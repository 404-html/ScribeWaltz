Barr's vagina. Oh God. I bet she would do it. Roseanne would probably do it. Bet Rosie O'donnell might do it too, but there's a lot of lesbians. It would do it just to throw someone's out there using their vagina properly with Rosie's, you'd have to take two flashlights and just rub them together.

Speaker 2:          00:02:34       Humana, when Eddie, you have to is also on a podcast called you guys call it talking shit. Just talking shit with Jim Jefferies and Jim Jefferies and Eddie eft. And recently you guys get fucked because I guess you swore in your itunes. Yeah, just start title. Like we ask for the episode. We had one title once that was called at. I guess I'm going to have to eat this dude's can't. Was one of them. A

Speaker 4:          00:02:59       guy named Brian Mccarthy told us a story about how he fucked a postop transsexual. And uh, he was telling the story about how she told them she used to be a dude before he fucked her before he fucked her, but he said he was already like so into it that he was like, all right, and then they're having a threesome with her and the dude's getting a blow job and he's like, I'm looking at the back and he goes and I realize, I guess I'm going to have to eat this dude's content. And so we titled it that. And so he did. Yeah, he did. He tells his thoughts. Episode three, we still think it's our funniest. What is this guy's name again? Brian McCarthy. He actually lives right out here. He's Caroline McCarthy. Is he a comic and sort of. He hosts all these things. He's got a show on a national lampoon radio.

Speaker 4:          00:03:44       He's the funniest. If he came in a room with a bunch of comics, every comic would go. That's the funniest guy in the. Really fucking wait a minute. Where he would have joey is in that room. I'm telling you, you can't tell me there's a guy alive. It's funny than God is like a challenge. So Joey nonsense as would, uh, would find this guy really. Is he doing? He's fucking weird. There's no way to explain them. Me, I believe you, but I don't believe he's funnier than Joey Diaz. I don't think that's possible. He's like this fat guy that he's got a wife and kids normal life, but he drilling worn on the side and he wears pink polo shirts and like white box and any, you know, he's got like the secret life that he leads and maybe you shouldn't be talking about it on the podcast, he told her story about smuggling weed from Jamaica in boom boxes and getting arrested and having to go to jail for two and a half months in Jamaica.

Speaker 4:          00:04:32       You know, when he got to America and he went to jail. He stayed in jail for two and a half months rather than tell. Call his parents to get them bailed out because he didn't want his mom to know. So it was just going to sit it out and let his mom think he was in Jamaica. Oh my gosh. Just a fucked up. How old was he when this happened? Like 20 years old and Oh my God, I just rather take two and a half months in prison. Jesus Christ. So he's just wired crazy yet and yeah, that's a dude that will fucking keep a secret though. That's a guy that I'd want working for me. Yeah. Two and a half months. Two and a half months in jail instead of telling his mom, that's a fucking soldier right there. Yeah. We got to soldier Ryan Mccarthy in episode three of your podcasts and I need to hear this now and then we have on our show on our, on our.

Speaker 4:          00:05:15       Yeah, it's the. It's one of the funniest stories you'll ever hear in your real. I swear to God he's talking about fucking pussy and he's like, oh, it felt like frozen gummy bears. That's the only thing I can describe because I think I can get rid of all the dick meat. They just like, so I'm fucking. And he goes, no. If I tell you this pussy just looked like a sloppy mess. You should have seen the asshole, but I couldn't get any friction in the pussy because I guess the doctor didn't do a good job, so I'm pinching the pussy down and I'm fucking fuck this guy and his asshole. He did everything. Oh my God, Jesus Christ and he's not even gay. Not at all. What the fuck is that about? Told a story about how he led a guy below him one time because he was out with this and he's.

Speaker 4:          00:05:57       He's not a good looking dude. He was out with this like supermodel chick, like really hot, like famous playboy model and they were out and they were all doing coke and partying and she goes, I'll let you do anything you want to me if you let this guy suck your Dick. And he went, well, he goes, what do I have to lose? He goes, if I, if I like it, then I'm gay because that solves a lot of problems for me in life. He's like, so I, I let the guy do it, and apparently the guy that did it's this famous writer for Vanity Fair and he let the guy suck his dick and he said, as soon as he goes, as soon as I felt the growth, the stubble of his beard hit the base of my cock. He goes, I've never gone so limp in my life.

Speaker 4:          00:06:35       And he goes, I went, I'm not gay now. Did he fucked a chick afterwards? He did. Fuck the chick afterwards. Maybe it was two coked up the fucker that night. But he got to afterwards. But so the guy went, he went limp. Meaning that he was hard before the stubble hit him. He, yeah, he, well, he was, she got them hard or something. It was a crazy fucking story. This dude knows how to party. You know? He doesn't know. I do not want to know how to put it as an idiot. She sucked. Had a guy suck his dick. That's not a guy who knows how to party now. Silly. He's A. I would rather not. Fuck that girl has a lot of outrageous demands. You know, he's friends with, he's friends with the dude who's a pretty amazing dude to me, to that own consumption junction.

Speaker 4:          00:07:16       Do you remember that? Yeah. Well I went to Arizona to do crazy stuff, right? And assumption junctions all around. I don't know if it is, but the dude sold the website and made millions of dollars but powerful. I went, he's his best friend and I went to Arizona to Scottsdale or whatever tempe to do, shows that. Right. And he's like, let me call my friend. He'll show up at your show. So the dude shows up and sits down and starts telling me stories. He's like, so I'm in Panama and uh, because you know, there was no extradition laws there and we're doing mountains at coke and we're fucking these girls and I'm pissing all over them and we're all in the shower and there's eight girls for me and eight girls from my friend. And like, these guys just live in a world that like they make movies about and shit and they tell me these stories and I'm like, are they just, are they lying to me?

Speaker 4:          00:07:59       That impress me because comic and then you see his website and you go, oh, okay. There's guys that are doing that. There's Joe Frances type characters that are like that guy. He's notorious. I think these guys are beyond that. This deal now owns a website called sugar sugar. It depends on how much money you have. It really does. If you're a sociopath and you got a billion dollars, you can do some damage. You can just go out there and, and ball all the time. I know some people that are, uh, that are big finance people that I'm back in the early days of the UFC and these guys are tons and tons of money and Scott was ugly as fuck. This guy used to travel all over the country, just banging chicks and he was always telling me stories about being in a Baeza and being in Russia and being here and he's just a fucking 20th century baller. Sky was just roaming the country. Roman the world rather just everywhere party. And it, especially if you go to other countries in other countries, people just fuck. I toured. America is a different rap and you know that because you, you go to Australia like six months a year. I toured

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       for about six years extensively around the world, like doing China and Dubai and all these South Africa and I saw some shady shady shit, like you just start finding out like a prostitutes or $50 around the world. And I was at a party one night in Dubai where everyone was so fucked up. They went all, let's get hookers. And when we found out they were $50, we're like, well let's get 10 each. And uh, and it was like we didn't even want to have sex with them. It was like, just to like, you know, like it, it started with, well I don't know, $50. I just want them to come over and listen to my jokes, like creating your own audience. And then everybody gets 10. We've got 30 people. That's a decent night in the are. Imagine having the audience you could fuck afterwards. That's awesome.

Speaker 5:          00:09:39       Well, that's, that's what happened. I'm not going to mention the names because some of them are, you know, comics that work here, but there was a whole bunch of comics and everybody started upping the ante. They're like, I want to just have them come over and fucking poor maple syrup all over them and we're going to swim around the fucking bathroom floor. I want to put pringles on this is in Dubai. And Dubai's, you guys worried about being arrested because they have some really crazy laws from the minute we got there until the minute we left on this trip, we were so fucked up that it never occurred to me. And then my next trip over I, I got fucked up in customs and thought I was never coming back. What happen? I, uh, I had, didn't have the proper visa and I tried to leave. Uh, I missed my flight because I was all fucked up.

Speaker 5:          00:10:20       Oh, this was the same trip on the way back. Uh, I tried to leave like the other two comics got on, got on the plane. I missed the plane out of just being so fucked up. I was in an Internet cafe, I missed the plane and then I'm like, fuck, the next flight's not for 24 hours to London, so I try to leave the airport to go to a hotel and my, my visa was only good for like three or four days or whatever. So they checked my visa, they checked my, my passport and they didn't match because my agent fucked up. Oh my agent put my, put my middle name or something on it somehow. And you easily could be a spy to look at you and spy looked to him. God just took my passport, walked away and I never saw my passport again till 24 hours later.

Speaker 5:          00:11:06       So I'm without a passport. The next thing I know I'm in an office next. I know fucking strip search I've done. They've gone through everything in my bag. They've gone through my computer. When they opened up my computer on my heart started beating so fast that I'm like, because pornography is illegal in the Middle East and they tell you don't buy. The guys are going to try to sell it to you in the streets. Don't buy it, they can be spa. So they looked on an every folder and your laptop, they opened my laptop and when they opened it I was just like, this is it. I'm going to be in fucking prison and be a Middle Eastern prison for the rest of my life because I downloaded like topless carwash angels, you know, like that's like, this is fucked. And uh, I had called my girlfriend at the time because they kept making me go like before they, like Kinda held me in this office.

Speaker 5:          00:11:50       They were like, go to this office and I'd go to this office, they'd be like, go to this office. And I kept walking down hallways and they're like, go down this hallway and they make me walk down this hallway and there's a big sign that says like nobody is allowed past this point. No one at all. Like whatever in English it said it. And I'm like, they told me go down that hall and I'm like, I'm not going down that hall. Like they're setting me up or something. Right. So I call her on the phone, I've got my cell phone. Oh, that's crazy. And I go, listen, I'm in, I'm fucked. I don't know what's going on, but if you don't hear from me in two hours, call the US embassy and tell them I'm in trouble. I said something's fucked up here. And Dubai's supposed to be like the most progressive place in the world. What? But I know it's not in the world, but I mean in the middle of the Middle East countries, just because they want the money. Exactly. Want tourism and need to be the biggest of the desert. Yeah. They look the other way. You see shit like Russian hookers barbecuing sausages on the beach like topless. And you're like, wait a minute, there's Muslim. Come. Yeah, tried it.

Speaker 2:          00:12:50       People been arrested. They were making out there. So it is just subjective. They decide when to enforce with sex and the city, wasn't it? No, no it was real. Real couple real. A couple of weeks.

Speaker 5:          00:12:58       Weird fucking shit. Like we had, we had drinks, beers on our van and uh, I was over there another time shooting a documentary and we had beers on the van after we shot one night and we had a, uh, a female like that worked for the, for the Emirates with us. And the next day we find out like we're in big trouble. We drank around a female. Uh, we were swearing, uh, there was all kinds of shit in there. Like they're like, you broke every, like sharia law possible, don't you fuck those evidence of this? Well, it was kind of like I was over there with like a guy who's really his, his father is like the attorney for the Emirates. And so it was Kinda like, you guys are okay but don't fuck up again like you. So do you have a mark against you now?

Speaker 5:          00:13:43       So if you go to Dubai now not, I'm not, I'm never going again. We filmed one thing where I put on a dish dash, which is the Islamic will, not Islamic, but just the garb that they were in Dubai and you know, it's the white gown and the hat and they gave me one of those when I did the UFC and I with abby. Yeah. And a buddy of mine just wore them around town. We thought it was kind of funny and we're just. And we kept asking. People were like, well, we're okay, right? We're not breaking any law. And they're like, no, no, it's not religious. It's just the clothing that people wear. And then the girl that worked for the Emirates left the Emirates and sent me an email telling me that there were spies watching us the whole time. I was like, fuck this shit. I don't need to go back there. Yeah. Who was, who's

Speaker 2:          00:14:24       there was telling us. Pete Johansen was telling us that he did gigs in Dubai and there was members of the secret police would sit in the audience and watch. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it will be in the front row and they'd be totally obvious, I think is actually, I don't remember if he said the front row, he might've said that back row, whatever he said. They were super obvious and they were standing there with their arms crossed just staring at him the whole time. So He's trying not to cross any lines. Try not to say anything. The lines. You can't cuss. No, no. You can say they don't want you making fun of Islam. They don't remember when we had. What's his face, how sparks. And he was talking about almost getting arrested who's doing gigs with Jon Lovitz and he made the mistake of calling the speaking of the.

Speaker 2:          00:15:06       One of the sultans or one of the shakes and he called them. What do you call Ms Dot Moore? Ms Dot Moore. Ms Dot Moore. I think he said that. I called them the French name for Mr. and apparently one guy got incredibly offended and called the religious police and people showed up and they were going to fuck him and put them in jail for this. I seriously think I could make a movie about my weekend. The one weekend I went there, the risk area when there's other parts of the country where you travel like that where the dues, we get used to behaving and thinking you have a certain amount of freedom. You know what you do here. This is an entirely free country. You know, we'd still illegal. You can't say I want to kill the president or if you do, they'll lock you up. You know, obviously it was in character when I said that the president of the Kentucky Fried Chicken, you know, you can't do certain things.

Speaker 2:          00:15:49       You can say it's not completely and totally free, but for the most part it's pretty easy to get along here. But if you go to other parts of the world, they're incredibly suppressive. Incredible. Especially the Middle East. Terrifying. You know? That's one of the things like when people like, you know, I am most certainly not for war and not into this war, which I think is a fucking shady war and shady as fuck her. We got into it. But you have to be very careful about the rise of Islamic power all around the world. The rise of [inaudible] was sharia, sharia law. We have to be careful of any kind of religious zealots, whether Christian zealots are Muslims, Muslims, ups or anytime. People that think they can lock you up and they have the right to because you were having fun, you know, you were out dancing when you were out drinking.

Speaker 2:          00:16:32       I have to say that's some scary shit. I've always been, not anti American, but I always rebel against the government on all things when I get over there and this should happen. That's when you start to really appreciate your country that you go, you know, I could call the embassy and they would take care like they fight for you at the shore. That's what they're supposed to do. And they're United States citizens, you know, I mean, we pay taxes. That's what it's all about. You know, that's the benefits of being a part of the team, but it's just fucked up that we have to think about that anywhere. You know? I mean, yeah, it's not perfect. It's fuck corruptive shit, you know, super corrupt. The fucking, the business of government is gigantic. You know, there's a billion different jobs out there that are literally don't need to exist.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       They exist to keep jobs going to keep the business of government going and it creates quagmires and fucking complex little social situations. That's very. That's why I always say to people, I think it's funny when people criticize the president. I'm like, I'm not an Obama Fan, but I'm not against them. I don't believe in the whole political system, but I love people that criticize, but he's the one who's in charge now. He fucked everything up. He's so silly. He's like ww raw, that whole political system and Vince Mcmahon's, the corporations running it all and. But, but people that criticize like a guy like, you know, a Baldwin is healthcare Douglas. I'm like, dude, you can't even fucking return your videos to blockbuster on time. How

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       it's a general lack of understanding of what the system, which I think most people have. And even me, I, I'll, I'll get into it, we'll focus on for like a couple of months and then I'll go, what am I doing? What am I paying attention to on paying attention to this stupid hustle, this fake thing that barely know what goes on in Washington, barely affects your day to day life. What goes on in your neighborhood, what goes on with your friends? It goes on in your world, the people that you interact with, that's it affects your life. If you get really too hung up and dealing with like Washington and politics and Democrats and Republicans and and thinking. You understand that system. That's what's ridiculous. Used to work for a senator and yeah, it was my first job where I worked for Ireland. Specter, get the fuck out of here to God that evil cunt.

Speaker 4:          00:18:29       You know, that guy was on the warrant commission. I can tell you, I just, I started interning for him in college and it was like I thought I wanted to go into politics or something and then I realized like I'm the. I thought that I had the shady side that was good for politics, but I was like, there's no fun involved. It's just a fucking torture is horrible, and they are that like everyone says it's poor man's Hollywood specter had like hair plugs, facelift, fucking horse. You have to appear virile too. And it was just like. And he was the ugliest dude in the world and he was over evil. Fuck man. But when he would explain his, his single bullet theory, if he would sit and explain it to you after he does it, you would believe him? No, I wouldn't. You know, I wouldn't because I've seen the bullet.

Speaker 4:          00:19:12       The dumbest thing about the single bullet is the bullet itself, but there's almost no damage went through to people. Shattered bone and it's barely dentist, but I'm telling you in his presence, he has this way of Cain. Correct. Incorrect. I would not be amused or affected by that dummy, but it's no way that guy's an evil. Fuck. There's no way I would listen to him and being charming or is he not in the least. It was one of those things where I was like, how the fuck did this guy get into politics? He was on her and all you have to do is be in dude, once you're in, it's like being a writer on a Sitcom. You know when you work on a Sitcom, one of the things you find out about working on sitcoms is there's usually a few brilliant writers and these fucking fakes.

Speaker 4:          00:19:49       These people that aren't really funny at all, like they would never stand up comedian someone somehow or another got them a job as a comedy writer and now here they are on sitcoms and I would you deal with them over and over and over again and you realize all you have to do is just get into the system. Once you get into the system, then you get other jobs. I gave that speech once. I got a deal a long time ago with a for to do a sitcom and it was going to be about my life and I used to live with my sister in New York for awhile and they thought that was funny. You know, to the point of view will make a show about it. And um, so I met with writers or first I met with the all the development guys and they were like showing me the writers.

Speaker 4:          00:20:23       They were gonna give me and they gave me the script of these guys and I went, this is shit, this is shit. And my manager at the time was like, shut the fuck up, take the money. Who's your man? Got Up the time it was kary Hoffman Carry Hoffman had in New York. He owned standup New York. Oh my God. Stand up. New York didn't carry, like he would get, like people would get sitcoms and he would want a piece of the Sitcom because they used to work out in this club. Do that. Yeah. And that's hilarious. He listened to the

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       stouffer's or listen to that guy was a manager of a fucking calm or owned a comedy club. Comics would go up and then performance club and they've got to develop. One guy got a development deal and he wanted like a certain percentage of this Guy Sitcom because he used to practice at his club. Oh, that's fucking stupid. So amazing. Of course not. Of course. Try really hard. Amazing that he would even chase after that. So I'm sorry. So this guy tells you to shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up and take the money and I'm sitting in the meeting. No offense. I said, I understand, you know that you think these guys are good writers and everything. I said, but I know this whole system, what goes on, guys get in and they'd get their buddy in and he can't write and. But then they've been there for 10 years and you don't realize they never wrote anything good.

Speaker 2:          00:21:29       They were just there and now they get to be a show runner. I said, I've got millions of friends that write funnier than this, can I? Can I just go out and get one of them? And we're. Jim and I are in that situation right now where they're trying to do a show with us right now and it's like we feel like we, we, we could write the show. There was a time when, uh, I had a development deal where there's two guys that were, uh, uh, writing for friends. They were the creators of friends and one of them branched out on his own and uh, I got this development deal and it was for Fox and was, it was a good amount of money. And so they really wanted this guy to do it because this guy has such as great background will. Often what happens is when there's a team of writers, you got one brilliant guy and the other guys, this fucking buddy that you bounce shit off of, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:22:11       And so the brilliant guys bouncing shit off the other guy and then they put it all together like maybe the other guy types and they become a team. So you didn't want. Somewhere along the line the other guy says, you know what? I think I'm unrecognized. My talent from a much broader. So this fucking idiot decides he's going to go out on his own. So he gets his giant development deal. It was for um, it was Michael Eisner's company and it was a fucking huge development deal. Millions and millions of dollars. Everybody was like banking on this guy. And so I go to meet with the guy. They wanted me to meet with them. I meet with them and he's wearing bowling shoes. And whenever I see a guy who was trying to be wacky, you know, you're wearing bone bone shoes aren't comfortable. Those are uncomfortable as fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:22:50       Like why you wearing those and wearing those to let me know that you're nutty. You know, I might be a multimillionaire, but I were bowling shoes to the office. Did you just get done bowling? No. You're trying to send a message. The message is you're dressing like you think a funny person would dress. That tells me you're probably not fucking funny. So I immediately get terrified and I'm like, Oh, this guy is a fucking faker. He snuck through and there's no way. There's no way. How can you get this fucking gigantic multi-multi million dollar dear if you snuck through? So I meet with the guy, um, we talk, he has an idea. He wants me to be a part of it. And Bubba Bubba, we meet and then they give me one of the scripts. The script that I read is fucking terrible. I mean, it was just God awful. There's nothing funny in there at all. And I'm like, well, maybe this is just, you know, just a shit script. Maybe he's got some other ones, maybe there's a Spec, maybe they had him write this, you know, and it wasn't a subject that he was interested in. So this guy comes up with the, uh, this is this idea for a sitcom. Sitcom is about an immortal. It's about a man who's immortal. Okay. And uh, he, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       existence like Egyptian days and all he does is like get laid. It's fucking devoid of comedy. Who wants to watch a sitcom about an immortal, a guy who was in mortal has been a more general sense the Egyptian days. And all he does is try to get. I don't understand all these hooks and these sitcoms when you look at like the best sitcoms that have ever existed, that the jobs or whatever they do it. It's, it's so like superifilous. It's all you need is a group of people that hang out together and have relationships with each other and the interesting relationships. If you look at like taxi and cheers and you could move them to any other setting and they would be funny. You put them in an office if you didn't matter what this guy did. Oh, this guy was not funny. It doesn't matter if he wrote about three people hanging out at a laundromat or three people who work on the moon just in that.

Speaker 4:          00:24:36       He's a fucking idiot. He just snuck in. That show never made it out though, right? Oh, of course it didn't. And I, I had to tell them we had a meeting and it was a real controversial meaning. It was like they were upset at me because I was like, this guy sucks, and they're like, this guy does not suck. This guy is Bubba Bubba. He's this, he's that. He's done all these things and I'm like, he's not funny. I'm telling you, this guy is not funny. This is a mistake. They'll like you don't understand. There's more to writing and just being funny. There's character development and story arts and he's a guy who really understands that and we can bring in more funny later, but what he's really concerned with is what we're concerned. We want a really good story. The story was deaf. It was terrible.

Speaker 4:          00:25:10       It was stupid. It didn't make any sense. It was just like a guy who's pretending to be a comedy writer who got a job writing comedy. I like if you took some fucking guy, worked for a fence company and I was. I'm tired of renting Francis other organ. I think I'm a good writer. I've done it. I've been doing standup for 15 years and I. It only, it took me 15, 14 and about 14 and a half years to finally realize that 95 percent of the people in the business don't know anything about comedy. Like, well, you can't really truly understand unless you're doing it. I mean, I and I've lately been putting them to the test where I'll say, well, explain to me why and when you put them, like when you put them on the hotspot anymore or like I'll say something like, why is that comic doing that?

Speaker 4:          00:25:52       Or why should he, why do you think he's good at what he does? Or why isn't he, you asking agents, managers with development people, talent scouts. I always do it and I put them to it and they'll go, well, you know, he does this really interesting thing where he's kind of like, not really observational, but he's kind of political buddies. He's more on a surreal. I'm like, you have no fucking idea. You have no idea. You all are sheep and you just file. It's not that I don't think they, I think agents and managers are really important, but I think they really can't truly understand what common is all about unless they do it. You know, unless you do it, you really never going to be an expert on it. You might know a lot about it, but you're never going to really truly understand it unless you can recreate it. I have an agent out of Australia, I think you might have. I think he might've worked with you when you were down there already, Lang. Yeah. Yeah. Same name as the Howard's Guy, but st

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       already is fucking like the greatest agent that has been a great guy. He's fucking amazing and he knows comedy comedy a little bit and like you'll do a bit and he'll go, why don't you say this? And you're like, yeah, that, that would actually work better and I'll run my sets by him before I go on TV. And he's like, no, no. Take that out. Put that in any shit. We're not saying that he can have some understanding of comedy without doing it. You just can't really truly understand it. You know? You're never gonna understand it. The way it comic understands it. It's all theoretical until you put it in practice. It's like a guy who does caught it and the gym is pretty sure he could farewell in a street fight. Yeah. Yeah. No, but really he's not really sure it's theoretical. You know, a guy who was actually fought a bunch of times was like, yeah, I've been through this shit before.

Speaker 2:          00:27:22       I know what I'm going to do. You know, there's, there's a difference and, but there's nothing wrong with agents and managers that don't understand it totally because they do a great job. You know, I wouldn't do it and you wouldn't do it. We're not going to sell ourselves or we're not going to go out and get development deals. We can't do it anyway. You can't negotiate for yourself. It's impossible, especially that end be creative like it's important to have managers and agents, you know, but they don't have to know everything. They just have to shut the fuck up and push in the right direction. If you're talented, you know what the problem is when you're not that talented or when you're not doing that, well, you haven't become successful yet. Then they start tweaking you. Then they start, well, we've got to figure out what's going on here.

Speaker 2:          00:28:00       Well, you need as a new look. You know, the Jamie Masada told my friend Todd Parker that, uh, he had to be the generation x guy. That's what he was saying by the younger generation x guy. This is your new hook. You go on stage, everything come out of your mouth that gen x, I am generation x guy. Have you imdbs that guy now? Lately that got the friends writer it just to see what. I don't even remember his name. I don't remember his name, but I've met a couple of those guys. I, I wrote something with one of those guys, a guy who wrote on Seinfeld. It was fucking terrible. He couldn't write anything funny and wound up meeting me writing the funny stuff and him writing it down. It was a terrible relationship with Carrie Hoffman. Did that to uh, to me that once he tried to change me, it's like I could have no idea.

Speaker 2:          00:28:40       Oh, you never see comedy duos anymore. You and a girl and a girl and you'd do like stiller in Mira. Oh God. Oh my God. What an idiot. Yeah. But uh, what does that guy still in the business? I think actually he's doing really well because he's got Mike Royce and Tom hurt to a really good writers and I think, I think tom might be on. I always liked the guy I'm doing. This club is always nice to me. Tom, I heard that shit about him to 15 percent from. He was kind of like a father to me. He was that. He was really good and he actually did shit. That was amazing. Some of the shit he did was the best stuff a manager ever did for me. When I went to Montreal to do new faces, he sent a tape of me to every single person that wasn't going to Montreal and I bombed at Montreal, bombed and so I was fucked and then all the people that didn't go to Montreal saw a tape. That was great and we're like, he's all. What year was this? This is 2000 or so. People were stopping and going to Montreal. By then it was Montreal kind of died either on my. My Year of new

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       faces was listening to this. It was me. Tony Rock, I believe was in it. A Dean Edwards who got Saturday night live that year, Demitri Martin, Mike Birbiglia, a Russman, neve like everybody got something big out of it. And uh, and it was like the last year though. It was the last year because chicken was

Speaker 2:          00:30:01       the year before. Yeah, that was when I was going to bring up, when we're talking about this, I think we brought up chicken on the podcast before, didn't we? Well, chicken, God rest his soul is the most amazing phenomenon. And this is the proof that agents and managers have no fucking idea. They just don't get it. They don't know what's funny and what's not funny. This was, some of them don't. I should say this guy, um, he was this young kid who was just real boyishly handsome and he had this really wacky act like there was, there's a screw loose in them and he had this like really, like completely over the top act. It just would baffle comedian. So we'll go. This is not funny at all. I don't get it too. It was all like, give you one. I remember

Speaker 5:          00:30:38       I auditioned for snl with them. He, uh, he went on stage and said so and so when they hit a home run, do you ever see him? They just jog around the bases. He's like, they just casually jog around. If they hit a home run, he's like, that was me. If I hit a home run, it'd be like what the fuck? And he'd like do like flips on stage and run around the audience and like throw his arms in the air and be like, I'd be flicking shit in the air out of my life. Would almost like if you just see a crazy man jumping up and down in a nightclub, a dude's pretty crazy. That's what he was.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       Awesome. Yeah, he wasn't, it wasn't that talented. We tried really hard anyway. He wound up getting this giant development deal and just being a complete total bust like they couldn't do anything with was just not talented. It was just awful. And so um, he went into this sort of dark depression and then comics hated them. Like he was a punchline for Comedians, a bunch of them who just shit all over him, you know, I mean, come, you know, comics are, if one guy's doing better than you and you think he's not as good as you, it's just fucking phantom is the. So this kid one up killing himself in front of a school. We hung himself on a tree in front of us.

Speaker 5:          00:31:46       Cool. I know that. I'm pretty sure that part of it. I know I heard the story when he was at Montreal though, like there was so much hype on them going into Montreal that uh, like that they were bidding on him before he even went on stage. And I think he did as he was going on stage, someone said to his manager, like, one of the networks goes like, we'll give you a million dollars if he doesn't step on that stage because they knew his price would even go up once he went on stage and a million dollars. His development deal was a half a million. Oh, that was pretty sure that's what he got. So they said, we'll give you half a million for lease. That's what the rumor was. Go on stage because they didn't want the bidding to even go up further. So I don't say

Speaker 2:          00:32:27       lot of hype. Yeah. I don't think that really happened. That doesn't really. Nobody does that. But there was a lot of people that were into this kid and comics. We'd be standing in the back of the room watching this kid who flail around on stage and you know, like literally flail,

Speaker 4:          00:32:41       you know, and like he was on fire and go, what the fuck is going on? Let's look at clips of him online. You think that's a good question? Michael Ruth was his name. I think I've met him the night we did snl. We're, we were auditioning at Carolina and we're all in the green room and he comes into the green room and all the comics kind of know each other and then he shows up in the green room and he's got this energy, you know those energy vampires that just suck all the energy away from everyone else. He started bouncing around the room going fucking crazy. I don't know what I'm fucking doing here. This is like snls here and I'm fucking like, I'm not even a comedian. I don't know what, like this is crazy. You guys like do your shit and I just get up on stage and I'm like wacky and fucking crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:33:22       And, and everyone was just kind of, you know, comics were all looking at each other like did you. It was almost like he was psyching us out too because we're all trying to, you know, this is a big deal for us. We're all trying to get on and uh, he's bringing you into his head. Yeah. And I thought that's what he was doing and I'm like, you're fucking with me right now and I'm about to punch you in the face like that. So you thought he was doing it on purpose? Yeah. And I'm, I'm like, I'm not going to put someone really do that. I think there are guys that are, they kind of do that railing. Yeah. How would that work though? That's a weird strategy to go out and do anything. I've found some videos if you want to listen to one. Yeah, no one. I don't like comics that go. Yeah, that's him, man. You go to the room. Does it say anything about him? How He's dead. He didn't say how he killed himself. No,

Speaker 6:          00:34:04       you guys got a lot of white suburban gangster kids here. I ain't got a voice. You guys got little white suburb against your kids here. Not a gangster kids. Seventeen year old Caucasian boys that looked like me. Fuck you there. A black girl walking around the mall here. They got the pants hanging off their ass. Got The adults were going. Oh Shit.

Speaker 7:          00:34:34       He pulled his pants down. It looked like a thong he had on

Speaker 6:          00:34:44       dangerous, but she 45 pounds of gold. Gold chain. Three gold to go in the whole fucking time. His name's Bradley. Cue The plane that rap music loud as shit. Driving his mom minivan. No thank you. To want them to dance clubs. Doing all those boody dances. You know. Fuck you, dude. You can't do it.

Speaker 7:          00:35:31       He pulled his pants down again.

Speaker 2:          00:35:39       His name is Michael Roof. R O f. So anyway, that's enough of that. Anyway, that's not terrible. I mean that's. Yeah, I mean it's not the worst comment I've ever heard.

Speaker 8:          00:35:51       Funny, when he was going down his pants the first time he had taken his underwear and I gave himself a Wedgie so it looked like he had a thong on. It was like a little touch, a little extra touch. It was nice

Speaker 2:          00:36:01       jazzed up the bit. I like the Tagline, the new crack tagline you added, you know, whatever man. Nothing wrong with that. I mean, I mean it's not my style so I'm not into, was in closing down really well. He, um, you know, he, he had that big development deal and then nothing happened for it. And then, um, I remember like, um, so many people are so fucking happy when nothing happened to it, you know, and that's when it got really ugly for him. Like comics were happy that he was failing, you know, and then we'll just, there was like a lot of negative energy towards it, but they used him as an example. They said like, he killed the development. Yes he did. He did kill it. They gave him a ton of money and that was it really killed. It was their lack of real talent and ability to recognize talent, you know, these, these comics or these agents and managers, they're really just taking guesses and that's what killed that were killed.

Speaker 2:          00:36:51       It was all these big people that spend a lot of money and the people that were the head of studios that people that, you know, they had a budget and then they're like, why did we spend half a million dollars on this fucking thing? Like, what is this? There's a lot of that going on, man. You know, like this the friends guy, if they sat that guy down. So just write us a couple of scripture real quick. Now let's look at your scripts. Let's look at your scripts. They read their scripts and then didn't read anything from this guy before he got this deal. I know they didn't. I know the whole story behind it. Everybody was so high on them. They just want to. We're willing to throw this guy money. I've looked at a bunch of scripts lately and I'm like, death, death, right? I can't do it.

Speaker 2:          00:37:24       I've, I've, I've read a couple of them and I saw and I looked down to that and I go, no, I'm not even going in. I can't go in. I can't do this, you know? Yeah. It would be nice to do a sitcom again. I love doing news radio. It was a lot of fun. But good luck trying to find another one of those. By the way, Dave [inaudible] was going to do the podcast. Don't touch with Dave Pollino very excited. Um, but you know, it's like getting a hold of one of those sitcoms as like a fucking one of the million and it's. So if you don't do that, what are you dealing with? Well, you're dealing with a bunch of producers that don't really know how to do comedy. You're dealing with a bunch of writers. Most of them are not going to be talented because if they were talented they'd be working for modern family or some of those big shows and there's not that many really good ones that are out there free, you know? So it's like your odds of finding a good one or like one in 10, you know, maybe maybe one in 20.

Speaker 8:          00:38:07       Yeah. I uh, Paul prevents and I started writing a movie together on this idea that I had and I met Paul and Edinburgh. I was doing the Edinburgh festival and I kind of did the thing is a bit. And he's like, what? I said, Oh yeah, I've tried to write a movie about that. And he's like, Hey, you should write that fucking

Speaker 2:          00:38:23       movie. This is the bit that you said is the same as my bed. The one that I talked about on the show, very similar as A. I had a bit that I used to do. I did it back in the nineties. I just talked about it on the show the other day because we were, we were both on the green room show together and there was um, we were talking about like being booed off stage and like when people want you to change the subject, you're talking about like how people get upset at you. And I said that I used to do this joke about cloning Jesus because there was a thing called a second coming project. And the second project was. That's funny that that's what we named the script was the second coming because it's all about the guy jerking off is the opening scene.

Speaker 2:          00:38:58       Really? Yeah. Okay. Um, there was a real thing. It was in the news about this many, many years ago. Anyway, the idea was they were going to take dna from the shroud of Turin and they were going to recreate Jesus. They were going to clone Jesus. But I, one of my job was like, and this is a real thing, like they really think, I'm not sure it might've been a parody, you know, there's a lot of those. The sneak through. By the way, Rachel maddow got busted on a parody the other day. She was a reading a parody. This Christian, it's a fake website. And she was reading it as if it was news that Palin's supporters really believe that, you know, we have to inject Christianity into North Africa. And it's really funny. And some of my bid was, you know, like Dolly the sheep, you know, when they cloned Dolly the sheep, that Shit didn't come out perfect.

Speaker 2:          00:39:41       Like cloning is not an exact science. Like what if they, what do they do with the first Jesus if the clone, when it comes out retarded, do you kill them and start from scratch or do you just, you know. And so this whole bit about it. And when I did it at the comedy store, someone was yelling out fat white woman with blonde hair and fat blond fingers, just that, you know, I'm a Christian next subject. Like she was so firm and her wonky beliefs that she wanted a styling. Just theoretical idea. I mean it's not a real Jesus we're talking about this is a. and it's a real legit question. If they really do clone Jesus, that's a God legit question. Like what if they found Jesus's bones and there was some DNA inside of it and they could extract it. They knew for sure it was de Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:40:27       They knew it was his DNA. Well, that's a real legit question. What if he does come back retarded because he could come back all fucked up. There could be all sorts of. He could be autistic and psychopath could be black as fuck with you. What if he was my, I think it was black. Yeah. Because you can't start off white and then go put there. Well, there's a lot of evidence that Jesus wasn't even real. It was a lot of evidence that there was no Jesus started mythologized and that this same mythology repeats itself over and over and over again. So Jesus, even as a historical figures in question, you know, there's like, there's like, you know, volumes of, of pages written about certain Caesar's and certain, you know, rulers of, uh, of, of Greece and Rome. And so the, the stuff that's on Jesus's, so it's really hard to tell whether it's real well and also all those biblical fucking, you know, like everything from all the matthew, mark, Luke and John. There was like, there was the bulk of q two, you know, but that there's a, there was a fifth book of the Gospels. Apparently that was luke based. His book on, I'm not completely accurate and all this stuff, but if you start reading about it, you'll find out that like all four of them didn't live at the same time, so some of them base their account

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       on the other ones because they'll say it's like identical of the other one. So it's like they just heard a story. Yeah, and just rewrote it, which could have happened from the beginning and then there was also like the council of nicea where these guys went in and decided the bishops all went, okay, well we've got all these books. We're going to throw out these ones. We don't like these. We're going to keep the. They just rewrote history the way they wanted it. So I mean it's like shit like that on there for you. If you find out about the New Testament, that's where things get really weird because constantine and a bunch of bishops create that New Testament. That's the know what you're talking about. Something that was way after Jesus's death. You know, if Jesus was a real figure, the whole thing is fucking squirrely.

Speaker 5:          00:42:11       You know, the historical account just mean not even saying the religious accompany historical accounts various quarterly. I don't know about it. Like Dolly being retarded. I've often wondered like, you know, when like a dog bite someone, everybody's like, oh, he's a bad dog or whatever. I'm like, you see people all the time, like people with down syndrome. Are there like down syndrome dogs? Yes. I'm going through minds where your fucking dogs retire. Yeah. It's totally retarded dogs. Just really, really overbred you know, you have uh, uh, one of those little dogs. What's it called again? A Pekinese. Yeah, those dogs, man. Guess what? That came from a wolf. Yeah. There's no way you get a good example if that is what you get from a wolf. I think my dog might be part wolf. Really? Yeah. It's, she's, she's a, she's an ozzy cattle dog and cheese.

Speaker 5:          00:43:02       I grew up with Jack Russell terriers. You ever see those little short locking the assholes? And they, uh, the really aggressive because they used to kill rats. Fucking solo aggressed send them after we lived out in the woods and these things would do one of them. One of them went down a A. I couldn't find him. One night I find them down a sewer under the road and there's A. I'm looking down the sewer grate. I see them and there's a pipe way down underneath it runs out to a creek and I'm like, fuck. He ran up the pipe and he's under the sewer. There's no way for me to get him. I looked down, he's got a raccoon cornered. Oh my God. And I'm like, fuck, he's dead. He's dead, this raccoon and she's going to an all and I'm just going, come on, like try to coach them out the.

Speaker 5:          00:43:37       And I'm screaming, screaming, and all of a sudden I hear and it goes and I'm like, fuck, my dog's dead. My Dog's dead. And I'm shining a flashlight and I don't see anything. Next thing I know my Jack Russell drags the raccoon out of the pipe on Jack Russell killed a raccoon cut to about a year ago. I, my dog's leash lists all the time. People you can call me an asshole, but I don't believe in putting a dog on a leash. And my dogs well behaved and she's amazing. I saw the dogs won't be hey, as long as you really know the dog as well behaved. Just when people walk around with like pitbulls without just. Yeah, my dogs. Amazing. And so the way I used to do that, like a retard when I, when I, when I get close to home, I'll go, go, go home and she'll run like 200 meters up the road. So I one I'd see this cat and she chased, she never would hurt a cat but you'll play with them. So I go, go, go. There's a cat. You told him to chase the kid and she just plays with the cat. And uh, so she goes running up the road

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       and all of a sudden I hear her go ma and I'm like, oh fuck, she's, you know, she's now fighting with a cat and she's never fought before. And I come around the corner. It's not a cat, it's a fucking raccoon. And I'm like, fuck. And the cat takes or the raccoon takes off. So you totally chase after a raccoon thinking it was a cat. And how did you mistake the, it was so far away. It was like 200 yards away. So I wake up the next day and they see my dog sitting there and the eyes are crusted shut. And I'm like, what the fuck? So I take her to the vets and uh, the record scratch both their corneas. Yeah. Oh God. And he said, the vet said these things will rip your dog apart. They, they will fucking junkie texting and tweeting while he's trying to have some convoluted conversation.

Speaker 4:          00:45:24       They said they'll rip your dog apart. And I said, well, what about the rabies? And he said that rabies aren't bad in California, but uh, it's not bad. But the rackets fucking fucking scary man recommended. There was when I lived in new Rochelle, New York, I had a big one in my neighborhood. He used to fuck up trash cans. He was gigantic. I mean, it was like a dog. I couldn't believe how big he was. And I, I got a blow gun just so I can try to kill him. And I was terrified. I opened the door, it was a small, I had a small little yard and I would open the door and he would literally be fucking 10 feet from me. I panic and slam the door. I'm like, get out of here, bitch.

Speaker 9:          00:45:55       My, my old dog Cabo at one site level, Islam out the backyard and just to go to the bathroom and I'd let them out and instead of going around like, oh, what's going on? So I go outside and it's two skunks, like corner did my little backyard and the dogs about to attack them. And I'm just thinking I don't want to get sprayed and want the dog to get sprayed. Takes forever to clean. My dog got sprayed when I was a little kid. It's the worst. It takes forever.

Speaker 4:          00:46:21       You use tomato juice. Apparently there's an enzyme and tomatoes that helps break it down, but not much tomato and it doesn't work. You got to keep doing it over and over and over again. The stuck for weeks. Have you ever heard the Billy Burger bit about raccoons? Was the raccoon and the little hand stealing the cat. The youtube video. It's the hardest I've ever laughed at a joke in my life. I don't think I met a Mustang. I saw him at the Improv one night. It was recently, so it's probably like in his new set, but it's billy shelly, you know, angry billy gets. He's still angry watching this youtube video where a raccoon keeps stealing like cat food, like it comes over and keep stealing the food from the cat or from the dog or something and he keeps going. This little fucking raccoon hands and tears were coming out of my eyes.

Speaker 4:          00:47:03       I was laughing. I've never laughed that hard at a comic store. Check it out because he's so angry about the little hands and he's like, I'm the fucking little mask on this room. It's pretty crazy that all. And all dogs came from wolves. Yeah. You know when they figured out that genetic lineage of dogs, they expected to be a bunch of wild candidates in there. A bunch of different kinds of canines. Nope. Wolves. All. Originally it was a wolf or what about a Dingo? It's a different kind of dog and welcoming. It's a candidate. A wild. Okay. I know if there's specific ones, that Dingo doesn't come from a wolf, does it? I don't know. That's a good question. It's an Australian thing. Yeah. The dingoes eat babies Australia. My dog looks like a Dingo. Do Kangaroos kill people? There was a recycling of discussion one time I got out of a car and uh, I thought it was a fucking, like, we're driving through this neighborhood.

Speaker 4:          00:47:48       I don't know why we're in this neighborhood. Simple yes or no hair. I don't know, but I've heard stories that yes, because when we went to the zoo in Australia, they told us the big ones, the big. There's big Kangaroos. I forget which kinds of the big ones. What are the red ones? The gray ones. The big ones. Kill people. And they have a bunch of times. They said you have to be very careful if you approach them in the wild. This thing I read the other day, it said like a hundred people die a year from it. And then this other website, it's like a, there's been a few known attacks in the history of, you know, yeah. There was one woman recently, her dogs were killed. The most recent attack that I could find online. And this kangaroo drowned her dogs. That's pretty high.

Speaker 4:          00:48:26       Fuck gangster IRA's grout. Drown your dog. I saw the biggest fucking kangaroo and I thought it was a statue in these people's yard. And I was like, fuck, who has this giant kangaroo statue? I mean like 10 foot tall white. Looked like it was. No, once they get to be like seven feet tall, as tall as your ceiling and come off, I swear to God. And I got out of the car. So this is like a 10 foot ceiling. How many feet? Ten feet. I was, uh, two other comics and I see this thing over by these garbage cans. I'm like, Holy Shit. Look at this fucking thing. And I start walking towards it and this comic named Tommy Johnson goes, get out, fuck back in the car, make fucking get in the fucking car. And I'm like, what? And I'm walking towards it. And all of a sudden I see it move and now he's like, Hey, don't fucking dishes made it.

Speaker 4:          00:49:10       I'll fucking gun. Wow. That's what they claim. I think it's like an urban myth that they just fucking rip your stomach. Oh No, no. It's not an urban myth. People definitely have been attacked in that manner. They just got punched in the red. The red kangaroo is the big one. I'm just trying to find out how that would fucking freak me out if I saw a kangaroo that big. Yeah, no shit. I don't think they're that big though. I think you were afraid they were that big. I love to try to like ride around in your ceiling. I didn't think it was 10. I thought it was about seven. I'd say seven, seven feet tall. This fucking thing. Yeah, that's what they told us when we went to the zoo and in Australia it was fucking. Oh, okay. Here we go. They can go to eight feet tall and weighed 200 pounds.

Speaker 4:          00:49:51       Wow. Holy Shit. Why ever seen those videos? Week leaking feet. Fucking tall. Terrified. That's insane. I've seen herds of them down and Donna's is amazing. You ever seen those videos of the kangaroos fighting on like the golf courses in Australia? Yeah. That's where you see them on the golf course. It's not the red kangaroo with a gray kangaroos. A big one, right? Isn't that the Big One? I don't know if you ever see guys fight them. The eastern gray, the boxing love Jesus Christ did know the red kangaroo does grow to nine feet. Fucking tall. Holy Shit, dude. It doesn't weigh as much as the gray, but the red grows to nine fucking food. It the scariest thing because I got. I got, I got from here to the curtain. I was 10 feet away from it. Fuck that. And I was walking to it because I swear to God it looked like a statue and all of a sudden moved to town and I went, oh my God, that's fucking alive and Holy Shit.

Speaker 4:          00:50:42       That is so big yet. And this comic was just start yelling out the gas fuck in the car. Whoa man. Wow. Yeah. That's scary thing. And they apparently, while people are content to them, I'm sure that's probably why people hate them. They think they're rodents. Will they kind of are? Yeah. I mean they, they're kind of girls. I think they're kind of cooldowns girls must feel so fortunate that are not rats. All they needed was just a fluffy tail and groovy and no plague will just eat nuts. You don't have to eat garbage. Okay, cool. Cool. Have you seen the viral video yet? Or the rat that goes up the guy's face? What? Oh yes. On the subway. You get everybody to tell me about New York City. Rents are fucking terrifying. I remember when I lived in New York, I think I've told this story, but I'll tell it again for this.

Speaker 4:          00:51:24       I was at a gas station once and I went to use up sofa a payphone. This is how old this story is. You know, there was no, I didn't have a cell phone, so I stepped away from my car. Well, my car is pumping gas and I go to the payphone and I'm on the payphone and while I'm on the payphone I'm watching rats, big ones like cats jumped in the wheel housing of my car, climb on the tires, climbed down, and I am your car. Yes, I'm fucking 15 feet away. I stepped over to use the payphone and as I'm standing there on the phone, I've watched these rats and they keep going down this opening in the manhole. There must have been thousands of them down there the way they were coming up so quickly and in, in, in, in such rapid succession.

Speaker 4:          00:52:02       One after the other, one after the other, and then down one after the other one. I'm like, there's just a train of them down there. And I went and reported my car stolen. So scary dude. More rats than people in the air. Like for. I think it's for rats for every person. Oh my God. I was walking down macdougal street one time hump from the seller one night and I'm just walking through it and then you know, people with their garbage out in the street for the garbage men to pick them up. I'm going between garbage and a building and all of a sudden a rat just will runs out from the garbage and uses. My foot is like a hurdle. Little feet touched my foot and it was the most I've ever been like a woman in my life. I started like jumping up and down like screaming because it's like, it's like that fucking like adrenaline rush goes and you can't fight.

Speaker 4:          00:52:46       You're just like, ah, what the fuck. It was as big as you were. Such pussies were such pussies compared to animals were so soft and mushy and fleshy. I think it's the the filth though of the rats. That's just the film. They're furious. They're fucking army as much as the filth of those. They you feel like they carry hepatitis and aids and the black plague isn't that connected to rants is not all my rent's not a bunch of plagues had been about ransom. They're horrible carriers of diseases. Who is it? Jim Norton and uh, I think as Jim Norton and rich Vos used to go to this one park in New York and sit there and watch

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       the rats and they said you'd see like thousands of these racks. There's so many of them. Manhattan, Manhattan is so crazy with rats. I was at a pool hall, wants a New Jersey and this is the scariest read I ever saw was with my friend John. We went, we were doing a Gig and we stopped home from the Gig to play some pool. We stopped this pool, get out of the car and as I'm walking towards the door, there's a dumpster like outside. And as I passed by the dumpster, there's the biggest rat I've ever seen in my life. I mean it is like a raccoon. It was gigantic. No bullshit. I'm not bullshitting. It was two and a half, maybe three feet long in the body. It was enormous and it had these shoes, huge fucking nasty yellow teeth. And I don't know if it was sick or dying.

Speaker 2:          00:54:07       I mean, it might have been old age because it was so big, it might've been the end of the line for this fucking thing, but it was up on its back legs and was going like this to me and I was thinking, do I kick this thing? Do I get a rock? What the fuck? I was just such a little girly man. I'll never forget that noise. When you got to think with all the poison. They lay down, like you'll see the signs of the subway saying, you know, careful, there's like poison everywhere. Ran with. They've got to be adapting and mutating and we're making some fucking scary rat just chorus, right? Yeah. I mean that's what happens with bacteria, right? That's where we're at. Murcia know that staph infection that people get this antibiotic resistant. That's what it is from fucking. Is that like the superbug?

Speaker 2:          00:54:53       Yeah. Well the mercer has the super staff. It said Mike, I don't know what it actually stands for, but it's something resistant staff. So it's a antibiotic resistance. So when people get it, it's like really, really dangerous and it's really just created by human beings, by, you know, I was fighting off different versions until the only ones who survive are super fucking strong. It's why it just read the other day that 80 percent of all the antibiotics in America are given to animals like they pump them full of antibiotics and the same bacteria that we've used antibiotics to fight off. So do animals. So all the antibiotics they're taking is causing the bacteria to butyrate, which is making us immune to these antibiotics to live. Is that true? Because, um, I was on a, on a, I did a thing about, um, uh, talked about food inc and I got contacted and this is one of the coolest fucking things about this podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:55:46       I got contacted by a bunch of scientists fuck food scientists, you know, people who are, um, you know, involved in the farms and one guy who worked for a poultry company. And uh, he was, uh, talking to me about it. Let me find it here. That shows the difference between your listeners in ours. You have all these intelligent people that are really interested. We get guys who were like, you guys are fucked guns. Well I get those to watch corn too. By the way. Have you ever get the chance to watch the documentary that that's where they even go into more detail about having like having holes on the side of the cows. So creepy and Food Inc. There's a whole. Well, well iT's according to this guy. First of all when he wanted it and his name is Jacob Kim. So thank you jacob. At one of the things that he explained to me is that chickens are not on steroids and then what it is is just genetic selection and they've naturally selected birds with bigger and bigger breasts to the point where they're freaks.

Speaker 2:          00:56:39       So they wouldn't have survive if they were a real animal, but you know, because we grow them just for their tits. So. And he also said that What they're supposed to do is they're supposed to cycle the antibiotics. So when a bird is sick, so like they have a cycle, like there's 49 days, he says to grow a bird. So in business terms, the pharmacy's profits go down as the flock stays longer than that. So in the instance that a 30 day old flock get sick while they're supposed to wait 21 days before they killed them. So when they, when they get sick, they're going to lose like 10 or 11 days of profit. So if they do something like that and lose these days a prophet, you know, it's like a problem with them. So some unscrupulous companies don't follow that. And then they send out the bird, you know, like 15 days later in the birds still pumped up with antibiotics and has a process to your system. You're saying, I can't believe you know, I fucking data one thing that I didn't do right code for. shut it off your fucking cops. My new phone number. you fuckheads for giving out at all to one 800 faggots. Oops. I said that shit.

Speaker 8:          00:57:44       A retiree. Stay away From that word. Yeah, he retired it. It's been a, it's been feeding. It's been growing in him lately. I find it a funny word. Yeah, I, I don't. I mean, I'm never going to retire a word, kind of like. Yeah, I always said like when they tried to retire the n word, I go, what are they going to do? Put it on a banner and raise it into the rafters at like the apollo theater, right number that's retired United States, something that were, some gay guy gets mad at me and I'll just flirt with them alone. So he goes to site, don't be mad. I don't get right now where I say it, I go, uh, you know, like the, the reason that like gay men are more sexually promiscuous than men and women is the [inaudible] because they've got time and energy from not fighting all the time because a gay fight, you know, it's Just like, hey, those shoes don't match your belt. And he's liKe, really? Let's fuck, you know, like that's gay guys beat the shit out. And that's the other thing. Gay guys can beat the shit out of each other and the cops show up. Like what happened? He punched me, will hit them back. Faggot. That'S funny.

Speaker 2:          00:58:43       Um, so anyway, back to this guy. So the guy was explaining to me, so no steroids for chickens, that's not true. But there it is true for cows. So cows are jacked, cows are totally jacked up on hormones, no hormones at all or no hormones, no steroids on chickens because I, I eat, I eat all grass fed stuff. Yeah. I order all my meat from us. Wellness meats. Yeah. Uh, no, no. It's good. Grass fed beef tastes really good. Fucking had a strip last night. And pork chops, grass fed pork chops, you know, I agree. We need pop shields by the way because pork chops makes a big terrible noise in people's ears. I ordered those. I'm soon. But I uh, yeah. I eat

Speaker 8:          00:59:22       a paleo diet. Do you know that? Yeah. So I eat that diet and, and um, in all the grass fed shit and my chicken breasts that I get are grass fed and they're fucking massive. And I'm like, this is weird. I heard the whole thing was when you buy organic and grass, that you're Just not getting the fuck they're bigger chemicals on the grass. How is that possible? I don't know what's going on in that grass. Oh, hey. So what did you think about that movie

Speaker 2:          00:59:51       to avoid? I saw it last night. I shut it off after the car accident when the fucking the parents were killed in a car accident. I'm like, first of all, you've just, you showed me a girl who's a prostitute and a stripper. Okay. And then you showed her happy family. Fuck you. That's more science fiction in the dmt shit because that's just shitty writing to me. You're showing me this. This girl loves her brother. And how much do you love me? I love you so much. You're just jerking with my emotions, man. This isn't good story writing. This is nonsense. What I liked about the movie was the first person perspective. It was like I was in a video game that was cool.

Speaker 8:          01:00:21       King of the. I even remember like you could actually see it where the character blinks. They would have it like every, like randomly every five, 10 seconds. And then when he goes into the dmt trip, did you think that was a pretty realistic?

Speaker 2:          01:00:32       No, I thought it was interesting. Yeah. But it wasn't realistic. First of all, you couldn't explain what the dmt trip looks to a person. You couldn't recreate it with like cgi. Right. Because what it is isn't possible. What your will. You'll see. It doesn't make any sense what I'm saying. But when you have a dmt trip, you're not seeing anything that can be recreated. It's impossible to recreate. It's like when I'm watching there was just some swirly cool shit and like really interesting. But when you see it, when you see a dmt trip, it's just, first of all, it's a million things at the same time it's a bunch of different things. It's no matter how you, depending how you look at it, it's a different

Speaker 8:          01:01:14       thing. I really liked how there was so much detail too because I've noticed this on past hallucinate trips before, like, like little things like after he was tripping, like he shut this door and the door kind of have like a red pulse when he showed it and stuff like that. Now, what did you think about the big, even at the very beginning where you were hypnotized in a seizure where it's just flashing all those logos crazy like that happens throughout the movie and some points you're just like, all right, they're brainwashing me right now. This is, this is from the government or google. Hey dom, that kind of shit though. I'm starting to wonder about that with every. I'm such a, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I am paranoid. So really I'm completely paranoid and a or I can get there and I've got to like a close the neuropathways, you know, and just fucking try to bring myself back from it because I can go totally into that where I'll start thinking like anything like a fucking sitcom, you know, like,

Speaker 2:          01:02:06       well, you had a real freakout recently. We talked about this on the green room, uh, where you, you, uh, you got super paranoid from weed.

Speaker 8:          01:02:14       Yeah. And I've had, it happened. It was the second time it happened. The first time I had a pot cookie in Australia. The second time I just smoked.

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       But you said something really interesting to me and he said, I can't smoke pot. I said, yes you can. He said, I have to go to therapy first. Yeah, like what do you have to go therapy about breathing exercises? I don't fucking know, but it just put me into panic attacks and. Well, I thought, I thought it was just the wheat. The first time it happened. It didn't happen. We smoked weed before. Didn't we smoke weed in Florida? You know, it's another funny story. Know what's a funny story. One time I was at a medicinal marijuana benefit that you were like playing. You were like doing a show at the comedy store for him. Calico, brian kaylin and I came over and uh, some girl was with you like, like that was in charge of it or something. and she goes, she had these muffins and I had no idea that I didn't know that you were a big pothead.

Speaker 5:          01:03:00       I didn't know that. What it was. And I was starving and she goes, do you want a muffin? And unlike, yeah, have a muffin. So I ate the muffin and I'm like, these are really good, and she's like, yes. And then I count goes, what's a show? And you go, oh, it's a benefit for medicinal marijuana. And I go, it clicked. I went, did I just fucking eat a pot muffin? And she says, yeah. And I went like this, I can't go. I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta get home right now. And I drove home as fast as I could because I knew it would take 20 minutes for it to kick in and I just didn't want to be out with it going on and just be. And I was like, fuck, I got it. Because I had done. I'd eaten pot cookies before and I was like, I gotta get the fuck what happened?

Speaker 5:          01:03:40       So I drove home as fast as I could. I get home and it kicks in and I just didn't have the fucking greatest experience all alone. And I'm having like a wonderful night and I called a girl. I know, can you go to 7:11 for me? I need this, this, this, this, and I just was laughing and she's like, you use your high and like, yeah, yeah. But the first time I did it was in Australia and I had such a great time. I had to do a show three nights in a row by the third night. The same exact audience. Oh my god. Every night. That's ridiculous. So by the third show I'm out of shit, you know, I've, I'm down to my worst stuff and I'm like. So right before I went onstage, I hit a pot cooking thinking be, and I did like an hour and 45 minutes and they're like, it was fucking brilliant. And unlike, what did I talk about? They're like, you've talked about the mach three razor for an hour. And I'm like, really? And they're like, we don't even have it here. That's ready to record yourself. I would have been

Speaker 9:          01:04:34       great. I've had a two freakouts were one went to the hospital and it wasn't related top related. Uh, and once we're in the ambulance came to my house and I, I, but now I don't get that anymore. I don't get that anxiety or anything like that unless I eat it and then when I eat it, it's not good. Well, also, I mean it depends on what's going on in your life at the time. you think I should be getting paranoid. I should be dead right now because I smoke pot every day. My life's crazy. You know? Life's crazy. Yeah. Well, you know, just all the shit lately, if that's what you're saying. No, I don't think you're crazy, man. I think your life is saying her now than it was just a couple of years ago. Do you remember you. Well, you know, I don't wanna get into personal details, but you know what I'm talking about. Um, the, the, the problem is all right and here's the number

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       one problem with eating it is it nobody knows what the fuck it does to you. You know, nobody tells you they just sell these things at the pot stores. What was that? A pot brownie. Oh, I'll try eating it. Not knowing that it's way more powerful. Way more powerful and it lasts forever. I hate a pot brownie wants and I swear to god it lasted 12 hours, so this first one lasted about 12 fucking and they told me it was funny. I was having a great time. I was in adelaide, Australia. I'd been drinking all day and then I ate half a cookie and they said just eat half. Nothing happened. I go, I'm going to have the other half. And they were like, all right. I did the other half having a great time and all of a sudden I turned around. I got up to go to the kitchen. I turned around and looked at theSe girls and I go make it stop. WhAtever we have to do to stop this. Let's stop your trip. Yeah. I was like, can we, is there any way to like abort right now? And they're like, all right, calm down. And I'm like, no, no, no. We need to fucking stop this. and they're like, why are you being such a bitch? I don't know. But. But what started happening, it was around a bunch of girls, man, let's pull it together.

Speaker 9:          01:06:21       Hey, remember when excerpt out of fear factor, I had to sit with all those girl interns in their car and put it together though he didn't yell at anybody to make it stop. I thought my eyeballs were trapped and when he first came here from Ohio, he had nothing. He had no resistance. He was used to this Ohio. We'd, which you might as well been mixed mexican brick weed, might've well been smoking talcum powder. It's nonsense. That's a terrible example. Gold bond and I gave him a lollipop. These, these fucking beyond bomb. Before beyond bomb went to jail. They were operating a multimillion dollar operation at oakland and the dea rated them during the bush administration and we had to. We had one on the way there and then half hour later you're like, you feel anything? I'm like, no, not relating. And so we took another one because we.

Speaker 9:          01:07:01       I think you were new to the lollipops to at the time we didn't really know the length of how long the wait may panic attack right now. sitting in where he drops me and goes, oh, hang out here in this trailer. It was like the trailer with all the managers and directors and producers and stuff like that and I'm just thinking about not knowing anybody and it hits me were all super friendly but they're totally cool, but I mean my heart started pounding. I started freaking out. I go and sit on the curb and then in between breaks you come on and like, how are you doing? I'm like, dude, I'm so fucking stone and having a panic attack, and you're like, dude, I still have a mic on her when it's a now everything. Everybody in the trailer now hearS me and he like dropped me off in these interns car and just sat there and talked about fucking sex and the city or something. I think

Speaker 5:          01:07:44       I told you this. I know this, these, these little dudes that I used to kind of. It was a girl that was friends with her little brothers and they were big potheads in high school and we used to hang around. We're in college at their house and they always. They were up to no, like they grow it in their backyard. They tried everything so they were. They were making pot cookies one night and they make them, they leave them out, that kind of a wealthy family. They have like a maid and everything. They leave the pot cookies out because parents are always out of town. The maid puts them in baggies and puts them in the. In the cookie canister. Dad comes, grabs

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       two cookies, cookies and eat some rushed to the hospital thinking he's having a heart attack. So I say to the kid like, they're telling me the story. I'm like, so did you tell them? They're like, fuck, no, that's hilarious. So did he ever figure out that he was a. I don't medicate it. Like the whole family had a panic attack. Hey, yeah, you know, I'm one kid went to jail because a, they dose their teacher up in school. They gave the teacher pot cookies. I remember in high school used to always try to sneak in a laxatives and our teachers coffees and stuff and I look back and I'm like, that's fucking rude because I mean, I remember getting dangerous too. It's an evil I heard of. I heard about a fraternity wanting all these dumb fraternity price. I forget where it was his college at, like George Mason when I was doing a show there.

Speaker 4:          01:08:59       They go, oh yeah, we got this fraternity that at the end of hell week they, uh, they feed them spaghetti. They give them this big spaghetti dinner that the lake little sisters make for them and then they feed them like chocolate pudding, but it's full of x slacks and then they make them climb a tree and they've got to spend the night in a tree. Like the top guy gets to go to the top of the tree and all the way down. So like if you're an asshole, you're down at the bottom shitty. Just all shitty things are so disgusting. They're juSt preparing you for just to be fucked with and to be in some country group where you get to fuck with new people. Just taking advantage of the people that have the least amount of power and the people that want the most from you. The other good thing about fraternities was going to their parties and like fucking those sorority girls stand up at a fraternity wants.

Speaker 4:          01:09:46       I'm pretty sure I know as opposed to a. I did a lot of college, a lot of college gigs and like weird spots like cafeterias and shit rec rooms and did one in the cafeteria where I had to stand on actual cafeteria tables. It was like, that was the stage. It was a table and still on a cafeteria table. But um, one, one fraternity stunt that I heard that was the craziest was they made this guy drink water and he died from water. Oh, water. What's that called? Hitting a tree. Mia. Yeah. pretty much are drowning yourself. Yeah. It's not nuts style, but just turns out all your salt and then you know, this happens with this new starbucks size. Jesus christ. I've been drinking this ice tea forever and I'm still only like bulletins. Hold it up to the camera. It's for folks that don't see it at home. This is the new starbucks. Thirty two ounce and this is a, this is just an ice coffee or an iced tea rather.

Speaker 10:         01:10:38       Yeah. Here's the, here's the old size, here's the other side. And it's thicker too or bigger.

Speaker 4:          01:10:45       It's not only tolerant, but it's wider, wider. I got that hit in a marathon. I ran a marathon. You drank too much water. I panicked like, you just shouldn't change your fucking habits, but everybody goes, oh, you know, make sure you hydrate, make sure you're hydrated, make sure you hydrate. So I drank like, fucking like 10 bottles of water before the race. Like, oh wow. And uh, I knew I started pissing like so much that I went, fuck, I'm going to piss all my salt out. So I went up to. I never thought about that. Every day in my life I went up to the coffee table and a coffee and I go, I go to this woman. I go, do you have salt packets? I need fucking salt. I just wanted to down some salt, just big fat black woman goes, who puts salt in their coffee?

Speaker 4:          01:11:28       And I'm like, just get me fucking salt. And I knew it was going to fucking happen and sure enough I hit like the 16 mile mark and I hit a wall. I'd never hit my life because I was just nothing left in. Never heard of anybody doing it. I never even thought about. I know a woman, um, died in, I think it was sacramento. I want to Say there was a radio stuff they did was, she had a drink, a lot of water. That was like a year and a half ago, two years. And it was like we were on the cross town radio station, you know, we were on like one of their competitors stations and they were telling us a story. Like, how fucked up it was, you know, that's, that's. I remember that shit man. Death, some water woman who is trying to win like on xbox for kids.

Speaker 4:          01:12:09       I think some northern California sacramento, I thought it was, but yeah, it might be san jose, but in northern California, whatever it is, but it's just like, fuck man, drinking water, drinking water were so bitchy. Were so fragile. This is there a dog out there that could die. Because he drinks too much water. No, we suck. We're such pussies. You have it. It's, that's an anomaly. That's like a. Then you see guys that I know, dude, who this fucking crazy dude that I know from New Jersey who drank bleach and he's a lot. He's the dumb is this guy went to penn state and my friends all know him and they all talked about him. I finally got to meet him and he's just a fucking maniac. He sells mack trucks now. I think that's what he does for a living. And uh, they, they knew him from this fraternity.

Speaker 4:          01:12:50       They're like, this dude fell off the roof for time. Everybody knows a guy like that. And I'm like, why would you keep climbing up there? And they're like, they put, they would like put like signs don't let them on the roof to still go up there and fall off. So they tell me he chugged bleach and I'm like, I get a shot of it or something. And I go, I don't believe it. I don't believe until I need them one night or I see him and I go, hey dude, uh, I go, hey dude, I think his name is reagan or something like that. Is it true you, you drank bleach? And he's like, yeah. And I go, well, why? and he goes, because it said on the bottle if you drink this you will die. Am I dead? no. And that was like his whole point, like a philosopher.

Speaker 4:          01:13:30       I know homeless people used to drink rubbing alcohol when they couldn't get real alcohol or something like that. You remember michael dukakis? yeah. Michael dukakis. When he ran for president who's running for president and his wife, kitty dukakis was such an alcoholic that she'd be began drinking shaving cream and shit like that. Yeah, she, she was drinking like nutty shit and she got rushed to the hospital. I believe he was shaving cream or something, you know, shave something nutty. Do you work the stress factory in New Jersey? I have vinnie brand told me a story. I forget the comic. I think he was one of those like famous prop comics, but in his day was like a really bad alcoholic and I'm like, I could be wrong with who the comic is, but a lenny shoultz lenny,

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       I don't think it was lenny because I think the guys did is not that izzy, I don't know whoever it is I think is dead now. But glen, he was really old fucking vinnie's office and drank cologne. Like he came out and it smelled his breath and was like, what the, like he was that much of an alcoholic like chicks. Have you ever heard of it? Like when girlS fall asleep with a hairdryers in their beds, that's like an actual, you know, a lot of girls do that to keep warm or something like that or a sound of it. And they, uh, if you ever heard of that before, they just full blast hairdryer and they stay in their bed, in their bed and it's actually a condition that's awesome. People are so nuts, man. This kitty dukakis thing, um, she was rubbing alcohol. that's what she drank, you know, um, I guess she was rushed to the hospital.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       I mean, I guess you can die, but how crazy is that this guy was running for president, which just goes to show you how much your world is falling apart when you're running for president. You know what I mean? How much effort do you have to put into it? It's a reason why these guys go gray like a year after they get into office, you know, the amount of stress and the, the. I mean he wasn't paying attention to his wife at all. You don't. You think you'd know if your wife was ready to drink rubbing alcohol. I just, baby. How you feeling or thinking about drinking some.

Speaker 2:          01:15:25       let's talk. Hold on. Listen, I can't talk to run for president, but don't drink alone. I'll be back in 20 days. Maybe I'm talking about drinking some room clean. Don't drink my perfume. She was apparently she was taking antidepressants or something too. She had been taking an antidepressant, prescribed antidepressants back in the eighties. You know, where they want to make a ground up leeches. What did they, would they serve you in 1989 for antidepressants? Cocaine killed the whole. What can I enter the questions they have? They didn't have the good shit. Just drink a coke. Thorazine? No, that was for. Listen, that list gets a friend or something. I dunno. prozac, right? Wasn't prozac and whether the early ones. Dude, I know so many fucking parents that dope up their kids. I know two parentS where their kids are just wild. They're crazy and the parents don't pay much attention to the kids.

Speaker 2:          01:16:14       So the kids are on drugs. I have to put the kids on some medications. Dogs. People give dogs depressant. So fucking anxiety drugs and my old neighbor, she used to live down the street from me and you know, I didn't know her that much but he was just, hi, how you doing? What's going on? And her kid was, you know, always running around and you know, playing fucking dragons and swords like kids, do you know, I was kinda gotta get them on something. There's something wrong with my baby. I'm like, there's nothing wrong with your kid as a kid when kids are fucking four and you work all day and you come home, they're wired to the gills. Okay. no one's watching what they're eating or eating candy all day and they want to go crazy and go nutty. You're just old. You forgot what it's like to be a five year old. This is how five year olds are. They're fucking crazy. Five year old boys are crazy and she had them doped up and then this other lady I know, same fucking thing or kid was wild. He was running around crashing cars into everything. She's like, something wrong with them. I got to take him to the doctor. I'm like, there's nothing wrong with a fucking kid fucking kid. So she's got them doped up to, you know, it's like jay jeffrey. It's amazing that that's even an option. Jim jeffrey

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       said his mom used to wake them up every morning with a glass of orange juice and ritalin and she would just open up, like he said, he didn't even know what it was. She'd just be like open up and just pop them in his mouth and make them drink it down. Well, you know, when you develop a kid incorrectly, some people are just mentally imbalanced. That is a fact. There's some people that their hormone levels are the chemical levels of the brand or just fucked up and they do need some help, but there's other people that just were. Somebody raised them shitty, just did a terrible job, barely fucking paid attention to him and the kid developed all this nutty behavior and getting it out of someone. It's way harder to get something out of something. Someone once it's in there, once they've already developed some wacky patterns of behavior and they have like certain associations, very difficult to get that to change, but if you could just, you know, it's way easier to raise on correctly from the beginning to try to turn someone around once they're fucked up.

Speaker 4:          01:17:59       It'S like how many people that you know, that are a mess, that have fucked up lives ever. Pull it together ever. You know, ever so few, but so few people quit anything. I know a chick who used to prostitute herself and she was like the nicest girl in the world. I knew two girls that kinda like went to prostitution and they, you wouldn't think either these girls, but she was doing like craig little craigslist hooking and shit and um, she had, you know, it had like the molestation thing and all that fucked up stuff and she went to therapy and jay and I said, why don't you tell what your therapist say about it? And she's like, I don't tell them. I'm like, well, you need to tell your therapist that you were molested and all this stuff and work on that shit. And she did eventually and she's like married and I think she's had in her life is good.

Speaker 4:          01:18:46       It, she really is a product of like, it actually cleaned up that problem. people can do it, man. You can change it. Just you've got to be fucking goddamn committed staying on that track. You almost have to become addicted to changing, you know, you have to like get and it has to get ingrained in you so deeply after so long a time that it actually becomes your new way of thinking and you new behavior. I mean, if you just go back and look at yourself. I mean, if I had to be myself at 21, I mean, I couldn't imagine if I had my 21 year old brain today, I would be fucking insane out of nothing. I would never, I would have liked the house on fire with fucking to drive my cars over cliffs. I mean, I feel like last night what happened in my house, I had my 21 year old brand.

Speaker 4:          01:19:28       You guys hAd some nutty as podcast on. Fuck, I'm going to ask you. I'm afraid to go to my house. It's so you never finished what happened to you? Um, in the most recent pot thing where you send me a message? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was in New Zealand and um, uh, I, I, I, I had smoked a few times. Our arch barker and I are really good friends. And when we're Australia we go to his house and we just, and he's another guy that's huge in Australia. Massive. He's in Australia. He's like, chris rock isn't America? Yes. Wow. Uh, like, like dane cook. Yeah. That massive. Like, like crazy sells every ticket he puts out. And I've heard of them in America. He's funny is, but it's cartoon

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       that we love our gcp fucking hilarious. And uh, it, it, it. And he was doing well in America. He's on flight of the conchords, you know, he's got a career here. Yeah. It's not that he's doing bad, but just superstar superstar there. And he loves it and it's a great place. He splits his time there. No, he's there now. Permanently. Permanently. Yeah. It's so crazy. He said fuck it. He bought this great house up in the middle of like, it's out there and he's got a farm and he just loves it now. You're a huge in Australia too, but you want to be over here more? Yeah, I'd much rather be here. Why is that? Just, you know, I've got family here and stuff and getting back the 15 hour flights. not easy. It's brutal. It is brutal to fucking crush you. The crusher spirit that I fly.

Speaker 2:          01:20:51       I've got, you have to throw it in three weeks. I'm going in. I'm done too. Are you going to be in, in town? Um, I leave sydney like the day you show up. Oh really? Shit dude. I could hook you up. What's, what's, what, what, what days? You're um, um, I got two shows because the first show sold out you at the end. And morgan? No, no I couldn't get in there. There was a band because the ufc, the what happens is the ufc books their stuff kinda like late in comparison to like stand up and concerts. Like if you go to a concert venue, most concert venues are booked six months to a year out. So for ufc it's not that far out. Like we're, we don't and we haven't announced yet. We got some shit announce right now. It's in april, but there's some still some stuff in marx's up in the air and the may stuffs up in the air and the june stuff is up in the air.

Speaker 2:          01:21:34       Some of them get confirmed and some of them are still up in the air. And the problem is sometimes I don't find out until like maybe the latest, the earliest is three months out, three months out. It's tough to get a gig because they're all, all the venues are booked friday and saturday nights. So it's saturday night and met rudy hill, wherever that is that he rooty hill rsl. Hey, I know it. I know supposedly in a funky, I think you, you must be, is a list promoting, uh, the same people that promoted the last time. So those are my guys. Yeah, they're great. Yeah. Same guys pack that place. Yeah, sort of the first one is already sold out in the second one. And by the way, if you want to go to mandalay bay this weekend, it's almost sold out friday night. Um, uh, at the mandalay bay theater and uh, there's gonna be a, it's going to be arusha fear and joe dhea, so it's going to be fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:22:17       It's a big giant place, but I've been pimping the tickets for a long time so it's almost sold out. So, um, this is the place I'm doing it. SYdney as the rsl club. You ever, were you ever working on? Yeah, I think there's a good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're like, it's an rsl ourselves, like they're retired service league, which means it's like they're veterans clubs until it's like a vfw. Your plane. So how come you didn't tell me to get the fuck out of the neighborhood? You think you think you're like, fuck, I'm playing a vfw, be in that place. They'll have a big fucking, it must be pretty big. What's it? The capacity? I think it's like $800. So I have like the theater within there, like, but in every little town they have these rsls and it's where you go to drink cheap before you go out at night and they got poker machines club. Yeah. So what, but why are they tellIng me to get out of town? Because it's probably a. They sent us a shitty neighborhood.

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       Yeah. They're like, if you're going to party, don't party there. I get the fuck out of there. Get back into the city. Why is it creepy? It's just a fucking suburb. It's like playing like, you know, like if you were in clifton, clifton, New Jersey and you're not. and sometimes it's fun being in the suburbs. So sometimes it's fun being those weird fringe places. Well they've got, you know, they're, they're, they're rednecks are called bogans bogans slogan. So they're like, I'm crocodile dundee is that they're more like, um, they're guys that are In delight, nitro circus kind of shit. They'd call, they'd call them like circuit does that mean nitro circus? That mtv show with pat? Uh, travis pastrana have no idea the motorcycle motorcycle jumping and all that. So they're just like, fucking, you know, guys like to have fun and adventure seekers. A lot of guys in Australia fucking ride motorcycles and they drove units which are like pickup trucks.

Speaker 4:          01:23:54       I'll start as a goddamn manly country, yet extremely goddamn mentally. Was that about, was it the prison colony thing? I think it has a lot to do with that task to fucking beautiful place, man. Australia. So gorgeous. And, and I Saw like I saw down there and the surfers, they're just crush americans are really. Every dude there. You think he's a pro real, you'll just go to like some guy like, hey, you do you serve? And he'll be like, hey, I did a little and you want to go tomorrow? You'll go to the next day and be like, dude, you should be on tour. Like really fucking all amazing. Well they love the ufc. Mma and ufc sells out there in like 15 minutes time every, every single time we've been there. We've been there twice, but every single time it breaks, records sells out quicker than anything.

Speaker 4:          01:24:38       It's fucking nutty. And they love george sada apolis there. One guy that got a little, one famous australian guy. He's a fucking great dude. Yeah, he's a top contender right now in the ufc. Two nicest fucking guy in the world, but he's a perfect ozzy just so fucking savage. They have a, they have a real fucking like they call theM blokes, like a guy's a bloke and they're very blokey and women complain about it. Like in sydney, I always say that like, you can't even talk to a woman in a bar because the guys have fucked them over so badly. You go up to go and be like, hi. She was like, go fuck yourself can't. And You're like, whoa, what did I do? And it's not like you did. It's what the last 20 guys that dealt with her did. So the girls are on the defensive and uh, because the guy is just, it's all about your boys, but don't they have a different attitude towards sex and Australia?

Speaker 4:          01:25:21       The much more permissive? Much more. I would say there are a lot of much musculus everywhere. But America, that's one thing you don't realize about America. How, I mean obviously the middle east is worse unless you're a little boy, but in the, in the middle east, they love to fuck little boys. That's, that's an awesome time for them, but as far as like like european countries, we are so fucked up in comparison to them like our, our whole repression, all that shit that doesn't exist over there. They're like in Argentina and south America, the commercials, there's super life hurt. I've heard, I don't know how true this is. I read or it was in a. It was a statistic in jesus camp. Did you see that film? They said two thirds of americans born again. Christians know that's what it said in the beginning of that film. I don't think that's correct.

Speaker 4:          01:26:05       I think probably two thirds of the people that they talked to or evangelical, you know, finding the numbers of for $300, million people. that's so problematic. Not only that, you've got to add in mexicans, you know, because there's a lot of undocumented people in this country and who knows how many it is. I mean, I've heard millions and millions in California alone, so who knows how many it is nationwide, so knowing how many people are actually christians and evangelical evangelical christians or people who believe the earth is less than 10,000 years old. You know the numbers are. Who the fuck knows what they are? I've heard 51 percent believed the earth is less than 10,000 years old. Fifty one percent believe in a biblical version of the bible that's fucked up there. But which by the way, play that fucking clip. Yeah. god, we have to play this clip.

Speaker 4:          01:26:49       Bill O'reilly, man. Now, by the way, bill o'reilly went to fucking harvard. I also think he's a troll. I think he's playing a character. I think you might be wrong. Almost pause. Thank. He's, uh, he's very clever as to lIke the kind of shit that he supports in the way supports. It is so asinine that it's almost like he's trolling. It's almost like subtle parody. Yeah. Here's why I think that I used to do sports radio in New York city. I was on w new, which is the station, opie and anthony. Ron And all that, I was the morning show with this guy named sid rosenberg's sids. Sure. I know. Said rosenberg. I do a show in miami all the time. Sports expert. I knew fucking nothing. It waS supposed to be like love lines where he was the expert and I was the comedian and sid wanted me to be an expert in sports and I don't give a shit about, you know, what fucking guy stats.

Speaker 4:          01:27:35       So did he ask you to like learn the stats? No, but there was constant conflict between the two of us because you worked there for six months and I was like, I'm getting the fuck out of here. So he was telling you, hey, read the sports book, read it. You'd be like, did you watch the game last night? And like, no. And he's like, why not? I'm like, I didn't fucking want to fucking be funny. I'll be funny. And he's like, but you got to be funny about sports. I'm like, no, I don't. I just have to be funnY. So man, that always bugs me when I listen to sports radio. And they were like, and how bout mchenry with the play in the night? Does he think that dad's gonna get his contract extension but don't bump. But it made me fucking like crazy because I realized the only way you're going to get ratings and be interesting is I had to basically take on a character and I would sit there and criticize these athletes and these coaches that I didn't even watch the fuck below to that.

Speaker 4:          01:28:24       By the way, I wouldn't even watch the game. And I'd be like, jim fossil, he's a fucking pussy. Did you see what he did? Just say fuck, I wouldn't say that, but I'd be like, can you put. I said pussy. I'd go, he's a pussy, he's a pussy. And the next thing you know, you know, all his fans are called, I'm going to kick your roads, man. How could you say that? How could it. And I would just try to incite people to create radio. And I watch fucking bill o'reilly and I'm like, he's doing the same shit. There's no possible way he might be. He, you know, I definitely think he's playing towards his market. He has a market and he's concocted this, this gigantic conglomeration of retards and old people

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       that think that he makes sense, but this is one of the most troll like things that he's ever said. BrIan, check this out. It's talking about the moon is on bill o'reilly dot com. Could find on youtube backstage conversation backstage with bill o'reilly,

Speaker 11:         01:29:19       david, beverly hills, Florida, or what do you mean when you refer to the ties? When you asked about the existence of god? Science explains the tides. The moon's gravity pulls on the ocean. Okay, I had pneumonia then. How'd you get there? look, you pinheads who attacked me for this? You guys are just desperate. Had sImone get there. I just wanted to get there. I get there. Can you explain that to me? How come we have that and maurice doesn't happen. Venus doesn't happen. How come mars has two moons by now? How'd I get here? How did that little amoeba get here? Cool out there. How to do it? Come on. You have order in this universe. You have an order in the universe. Tide comes in, tide goes out. Okay. Yeah, the moon does it fine, and the moon get there. Who put it there? It just happened. Okay. If we have existence, if we have life on earth, how come they don't have it on the other plants? We just lucky some media and do this. Come on. you know, I see this stuff. It's desperate times. It takes more faith to not believe and just think that this was all luck. EverY oldest human body, the intricacies of it and everything else, all luck.

Speaker 11:         01:30:34       Then It does it to believe in a deity.

Speaker 2:          01:30:37       Is there a positive I want you to do right now? Two things I want you to do. One, I want you to go look up a bill o'reilly, a scandalous voicemails because he left a bunch of voicemails on his assistance. His assistant's fallen about a rubbing her down with a loofa sponge and fucking all kinds of creepy shit. He wound up payIng her off, don't you? Don't you think that bill o'reilly's the kind of guy that really needs to get really high? Yeah, and then he might go, holy shit back. I take back almost everything I've ever said. She, yeah, for sure he would because he would allow hIm a different perception that he probably has never entered into if he does believe that shit, but it's, I don't know if he does or doesn't. I think he does and this is why I think he does.

Speaker 2:          01:31:24       I think he does because he's got a tremendous ego and I think, you know, he's one of those guys that he's, he's saying something all the time. I don't think you would say something all the time unless he believed it, you know, this, this whole thing. I think, you know, I think he's definitely preaching to the choir and I definitely think he's, you know, trying to fit a, fit a mold and, and trying to appease his constituents, all the people that listen to his show. But I think there's, it can't be contrary to what he really believes because he's got too big of an ego for him to be on tv talking about it all the time. Eventually he'd implode. He wouldn't be able to deal with that. If you really did have a, an intelligent

Speaker 12:         01:32:00       argument that was contrary to what we've saying, I don't think you would be saying it on the air. I just think his ego's too big. I don't think he's that genius. He's not. He's not andy kaufman and he's not some brilliant trickster that's fucking fooling the world. I think these guYs, they start playing a character and then they sort of like dice clay it. They become the character. Yeah. Whatever one dice clay onto the dice. Clay used to be andrew silverstein, by the way. We're goIng to try to get dice on the podcast too. I'm not hating. I love dies down a great talk with dice. Ella. Date diocese. Kid is doing comedy. Dices kid is 20 and diocese so proud and his kid is fucking killing. It's kids like learning. Yeah, and it's fucking great. what's his name? What's he go by? What's his name was max.

Speaker 12:         01:32:38       Max. Max clay. No, I don't think goodby silverstein. Anyway, he'd seen his name around dice used to be a andrew silverstein and then he would. The dice man was like this character that he would do on stage along with a bunch of other characters. He would do like stallone and he would do deniro. He would do like all these characters, like all these impressions and the dice man was one of his characters. Well, the dIce man just became his main character that became his thing. He done on stage and then it became him offstage. You know, and I think that happens to guys like Glenn Beck. I think what happens is they start out with this character and they start out and then they get all these people. Thank you, Mr. Beck. You make me so happy. And what you said about jesus is so important to me and my family and what you say about our troops so important to me and our family and he, this guy's soaking in this love and he's putting out a book every three days.

Speaker 12:         01:33:25       This motherfucker and all of them are about what's wrong with the left and what's wrong with society and what's wrong with being godless and what's wrong with this. And sarah palin's the only hope for our country, and then they start fucking believe in it, man, because the human ego, when you're the type of person that's really selling something and pitching something and getting all this adulation for it, if you're an egomaniac, which most people get into the public eye are, you know, most people that get into a position where like a guy like that where they have a, an opinion show where they're onstage every day talking to people and broadcasting to millions. They get all this love and fan mail. It's very difficult to be objective about that. You know, it's very difficult to like, you know, have a real honest way of looking at the way you start looking at it the way they want you to look out.

Speaker 12:         01:34:06       Because this is where the love's coming from. You know, and then you start back turned into a fucking mormon. Okay? As an adult, as an adult, who by the way is obviously, look, you can say he's crazy and I do, but that has got a high iq. There's no question in my mind. I guarantee you, if you sat that guy down, he's won 20 Plus iq, you know, he's a smart guy. There's no way you could do that. Free ball mormonIsm, he's fucked up. No, he's not. Look, the, the intelligence and balance are two totally different things. I've met some brilliant people. I'm one of the, I don't want to say his name, a guy who used to design my website so fucking brilliant, but completely insane and totally imbalanced. I know a bunch of people like that, that are really, really brilliant people, but I mean mathematically brilliant, you know, structurally brilliant, brilliant.

Speaker 12:         01:34:53       The way they can break down a complex, uh, orders in all, in their own life is just chaos. And you're saying becky is brilliant. Yes. I think he's absolutely brilliant. Brilliant. And being a cunt, he's what he's doing is I think he's a brilliant manipulation. Yeah, brilliant manipulation, brilliant at acting, brilliant at playing apart, brilliant at becoming the perfect version of this guide thAt all these retards need. Because I don't, I don't think it takes intelligence to be a manipulator. What he's doing takes intelligence. He's free balling every day. He's got like a big screen and is breaking things down and some of it makes sense. It's like 20 or 30 percent of it. I go, god dammit. I agree with glen beck. This is ridiculous. But I think that those guys, when they get to that position where the extraordinary amount of success that they achieve in one certain area meet glenn beck's houses for sale in Connecticut and I looked at that shit online.

Speaker 12:         01:35:44       There's a fucking giant and it's probably only for sale because he got a bigger one. You know, you've got a bigger crazier when that guy selling. Literally every time I go to the bookstore there's a new Glenn Beck book and nobody makes me feel lazier than glenn bUck because I've been writing this god damn book for a year and I can't ha Glenn Beck putS out one every 15 days. It's fucking insane, you know. But these guys, I really truly believe as a person who's been affected by fame and had been affected like my war. If I had to look at my own behavior and analyze it and then you know, that's one of the reasons why I really got into psychedelics and the, the isolation tank is because I felt like there was an overwhelming influence that that fame and the pursuit of fame has on a person, especially in hollywood where you're, you're trying to make things happen where you can lose yourself in this quest and I take it happens to a lot of people.

Speaker 12:         01:36:29       So I wanted to kind of analyze it in myself and, and it took a long time for me to get ahold of it from like fear factor on. There was like a long time in there where I was like, this is a crazy thing here. Like how do you make sure that what you're doing is really what you want to be doing? How do you, how do you, how do you know that you know what you're doing is not what you think people would like to hear from you or what you think is gonna you're gonna say and do to get more work and to get more people to like you. I mean, I've had conversatIons with really successful people. They say, you know, I can't do that because I'm this and that and my image is that and this and like, okay, you're, you're not even doing you, you're pretending to be something else just so that you can get more of the positive reaction that you've gotten. That permeates into your real life,

Speaker 8:          01:37:10       but what if, what if that's like, like I'm the kind of person I vacillate. Often I'll, I'll look at one thing and then all have a different opinion maybe a year later on how I felt about it and been in the seat and as a, as a performer, as a comedian, my ax constantly changing. Sometimes I can't do bits that I used to do because I've changed as a person. I don't feel that way and I can't deliver them with truth and I'm like, that would suck to fucking be locked into accounts. We're off air Says we're off the air use drink keeps on fucking up, but it's on here. It says we're on here, so it's going off and on and it's choppy for people, but I can't get on right now. It's on you see it. Yeah, it's on. You see online. Where do you see online? We have 13, 17 viewers. It's broadcasting.

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       It's recording. See if you can see it on a. On a browser. All right. Anyways, who cares? We're talking about use you, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:38:03       Well, I'm just my. I accidentally unclicked it and I can't get back to. Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker 5:          01:38:07       So people lIke that, the ability to like change while you're and to get locked into that character would be terrifying for me. I'm a control freak and if that's where your income and I don't have the, you know, I'm lucky enough that I don't have like a life and kids. But imagine if you got into that where then you've got a house and mortgages and schools and you've, you've bought into this character and all of a sudden you've changed as a character and you're like, fuck, I'm not that guy anymore. I don't feel that way. I've changed my way of thinking, but fuck, I gotta I gotta still do that because people do change. People either become more conservatIve as they get older or you know, start to realize shit, you know, I've become more liberal as I get older. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:38:46       yeah. Well, I think as you become more intelligent, you know, you realize that there's a lot more. There's a lot more to things than people think. Now. Everybody likes to think it's black and white. I have a lot of conservative now, a lot of them about gun control, about, uh, about taxes, about a lot of different things. But I also have a lot of liberal points of view to, you know, especially when it comes to things like gay marriage and, you know, and that to me is one of the most frustrating things when I see people get upset about gay marriage, you know, as if it's somehow another fucking effects. You have two guys who obviously want to be gay. No one's got a gun to their head. No one's saying, if you're not gay, I'm fucking killing your family. You know? No one's doing that. They're just,

Speaker 5:          01:39:22       I find the people that are afraid of life, bro. This shit is offline, man. It's on everyday. I can take it on. You know, I, it's, it's having pro ustream. Ustream has some problems, man, when there's like you're trying to get on it, you have to refresh it a few times, whatever. It's on those, so don't worry about it. That's crazy. I, I walked out of the. Actually it was when I worked with you down in tampa or I was doing the, the early and then you did like friday night and you came in tampa improv. I came out like my first night, it was like a wednesday or something and they're these guys out in the street holding up signs and it was like almost like that church from Nebraska or wherever. Those crazy fuckers that protest funerals is that. And they were holding up signs, god hates fags and blah blah blah.

Speaker 5:          01:40:05       And I just walked out. So the audiences out there with me and I thought I'm just going to fuck with these people. And I went up to this kid and I'm like, how old are you? And he's like, I'm 16 years old. I'm like, you're 16 and you're to go to an arcade. Go try to get laid. Go fucking have a life the fuck's wrong with you. Don't listen to your parents. They're assholes. And I'm making everybody laugh. Just making fun of this kid. But then I started, some older guy starts yelling at me and I go, dude, stop. You want to caulk in your ass so badly. Was the old guy your here right now because you hate yourself. I'm like, you want to make it easy? Just go suck a cock. It's going to change your whole life. You're out here, you're doing this shit because you're a homo and you just don't want to admit it. And I'm like, leave them the fuck alone. And go join them. That's your deep down. You know you're gay. And he's like, you're the devil. You're the devil.

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       You're here to. And I'm like, no, I'm here to help you. Dude. Go fucking suck a cock. It's going to change your life. I'm not joking. The next night I walk out, it's the atheists holding up signs going. You know, there is no god and god is bad and god created, you know, there's death and bob and I go up to them and I go, you're just fucking bad. Just fucking shut up and go fucking have a beer somewhere. You're. Why are you out of here with a. You've got your own religion of atheism. Like, I get it. I get your belief. You know, I don't believe in any kind of fucking order, anything. I don't know what I believe, but go away. Fucking stop your religion of people want to believe anything. Whether it's they want to believe in republicans. They want to believe in god.

Speaker 4:          01:41:39       They want to believe in. No god. I've had arguments with acs where it's so ridiculous. You know, like they're, they're saying scientists. Science disproves the existence of god. Like, no, it doesn't scientists and disprove anything. What what science does is it shows it's. Well, first of all, it's statistics and things that can be measured. You know, how can you measure what happens in the afterlife? That's nonsense. How can you measure what happened with the birth of the universe is and how do you mean? How do we not know that there's something that's far more comp? I mean, I'm not saying that there's a guy in the clouds with a harp, but what I am saying is it after smoking dmt seven times and doing mushrooms, all the times I've done and all the times in the isolation tank, I've seen shit way crazier than a dude with a harp and the clouds.

Speaker 4:          01:42:19       Okay. And I've seen it many, many, many times. I, I think that the idea that you can tell me what does and doesn't exist is fucking ridiculous. I cannot believe people actually try to do that. And I'm like, how do we know that we're here right now? Or that were, you know, there could be something so complex. I always tell people when they go, what's your belief on god? I go, when my dog looks at my computer, my mac book, she can't comprehend the operating system she has. No. She does not have the capability. And I believe that as humans, that's how we are with the universe. We don't have the fucking capability, we might be the most intelligent species, but we're not intelligent enough to understand something that's doesn't mean anything. It's like being the baddest worm. This worm is so smart. He knows how to get around this pebble, you know, it's really, it's ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          01:43:09       The idea that we can figure it out. I mean, this is complete and total stoner talk, but the idea that we can figure out the fucking universe, you know. Did you find the bill o'reilly? I'm the stuff now. It's not on there. What's not a video, bro? So on a video, it's an audio. Well, I think they just transcribed it. I saw it on a Washington post and stuff, but it just kind of talked about it. Did they have the transcriptions though? Hey, I want to change the subject for said, did you Bobby Leon here yesterday did to get naked for you. Fuck it. It got on our podcasts and we could not get him to keep his clothes on. He was just fucking rubbing his dick on everything and wow. So fucking much more sedate and what you guys fed them over there? Uh, I think he was, you know, I can, have you ever told your story

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       that you did at the storyteller a anywhere else other than that show? That was the first time I ever told him you should talk with, uh, the whole, uh, the whole time we use that urban, all of the black show. You want to tell that story? I'm not afraid. I mean, it's not, it's not racist on my part with apps not just took a chance. Yeah. I, I went to a suny, it was called suny farmingdale. It was a state university of New York in farmingdale, long island. And uh, my manager at the time, I think I'd only been doing comedy maybe three years, three or four at the most. I was in New York city and my manager at the time, jason steinburge. Do you know jason? Yes. Jason. And I'm only telling you his name because I want to burn them on this. Jason at the time had mostly black comics and all it's comics were like def jam didn't doing really well.

Speaker 5:          01:44:39       And so like some great great comics he had, he represented a lot of really good guys. Tony woods, greer barnes, all these guys were doing really well time and we're big in that. Like so he was always booking these events for like black shows and I get a c, I'm begging for work because I don't have any work at the time. And I hear him, I'm in his office, I hear him go, oh, oh yeah, so you need a comment yet yet? And it's not a def jam show, right? Ensure. Yeah. Okay. I think I got the 500 bucks and I'm like 500 bucks. Fuck, that's the most I've ever gotten paid for a gig. And I was like, I want this fucking gig. And he goes, all right, you're going to have to. Suny farmingdale train takes you right out there. It'll be like $10 train ride.

Speaker 5:          01:45:21       He's like, it's your, you're the intermission of an auction. And I'm like, what? He's like, yeah, it's traditionally, this is like an urban room, but it's just this auction. It's going to be like alumni and stuff. And I'm like, all right. I will, I go out there on the way out. Tony woods. Do you know tony? Tony and I are sharing and somebody who's really good friend of mine, he's going, dog, don't fucking go dog. They beat up Ralph Harris. They beat him up on stage and I'm like, what? He's like, they're gonna kill you guys. Sam the hog don't go, so why don't you listen is 500 bucks. I go, no, but it's an auction. It's different. I'm in the intermission. It's an alumni thing. So I go, I get there. I see the line of people waiting to go in and it's not just an urban show.

Speaker 5:          01:46:02       This is fucking like urban. Tony told me, he goes, dude bro. He goes there, their caribbean, black, caribbean, black are the guys that they killed me because I'm american black. He's like, they're gonna fuck you up. And I'm like, no, no, no. He's like, trust me. So I see the line of guys going in. Everybody's gone on fubu, you know, like jerseys and timberlands. Every single dude in the crowd, baggy jeans by the way of fubu stands for, for us, by us. And unlike funches, you know, kinda like separatist as it is and it's pretty funny when joey diaz whereas that. Yeah, sure. So I go, this is how long ago this was, I go to the payphone and r and r I page jason steinburge, and he calls me on the payphone and I go, jason, I'm fucking outta here. I'm outta here. And he goes, you're fine, you're fine.

Speaker 5:          01:46:51       It would just be funny. I'm like, no, this doesn't look good. He goes, no, you're gonna be fine. So I go into the auditorium. Security goes, well, what are you doing? I go, I'm the comedian. Security goes, fuck, you're the comedian. I quit because I'm outta here about here because he knows what's going to happen. The security guys saw you as a black guy. That was. Yeah. And he said, he just says, fuck, this was serious. It was serious. They call this gig the little apollo. Oh my god. And so I'm like, fuck. So I go back to the phone. I called jason again. I go, jason, I'm leaving, I'm leaving. I'm just not doing it. I'm going to die. He's like, eddie, you're funny. He's like, just get up there and do what you do. And I'm like, so I, I'm so nervous, you know, when you're so new there's no chance of you doing well and awkward.

Speaker 5:          01:47:36       So I go down and the, the mc goes, uh, what do you, what do you want to come out to? And I never come out to music before. I'm like, what do you mean you got any led zepplin free bird, you know, like fuck, like a puff the magic dragon. I don't fucking know what. And they've got a dj on the side and I'm like, fuck. And come out too. Well I don't follow any rap music. Right? All at the. Especially at that time I came from a place called fox chapel and I would come out to fuck the police. I didn't know what that. And at the time I think knight rider is a good one. I had the shitty nightrider joke about how kid was gay. It was a gay car because they like l or ellen at the time was like coming out and I go, she's not the first gay character kit from nightrider was gay and uh, it made me.

Speaker 5:          01:48:28       He's like, michael, michael, I'm going to pick you up in a minute. And uh, so I was like, I'll do the kitchen and I'll come out to the knight rider like rap song by the way. Get our kelly the zoo, get that, pull that shit up. I know. We'll just, we'll edit it out later. Do you need, we need this, just trust me. Just pull it up on the side. So I go backstage and what they're doing is they're auctioning off dates with students from the school, so girls or guys like a guy will come out and heal and all the dudes are backstage lifting, doing foot pumping up, doing pushups and they've got dumbbells. So they're, they're getting swole and they're putting baby oil all over their bottles and taking their shirts off. And they're black as tar. Yeah. And they are no one ever making them black.

Speaker 5:          01:49:14       Everyone's ignoring me. Like what the fuck are you doing back here? And I swear to god I grabbed one of the bottles of rum that they're drinking and I just start chugging rum because I'm like, this is. I'm terrified so I shouldn't. I just start scrolling down this rum and there. I saw one chick there, the one white chicken. I'm like, she's really fucking hot. So they're auction dates with the guys and the girls. The guys will come out, they'll just like flex and everybody will bid and then the girls will come out and do like a strip tease act. They'll bring a guy, I'll put them in a chair and grind on them and do like a lap dance or whipped cream and do all this shit, you know? And they'll go crazy, but they're bidding. They get dinner at puff daddy's restaurant. P diddy had a restaurant in New York.

Speaker 5:          01:49:57       They had dinner at his place. They get a limo ride to New York and a broadway show. If they win the date and they're bidding. And I swear to god, dates are going for like $7 and watch five sold. Who could, you know know, and I'm looking at the hot fucking white chick going, I want a bit, we'll backstage this and she has to go out on a date with a guy. Hey, the guys just discussed it. Well, this is where it gets creepy. So the finale, I'm going to be the intermission. Then the finales is black stripper and she comes up to me and she said, hey, you're the comedian. I'm like, yeah, she's like, my name's heaven. And I'm like, hey heaven. And so we start talking. She goes, you're going to stick around and bid on me. And I'm like, and she thinks I'm like this professional, you know, rich comedian and I'm going to be able to bid a lot of money.

Speaker 5:          01:50:46       And because you told her that, I don't know, I'm like, I can't think about her. She starts talking to me. I just want to get a little taste. I actually said to her, get away from me because I was so scared because all the guys were checking her out and I'm like, I just don't want any problems here. So you thought you were going to get problems because you were talking to the bikes in front of black, kind of given you the mad dog look. So I'm just like, I'm just going to fuck. So has anybody said anything to any guys? No one was just white fear. They forget. Total has been negative to you. Got it. You got to understand, I grew up in a place where there was like my high school probably had like one black guy and you know, his last name was huxtable and uh, we, we, I ran track all through college and I was a sprinter, but I was separate, like I didn't hang out.

Speaker 5:          01:51:25       I hung out with my white friends and I wasn't. So when I moved to New York and I started to become friends with all the black comics, it was like a total new world for me. But this was like putting me in. I was out of my comfort zone. So what's your opening line? My opening line, I, I miss my cue to go out and they're yelling for me. Oh god. And I've rewritten all my jokes. You know, when you do that, I read and I go as not good. I'm not confident in this. And I like stumble almost trip on the stage and they're already. The emc had been go where my dogs at and goes, ooh. And they're running to the front of the stage when he does it and all putting their hands up in the air and I come out and I go, hey, uh oh, what happened before I came out?

Speaker 5:          01:52:08       They auction off the white chick, right? The bidding goes up to like $350 and every black chicken, the place is about to fucking rush the stage stabber. And I'm like, there's going to be a ride in here and the black church, southern white guy. So I'm going down with her. So black girl saying there, they're pissed off. They're screaming and they're going to get a here. And so caner mission happens. They call me out and I think my opening line, I think I said something about they're going to be a riot when they did it on the, when they were bidding on the white chick. And I go, you know, I was like, and I get a little, I get a little bit of a laugh and there was some creepy dude that was like an older dude who was bidding. I made a black guy though.

Speaker 5:          01:52:53       I said it's like a pedophile. And they kind of laughed at that and then I said, you guys, what are you doing with auctions? Didn't you learn your lesson with auction years ago? And I think it's kind of funny and I think like I'm going to get a laugh. Like, like kind of like, oh he's an insult comic and I hear like a womb and all of a sudden another who and I wasn't quick enough to keep going and I just said he paused, I paused and then you let them just started building. It was like a wave of booing to started to like get this mother fucker off the stage and people start throwing shit. And I swear to god, I hear it, get that fucking wait, get your white motherfucker ass off the stage before I kick your white motherfuckers. And I'm like standing there and I'm, I'm kind of like in this, like all of a sudden I get hit in the head with a cup, a crumpled up coke cup and he pisses me off and I go, who the fuck through that?

Speaker 5:          01:53:46       Who? And I don't know why, but you know, you get that rage and it's like, all this shit's happening to me. And I'm like a dog. That's been so much. I just started biting everyone. Who the fuck? Who the fuck through that? And some guy goes, I did. I go, fuck you. You want to throw something? Come on fucking throw something at me. Fuck. The kids starts running towards the stage and there are fold out chairs in the front. He picks one of them up and throws it on the stage. And unlike at that moment, I go, I'm going to fucking die like a. And they're pulling cushioning out of the seats and throwing it at me. And they're booing so loud. Now here's what's hilarious about eddie left. This is what he says to me, that when he tells me the story at the beginning of the day, he goes, now if it happened today, I totally be able to be like, I told the to make it funny. Comedians always want to think that I have so some.

Speaker 2:          01:54:33       I have some ruthless bombs in my past and I have gone over these bombings and said, man, if I could just go back and redo it is one time I bombed after jim breuer zwiers bottom of my entire career. It was devastation. I think I've talked about this for, I don't remember. I've talked about on the podcast, didn't brewer. We worked together all weekend and I could barely follow them. You know, this is like, I only been doing comedy maybe three years, maybe three or four years and he was just too strong to the middle and I really wasn't a headliner. It was a fake headliner. I like, I could do 45 minutes, but I would tell my jokes slow, you know what I mean? I couldn't, you know, so like when he was on stage and he's. Bruce has been about going home and he was being, he was hammered and his mother turned into a demon and it was like really loud and really animated and he was just, you know, sometimes it just gets in the zone and brewer used to get in these crazy zones. Man. I used to really enjoy watching him perform because he could just, just as physical performances, physical, you know, his, his, his, his presence on stage. Fuck. He just would nail it. And this is one time man, we had been doing all weekend, so we'd done two shows friday, one show saturday. This was a late show saturday and brewer just knocks it out of the park and there was a bunch of shit going wrong in my life at the time. One, I just torn my acl.

Speaker 12:         01:55:44       So it was for the first time in my life I couldn't work out. I've had never not worked out. So I had all this tension that I didn't know how to deal with, you know, like for me, my, my whole body from the time I was like, you know, 14 years old to the time I was, this was happening when I was 22 or 23, my body had been designed just to fucking to constantly be working, constantly be exerting all this energy, whether it's in kickboxing or wrestling or something. There was like, there's this constant. Then that was the only way I coped with stress that was gone. Okay. And I had moved from New York to boston. So no acl. It blows out and moved to New York or from boston to New York. I have no friends. I don't know anybody there. I'm living with my grandfather and my grandmother.

Speaker 12:         01:56:22       My grandmother was dying of an aneurysm. She had an aneurysm. They gave her 72 hours to live. She lived for 12 years. Okay. And I'm staying in their old house that they bought in 1945 and north New Jersey, which is now in a war zone. I mean, while I'm there, the next door neighbor's door gets broken down with a battering ram. They arrest him for selling crack. I mean, no joke, man. It was a scary, scary neighborhood. It used to be an italian neighborhood. Then it went just total total chaos. So I'm staying in the house and my grandma, like, she, she, she died. Both of them are dead now, but back then she um, she couldn't move. She was completely paralyzed. She would get bedsores and she could feel some things and sometimes she would just let out these soul, like almost like she was emptying herself of the pain and the only way to do it was to let out this horrible screech. So I'd be in the house and I'd be like wandering around, maybe I go to the kitchen and grab something to eat. And here

Speaker 12:         01:57:20       it was like an animal, like a wounded animal. She couldn't die. It just, she was so resilient. She had those italian peasant jeans and she was just so fucked up, but yet she hung in there for like 12 years. So I'm living in this house. Right. And I'd just broken up with my girlfriend and my manager, god bless him, great guy. But it was back in the day where we talked about like, when you're not doing so well then everybody has advice for you. And his advice was you should dress nice, like, you know, you're a good dress. Nice on stage. So my stupid ass, I'm wearing these like nice pants and a nice belt and like a club shirt that you would go out clubbing. And I had a nice head of hair back then. It was delicious and I'm wearing shiny shoes and shit.

Speaker 12:         01:57:59       And I just looked like the fucking biggest asshole. I just looked like some club, shithead, some goofy italian con. It's 22 years old. It doesn't know anything about the world. Right? And I'm onstage and, and I fucking, I am panicking. I remember brewer got off stage and the mc was good about to bring me up and I was off stage when brewer came up. And I remember he said, he said, hey, I fucked up that. How fun. They're great. And I go, I'm going to fucking eat it. And I remember saying it to him like, dude, I'm not fucking confident right now. I'm not feeling good right now. Oh, you'll be fine. You'll be fine. And I just, I just was not prepared. I just went up there and I went into flames. Just went into one girl. I remember what girl in the audit, she goes, I was just eating dick up there. And I was editing my material and chopping the jokes as I go along and one girl goes, you kinda hot,

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       but you're not funny. Oh. And there's nothing you can say when you know that that's true. Not that I'm kind of hot, but that I'm not funny in another guy goes, you're fucking suck. You fucking suck. He's just big meat heads, snap and nothing. I could say he was right. I fucking sucked. I knew I fucking suck. There was nothing I can do. And I was supposed to do 45 minutes. I wound up doing like 30. I got a few laughs. I started getting a few laughs, but there were so shaky. It was just the worst set ever, the worst bombing ever. And I still to this day, we'll go back in my head that fucking 20 years ago, that's my gig still to this day, the worst one I've ever had. And you'll go back and replay it over in your head. Okay. I could've said this, the heat that goes through your body when you're bombing, there's like, people don't understand when you're bombing, there's a, there's a hot flash.

Speaker 5:          01:59:26       You almost get hot flashes. So I'm having it. When the guy through the, the, the, the, that knocked me out of my aggression. When the chair came up onto the stage, I was like, okay, I'm not going to fight a crowd. And uh, and I gotta get the fuck out of here. The girl on the side of the stage that, that booked me is going to get off, get off. And I think this is, I was supposed to do like 40 minutes and I think I'm at 45 seconds or something or four minutes. I forget. It was so short. She's going to get off, get off. And I go, this is how badly I wanted the money. I go, where's my check? Oh my gosh, from the stage, but no one could hear me even with the microphone there. Bullying that loud. I just looked aside.

Speaker 5:          02:00:09       I go, where's my check? I go, I'm still getting paid. And she's like, yes, yes. And I went, no, I want to see the check. I want to make sure while you're onstage. And I always was under the impression like you have to do your time to get paid and they're getting me off before my time. So are they going to like not paying? So I want that $500 a month and I'm going. I was willing to stand up there for 35 minutes and take the abuse. I wanted the money so bad. And don't you think though that you learn so much about those, about your comedy from bombing? So that just like fall to me. Yeah, it's the ultimate school. Fuck you and I. Right. Then I said, uh, I go, uh, let me see the checks. And they went and got the check.

Speaker 5:          02:00:50       That's it. That's why I was up there four and a half minutes. They had to go get the check, come back and then you got off offstage. I get off stage and they rush me out the back door like people around me because they're afraid to riots going to start. We go up the back door, the stripper is waiting there and she smoking weed with a couple of guys out there and she goes, hey, where are you going? And I'm like, you didn't see what just fucking happened? She goes, yeah, that was some bullshit. And I'm like, so she can stick around though, you know, in bid on me. I go, are you fucking kidding me? Kidding me? Do you think they would have let it go? They were, the audience members would have forgot. I don't know she, but I got her phone number.

Speaker 5:          02:01:27       She gave me her phone number. She said, give me a call sometime and I get in the car. Do you remember? This is like 1997 or 98 that this happened or whatever. The guy drives me to the train station in a tr. Nice in it. In this little black triumph. Any so fucked up. He's been drinking so much rom and he's driving like 100 miles an hour and I'm going because he wants to get back and I'm like, dude, slow the fuck down. Slow the you're going to kill us. And he goes, man, you suck. He's like, you are terrible. And I'm like, shut the fuck up. And he's like, no man, like I've seen comedians. You're the worst I've ever seen. And he's driving me to the train station. Tell me how bad I am. And it was a black dude. Yeah. And I get on the train.

Speaker 5:          02:02:08       It was the most racist I've ever been in my life because I'm just looking at every black person, like blaming them for what happened. But I imagine it live in your whole life like that. But welcome to being black. I get home and at the time I was living with him constantly fucking with him. I mean, it was like the river I learned, right? That, that was a great learning experience. I get home, I'm living with my sister and uh, at the time, and this goes back to like answering machine time, like people had answered machines and the cell phone. Well I, I, I must've called street. I don't even remember calling the stripper, but I must've because my grandfather dies and we're on the way to my grandfather's funeral. We had already just done the viewing or whatever. When you go then from church and you go to the cemetery, we're going to the cemetery.

Speaker 5:          02:02:50       I'm in. My dad had one of those, like he had a cadillac I remember with a car phone built into the car. Nice. And my dad, my mom and like two of my sisters and me and uh, uh, my sister decides to check her voicemail, uh, the answer machine at home and puts it on speaker and she listens to the stripper and I swear to god it comes on and goes. It's like next message. Beep. Hi eddie. This is heaven because stripper. You met out at suny farmingdale itself, a stripper. I'm just returning your call.

Speaker 5:          02:03:28       My sister looks at me and goes at pap apps. Funeral dad's funeral. That's hilarious. That's great. Don't you? Don't you think though that you like your comedy makes these big leaps after these horrible, disastrous bombings? Yeah, you absolutely have to go through it. Check it, fired up. Even if I see like a bad review online, like I'll read 10 great reviews of like a show that I was at and then one guy says, I'm still waiting for my first love that. Can I just get like a little anxiety? Like, man, I got to work harder. But see I'm for one, like one bad one will. I think that shit's good for you. I really do. I'm different. I and I don't want to blow smoke up your ass, but I like I've said I need good comics to inspire me and I see so much shit comic and I saw you one night working out and I was like fuck, fuck. He's going deep. He's going deep and he's not afraid and he's fucking like when you're doing. The monkeys were just a bunch of monkeys on a rock spinning through and I'm like fuck. And I just went, fuck. I gotta go home and write, fuck, I look like one of those lights. Awesome. I said to you have to show I go fuck you. And I like had to hurry home and start like, just like. And I like to watch really good comp. Like I'm one of these comics

Speaker 12:         02:04:38       I love when I get to pick my middle act. I love to bring the best fucking comedian I can bring. Did I go on the road with joey diaz and does he just show ideas? Is the funniest guy that's ever walked the face. I've never laughed more at anybody ever in my life. Twenty three years of being a comic. Have you ever met anybody funnier than joey? I mean it's like a cartoon. He's just, he's just explosive with energy. Just makes you happy. You know? He just ridiculous. It makes you funny or two. He makes me funnier and funnier with our work with joe. That's how I feel better. And that's how Brian Mccarthy, I feel the same way. But what you said, like I saw dave chappelle once at the, at the comedy store and I felt the same way. I want to go home and write.

Speaker 12:         02:05:10       I'm totally inspired by great comics too. Like I saw louis at the, um, at the improv and hollywood, lucy kay and I wanted to go home and write. It was really great performance in norton recently I saw norton at the cap city and austin fucking great. And that same feeling I want to go right. But I also get inspired by people who don't like me. Yeah. Even fucking, you know, haters online. I can get a million people who love me. Dude is the greatest fucking show I've ever seen. Some amazing. And one person who's like, you know, fucking hang it up, streak two ufc. Oh, what bitch, you know, I'll get, I'll get like fired up to. I have to zone them, work harder. It gets good to zone them out. But it's good to be humble. I really believe. I mean, it's a bad feeling to have someone negatively critique your work.

Speaker 12:         02:05:52       It's a terrible feeling, but I think there's something to it that's good for an artist. There's something that keeps you sort of humble and balanced, especially in this either direct adulation relationship that you have with an audience. You know, you're immediately giving them what they want to hear and they immediately laugh and they tell you how much they love you. I mean, you can get imbalanced by that. You can get lazy. I mean, we both know comics had got fucking super, super lazy and one of the reasons is like, you know, they're not for whatever reason, there's not, there's not enough balance. You know, they just got to a point where it was too easy for them to many people being nice to them and they just, they lose it. Know chris rock once had a really important thing that I read where he's talking about how he bombed really hard.

Speaker 12:         02:06:31       What's going on after martin Lawrence Martin lawrence, which I did too, by the way, a bunch of times at the comedy store when I was a fucking. When I was on hardball to show that nobody ever saw on fox, I would go on after a lot of guys to comments are mitzi shore. God bless her. She did a tremendous amount for me early in my career and one of the things that she did for me, she always put me on the most devastating comedians in the night right on after them, like dice clay. I went off to dice clay 100 times. Richard pryor have to. Richard pryor when he was in a wheelchair when he couldn't even talk for five weeks. Every time martin lawrence would have a set. This is back when martin law into that tv show. He was all fucking destroy your. I'd never seen an aston martin either. Martin lawrence is in the back parking lot with an aston martin. I was like, what the fuck is this thing like me and a couple other comics like circling around. I was driving a volkswagen. Sure rocco. It's like scratching my chin. Like what the fuck is this man? This thing's crazy. And martin would just devastate the main room. I mean devastate when martin lawrence was in his prime, that guy does not get enough respect because if you go back and watch some of his old standup, he's just fucking

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       funny. And that show, martin do that shows that the writing was like nonexistent, but he carried the whole show with all his characters and he pretended to be women. He's fucking funny. I would be a backstage st just like the brewer night. I mean at least I had been past the brewer thing. Like it happened like a couple years before that. So I had recovered and I knew how to like get out of the gate strong because 90 percent black audience, you know, and I'm just ready to go on after him and he's crushing and then he's like, who's coming up next? You know, he has to bring me up. So martin lawrence brings me up, you know, he calls over to the piano guy. Piano guy says joe rogan. And he goes, all right, y'all give it up for this next comedian, mr joe rogan, very nice guy says, and I just go up and eat a bag of shit up.

Speaker 4:          02:08:19       Just a, a big manure bag that you would buy like at a fucking farm depot know, just filled with shit. I'm just chilling and people are getting up in droves and leaving. But all that stuff makes you way better. It makes you a way better comic because you realize you don't ever want to make that feel, that feeling. It's like you feel the fire behind your feet and it makes you run faster. Like you're only going to run a certain amount when you're not pushed that. No, I feel like it's funny. Like you said, sometimes I just go, I'm shit, I suck now, blah blah blah. But I don't realize that I don't have the ability to bomb like that anymore. I mean it can happen in a bad situation now. Like something really fucked up happening. But like I used to have to New York, you know, million times sde used to the seller.

Speaker 4:          02:09:02       She just wait and put you up after the hardest person to, to, to make sure you were ready for it. I had to tell forever, every night in the cellar and that's all I got so dark because patel would just. His jokes were so amazing and so dark to that. It was like I had to go to a darker place than him pick up the frequency where he leaves. And I remember just bombing so bad in the seller that I would just start, start just like, what's the fucking freestyling, just saying the worst things I could say like talking about killing babies and shit, like trying to get out of this horrible that I would just shock the fuck out of the audience and it never works. And it was like, that never worked. It was almost like if you go into a zone though of like, I'm going to pretend like they're not here and I'm just going to just keep saying this shit and hopefully they're going to come around because this is so painful.

Speaker 4:          02:09:52       I'm in this terrible, terrible bomb. But I mean I had, like I watched you on, what was it, a, any evening at the caroline's comedy hour. That's where I saw you first when I was like a little kid. I didn't even do comedy. And I'm like watching you and you were dirty. I remember you and sarah were on it and sarah was dirty and so he's a little kid. I'm like, these are good comics. These two, these are convenient. It was so hard for me back then. They even come up with seven minutes of material that I could do on tv. I would have to sit down and go over my shit. I was like, god, I can't do that bit. I can't do this, but I might have had an hour of material. I might have had five. I could do it. I couldn't imagine you bombing because of the way your act was like you had the competence and the dirtiness and everything.

Speaker 4:          02:10:29       So I was like, this guy can't bomb. It's not. So you probably a lot less bombs than I've had. Wow. Well, yeah. Was it. Well, you know, I've had a bunch man. I don't know about that. I don't know how many you've had, but especially the store. I had a gang of them in the early days when I was going on after, you know, like really good comics over and over and over again. I had a. I had a quite a few bombings. Yeah, but the early days were way worse. The open mic days were fucking brutal because you're really not supposed to be up there talking, you really not good enough. And then look, brian has been doing standup. He's been doing open mic nights just for a short period of time. So you're in that kind of zone area where you're learning it and figuring it out. You're in that stage of your life where sometimes, you know, I've seen you go on stage and you're trying out new joke and it just doesn't work and you're just fucked. You know, you're just stuck in this rut. You know, you're right there right now. Right.

Speaker 9:          02:11:21       Well, I had a horrible thing the other day where somebody I knew a was sitting in the front row and they thought, oh, this is awesome. I, you know, I, I could say talk to brian while he's on stage. He said the whole time she's just like, making me going like that, or she like I said something like, oh, I just broke up with my ex. I hate that bitch. And she's like, oh, whenever you're not over her. And like I said, it loud enough where like, it kept on like fucking me up and then it just throws you off and I felt it. I felt I felt way off my tracks, you know, but I didn't, I never feel. I haven't really felt like bomb.

Speaker 4:          02:11:55       Well you gave me anxiety so I had to go on afterwards and I was like, this bitch going to talk to me. Fuck. She going to talk to me too though? Yeah. But I don't want to. I don't want. I'd rather not. You know, people say, oh, you know, you're so good with hecklers. You must love it when people talk. Shit. No, I want everybody to have fun. I don't want to have to ruin someone's mind.

Speaker 9:          02:12:15       Bob hope joke. That one that talked a few times on the podcast before when I did that and I was booed and hissed. I took off comedy for five years

Speaker 4:          02:12:24       to find joe. Bob hope died. He goes to hear bob hope died. Yeah. They're going to fly out his body to entertain all the dead troops. That's great. It was the day he died though, and it was like during like, you know, after he got some orange and I say, what my favorite joke of yours is the one that you're doing right now, but your dog? He goes, uh, I have a bunch of cats and dogs from other relationships. It's like whenever we break up, I keep their cat, I keep the dog. He goes and they all have the same personality as the girls that I was dating. It's really funny, like all of them hate it when I come in their face. Now I break it down to each and chris white house from Australia. I think he's a kiwi, but he lives in Australia and he's really dark and really funny. Really good job. What's a kiwi? A new zealander and a. His name's chris. When he writes jokes, he writes a ton. He on twitter. He's right. I don't know his name on twitter, but he writes tons of jokes all the time. He did a joke about the crocodile hunter. The day the crocodile hunter died and somebody in the audience yells out too soon and he goes to soon. I would have done that joke on the fucking boat.

Speaker 4:          02:13:29       I said something about the crocodile hunter when he died and I actually felt bad about it and the reason why I felt bad about it, but some, you know, what I said was I go, he dies, I go, my act gains 10 minutes. I don't see the loss. That's what I wrote on a message board. And I just flippantly, you know, comics will say shit like that just to fuck with each other. Like have you ever done the open anthony show now? Never done great fucking show. And it's, everyone tries to say that like louis, c k will say the mean is shit to norton who will say the meaning shit to ob what they say, the mediumship active but it's not real. It's like you're trying to get laughs and someone said, you know, hey man, this guy has like a family and children with his children read that.

Speaker 4:          02:14:04       And I went, oh shit. And then I thought about it. I'm like, okay. I don't even really think that I don't even really believe that, and I was really mad at myself because I would have totally written a crocodile hunter bit if it wasn't for the fact that I felt bad that I wrote that I said that, which was our very short sighted and it wasn't really even funny. It was just like a quick, easy, cheap like jive. And I thought about it. I said, god damn it, I fucked myself out of a good crocodile hunter because for sure that's like right up my alley, you know, like I'm fucking. No one's more fascinated by predatory animals than me. And when a dude who fucks with animals his entire career, look it. When a guy like that fucking gets killed by an animal, I mean there's a, there's a fucking wealth of material there.

Speaker 4:          02:14:47       I said in earlier in Australia, I said before he died, uh, I watched the show. I go, I mean, they all think America loves the crocodile hunter. They think we all do, but it wasn't like, because they're not as into them as we are. Really. No, not at all. They all kind of think he's a freak and they're not that australians have a thing about australians who become famous somewhere else. It's called tall poppy syndrome. They, uh, they try to cut down the tall flower you because jeffrey's was pissed because he would go back to Australia and people wouldn't buy tickets to a show, you know? He's like, I've got a fucking. Hbo is bash it. It's my worst. Jeffrey, he doesn't have a lot to complain about right now. Things are going great, but the eye, my joke was, I'm watching the show. I go, I admit I watch the show and I watch it every day.

Speaker 4:          02:15:31       Hoping every day will be that day since it's gonna happen, you know, you put your head in fucking crocodile's mouth now. And then when he died it was like a funny joke. Everyone used to laugh at it. Then when he died, my, my agent over in Australia call me, he goes, mate, you're fucked. I go, what? He goes, they're playing your clip on the radio. And I was like, oh no. So they were playing it like these two, like a discharge djs were playing at this one station. They thought it was kind of funny just playing my bid over and over. So I got. I thought, oh, this is fucking. I'm dead in America. You know, I would have been, had gone into hiding. Yeah, me like, mate, you're fucking, you're fucking champion. May hilarious. And I was like, I want to go to Australia more. These guys are fucking cool fun man. You know what? I love the color legend champion and a legend that sit in england all the time. Your legend, the legend. Your legend mate. Alright, speaking of legend, before we get out of here, I got it. I found the bill o'reilly thing and I got to read it because it's so ridiculous.

Speaker 12:         02:16:30       Then when everything about bill o'reilly, no matter what you think about his opinions, this is what you need to know and this is some, some fucking voicemail that he left from some woman. Her name was andrea charisse and she sued him for sexual harassment and this is what he goes. You would basically be in the shower and then I would come in and you would have your back to me and I would take the loofa thing and kind of soap up your back, rub it all over you, get you to relax hot water and um, you know, you'd feel the tension drain out of you and you'd still be with your back to me. And then I would kind of put my arm. It's one of those myths, one of those loofa mints, you know, so I got my hand in it and I would put it around in front, kind of rubbed your, tell me a little bit within and then my other hand would start to massage your boobs, get your nipples really hard because I like that.

Speaker 12:         02:17:20       And you have really spectacular boobs. So anyway, I'd be rubbing your big boobs and getting your nipples really hard, kind of kissing your neck from behind. And then the other right? Yes it is. And then I would take the other hand with the falafel thing, the falafels. I don't know what that means and just put it on your pussy and. But you'd have to do it real light, just kind of a tease business. What a fucking goofy like any chick is going to hear that and go, oh yeah, I was just thinking it was going to get off on this shit. Old broken people trying to romance her. I'm like, can I choke you? And delirious jewish food. Falafel apples. Yeah, middle eastern food. But I don't think that's what he meant was sloppy with some hummus and falafel thing and that's not what you meant. Chefs and cheap phase up here. You just used the wrong word. Maybe I dunno, but that's it. Understand that this is the kind of human being you're dealing with and all this shit that you see on the fucking in the public guys. Just nonsense. You know? It's just what we said before, that people, when they become famous and they get adulation, they start all of a sudden believing the bullshit. They believe their own hype. It's step one to to losing it all like r kelly and it's fuckin xuesong. You got that bitch.

Speaker 5:          02:18:32       Yeah. You want to play at the end. We can cut it out the very end. Yeah, let's cue it up. Cue it up and we'll play it at the very end. Do you know the angelica houston? I think he heard that. Said it. She goes, uh, uh, I go by the motto. Never pick it up. Never put it down. Like, if you don't take the adulation, you can't take the criticism, like focus on yourself. Don't focus on like what other people say. And I try to do that because if I can get on people, but when you walk out of a show and people, you're great, you're great. What do you know? That's just your opinion because you're going to hear you suck too. Right? And so that way I don't take the. You're great. You're, I just go. Oh thanks. But I don't let it soak in because otherwise

Speaker 12:         02:19:07       what I like, I like hearing we had a great time. I don't want to hear your great. I mean, if you think that. Thank you very much. Um, I'm trying, I'm working hard. Keep going. I do it all for whoever likes to see the comedy. That's what I'm doing it for. I mean that's you, I think you, you, you alter your motivation as you get older and as you get more successful and as you kind of get a better understanding of what you're doing. Like as an artist. And I think initially I just wanted to get laughs. I just wanted to, for me, I wanted to prove that I could be good at this. I wanted to get some success. I wanted it, I wanted to do it for me. But then once you get the success, then it has. You have to change your, your, your rational or your um, rather your motivation has to change and it has to become, in order to stay good and to stay relevant you have to, it has to become about the art.

Speaker 12:         02:19:52       You have to be obsessed with creating good stuff. You have to be obsessed with doing something that people are going to enjoy. Those pops of brilliance when a new bit comes to light in. Did you go through a change though? Because I remember like when I watched you when I was younger and I was like, oh I liked you because at that point in my life I was into like island here, like tits and ass and fucking pussy and that's to me you were that kind of comic and evening at the improv was guys with their sleeves rolled up going what's the deal with and you, you're gone, you know, fuck that pussy and a while I was a savage. And then you think about how I got into standup comedy. I was a fucking kickbox. But then you changed. Now you do this kind of intellectual type material that's like, you know, like what you talked about now.

Speaker 12:         02:20:30       Well when I was 21, I'm still have a million dick jokes. But when I was 21 I had nothing to say about anything else. I had no opinions. I had no opinions on society. I had no opinions on life. I didn't think about religion at all except it scared me because I went to catholic school when I was little. All I thought about when I was 21 and was pussy, that is all I was a fucking savage. That's all I thought about. I was here. I was a former martial arts teacher and fighter who is now a professional comic and I was making my living working in bars and doing standup and trying to make girls like me. I mean that's what I was doing. Yeah. And all I was obsessed with. Yeah. And all I was obsessed with was fucking. And people would say that to me like your act is all about sex and is your act all about sex?

Speaker 12:         02:21:11       Um, because I'm fucking 22 and my hormones are blasting inside of my body, like a broken fire hydrant, slamming against the walls of my heart. Like what are you talking about? That's all I'm thinking about. I don't know. Anything else? I had no opinions. I could say sex jokes onstage and people could laugh. You know? Why? Because these are things that I was actually thinking about. So I had actual humorous points of view on it and people would say, well, you're acting so dirty. Well, am I supposed to not talk about what I'm obsessed with? Should I talk about what you're obsessed with? I, I guess I should have balanced. It did go through a long time where, you know, especially if I do like a half an hour set, it was too much. Sex talk was like, it was like enough already, dude, you knew me, you must have something else, you know, how many come shot jokes can you have, you know, but it's, as I got older then I started, you know, looking at the world and you know, then you know, actually thinking about things and then actually forming opinions and you know, and it can deeply considering those opinions before I ever thought about taking them to the stage.

Speaker 12:         02:22:07       And then I had opinions about things for years and years before I ever tried to like put them in a humorous situation. It's just a matter of developing as a human being. But you know, as your motivation changes and as your perception changes, I mean it's just, you, you just mature, you grow, you think about things differently. But as your audience, your, your, your ufc audience,

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       the guys that are like mma guys and like that kind of stuff, are they on the same mindset as you now with your customers

Speaker 12:         02:22:33       cereal? Or you'd be amazed, first of all about ufc fans. The first of all, the broad spectrum of fence. There's some fucking brilliant intelligent ufc fans. I've met some people in the mixed martial arts business, whether they're trainers or competitors or you know, people who just do it, you know, as a hobby or involved in a management aspect. Fucking brilliant people who are huge fans of the sport, you know, I met a bunch of them are really like the guys who own the ufc there. Fucking smart people, man. They're not caveman. I mean dana white's crazy and he swears a lot stuff, but he's a fucking really introspective, like a very considerate and compassionate person. Like these guys like dana white recently saved some Thailand girl. There was a girl who needed to, like, I believe it was liver surgery and she, she was the daughter of a trainer at tiger moitai.

Speaker 12:         02:23:18       Somebody put a thread about it on the underground and this girl is going to die unless she gets this surgery within the next eight weeks. Dana white fucking paid for all of it. You know, he's like one of those guys. He's not an asshole. He's not a meathead, you know, he's a. He's a really good dude. Well I guess people that, you know, everybody looks at like cage fighting fans and they think, oh, they must be assholes with skulls on their shirts. A lot of them are, but a lot of martin and even in the assholes with skulls and their shots, they can be lead. They can all be. Everybody can look at things in a more compact, more fun, friendly.

Speaker 5:          02:23:47       Well I'd imagine that like cage fighters to themselves or kind of perfectionist kind of guys. And then like, what was that thing? I texted you one day and asked you about the quote about if you can do one thing, well you can do me a moto massage you. That's why I got this tattoo. See that shit is because I find sashi versus a tiger like those that I do that crossfit stuff and all the guys I do crossfit with our obsessive compulsive and very intellectual, uh, you find these guys are great athletes and you would think they're just dumb fucking, you know, can climb a rope and fucking power lift, you know, deadlift 500 pounds, but you start finding out they know everything about nutrition and then everything about this and then it goes to supplant transcendent. People are not disciplined, right? Dumb people can work hard if they're like in a football camp and the coach is screaming at you every day or you know, if you have to, you know, what you're in the army or something like that.

Speaker 5:          02:24:33       But when you have to motivate yourself to go to the gym and you have to motivate yourself to buy the proper nutrition and that takes intelligence, it takes a certain amount of discipline. Yeah. So I've seen that these mixed martial arts I've said, because I would say that them, the guys that, that do fight and are really into it are probably good fans that really get all your material and, and get into like the intellectual shit. But I'm thinking like the average guy, wwf foam and goes, hey, I just want to see some broken blood. This. Does he come to your show and be like, don't be a dick joke.

Speaker 12:         02:25:03       There's that. But you know what man, I, I make sure I try very hard to make sure that my jokes are first and foremost funny. You know, whatever my point of view is on something. It has to be, it has to be digestible to a lot of people. But there's some weird shit that I might think. It's funny that if I had an audience audience filled

Speaker 5:          02:25:19       with, you know, only like guys like you or dunk in or you know,

Speaker 12:         02:25:24       someone who's like a very smart person that's, you know, of a certain age. I could talk to about almost anything I would do different materials. It was just you guys, you know, but to an audience full of a bunch of people. First of all, I want everybody to have fun. You know, I want, I want like a, a julius fun, festive atmosphere. I want, I want, I wanted to be like an hour long party, you know, and the party filled with ideas and thoughts and then you know that I'm not coming from coming from a place of ego. I'm not a egomania I'm, I'm, I'm calling for a place to just, let's just figure this out. Let's try to put this all together. It's not me, it's not about me. It's about these ideas. It's about fun. It's about having a good goddamn time up there.

Speaker 12:         02:26:01       So it's the ideas. But I've got a lot of weird shit. My act about time travel and the large hadron collider and there's like, there's some shit that, there's some songs. Sometimes when I'm on stage I go, god damn, I'm taking these motherfuckers don't fucking twisty road here. I hope there with me no hope there with me when the punchlines come because there might've been like, you know, after five minutes of large hadron collider rant when I get to the end, they're like, what the fuck is he talking about? You know, people are taking notes. I better go home and read about this shit. I think, you know, I initially I sort of, you know, did comedy just to try to get labs and this is what I always say that there's like a bunch of different stages of comedy. I think the first age that you do anything you can to get a laugh, you know, I mean, I'm sure you've said that some hacky lines in your life that you're not lost about.

Speaker 12:         02:26:43       I mean I look back the last time, I think in 1997 or 90. No earlier than that. I was on newsradio though. It was like 95, 96. I told some woman, hey, I don't come to your job and slap the dicks out of your mouth. I can't believe I still use that. Like in 90 I used it one time. It was in montreal at the comedy works. Some chick said something right after. I said, I'm like, man, really? You didn't even dig into your bag. You just grabbed the most obvious stupid hacky law. I still think about that to this day. You know? I think initially you're just trying to get laughs and then once you get good then it goes from what makes me laugh, you know? Instead of just trying to make anybody laugh with like a tool, like I have a hammer, look at my hammer, I'm going to hit the nail dong.

Speaker 12:         02:27:23       Then it becomes your perspective. It's like becomes, you know, this is that, this actually is funny to me, and then it becomes how do you make someone laugh with your opinions on things like what, what are your unique points of view that you can somehow or another turn into comedy. So to me there's like been three stages in my life. The first stage was just say anything. Even if you didn't believe in it. I said a lot of stupid shit about, about gay people, about whatever the fuck I was, if I thought it would work, you know, to me it was like, is this a brick? Can I kill a rat with it? Let's kill her at, you know, it was just a tool. I think I followed your model and I'm just, you know, years behind you doing the same thing where it's the analogy, good analogy. Hired was golf. They said when you learn to golf, just fucking hit the ball as far as you can fucking hit it and then hone your swing and bring it in instead of trying to hit it right. And then trying to hit it far so like try to kill it first. Try to learn how to kill and once you kill you'll get all that confidence and you'll never be scared and then hone it in the good,

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       you know, really creative, interesting jokes with your point of view. But you can't go out there initially with that. Some guys probably have, they try, but they seem so pretentious and especially when you're 20 and you're breaking down the government police shut the fuck up. Yeah, please go get hit in the head by a ball, you know, please get punched. You know, go, go do something. We develop some character to talk about this off air. Someone who does that. Right. I'm sure there's a lot of people will do it. Just, you know, you want to be somebody, man. You want to be. Bill hicks, you know is a great fucking lana punchline. One of the great clubs you ever worked there. One of the best jobs on country. Fucking fantastic club. Anyway, the atlanta punchline has a, a back room, like a green room and it's got a bunch of shit written on the wall and one thing that I took a picture of a, put it on my mobile log back when I had a mobile log.

Speaker 4:          02:29:06       I've got to find it. It must be on my. It said it's quit trying to be hicks fragment. You started the at friend. Oh, okay. Well go check that shit up.
