Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Push the sucker right up. Close three, two, one. And we're live.

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       What's happening man? How are Ya? I'm cool man. There in La to meet you in person. I've seen in magazines seen you since man. But like when, when did you first burst onto the bodybuilding scene? What year was that?

Speaker 1:          00:00:22       Oh, is it reminiscent today? First Time I came out here was 1992 golds gym. So I came from UK to do my first professional bodybuilding contests was called night of champions in New York and I got second place there and made a real big impact. And the weeder company that used to be based out here with a flex magazine and muscle and fitness right down the street. They used to be. I don't think they are now.

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       Closed down. There's a fence around it and everything, but that's, that's less than a mile away from here.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       Yeah. The, the weeder officers are out there and you know, we though it was a, it was a big name and bodybuilding, the magazines and everything. So they flew me out here, did my first photo shoot at Gold's gym? Nineteen 90. So 27

Speaker 2:          00:01:02       and I remember watching you in those magazines. You were the first guy, well, you know what were the first guy, but you were one of the first guys that I ever saw in a magazine that it was like, gee, how the fuck is that a person? You were so big, man Christ you were big. That's funny. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:18       Because I look back at some of the pitches now me and I say what the fuck, you know, it's um, and I came into the sport and I wanted to see what I could do. I want it to like take it as far as it could take it, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:01:35       Well, you represented to me as an outsider looking in this insane determination, you know, like I've, I felt like all the best guys, whether it was arnold or you or Lee Haney, all the top guys, they always represented not just like the biggest and the most profoundly ridiculously muscular bodybuilders, but also this extreme dedication that was required to reach that level.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       Been around minute with martial arts and everything. And it kind of sport is the same thing. What separates the guy that's first from second, from third or whatever, you know, you all got certain physical characteristics that help you in your sport and so on. So you're all gifted up there. So what can separate the guy from first and second and third? It's, it's all up there. That's, that's the key.

Speaker 2:          00:02:22       How did you develop your mindset? Was it something that you always had or was it something that you developed as you were training?

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       I think there's something already already had and I kind of left home when I was 16, so it was out on my own on the street and uh, you know, you're either going to get smart and, you know, look after yourself or you're going gonna fall down. There's nobody there to catch me. So that was there from a, from an early age I think. And uh, I was just very determined to, to this thing that I will be good at in order to change my life and change, you know, uh, the projection of my life for the people around me. Um, I always grew up on a housing estate in the UK. I no education,

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       I was in a jail when I was 18, so I had all that. That was, you know, the people around me. I was like, I didn't want part of that future. I wanted to do something else and I got this thing that was good at, so I'm going to take it and run with it, you know, it's crazy how many people have similar stories like that where they were in just a terrible environment and they realized that they had a tough enough, they had a smart enough and they had to get out of there and if not for those terrible situations, who knows if they would have ever reached the levels of greatness that they can tell you from our point of view, I don't think I would have done because I would be too comfortable. If you're comfortable, you're not going to put yourself through that extreme kind of pressure and pain.

Speaker 3:          00:03:37       And uh, you know, I wanted to improve my life, changed my life and uh, through the sport. Here I am sitting talking to you on this show. People are listening to me. I've been all around the world thanks to my sport. So it's been great for me. You know, when you meet current bodybuilders, are they like, hey man, what the fuck? I couldn't be. Not a gigantic huge Mr Hawkins your regular size athletic looking dude. Yeah. Not really. Maybe some of the younger guys that are coming into this now, but you know, people know me. Um, I was a professional bodybuilder. That's what I did and I was the best at doing that, but that kind of training and that kind of physique is not going to serve me now. So I do training to be more functional. My goals are more health related now. Whereas before I was a young guy and I want it to be the best at this thing I was doing.

Speaker 3:          00:04:25       I put everything into that. Um, but you know, that kind of physique. It's not practical for everyday usage. You know, how to tie my shoelaces when it was 300 pounds. I'm sure. Man. And how tall are you? Five. 10, five, 11, five. 11. So like when you were that big, you were just a ball of muscle. Just a mass. Yeah. And 300 pounds. I was 300, 3:10 in the off seasons. Christ competing to 65, but I mean to 65. Lean as fuck the hydrated, you know, shared it. So yeah, that's, that's all I did. That was all I did. I trained, I eat asleep. I studied. That's just my mental focus was like lasered on that thing that was doing nothing else. I wouldn't go to the movies, I wouldn't go to dinner if I got home after 11 because I got to be in a bed at 11.

Speaker 3:          00:05:16       That was, that was the regime that are live for, for many years and that's why I was able to beat other people that maybe it could be argued they were more gifted than me, but they weren't willing to do that. So that's, that's what it's all about. Yeah. That's what I had always read about you. And that's what I did. Like I said, there was the impression that I always got like, what you represented is the pinnacle of extreme dedication. Yeah. And study, you know, um, we had no internet then. Everybody's got coaches now and nutritionists. The thing that appealed to me is this was an individual thing. I had to learn about the training, had to learn about the nutrition, how to learn all this stuff myself. And that was, apart from the training, that was part of it as well, you know, the learning part of it I enjoyed.

Speaker 3:          00:06:00       Was it hard to get good information because I'm sure there's a bunch of like gym experts, there's always these bro science guys that are hanging around giving you shitty advice, like how hard was it to get the proper information when it came to the training. I kind of sifted through it and uh, was very influenced by a guy called Arthur Jones. Don't know if you've heard of him, but off Jones he invented the Nautilus machines. And uh, this guy was like a billionaire self made billionaire who's just was fascinated with the bodybuilding but had no business interest in it. So he just wanted to know. He studied it and it was like, what is it that causes muscle growth? What is it? And um, he found it was the intensity of exercise and then there was another bodybuilder might men, so went to compete in the Mr Olympia when the Mr Universe, he took those principles and who used them and so I read all this stuff and it was very logical, it made sense.

Speaker 3:          00:06:51       And then I try to own the gym and it worked in the gym and if I trained more often or if I did more in the gym, my progress was slow down or stop. As soon as I cut back and I made the workout shorter and more intense, my progress went. So it was for me, it was pretty early on. I learned how to train properly and that's why I was competing. I competed on a world championship after 18 months training, which is pretty much unheard of. That is pretty much unheard of now. When you say shorter, more intense workouts, how did you regulate that? Like that is, that's a huge issue with martial artists is overtraining or they want to do more work than everybody else. They want to work harder than everybody else and they want a break in their body down and showing up for the fight.

Speaker 3:          00:07:31       Exhausted. Overtraining is a big thing. Yeah, and if you see the process for muscle growth is you go in the gym and it put stress on the muscle. If you put stress that is not used to, then it's going to react. You're going to get growth, but you need to recover from that first. You don't go to the gym and grow and then recover later. That's the way it works. You Go, if you've, you know, you give your body some stresses not used to, you'll get a reaction, but before we get the reaction, you have to recover. So if you're not allowing enough time to recover, you're just. I use this analogy, a seminars I do. It's very simplistic, but it gets the point across. If you get a bit of sandpaper and you rub it across the palm of your hand and it's kind of bloody.

Speaker 3:          00:08:12       If you leave it and let it heal up, what's going to happen? The skin's gonna develop back a little bit stronger, a little bit thicker than before because it wants to protect against that stress. So that's the process, but if you go and you might get hand bloody and before it's healed up again, you're going and rub it again. What's happening? You're not really getting any way. Just going to have a bloody hand. You know, you think you're being tough, but you're actually just being silly. Yeah. And it's a why are you going to the gym? Right? I'm going to the gym to get results, so I'm going to do whatever it takes to get results and if it means training 30 minutes once a week or it means training 10 hours a day every day, whatever it takes. I was willing to do it and I would have done it, but I'm training 10 hours a day is not going to build your muscle. It's just going to burn out. So I was doing average 40 5:50 minute workouts probably four times

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       a week. And everybody say, oh, that's it. Whether I write on a piece of paper, what the fuck is that? That's nothing, man. I'm like, okay, well come and do it. Come and do it and tell me if you want to do more when we're finished and nobody has ever said, oh, please come and do some more. They're like, that's it. That's enough because every set by the warmup sets you've got to warm up and, you know, to be safe and everything. But the set, the real sets, so I call them, we're going to go to absolute failure and even beyond with forced reps, with assistant as reps, maybe extra negative reps, which is, um, something that most people neglect when they lift weights, they think, you know, I've lifted it. All right, well let it go down. I've lifted it, but they're neglecting the lowering part of the weight and the negative.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       So I get people to really slow that down. So you're taxing that part as well. And even at the end of the sit on some exercises with machines where it's practical. So you know, you can't curl anymore physically on the positive, on the contraction, what your strength on the lowering is greater. So if you did curls and you failed, I could lift the weight to the top for you and you could lower it down for probably another three Reps. so if you'd just gone to failure here, you wouldn't have exhausted the negative part of the Rep. so my thing is the exhaust, everything, it's totally fucked. You can't live, you can't lower it, you can't lift it, it's total failure if you do that once and an exercise and then time to move on to another exercise. How did you develop your protocol? Just trial and error.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       Trial and error. And you know, I didn't invent this system of training as I said, people there before me, Arthur Jones might mentor, I just taught what they did and refined it a little bit more for a competitive bodybuilder because Arthur Jones wasn't competitive bodybuilder. People who trained weren't so his, his routines were even briefer than mine. But for a bodybuilder, you know, you've got, you've got to work the side, Dell, you've got to work different aspects. So, uh, I'd probably did a little bit more than they did. Um, so I adapted it to myself and my needs

Speaker 4:          00:10:48       now when you were at your height and when you're 265 pounds shredded and dehydrated and then 310 pounds in the off season you got, it must be like used to looking at yourself like that. Like was it hard to adapt to being me? You still obviously a very fit guy, but you're a normal size. Like if I saw you I'd be like there's a normal fit guy. Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       That's what I want to be in A. I'm not training for bodybuilding because it's not what I want to do now. Plus I got a lot of injuries from a low super heavyweight. So I did, I got a torn rotator cuff which is not. I've tried out a couple of surgeries on that doesn't repair. So you know, I was trying to lift weights and continue to do and what I do because that's what I'm used to doing. Right, right. And when you're familiar with doing something that you're reluctant to change to something else, but I noticed my shoulder is getting a bit worse and my hips were getting, you know, I'm like, hold on, is this serving me now? Why am I doing this? Am I doing this just to try and maintain something for other people what they think I should look like? And I kind of came to the conclusion, yeah you are because you're not, you're not a bodybuilder in the morning, not competing.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       So if during this training is not really benefit and humans maybe making your injuries worse, you know, when, when you're 60 or something, you're going to like lift your arms up or something like that. So I'm thinking more practically. And um, I started doing yoga and I really fell in love with it. It's amazing, isn't it? Yeah, it's amazing. It's physically, it's amazing. I got much more range of motion mobility and then you've got the spiritual aspect of as well. So I'm actually the. I was inspired to do yoga from a DMT trip predator, a dmt trip. And I came back and I was like, my body's all fucked up this thing, right? Like I gotta fix some stuff here. What should I do? And I didn't even, I vaguely knew what yoga was, but I didn't really know what it was. And I got to do something. Got To do yoga or Tai Chee, I don't know what it is, but I started looking into it and then found a yoga teacher. And I do that a couple times a week. I find it's great. Every time I do it I just think I should do more on this morning. And I got up this morning and did yoga class at 8:00, Gold's gym and you know, on an empty stomach, just had some water and some tea and I fucking feel amazing or that from that. Well, it just,

Speaker 2:          00:13:05       to me it feels like it connects everything. It connects all the tissue from the back to the legs to the arms and the neck and the core. It strengthens all the connecting stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       Yeah. And you get a flow going around. That's the thing with bodybuilding, because bodybuilding, you're isolating the muscles right? So you're isolating your bicep, you're isolating the tricep, isolating the deltoids and putting stress on those muscles to maximize the muscle size of those individual muscles, which is great for bodybuilding. But uh, your body's function like that, you know, if you throw something, you throw a punch or you know, you don't use one muscle, use the sea, you know, sits chain affects your whole body, works together and bodybuilding. You don't really do that, you don't learn to do that. So that's what I've had to relearn, you know. So when you exercise today, like what kind of stuff do you do besides yoga? I do yoga a do some cycling. I live in Spain, we've got some good hills there. So I do because I like to push them and I can't push the whites anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       I can't get in that zone, you know, because because of my injuries, so I got to do something else. Yoga is a challenge, you know? And it continued to be like if I do that until I'm dropped down dead 80 years old, there's always more that I can do. You know, you can always do a bit more range or a bit more difficult pose. So there's no, there's no ceiling there, you know, uh, with the bodybuilding I already been on the ceiling. Yeah. You know, um, I do cycling couple of times a week up and down the hill, so that's like, you know, it's got almost like intervals because you do a hill, it's intense and then you go flat and it's a bit easier. So I enjoy doing that. You move to Spain? Um, well I lived in UK and I started visiting Spain because in Spain, the south coast of Spain.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       He's got a very brick, a British community there and the weather is amazing. It's like La Mar Bayer is like, for me it reminds me a lot of la, but a mini la without all the bullshit and the traffic about the crime and all that kind of stuff. Uh, so that's why, that's why I moved there. Oh, that's nice. Have you ever looked into anything for your shoulder, like stem cells or things on them? No, I had, um, there was a new surgery now because what happened, I tore my supraspinatus a couple of times and because the end was badly frayed there to chop off the end, so now it doesn't really bridge the gap to the Humerus, so it needs a bridge and apparently there's a new surgery that they can, uh, make a bridge now. Um, but I went to see a surgeon and he's like, okay, what's three issues here?

Speaker 1:          00:15:34       Pain, you have pain. I'm like, no, I'm not really have range of motion. Actually I got more range than the other shoulder was a bit loose. Um, so the only issue with mine is strength and stability and he wasn't able to give me 100 percent on whether the surgery would do that for me. And I've had a bad six surgeries. I had a tendon reattachment here about three on the shoulder, had the hips and I'm like, you know what, unless you're going to tell me a hundred percent that going through the inconvenience and pain of a surgery is going to give me what I need, then I'm not going to do it. I'm just going to cope with this and I can't venture risk, but so what, like, you know, it doesn't really matter that much to me. You can, you do pushups or I can do some pushups but probably like 10 where before I'd do like 100 or something so it's very weakened in stable.

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       So yeah, if. Sure, if, if I had a surgeon that says to me, listen man, we're going to do this and I guarantee your shoulders going to be stronger and more stable after it because you know, you've got to sit with you in a sling for like six to eight weeks. You can't shower properly, can't dress and in and all this stuff. So for me to go through that again, I would have to have like, yeah, this is definitely going to help. Then I would consider it until then I'll live with it. You know, they're doing some pretty amazing stuff now with stem cells. Yeah, there with some tendon tissue. So

Speaker 2:          00:16:53       yeah, they can do a lot of soft tissue regeneration. They're also doing it now. The most recent things. They're combining stem cells with platelet rich plasma that doing it together and they found that by doing the stem cells in the prp together, it helps generate new tissue growth better.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       Yeah. No, my wife, she had a knee surgery and she had the PRP and the recovery was real quick. So yeah, it's nice it she had meniscus, is that what it was? Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, if there's any surgeons out there that repair Dorian's shortened supraspinatus, let me know, man.

Speaker 2:          00:17:21       Now is your situation very similar to what a lot of bodybuilders face after they retire? They just, they're so much stress and strain on the joints in the back and.

Speaker 1:          00:17:32       Yeah. Well I'm Ronnie Coleman, who is the Mr Olympia after me and he said be serious. He did a lot of really heavy squatting, which also when he was getting ready for a bodybuilding competition and basically doing power lifting, which probably not a good idea. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       so ron has a lot of problems with his discs in his back and I'm not sure of all the details, but I know he's had a lot of fusions. So his mobility and so on is going to be limited. And one fusion. Yeah, several. So he can't turn his neck and his back to good. And is that both of his hips replaced? Oh, Jesus Christ. He's a young guy to hold. Was Ronnie's? No, no run is like almost my age is probably early fifties. Yeah. Why do I think he's younger than that? He retired. I'm thinking should I said 4,636? He did. We both were known to be very strong running more so than myself because they did power lifting before. So we moved some heavy weights and uh, you know, any sport man is that you're going to have some consequences. Yeah. No To ron if you fight and play football, whatever and everything has its, you know, its downside.

Speaker 3:          00:18:41       But all things considering I think I'm doing pretty good. I'm healthy and you know, I got a dicky shoulder. So big deal. It's okay. Yeah. I'm telling you man, if you just hang in there, they're on their way to figuring something out for that. Yeah, that's, that's almost what I'm thinking. I'm thinking like don't do anything now because a few years time there'll be something that can really do the job. So yeah, I'll wait until then. Yeah. The last thing you want to do is get something. Like, I always tell that to my friends that are thinking about getting disks fused and like, you know, they're so close. They're shooting. They're shooting stem cells into the discs directly in regenerating tissue the same way they've been regenerating municipals, tissue and tendon tissue and things along those lines. I met a guy that trained out here many years ago in La and he told me they were an I've seen before and after x rays of joints that are the joints destroyed.

Speaker 3:          00:19:30       He's got no cartilage, so looking at replacement and these guys have actually regenerated the tissue back, but it's quite a lengthy process of traction, like hanging upside down and hours of ultrasound just to push a ton of blood into that area. Blood Supply and then you can heal it up. You can actually regrow cartilage tissue, but it's not. Um, it's not quick. It's not on the protocol of the Medical Association. So they basically push these guys out of business with lawsuits. Well, you know, there's a doctor that we've talked about on the podcast before that recommends hanging from a bars for your shoulders. It's one of the best things ever to alleviate pain and also to increase range of motion and reduce impingements. Well, I'll have to get in touch with this guy. Yeah. Well just for my, for my back, I got the inversion table and I do that a couple of times a week just to keep them ability there. I know one of my discs, l five five's a little bit warm, but I don't do squats or heavy overhead stuff, so I think it's going to be okay. But yeah, I still, you know, it's all about prevention. Have you heard of the reverse hyper machine? Have you seen that? No. No. We have one in the back. I'll show it to you, but it's a creation of a west side barbell. You know Louie Simmons, crazy bastard. Yeah. Louie Simmons created this machine that when you lift your legs up, it strengthens back and on the

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       down. When it swings down, it's active decompression, phenomenal for disc issues. It's like active decompression plus strengthening together. I have one back here. I love it so much. Right there is like this. You could see it up here. It's. We've talked about this so many times people would think this guy is like hired me to endorse this product, but it's an amazing product. That is. Yeah. It's the reverse of the hyperextension la, so he can explain it.

Speaker 5:          00:21:12       Can hear the range of motion at the top. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Really? She drops her head. Raise your hand. Way Up. Drops on the way down for a flagship in extension is fine. This will absolutely help desk. This is traction. Motion Traction, and got one of those

Speaker 4:          00:21:38       wife very fit, so I'm sure she does a lot of lifting as well. So that was a world champion as well. Enough failed. You know, it's so common for anybody that puts any strain in their body to have usually five l and l, four area on the. On the bottom of the spine, one of the things about bodybuilding is that in isolation, when you're, you're constantly isolating these things, does that run the risk of like a weakening certain areas? Like you have to be? I would imagine very cognizant about balancing everything out.

Speaker 1:          00:22:08       Um, I think, uh, like with bodybuilders, a shoulder injuries is the most common because you've got the rotator cuff which is a small muscles and tendons which gives you the ability. That's why it can move it around rather than being a hinge. Um, so what happens, you know, you get an strongly at altschool, all these external muscles are getting bigger and stronger, but these guys inside I'm not. So eventually they get overloaded and you get some kind of issue there, some kind of tear. So when I'm training people now I give them a rotation exercises to strengthen those areas so that can avoid that. But Hey man, I started training. The eight is like we didn't know anything and when I got an injury and are living in England as well, there's no sports medicine doctors dealing with strength athletes or so on. And so I just go to your doctor and he's like, how do you do that? Lifting weights, stopped doing that shit. Why you left their wives, take these pills and that's, you know, so, so now we have much more information, much more, you know, a sports therapist and so on. So there's a lot more things available now and a lot more knowledge and information that we didn't really have back then. You know, that's, that's the main thing, you know, collect some of the smallest supporting muscles. I think when you're doing major bodybuilding exercises,

Speaker 4:          00:23:25       do guys now address that? Do they do like a lot of rotation exercises? A lot of rotation

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       in the gym than like, you know, if it did that back in the eighties, people like what the fuck you're doing little wait time, lift some weights. But I see people doing it now and with the bands and everything. So yeah, people doing more preventative stuff. It's fascinating

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       because there was guys like arnold who was kind of the original pioneers and then guys like you who came after him, but you were still again, pre-internet, figuring things out on your own, learning from the guys that came before you, but taking it to another level,

Speaker 3:          00:24:00       that was the beauty of it for me. I never really liked team sports because I just felt like this I sold was letting me down here, you know, and I felt like that through my life as well. I felt like, like my parents didn't really, you know, like everyone's fucking letting me down. Fuck this, I'll do this myself. And so I got to learn about the nutrition. I learned about the training, I got to do it, I've got to pull it all into action and of course I had people supporting me, but when I got on that stage it was win or lose. I'm taking full responsibility for this and we don't really have that now. And the guys don't learn anything because they've got coaches. So what should I do? Bus Do this, do that and eat this and eat that. Okay, and you know, the beauty of it's gone, you're not learning anything anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:24:45       What if you fall out with the coach like I was going to do next contest. So is that like a big thing now? Like there's like a series of coaches, is it like MMA camps? It's the same thing and it's like, I dunno, I think the guys a suckers because who is making the money here? The coaches, the coaches are making the money, not the, not the competitors. The coaches are smart and I look at the coaches and I say, who the fuck are you and what have you done? You know, what, which contest if you actually want. And most of them haven't done anything. It's just all theory. So I'm sort of the exercise physiologists, just guys from the industry that, you know, they're, they've trained a few people and they've got a few results and uh, it's more about the, for me it's more about the insecurity of the guys competing.

Speaker 3:          00:25:34       Like why don't you learn yourself and listen to your body. And I used to make notes, you know, every week I'd write down my diet, I'd write down every single workout that I ever did from 1984 to 1997. I have in a training log. You should sell that. I printed out all these little exercise books, you know, and like you can see the first one went on like 21 years old. It's a bit childish with the comments, what it's like, you know, I felt shit today. This was a shitty worker. Never fucking let this happen again, you know, all this stuff. I'm talking to myself. So I've got all this and then go back and look at it sometimes. And it's weird because I can go back to 1988 and I can look in my book and I look at that workout and I was like, I was in this gym and I was training with this guy and I can't even remember.

Speaker 3:          00:26:21       Like I was like, why do I was wearing. And I can go back in time and remember just from those nodes. Yeah, like every workout. As soon as I've got home and I finished, I was like, Hey, bench press, I did this, and every month I would make notes and say, okay, this is what I'm doing now. These are my goals for the next four weeks, you know, whatever, like little goals, like I'm going to put five pounds on my bench press, but you do that every month. Then the end of the month, you've got your end of the year. He got 60 pounds, right? So, uh, did all these things like, you know, a mental rehearsal, visualization, all this stuff. I did it, I just, I kind of learned it. Nobody, nobody taught me. So, um, that was one of the things, goal setting, writing and writing it down on a piece of paper just.

Speaker 3:          00:27:04       And that you can do this with anything, your business, whatever. You're writing it down on a piece of paper, you make a commitment, it's fucking, they're on a piece of paper everyday. You can look at that and it just gives you a stronger mental vision. And instead of saying, right, I'm going to win this contest in 18 months time. Yeah, that's cool you're going to win that contest, but how are you going to get the. It's like saying I'm going to sail to Australia. Yeah, it's a good idea. That's cool, but how are you going to get there? If you've got a plan, have you've got a map of like, fuck, you're going to go with no map, you're just going to get lost, you know? So I found that very helpful and that's what I try to teach people as well, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:27:38       I think writing down goals is huge and it's something that most people don't do. Yeah, I still do it now. Like a daily thing. This is what I got to do today. Sometimes I won't get through it all, but you know, at least it's there. I might put a couple of things off for tomorrow, but I find it very, very helpful. Yeah. Yeah. And which I've written it down like, you know, like let's say a, I don't know, you want to stop drinking or something, write it down. I'm going to stop drinking alcohol, sign it if I can put it there on your table. It don't just have said that you've said that you've made the commitment to put on a paper, so you're gonna, you're gonna let yourself down. You're going to be a pussy, you're going to be weak and you're going to break that.

Speaker 3:          00:28:13       You made that commitment, man, you know, it's there on a piece of paper. So, uh, that's that strong. Especially for the type of person like you dedicated focused guy. Like something like that is just extra motivation in, in a, like a, you know, it's a scaffolding. Yeah, exactly. Is there, it's solid, you know, something. Just say it casually. I fucking committed to this. I wrote it down, you know? Yeah. I'm a firm believer. I think you should, at least for a week, you know, at least for your week, set it down and have a little checkbox next to it and make sure you can look at that. Like, I did this, I got my workout in, I got my, my, whatever. Whatever you need to get done, whatever you trying to slack off. It's five things to do that I did for them. I didn't do the fifth one because I smoked a joint with four to five.

Speaker 3:          00:28:56       Still that four out of five. I would reward myself. If you do write things down, no, you'll just get more done. Even if you don't fulfill the entire even to get more done than than if you didn't do it 100 percent. It's having a plan man and everything needs a plan. If you want to get somewhere, I'll use that analogy. If you want to get somewhere, if you're a captain on a ship, you don't just get on the ship and say, Hey Ho, let's go silent and we're going to get there. No, you're probably not. You need to. You know, you need a route to get there and you need to know what it takes to get there. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this fight competition. Yeah. Cool. But do you know what it takes to get there? Right. First of all, this is what it takes. Okay. Are you prepared to do this? Are you going to do this? Yes or no, and if it's yes, go for it. You. If it's too much to

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       be honest, I just don't fucking do it. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       there was a time when you were a, at the top of the heap where there was, there was debate as to like what a bodybuilder should look like. There was like the Frank Zane look, which was like a strong obviously fit guy, but much smaller and just symmetrical. And then there was you that just came out like the fucking Hulk, you then, and then it was almost like overwhelming for a lot of people. And then there was this debate to try to figure out. Absolutely. Because when I look at a bunch of bodybuilders on a stage and they're trying to pick out who's number one, who's number two, I'm like, I can't. I mean, I always assumed that it's like a lot of other things, like the deeper you are into it, the more you can see the intricacies of it. Whereas for me, a person is not a bodybuilder. I'm like, they're all fucking huge. Like how can you tell who's the best?

Speaker 1:          00:30:34       Oh, so it's a matter of um, you know, it's bodybuilding, right? Yeah. So it's, it's muscle size is a big factor. It's not the only factor, but it was a big factor. If you look at the Mr Olympia is, for instance, in the era of Frank Zane and Frank Zane is a body that probably most people would look at and say, fuck it. Now that's, that's it. That's great. And you know, probably look at me and say it's too extreme. Um, but in the era of Frank Zane, who was Mr Olympia was Arnold Arnold was Mr Olympia. You could, you could argue that Frank Zane, his buddy his is more aesthetic and nicer and prettier than Arnold, but Arnold beach and why it just was bigger, more freakishly impressed, his bigger. And uh, Lee Haney was eight times Mr Olympia, you could argue maybe Lila abroad or, or somebody like that was better proportion and put together, but he was much smaller.

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       So, you know, Frank Guy, you would see the gym today like a regular dude. There's a lot of regular duties under the, a category now. So you've got bodybuilding. Um, but you've got other categories now that you didn't have. So you've got men's physique, which is more of this a type of physique, they're looking for various theoretic tight waist, everything like that. And you've even got classic bodybuilding, which is height over weight ratio. So you know, the guys are not that big. So you've got different categories as a reaction to people not really liking the direction that bodybuilding went and, and uh, yeah, I'll take responsibility for it going the size root and um, I had a nice physique when I started, you know, I had a nice physique, had nice abs and everything, but I'm like, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this to the Max and I'm going to see how far, you know, how big can I get, how can I get, how strong can I get? I want to go to the Max and I don't want people to say, oh, that's, wow, that's a nice physique. I want people to say what the

Speaker 2:          00:32:28       fuck? That's what I want it to do. Well, you succeeded in that. You definitely succeeded. Yeah. The guy that inspired me to before that, that

Speaker 1:          00:32:37       was Tom Platz. I don't know if you're not with the fucking

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       freaky legs and you know, he was the guy, um, when I started, it wasn't Mr Olympia, but he was very inspirational and um, when he talked it was just full of energy and enthusiasm for the training and pushing the body to its absolute maximum. And I remember Tom Platz saying, you know, when I walk out on stage in a bodybuilding competition, I want to see those judges there with a pencil and the paper. And I was just wanting to fucking drop that pencil and just say what the fuck is that? We're so big. His legs were so freakishly big like that guy had, like, nobody has really surpassed Tom Platz his leg. I don't think to this day. It's fair to say

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       now is that just, it's weird because it's very rare that someone's known very specifically for a body part that we plats is known for his legs. What plats made a whole career on, on the legs. And uh, not only the legs,

Speaker 3:          00:33:39       the passion he had for like pushing himself into the gym for the, to the absolute maximum. And that inspired me to do that and try and take it even further and that now is missing. That's not here anymore. Now for me, the bodybuilding and the fitness industry, people are just really more concerned with the cosmetic, the look and you know, taking their pictures and putting them instagram and all this kind of stuff. They're not really into as almost a spiritual side of it. You know, where you want to push yourself to that maximum and see how far you can go and how, you know, how far your mind can go into the pain and all that kind of stuff. That's not really there anymore. Well, what's, what's missing? Like, what's the element that's missing? Like why isn't that near? Um, I dunno man. I mean a collection of society in general. People just want stuff like, you know, they want stuff easy. Now. You know, everyone wants to be famous, but the picture on Instagram, you don't need to do shit. Just be famous. Go on. Big Brother. Be famous for nothing. Nothing. Yeah. That's, I don't know. I think that's a reflection of the way things are perhaps in everything.

Speaker 2:          00:34:48       But what's the difference in the way the bodybuilders approach it today? I mean, they're obviously doing something because there's still huge on. They're still, you know, these giant guys that are lifting weights. So what element, if you look at the giant guys that have

Speaker 3:          00:35:02       whites now that don't look quite like myself and the guys from the nineties now the guys are just big everywhere. The waste. So huge. Everything huge. Um, and it's 20 years since I competed in a contest, so I don't exactly know what the guys are using a lot more different to drugs and we use a lot more insulin and igf, things like that. So, um, I think what you're seeing in the big guys is somewhat systemic growth. It's like they just got bit bigger everywhere and that doesn't look, uh, so appealing I think, right, when their guts extent. Yeah. So maybe the relying more on the chemicals and they don't really, you know, I haven't really heard anything from any of the bodybuilding champions in the last 10 or 15 years. I don't think I'm interesting or new or revolutionary in the training methods. It just, you know, I don't really even talk about it that much now.

Speaker 3:          00:35:58       Everyone just does the same stuff. Know. Well, it was at one point in time where no one talked about it at all. Right. Like it was. You would get the magazines and they would tell you to take creatine and you could look like me, but everybody kind of knew who. Everybody who knew. People who knew people was somewhat Vienna circle. Yeah. I remember I started in the eighties and I read the magazines and a few things by Arnold and Mike Mansa where they kind of admitted that use something, but they've downplayed it. Oh, it's only for the last six weeks before a competition just to give us that last Polish and stuff like that and ask a few guys in the gym. And when I first started they were a bit cagey, like, no, no, no, no, don't, I don't do that. And later on I found out they're all, they're all doing it, right?

Speaker 3:          00:36:41       Yeah. Um, and it was very much an inner circle in the gym. Bodybuilders now everybody knows about steroids and now it's mainstream. And guys take steroids now just for cosmetic reasons because they want to look bigger and harder and quicker. Uh, I just equate it to women having a botox. So having some implants, the guys want to look bigger. I don't want to work so hard. They don't want to, you know, they just want to quick, right? So you get guys coming to the gym and that just takes steroids pretty much straight away. Um, I don't necessarily learn how to train really properly. Um, and uh, it's not just competitive bodybuilders now. I mean, it's everywhere. It's everywhere. It's mainstream. You look at Hollywood, you look at hip hop artists. I mean, come on, they're all, they're all doing a bit of juice, man. Look, look at nearly 10 years ago and look at him now, man.

Speaker 3:          00:37:33       He was just, I haven't really been interested in La. There's a, there's a lot of them. Nearly a cool J. I mean, you know, they all, they're all jack man. I'm know it's not fully me. I can see what's going on guys from Hollywood, they want to get in shape quickly for a movie. You know, guys just want to look good on the beach. Um, it's, it's, it's everywhere now. It's main course. There's nearly damp. No, he's checked. Yeah. We saw a picture of a huge Jackman when he was preparing for Wolverine was doing dead lifts and uh, he was in his forties and someone was asking me, do you think he's, I guess, yeah. Well, I mean, how much did it get paid for the movie as well? Fuck yeah. Well No, not only that, like tip for a guy that is not really that kind of an athlete to all of a sudden look like that.

Speaker 3:          00:38:17       Like you got to make some radical physiological changes and a couple of months like that was, that's not even a good picture of man. It's real good pictures of them checked. But um, I mean there's pictures of him from the movie too, which just, he's enormous. Like he just became an enormous guy. What I'm saying is like how much did he get paid for the movie? And my point is, you know, he got paid for that. So maybe he took her little health risk or whatever. You can debate that, but he's getting paid for it, but is it worth it if you're just doing it? Just fucking look good on the beach and all look good for the girls or something. Yeah, I'm trying to put it in. But here's the. Here's the thing, man. Once you get on that merry go round, you don't want to get off.

Speaker 3:          00:38:59       That's the problem. Right? And you don't want to get off because you took some stuff. You know, you got bigger, you getting more attention from the girls. Now guys got more respect for you. Your self confidence is up. You don't, you don't lose all that man. Well, speaking personally because what I took it for a competitive sport. I'm going to stop that. Stop. That was it. But that was my, that's my question. Like how did you just accept the fact that you were no longer a superhuman looking freak show of a man? Now you became a regular man. Was there a lot? My whole thing was see if with bodybuilding competition, uh, I never showed my physique even in the gym with the guys that are trained with. I was covered up all the time if I want to look at my physique and practice my poses and stuff, I did it at home.

Speaker 3:          00:39:46       So on the street I always wore long sleeve. I don't give a shit about anybody else. Why is that? Because I did it purely for competition. But why did you cover it? Why don't you just dress like with a. because it's freaking wanted attention all the fucking time and I'm not interested in it, you know, I'm a quiet guy and I just wanted to go about my business and reveal this thing. I've been working on [inaudible]. I didn't see it as being. It's almost removed. It's like a statue I'm working on so I wasn't tied up in like I was tied up in being Mr Olympia because that's who I was and that, you know, somewhat a, a plane. Um, what the whole huge body and I didn't, I didn't need that for, for everyday use. Well, that sort of fits with this whole Spartan image that people had a view that you are the image of you was like this guy that was just doing work that other people weren't willing to do and some sort of quiet isolation somewhere.

Speaker 3:          00:40:38       So literally we're not as deep basement a basement in Birmingham, England where, you know, it's not exactly a hotbed of bodybuilding activity, no beaches or nothing. It's an industrial city. Um, so I just locked myself away there and worked on this project and I love doing it. I love just being in that tunnel, you know, seeing what I can do and obviously the further you get along, the more difficult it is to make any kind of improvements. But I was trying, you know, that's fascinating to look at it that way is almost like an art project. There was a statue I was removed. It was not my, I wasn't like building this body so I could get, you know, admiring from the girls or the guys going to be. I was already like a fit strong guy before I started. So I didn't come from that place of like, I need to do this to make myself feel better, I need to do this because I have some talent for it and I can change my life with this. Maybe I didn't know it was going to be Mr Olympia,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       but I just knew that if I put my energy into this, something positive was going to come from it. And after a few years I won the British Championship. And because of that, you know, I was British champion. I didn't have a car. I went home to a one bedroom apartment with no furniture. I didn't even have a proper bed. I had a mattress on the floor, I didn't have shit, but I wasn't the British championship. And because of that somebody put up the money for me to open a gym. Then I had a gym, then it was making an income from my sport. So even if it went that far, it would have been worth it, you know? Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:42:05       Well, I think that attitude is probably what's made you like very healthy mentally afterwards, what are separate from your body and that it was a project, there was a paragraph

Speaker 1:          00:42:15       the way it was very tough because I was a sky or was Mr Olympia and this is solely been doing since I was 21 years old. And then I got an injury. So my exit from the sport was not calculated. I told my tricep tendon on the left elbow and this had already won injury, a bicep tear. But I kind of handled that and it didn't affect my training too much, but this was almost a complete detachment that I have to repair. And after that I just knew I couldn't, I couldn't lift properly and like, you know, you can't compete with the rest of the world if you can't lift properly. Um, so I had to retire and then I was lucky in limbo as know who the fuck am I and what am, what am I going to do with my life? So it took me a few years to kind of slowly get back, but it wasn't about, Oh, I've lost my muscles when I'm going to do. Like it was more about, you know, I don't know what my role is in life. I don't know who I am. It took me a long time to find that. And I think a lot of athletes that retired from sport, they have the same same issues.

Speaker 3:          00:43:16       It's a giant issue with fighters. You, you know, you've got this fucking tunnel that you're in, right? It's almost like being at war like stressful, but you know, you've got this role and this, this thing that you just aim and for all of them

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       time and now it's gone. Like what the fuck you going to do? Who are you, what it's all about, you know? So it took me years to kind of come to peace with that. But it wasn't about losing the muscles. It was about losing my goal and my focus in my role in life. I think.

Speaker 3:          00:43:45       Yeah, the, for a lot of athletes it's the intensity of life is all of a sudden reduce down to a mundane normal guy and lows and mediums the time.

Speaker 1:          00:43:57       Um, but I turned it around because when I was doing bodybuilding, my life was very restrictive, like a fucking monk, you know, I just had this regime and I didn't want to socialize. I didn't want to do anything outside of that. So after some time I came like, hey man, so you can't do that anymore. What about, how about the thousand and one things you didn't do when you were doing that because you couldn't. Now you couldn't do all those things. You can go a do you know, not eat all day if you don't want to eat six meals a day, you can do what you want, you know. So I started looking into some other things was interested in, I was always been interested in wildlife. So I started going a few safaris and things like that and yeah, slowly I realized like, Hey, there's a million and one things you can do in life like this, you know, get over this.

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       So it's just a transitionary transitional period. Yeah. But, um, I can absolutely see why many athletes struggle. Uh, Frank Bruno, who was, you know, a boxer, well boxing champion from Uk. I know he had a really hard time and almost like he was world champion when I was Mr Olympian. We've tried at the same time. We both got divorced like everything falls apart, man, like, you know. Um, and then you hopefully rebuild back to something else. Yeah. It seems that very few athletes have a smooth process into retirement and fighters in particular, they always come back when they shouldn't. Yeah. Well I know why they do that. When I was a kid, I was always, why is Ali coming back, man? Like just, you know, he's the greatest and now he's going to get beat by some guy cause it's coming back. What do you miss the fucking adrenaline or whatever it is, if that, you know, that all your focus, all your soul, everything is going into that one point.

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       And like it's, it's tough to replace, but you've got to know when it's time to step down. I think now when you did decide, did you have a plan, did you write out a plan, like how to step down because he wrote out a plan for the rest of your life? No, because it was, it was like new. Tara was like that, you know, it was like I didn't have a plan for the injury. Yeah, vaguely. I had an idea in my mind that I would like to open more germs when I finished bodybuilding. I'm actually, I didn't happen, but um, I started my own nutrition company which is still doing sports nutrition during unites a sports nutrition. So, um, put a lot of energy into that and a different things and being able to experience things in life that I shut myself off with.

Speaker 1:          00:46:24       So that's how I dealt with it and now I feel I felt great about it and I kind of look back and I can sit back and say, you know what, I couldn't give any more to that thing. I couldn't have given any more. So there's no regrets. Like a lot of athletes, you know when you're young and you're there, maybe you don't really appreciate it so much and then when it's gone you're like, shit man, what if I'd done this? What if, what if, what if, what if, you know, I don't have those. What ifs? Man, I did 100 percent even too much to the point where I got injured, so I'm, you know, I'm happy with that. I can put that to rest. That's a great lesson. That's a great lesson for young people coming up. If you just do all the work when it's over, it's so what you can do it man, win or lose, you do what you can do and then you have the self satisfaction, the pride to look back and say, you know what, I fucking give it everything I had and no regrets. And that's the way I feel about it. And I know there's a lot of my contemporaries that compete against me. I don't really feel like that. That's why a few of them are still there in the fifties and the making comebacks. That's one of the most horrible things to see someone who's lived a life of regret. Yeah. This has

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       just narrative and I don't like to see athletes coming back when they're not as you remember them at their best and they're coming back and the not so good, which I'm sorry, but inevitably at 50 years old is going to be the case. Is there any body builders are doing that now at 50? Uh, yeah. Kevin Love Ron who came second to me and Mr Olympia. He made a comeback last year. Really? Yeah. How do you look? Uh, well, it depends how I answered that question. How did, how did it look compared to previously not good at all? How to look for a guy that's making a comeback at 50 years old? Yeah. Great. But it's not a 50 year old guy looking good contest. This Mr Olympia as well. So, um, you know, just tried to make it come back within a year. It doesn't take many, many years to get to that kind of shape.

Speaker 3:          00:48:18       So I was the thing with bodybuilding, you, you've got a thing called muscle memory, so maybe it took me 10 years to get to be 260 pounds ripped, but now that information is in my DNA. It's there so I could theoretically not trained for 10 years. Lewis, all that muscle, I'm probably get that back in six to 12 months. Really? Yeah, absolutely. Well I've heard of muscle memory and I know that it's a thing but it hasn't been physically isolated. What causes that or how it is in your DNA? I'm not really sure if they have or if they're interested enough to do to the studies that's necessary, but those of us that are in the sport, we know it happens. I mean arnold did it like a 1974. I think Arnold was gonna retire, but then it got this pumping iron movie that everyone's familiar with.

Speaker 3:          00:49:13       Um, so the 1975 Mr Olympia, which the pumping iron and runs around, he basically made a comeback for that just just for the movie. And previous to that he did a movie called stay hungry with Sally Field and Jeff Bridges and I think he had to get down to like 200, 200, 10 pounds because the director didn't want them to be too big for that. So he came off the back of that and they just put all the sides back on for the Mr Olympia for pumping it. Really? There's. So the director made him sort of a macy's himself. Well, he still looked pretty big, I guess for the average person. Yeah. Oh Man. That's nothing compared to how he looks. But next to Jeff Bridges. Yeah. I mean he looks like a really big fit guy that you'd see at the gym. Look at Jeff Bridges. The dude abides. I liked to do. I love that guy. He's still around, man. Still banging out great movies and talking about how many great movies that guy's been in. Absolutely. What's the one where he's a country singer. That was great. Oh, like, yeah. Yeah. That was recent. Yeah. God Damn it. I saw that. That was a good movie.

Speaker 3:          00:50:17       Yeah, he, he's, he's good at choosing roles. So when, when a guy does get down to something like that, is it a matter of taking less steroids working out last, like your body just naturally starts to shrink

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       pure. Uh, if you're taking steroids and you're stopped and you're going to lose a lot of weight pretty quick and maybe just don't lift weights, play tennis, do swim into something else, and your muscle mass, it's going to go down. So I'm guessing that's what it is.

Speaker 3:          00:50:43       Now. When you first started bodybuilding, how long did it take before you did take something?

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       After about 18 months I decided I want to do a contest and I knew the guys in the contest. We're taking stuff. So I just want to be on a level playing field with them. Um, so like two months before my first contest in which take a little ballot, Debo, 20 milligrams a day, a day. That was the first thing I ever had. And then narrowed to the contest, I switched to some Var and Prima Bolin, but I mean 20 milligrams a day is like fitness chicks take that.

Speaker 3:          00:51:20       No. Do they do, do take steroids, right? Means paying hundred percent, 100 percent, even bikini chicks like skinny, but because they want to look harder, they went a leaner and it's uh, you know, I got girls that are fucking strippers and all kinds of chicks asking me, Oh, I'm, I want to take this [inaudible] stuff. You, you know, anything about that. I'm like, I do to you. Oh yeah. The guy just told me it's gonna. Make me lean. And everything

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       said, all right, let me explain what this is. This is an anabolic steroid and anabolic steroid is a derivative of testosterone, which is a male hormone. So what they try to do is minimize the androgenic part of the testosterone, the male like and so you're left with more of the anabolic, the building part, but they can't completely minimize the androgenic part. So even though stuff like winstrol Lavar is less androgenic men, testosterone is still derived from a male hormone and if you take off, you're still going to get the male side effects, which is pretty common in women's bodybuilding and fitness and so on.

Speaker 3:          00:52:26       It's common in athletics across the board. We see it in mma. We see it in women in MMA as well.

Speaker 1:          00:52:32       Look, man, if you're a competitive sport, a competitive athlete, you're going to do whatever you can do. You know, so when I'm. There was a study was done by a guy called Dr Goldman and it's called Goldman's dilemma and he asked a bunch of athletes. I'm including the Olympic level athletes, so if I could give you a pill that would guarantee you would win the gold medal or whatever the equivalent is in your sport, but you would die at like 40, 45, would you take it? The vast majority of people said yes, they would take it. That's the mentality you're dealing with, especially when when you're young man. Yeah. You feel indestructable like nothing's gonna, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:53:15       Yeah. It doesn't seem real to write. It's like global warming will one day make the seas rise. Yeah, but not right now. So fire up the fucking. Now I want to fucking gold medal. That's all I'm interested

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       in. I'm not even. That doesn't even exist. I'm here now on the fucking gold medal and this is the mentality of the, you know, the successful athlete and you know, maybe it applies to everything or maybe it was a fucking businessman if you said you take this pill and you'll fucking make billions, like would you do it, you know, driven businessman of probably say fuck it, I'll do it if it's a solution that allow you to win. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what I did. I, I consider that I did a calculated risk, you know, as far as taking steroids with the possible negative health effects, which I tried to monitor. I had doctor's, you know, blood test and everything like that. So if something was going wrong, at least out of the, you know, did you ever find anything wrong? Now, some things were a little bit out of the normal range when I was heavy and my blood pressure went up, like not sky high, but it was, you know, 40 over 90 1:50 over 90.

Speaker 1:          00:54:19       So it was, was edging up there but it was 300 pounds. So, you know, and um, couple of other readings were a little bit but nothing of great concern, you know? Um, but that doesn't mean to say that the harmless because it's over a period of time. Right. And I equate it to smoking, you know, um, if you smoke for 10 years and then you stop apparently after 15 or 20 years, you're back to like, you know, a guy that didn't smoke if you smoke for 20 years, 25 years, and maybe it's a different story. Have you ever seen Chris Bells documentary bigger, stronger, faster? I haven't, no. I'm, I think I'm due to speak with those are the brothers, right? Yeah. Chris and I think I'll be going on the podcast at one point, but I actually haven't watched it. No. Great guys,

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       really great guys. They both been on here a couple times and very knowledgeable and Chris is a, just did a great documentary called prescription thugs to about the prescription drug industry and you know, getting people hooked on these pain pills but in bigger, stronger, faster. One of the things that was fascinating about it was that he was going over, like we were told that this is going to kill. You were told that all these health negative health effects, he's like, but where's the bodies? Where are the bodies like, can you think about all the things that kill people, obesity, crushes, human beings. I mean, it is one of the number one causes of death in America, but yet it's looked at

Speaker 1:          00:55:44       like smoking alcohol, prescription drugs. Oh, all those things. All these things that have been some deaths in bodybuilding, um, uh, that may be attributed to steroids and there's been a couple that definitely attributed to diuretics, which is, you know, diuretics, you lose a lot of water, you, you can lose electrolytes, potassium and sodium, which regulates your heartbeat. So then you're playing Russian roulette with a bit on. A couple of people played that game and lost. So

Speaker 2:          00:56:13       yeah, that's an interesting thing to point out because the diuretic aspect is, is critical. When you see someone on stage and you see them shredded, those guys are basically almost dead,

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       right? I mean, you know, like probably the least healthiest fucking point you've been all year is, is when you're looking like that on the stove. Amazing. You look amazing. But I can tell you, you know, you feel weak as a kitten. You don't feel real good at that point, but you know, you do whatever you got to do what's required. Um, 996 when I was competing, they had actually a testing for diuretics because there was a couple of deaths and the people in charge started getting concerned, you know, this doesn't look good and that affects your revenue. And so, um, they don't attempt. They attempted steroid testing in 1990 but it affected the guys look so much that, you know, once you've seen a guy like this, so once you've seen a guy fight like this or once you've seen a guy run this fast, nobody fucking wants to see anything slower than that or less than that.

Speaker 3:          00:57:16       Right? They want, it's just not interested. So they realize that real quick like fuck list with just forget about the steroid testing. And anyway, steroid testing is like, it probably just makes it more unfair because the guy that's got more information and like the clearance times and all that stuff, they don't want to stop people from taking it, they're just going to take it and try to avoid, get round the test and it's the same in all sports and I don't care if it's fucking running, riding Tour de France, whatever it is, it's going on to some degree. What would the UFC has done and they've self imposed. This is, they've hired Jeff Novitsky, the guy who went after Lance Armstrong and he's had to Usada and they just do random tests on our ended. The punishments are terrible, like two year suspension. I mean, I think first time you get pop, first time for steroids.

Speaker 3:          00:58:06       I think it's a two year suspension now for the UFC. And this is again, this is self imposed. It's not even in Nevada state athletic commission or any other athletic commissions in positions. And uh, they've radically cut back on the amount of people that are first of all caught in second of all doing steroids. They're just not doing it, but if you do real random testing you around. Yeah. Then you have a better chance of eliminating something. It pisses athletes off because you awaken these fighters up at 6:00 in the morning and they need the rest, but they take the blood, they take the urine, see you go back to sleep and you know, that way nobody can be safe and you've seen a radical change and performances and some athletes have. People were suspecting of doing steroids. They changed the way they look like there's so many pre and Post Usada pictures of people that post them on like twitter and facebook and stuff like that where they, you know, in these groups where they talk about fights and like who's. You know what chaff cleats had been hurt most by Usada. Yeah. It's like, it's. It's interesting because the more of the bigger guys or it's across the board, it's bigger guys, but it's also epo, like a lot of guys have been popped for epo. They've been popped for. What does that other side? Mel Melatonin. There's another one, God dammit, I'm trying to remember it, but it's a similar thing to epo, EPO, increase red blood cell count,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       so you get more oxygen, which would give you more endurance.

Speaker 4:          00:59:24       Yeah, but that's, I mean that's giant in the sport. Yeah. I mean physical size is not really that much of a consideration is very few guys that are really big and muscular.

Speaker 1:          00:59:34       Well here's the thing with steroids. I mean that can give you muscle size but it depends on your training, but the training you're doing so it can also help with their insurance. So just because the guy is not big and muscular doesn't mean there's not benefit from steroids. You get runners and cyclists and like Lance Armstrong, Armstrong is like, you know, he was on a pedestal and then is demonized and is down here like let's say the owner guy using a bit of testosterone or you know.

Speaker 4:          01:00:04       No, he was a, you know, Bill Burr was a good friend of mine and stand up comedian had a hilarious bit about it and he's like, are psychopath was better than you're a psychopath. You got a dirty sport. He's like, we just have one psycho that was more psycho. You're psycho.

Speaker 1:          01:00:18       And uh, he had testicular cancer, right? Yeah. So I'm assuming then you're not producing any testosterone, so you've got to have to put it in from outside. How much? I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:00:30       Well, they had it in the used to allow testosterone replacement therapy for fighters. They don't allow that anymore because guys are abusing it. And also there was a questions of why they were losing testosterone in the first place and one of the thoughts was damaged to pituitary gland because that's apparently a big factor with fighters. Once they developed damage to the pituitary gland from head trauma, they start decreasing the amount of testosterone in their body produces. And so the thought was put it back in, but other doctors are saying, well maybe you shouldn't be competing anymore. Maybe put it back in for general health and wellness, but you probably shouldn't be competing anymore if this is the way your body's responding to head trauma.

Speaker 1:          01:01:10       Yeah. And it shouldn't really need replacement testosterone until you're like 40 or thereabouts, you know, because it shouldn't be producing still. And there's ways to up it, right? Even natural supplements to up it. A despotic asset as long as, what is d aspartic acid despotic I said as a compound, I think it's from amino acids, but anyway, they've done studies on it that shows that it can raise your own natural testosterone. Some herbs, Tribulus Terrestris also has some, uh, you know, some studies to back that up. Also exercise, right? Like high intensity exercise, sprint, certain kinds of squats. So how much it's going to make a difference. I don't really know. But yeah, heavy, heavy exercise would raise the testosterone over normal baseline. But once it gets to a certain age, it starts declining. In any case, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:02:02       Now when you started taking stuff and you started off with d ball, what? Like at the height, what was the craziest amount of shit you were taken?

Speaker 1:          01:02:12       The most stuff I took was in the off season when I was trying to real heavy, trying to build sized because I had to raise him that used to get ready for contests and I was always known for, like really coming in in shape. Um, so I don't use so much stuff getting ready for a contest you use more in the off season, so like a thousand milligrams of testosterone a week. Um, some decker to rebel and maybe 500 milligrams and Debo maybe 40, 50 milligrams is average and growth hormone in the off season I saw a lot of shit. It's probably about 30 percent of what guys are taken now.

Speaker 1:          01:02:52       I think so based on what people are telling me, I mean I have people come to train with me that haven't even done a competition, let alone the Mr Olympia and they, their stack is more than that because they found it on the Internet. I'm like, what the fuck? You know why I just saw it on the internet somewhere. This, I mean you go on the Internet and have a look for Dorian yates stack. I mean I've been on there and it's, I'm like, first of all, 50 percent of this stuff, I don't even know what it is. Right? So I don't even know what it is. And the rest of the stuff that I do recognize, like if you take this, you're going to get real health problems. So like is an issue, right? I mean instantly taken too much insulin and you fucking kill over in a coma.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       Um, I tried incident in the last couple of years. I was competing because there's a few guys started using it and so on. And I don't feel that I've benefited from it. I got a bit bigger, I got more bloated, the conditioning was harder to get. Um, so for me, I didn't feel I get any benefit from it. You can get bigger, but it's not the quality, you know, it wasn't. I was known for like Super Hot, grainy quality and I was, I was losing a little bit of that. He was an insulin. So that's my opinion. I wouldn't recommend, I don't recommend it to people that are trained with because it doesn't have any real benefits and has, has risks go why, you know, that's fascinating. Like the quality, like what constitutes the quality of muscle that you looking for? Well, I, I think, uh, in my case I was known for muscle density so you could have a 20 inch arm that's like got good volume.

Speaker 1:          01:04:33       We have 20 inch on the, it looks like a fucking block of steel. So how do you get that look how, what's the difference? I think the differences in the training that I've trained very heavy and primarily quite low reps compared to bodybuilders. I was working in six to eight, six to eight, a little bit high on the legs, 10 to 12, whatever. Everything I did was like six to eight reps where most of the guys that do intend to 12 and they relying more on pumping, just getting a lot of blood volume into the muscle rather than overloading it. Um, so I had a density in a powerful look to my physique that the other guys, when they stood next to me, uh, they didn't have that. And that was just from really heavy training I think. So you get the density of the muscle rather than just pumping it volume one.

Speaker 1:          01:05:14       How did you figure out how to make that number like six to eight, like why not three to five, like you know what I'm saying? Like how did you arrive over over many decades. First of all, people in the gym and also studies as well. Most studies would say for muscle growth you need to keep the muscle under tension from about a 40 to 60 seconds, which in most cases would be eight to 12 reps, so I went a bit lower like six to eight a that worked really well for me, but not on legs. I went higher, 10 or 12 on on the legs. So just a bit of trial and error. We know I'm the lower reps will give you more strength and more power without the hypertrophy of the growth of the muscle. So that's ideal for fighters. I worked with a few fighters in the UK and I tried to explain this to them and it's hard for them to grasp because they think I'm in the ring.

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       I'm doing a lot of, you know, I need insurance. Yeah, you do, but you're already doing that. You're already doing that, right? So if you want to get more power behind the punch, but you don't want to build muscle because if you build muscle, you put on weight and then you've got the white category. So whatever more power you got, it's going to be negated by the fact that you fight fighting heavier guys. So if you could stay the same weight but be more powerful and stronger with that building muscle size, uh, that would be the key. And that's basically like power lifting, low reps, three reps, and then have a really long rest totally foreign to mma training. You're going to do a bom, Bom, bom, put it back and wait for three or four minutes. Yeah, do it again. So you get that bar, the power behind a punch, but without rest, but without increasing your muscle size, you know, because that would, you know, if you, if you get more power behind your punch, but you're going up a weight class, like so what, you know, you want to stay in the same weight but be stronger.

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       That would be ideal for a fighter. So that seems counterintuitive for a lot of people because they assume that bigger muscles mean more power. Not necessarily. I mean, bodybuilders have got a bigger muscles and power lifters. How lyft is going to lift more weight at least for one or two reps, you know? Yeah. They're training for that power boom. Right. Same thing with weightlifting is a couple of reps, but very explosive and powerful. That's hard for people understand kettlebells as well. Like, yeah, throw it up, you know? Oh, well that's the thing about kettlebell competitors. They'd not the biggest guys like they, the internal musculature, the call. There's a lot of the lifting, right? Yeah. You know, uh, if you're throwing a punch, I mean who cares if you got huge biceps, it's like the internal, right? It's terrible all the way up through the call that's going to give you that power. So you've got to go. He's like feed or I mean Elanco who? I'm a huge fan of him. I like his fighting style as well, you know? Uh, I mean the guy looks like he's got arms like sticks is it looks like he's got a pot belly, it looks out of shape, but if I can hit like a baseball bat man early in his career, he was bigger. Yeah. You and he stopped training weights and started training only sports specific, which is,

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       it's a very controversial subject because if you talked to modern strength and conditioning coaches, they said it's absolutely the wrong approach. And if a door continued to do strength and conditioning along with his martial arts training, he probably would have been able to prolong his career. But who the fuck knows if that's true? That seems like a very, it's very hard to say what would have happened, but the modern approach seems to be, do you have to consider strength and conditioning as a huge part of any regimen in terms of like some of the elite athletes focus primarily on strength and conditioning and camp and not really unskilled work because they feel like they already know how to fight as well. It's already the conditioning. It's all about, um, I mean as far as the, you know, the conditioning of their emotions and their ability to react is already there. It's just a matter of building the ultimate gas tank and having the body that can perform and react as quickly and as fast and recover as fast as possible.

Speaker 1:          01:09:16       Well, they've got the guys that hit the hottest that not necessarily the most muscular though, that's

Speaker 2:          01:09:20       some of them are like tyron Woodley, who's the UFC welterweight champion. He's one rare guy that kind of violates the normal build of a professional mma athletes because he's fucking jacked. But he's also, he's also very smart in his approach. Whereas like he's the consequences of engaging with him or extreme because he has tremendous power so he can pace himself more than like maybe some guys can because if you get in a firefight with him, like one shot from him put the lights out on you. So he's got this ability to. And he's developed a very, very interesting way of fighting where he just paces his bursts. But it's bursts are so terrifying. Like when he comes at you, when he can, when he does sprint your way so much faster than the average fighter and so much stronger that I guess in his mind having all that muscle and he says it's actually natural. He just said he and his son.

Speaker 1:          01:10:20       Is it genetic? Yeah. My son is doing bodybuilding and uh, you don't have a particularly good a fried chicken and burgers and stuff and his like shredded all the time. It will. Tyron son is jacked and he's a little kid and he's parked on genetics are real. There's no denying. It's like me. When I started I had already a physique, had the ABS, I was laying, I had the shape. Everything was there. Just that to get bigger. So jeans are a big thing as far as your body type.

Speaker 2:          01:10:48       Oh, is it insurmountable? Like if a guy has shit genes, can he become like a jack? No, no, no. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          01:10:56       It can get better. Get better. But you can't be Lee Haney. It's a rare individual that you know, couldn't get up. And the Mr Olympia stage is probably hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of guys around the world that in the gym training and maybe it would like to compete. Um, what do you know, Kinda kinda everybody be a UFC champion. Can everybody be a basketball player? I know you need certain tools to start with and then you've got to work on that and build that.

Speaker 4:          01:11:25       But at least for, for athletes and fighters in particular, you see guys who don't have impressive physiques had, have incredible records and wound up doing really well with their skill and their tactics and their mindset and their understanding of when to engage, when not to engage with bodybuilding dough. It's a very specific look if you are born with like slope, shoulders and small hands and

Speaker 1:          01:11:46       you're fucked, right? You need to, first of all, you need the frame, the frame. You can't, it's the bone structure. You can't do anything about that with, with the training, right? So you need a relatively wide shoulders to smaller hips. You need the limbs to be proportional for bodybuilding. Um, most of the successful guys that tend to have a little bit longer legs compared to the torso because it just looks more authentic and makes the upper body looked more like that. So that's a bone structure. You can't do anything about it that you need to be born with a bone structure. Um, and then you've got muscle bellies, so you got the length of the muscle belly, which is genetic. So if you've got a short bicep, you know, used to tell you I'll go to the gym and do preacher calls and we get along. No, you have your muscle attachments are genetic. So the longer your muscle bellies are, the more potential they have for volume. So somebody that's got uniformly long muscle bellies with a good frame and a good metabolism that tends to have naturally low body fat. Then you're looking at somebody with potential to be a good competitive bodybuilder. If they don't have all those things, everyone can improve. But are you going to go win contests? No.

Speaker 4:          01:12:58       Have you ever had a guy come to you and said, and I want to be a champion, and you like kid, you're fucked.

Speaker 1:          01:13:02       Yeah. Damn. I mean, why? You know,

Speaker 4:          01:13:05       Dorian Yates tells you you're fucked. I don't say I try to be a little bit more subtle than that, but uh, I'm like,

Speaker 1:          01:13:12       you know, I don't, I'm not here to bullshit anybody. So if somebody asks me, I'm just going to tell him like, yeah, you can improve man. But like, you know, you're just going to waste your time if you're driven by a Mr Olympia because, you know, I don't be rude, but you just, you just don't have what it takes. Like enjoy your training. Shouldn't be healthy. You have fun in the gym. But yeah, forgot about that because it's not going to happen. That's hard for people to hear though, but it's better than me blowing smoke up their ass and saying, yeah, Oh yeah, you know, yeah, pay me. And Yeah, you can be. You can have whatever you want, man, because somebody else is going to tell him that.

Speaker 4:          01:13:49       Have you seen a guy that you thought, man, I don't think so, and then he became a great bodybuilder?

Speaker 1:          01:13:54       No, no, no. Jesus Christ. I can pretty much. I mean I've been around like, you know, what, a 35 years I've been in this guy man, so I can see people and I've seen people probably with more potential than me. Well they don't get anywhere because they don't apply. So it's,

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       you know, you've got to have the physical stuff, but the glue, the thing that holds it all together is this. So I've seen freaks in a gym, but they, you know, first of all, they're not that smart. They don't really understand everything that's going on. Um, and usually when somebody gets something real easy, they're not, they're not really that hungry. Right? So it's not necessarily always the guy with the most potential that, you know, you can beat somebody with more potential by being smarter and working hard, but it's, you know, 72 degrees, right? Yeah. That's what I've always said that like you can get a guy who's the most dedicated, the most hungry wanted the most, but when you're competing in basketball against Michael Jordan, yeah, you're kind of fucked because he wants it bad too and his genetics are just so superior. There's just no way around.

Speaker 3:          01:15:03       So you can't equalize that. Well, what are you going to do? You know, I saw this thing in England recently. Guy came over from the states, the real, I don't know what his name was, but it was a good martial arts. It was a kickbox. He was dedicated. It was lean and fit, and it came over to fight this gypsy fight or over in England and this guy's like fat out of shape. He turned up like 45 minutes late for the flight because it had been drunk the night before and he came in and it's just fat and it looked like shit and an for like half an hour. He's getting his ass kicked. Well, they're not thinking, oh, he woke up and it kicked the other guy's s. So this guy has been training, has been dedicated as he's doing all this stuff and this guy is the night before is getting drunk, but he still come in and kick the guy's us.

Speaker 3:          01:15:45       So you know, it probably just had more potential or he had a hot head or something. I don't know. There's a lot of factors involved in fighting. I mean his experience, his ability to take punishment that some of it is just inherent. Like some people just have a like a wider face, stronger neck. They can take a shot better. Yeah. There's oral genetic characteristics, right? The ability to absorb punches, it seems to be, or at least the variables seem to be a lot of it based on maybe you've got sick of bones or a shorter neck so your brain doesn't rattle as much or something. Mark is a perfect example. That is one of the best kick boxers of all time. And from New Zealand just to tank of a man, you know, five foot 10, 265 pounds just built like a brick shithouse oh dude.

Speaker 3:          01:16:30       Cro. Cop had kicked him and he went down and got right back up. It's like nobody does a cro. Cop had cakes you. That's a wrap, you know, and he's one of the few guys that survived it. Well, I got a my friend, my business partner from New Zealand, I don't know if it's true, but he told me about Malcolm is I've got a brother and the dad used to get them in the back yard there and just like knock the shit out of each other until they're like immune to getting hit. Yeah. I don't feel it anymore. Well, he's been knocked out a few times recently like, but you know, he's in his forties now. It isn't it the case with fighters? I don't know. I noticed that. Anyway, you get a guy that's like seems to be invincible, then it gets knocked out and then after that he it like

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       chocolate down for instance. Perfect example. Yeah. Unquestioned. What is that?

Speaker 4:          01:17:15       Well, your brain does not want to take that kind of punishment anymore. And with Chuck explained to me was that when it gets to a point where your brain realizes that you're too tough and you're just going to absorb this punishment and it just shuts itself down to protect it. And that's how he described it now. And obviously that's not like a neuroscientist describing it. There's also the connective tissue that keeps the brain connected and inside that it gets looser and more torn. Have you ever seen connective tissue? It's almost like a, like a strong version of cotton candy is. It looks like it's not. It's not the toughest stuff in the world and it's not supposed to take that many beatings in the wild. If you had that many beatings over a certain point that you'd be dead already, somebody would've already eaten you.

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       But a MMA seems to be safer than boxing because you don't hit as many times

Speaker 4:          01:18:13       sorta. Yeah, I would say probably overall safer. But that's like saying motorcycle racing is safer than like going down hill and a skateboard 60 miles an hour. You're kind of fucked all relative, right? Yeah. It's like the study that they did that just came out this week on football players would show they did. They, they did a test on 111 fighters are 111 football players. One hundred and 10 had traumatic brain injuries.

Speaker 1:          01:18:43       I saw the movie account numbers called now with the brain damage was causing the guys to be violent and kind of stuff. I mean, they were saying that 87 percent of football players at all levels, high school, college, all, all levels have traumatic brain injury. 80 seven percent of what you're going to do stop exact club football and stuff. MMA like that's the question. Climb Kleiman like, you know, everything's got its uh, its risks, right? Every, every sport, unless you do it like, you know, moderately. If you do things in moderation that good but could never be dorian yates in moderation, competitive sports or not, you know, they're not the healthiest thing in the world right now.

Speaker 4:          01:19:28       No, I mean, you're dealing. Well, I mean, I guess there's injuries involved in basketball, right?

Speaker 1:          01:19:33       But you know, you're not, you're going to lose your ability to think. But uh, even like endurance sports, a marathon run and stuff like that, these guys die younger than incidental person. Yeah. Because of the massive amount of free radicals that are producing, which is aging the cells from massive free radical from all this oxygen like uh, so you know, you, your agent, if Salads, you're wearing yourself out doing all this interference sports. Um, I think what's going to come out in the future, and I've been doing this myself and getting great results is very short interval training now they've done studies with five minutes of cardio workout and it's getting the same results as an hour. Well that's, yeah, I do 10 minutes. I do what I do a 90 seconds, like, you know, moderate. Then I do a 32nd all out sprint, whether it's on a cross trainer or a rower or kettle bells or whatever, get the heart rate right up, like one 60 or something.

Speaker 1:          01:20:31       And then go back down to do that a few times, like 10 or 12 minutes. And my resting heart rate was pretty good for a bodybuilder. I guess it was like 50 4:55 in the morning. I had it down to like low forties, 45 in the morning and that's just from doing a couple of times a week or 10 minute workout and once a week I do a hard bike ride, but yeah, absolutely because you want to get the. You want to get the benefits from the cardio exercise, which is a more efficient cardiovascular system, but you don't want the negatives for that free radical. So if you can get what you're looking for in a 10 minute workout, what are you going to do? An hour or two hours. I don't know if it would be useful for a fighter because you're going to be in a ring for all that long, so you've got to condition yourself with that. Just talking about for, for general health. Wow. I've never even heard of such a thing. Yeah. Interval training, but 10 minutes, 10 minutes. They've done studies on the four and five minute workout. So that's. I think that's the future where you know, you want to get the benefit without the negatives.

Speaker 4:          01:21:31       Do you think you could run a marathon right now?

Speaker 1:          01:21:33       Could I run a marathon? No. No, I running is not. Not For me now. Well not definitely not for you. When you're in your prime fast walking. That's good.

Speaker 4:          01:21:43       When you were in your prime, how much endurance did you have? Like if you had to do something, if you had to go up a flight of stairs. We like to

Speaker 1:          01:21:48       bad because I always did some cardio. I did some cardio and stretching and so it was a bit unusual for, for bodybuilders because that doesn't give you bigger muscles, but I saw the other benefits of it because if I got more efficient cardio, like I'm training legs and back, stuff like that. That's a huge amount of oxygen and you got to failure on squats or leg presses, you know, that's a huge amount of oxygen. So for me to recover from that, I needed a bit of a cardio so I was doing three or four times a week off season every day getting ready for a contest, but it wasn't very intense. It was more like moderate. I did like fast walking for an hour or do stationary bike for 45 minutes, sometimes twice a day. So I was doing quite a lot of cardio work, getting ready for a contest rather than starving myself. Oh, I see. I was bringing the calories down a little bit and bring the activity of a little bit. So it was a bit of both. A bit of calorie restriction, a bit of more activity, more calorie burning

Speaker 4:          01:22:41       now when you do in calorie restriction, but you also have to keep all that mass. How did you contradictory goals? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:22:48       uh, you know, training we can debate because I trained with some mma guys in England, a bit of Jujitsu, but mainly conditioning stuff and it's fucking hard man. It's hard training, right? He's just a super hard cardio and then someone's trying to punch you in the face at the same time. That's hard. So we can debate about the training. Which sport is harder? Yeah, because I've done a little bit of both. Um, but what's harder and bodybuilding is when you leave the gym, it's still with you and when you're getting ready for a contest, you're going to do more training and you're going to eat less. So most sports, if you try, you can go train hard and then you can go home and eat with bodybuilding, you know, two months before a contest, you, you're hungry all the time because you're trying to lose, you're trying to lose, slowly lose the body fat and maintain muscle.

Speaker 1:          01:23:37       If you're trying to lose weight too quickly, your body will preferentially burn a muscle because it's like, what is an emergency store, right? Your body doesn't want to give it up. So you've got to like coax it out slowly, you know? Um, but yeah, you're going to be hungry and you're gonna be tired for a couple of months ago for a, for a contest that isn't selling fun is not fun, man. It's, it's a constant mental battle as well because your body's telling you to eat, you gotta eat, you gotta eat and at night you can't sleep properly because you got to sleep a little bit. And then your body's like, internal alarm clock will wake you up if I can stop and go eat and you're like, nope,

Speaker 4:          01:24:13       I ain't doing that. But how do you keep your body from absorbing all that muscle because you're carrying so much muscle? Is there a drug that you can take that keeps the mass?

Speaker 1:          01:24:21       Well, you know you're taking steroids which are anti, which are anabolic and anti catabolic. So that's going to stop you from losing muscle. However, you know, if you restrict your calories too much or too much exercise and none of it, you still going to burn muscle is just going to lower the chances of it. So you know, you've got to stack everything in your favor. You've taken steroids is, you know, try to keep the muscle mass and stop losing it. But if you do restrict too much, you're going to, you're still gonna lose it. So you need to like one or two pounds a week very slowly. Your body from going into the shock. Yeah. That's where a lot of fighters go wrong because they're starved themselves for a couple of weeks and lose muscle. The Lou strength, I lose glasses in front of muscle and you know they're weaker.

Speaker 4:          01:25:05       Yeah, they fight very weak. That's, that's a huge issue and a lot of fighters are choosing to go up a weight class and they're having big success. Donald cerrone's, great example that it's been quite a few fighters. Oh, you lose it. You lose that weight very slowly. Not Depleting it down. Know what kind of diet where you want when you were competing

Speaker 1:          01:25:23       for a high protein, high protein, a off season. There's still a lot of cops, major and fat and then getting ready for a contest. The cops slowly come down, but I was a big guy to 70 to 80. I was still eating probably 3,500 calories a day, which is probably more than eight now. But you know when you're that big you, you're starving

Speaker 4:          01:25:47       because what do you weigh now? A way now to 30, something like that. So yeah, all that extra mass needed to be fueled. Yeah, exactly. Now what, when you were in say like out of contest now, what your goals were to put on muscle that you would eventually

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       like you would get bigger and bigger every year. That was one of the things it

Speaker 1:          01:26:07       so yeah, and then maybe there's certain areas where you want to like work on at some point that's a bit behind so you put more focus on that and a bit less on something else to try and keep the balance. Uh, it might sound strange now, but when I first competed a, my first contest I lost to a guy called Mohammed bin Aziza and his back was just like freaky thick. It was like three d coming out and that just stuck in my mind. I'm like, fuck that. I got to, I put a picture of him on my fridge at home. I put a picture in the gym and a funny enough, later on in my career I became known for the guy with the best back kind of thing. So, um, yeah, it was inspired by other people to do that. So I worked on the back for a couple of years.

Speaker 2:          01:26:52       What is the difference between the way you approach nutrition when you were competing versus the way people do it today? Because so much changes in nutrition. I mean it seems like every five or six years like, oh nope. Low fats out now you go high fat, high carbs around, now you go low carbs and it could change back and forth again.

Speaker 1:          01:27:12       I think the seven is like Arnold area, Frank Zane, they'd go more low carbs getting ready for a contest, but then you lose sizemore quickly. Um, why do you lose sizemore quicker that way because you get caught that ball do, you haven't got the energy. So you know, your body can use the amino acid from muscle for energy. So there's a balance there. And also you lose the glycogen storage. It muscle is a 70 percent water and the water holds um, carbohydrates and the muscle glycogen. So you lose that as well. So you lose that bit of volume when you lose the glycerin, you lose the water. So shrink down a little bit. Um, so my approach was more, it was high, higher carbohydrates, especially in the off season, getting ready for a contest to cut them down, but not, you know, not zero and a fairly low fat. I think people now realize that fats more important and there's probably more fat in the Diet than there was back then, uh, which, which I think is healthy fats just got a bad rap and it's bullshit, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:28:15       Well, that's, um, we've talked about that several times in the podcast, but there was a New York Times article recently about how the sugar industry paid off scientists to fake results. And that was done in the, I get the fifties or sixties and that's haunted people to this day. They think that fats are bad for you. They're essential.

Speaker 1:          01:28:33       I may be wrong with the organization, but I think it was World Health Organization. They, uh, basically submitted a study that showed how bad sugar was and some department of the US government, which is getting a lot of money from the sugar lobby basically said, I think you want to reconsider this, you know, kind of like. So that's where the whole fats are bad, you know, low fat came from. I know back then how bad sugar is. So I found it amusing when I first came to the states in 1990 got all these low fat products. I've called my friends at homeland. How fucked up this is, man. They got low fat muffins. Of course the fucking low fat. They're full of sugar, no fat, low fat yogurt, low fat muffins. It's fucking full of sugar. It's the worst thing you could have, you know. So people thought they were being healthy but they've been misled and it makes you fat. Yeah. Nothing wrong with fats as long as their natural, you know, if you get the fats in baked goods and all this shit, you know that that's not good, but natural fats in animal products and coconuts and all that stuff, it's great.

Speaker 2:          01:29:43       Now what would you use for carbohydrates? So you. Did you have a preferred method or did you

Speaker 1:          01:29:49       complex stuff like a oatmeal was a big thing. He was an oatmeal brown rice, sweet potatoes and some fruit and fiber, vegetables. Those are the main things that I use. Basic, nothing fancy, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:30:00       did you mix your portions up and like a little tupperware boxes or something like that so that you could know exactly what to eat.

Speaker 1:          01:30:06       I used to weigh my food like pretty much all the time other than nate and restaurants. Very rarely and yeah, I used to pack them up in boxes because you know, you've got to have it all the time. Right? Yeah. So that was one of the things I did Miss Miss Mountain so relieved and I carried on a fucking plastic boxes around with food and just go to a restaurant and eat whatever I want and have an ice cream if you will do. Exactly. That must've been nice when you realize you could just just eat. Yeah, I'm off season wasn't too bad because I'm eaten good food, but a lot of it. But yeah, getting ready for a contest. I mean that was a real mental test, you know, because your whole body is telling you you got to eat man. Even at night I said, you wake up, you got to eat. No, no. And I'm going to eat and when to watch MTV for half an hour from maybe fall back to sleep a little bit, hopefully, you know. Um, so yeah, the Diet thing, I don't miss that at all. It was, it was a tough mental challenge and I did it. And you know, whenever you get through a challenge I think it makes you stronger. But uh, you know, I don't want to ever do that again. Yeah. I can only imagine

Speaker 2:          01:31:11       now when you give these seminars and he talks to these, uh, young bodybuilders that are coming up, how do you be. You kind of have sort of a holistic approach to life down there just about health and wellness and. But when you were coaching, these kids are talking to these kids about how to be successful and competitive body is a multiple time. Mr Olympia one of the greatest of all time, if not the greatest. You mean you can't have a holistic approach? Kenya, you

Speaker 1:          01:31:41       to me for bodybuilding advice, and I don't have the body now necessarily, but I got all the information here that I can put across to people for the training for the nutrition, but it's called specific, you know, you want to be a competitive bodybuilder. This is what you got to do. I'm not a competitive bodybuilder now. My Diet and

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       my training is geared towards what my goals are, which is functionality, a health and wellbeing. And that's, that's what I'm into now. That's where I'm at. I'm not a bodybuilder anymore, you know, and buddy reduce or if anything and um, I, I feel good man. I'll fucking get a suit from Hugo boss a couple of months ago off the rack and this was like so happy I could just buy a suit off the rack before it had to have it made and if it go for a fitting and go for another fitting all that. I'm sure if they looked at the measurements of paper, they were like, what the flight suit suited for? What is this, you know, was like this wide going down, this is a wardrobe. What is it, you know, so uh, yeah, I look on the other side of it, you know, the young guys coming up, maybe they think less strange like, and asked me don't you dare look at pitches back and think wow, look like that.

Speaker 3:          01:32:49       I'm like, no, I don't look at. I just look at that and I think wow, that was fucking extreme and what I did. And that's craziness and credible, but does it always you as far as competition and let yourself like that. Sometimes when I look at those black and white pictures, giant picture of Dorian Yates and is one of those black and white pictures man. And that's just like hear you saying, there it is. Look at that. That's insane man. He couldn't really fit any more muscle onto that frame really. You know, like I know I went to places and I did things that other people, you know in the gym, look at your fucking forearms while my, here's the thing, forums. I never did any training for forums. All that was just from gripping the ball when I was doing back training mainly and some bicep training and stuff. So I had 19 inch forums and identity to a single fucking exercise for them apart from gripping onto that is so ridiculous. Well that's a good pitcher but is not me.

Speaker 3:          01:33:50       I don't know how dare you Jamie, pull up a non Dorian because somebody put it on Google. Put up that winches. Keep going to your right. No, no, no. Down what you were. Yeah. To right. One more. That one. Bam. So I trust it. That's from the onstage pitcher from Mr Olympia. So what you can see, if you look on the legs, you can see the thinness of the skin and the institute with the muscle underneath like this. No fat. There's no water between the skin layer and the and the muscle layer. Um, what body, but what percent of body fat did you get down to? Well, I don't really know because I had skinfold calipers used to do full calipers. And you're not accurate. They used to get down to like three point five, probably like a month out. But I know I got leaner after that, but it didn't really register because they're not that accurate after that point. So I don't know, maybe three percent, but it's, you know, nobody measures your body fat is what you look like. It's a visual thing. It's really what you look like in the mirror. But how did you know like how much water to drink and when to back off and um, experience.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       I didn't really, uh, your fucking legs, dude. I didn't restrict a water intake until like maybe 24 hours before the contest. Little your right leg there. That's preposterous. Yeah, that's a huge media. Alice right over the knee. The, that's a lot of sick work, man. That's like, that's like I used to try and legs pretty much once a week and for four or five days of every week I had trouble sitting on the toilet. Trouble moving around. I mean if I didn't, I wouldn't be happy, man. That's a field that fucking pain, pain in the ass, pain in the leg just to sit down. But hey, satisfying because you know, you fucking done some damage. But if it's like that and the damage repairs itself to get slightly bigger and stronger bodybuilders, just an adaptation to stress, you know, you put a certain stress, your body's going to adapt to it. Fuck, I need to get bigger and stronger so I can handle this stress next time. That's basically what it is. So continually trying to stress yourself like anything you want to get better. Katia, go to express your cardio system so it adapts.

Speaker 2:          01:36:05       Yeah. There's no other way, right? To get that big. I mean there's no shortcuts. There's nothing you can do. There's no easy route.

Speaker 1:          01:36:11       Well, I don't know. It looks like guys are looking for the easy route now because I don't see them train that hard. But then you don't see the quality of their physiques the guys a big now. But you look at the quality is not the same. It's not the same. Not the same. Can you just generally accepted in bodybuilding in the nineties was the peak of competitive physiques as far as the standard and the depth of the standard. There was like six to eight guys on that stage that were like really, like if you are off, you know, there's places could change. Now you've got one guy, Phil, Phil Heath, who was the Mr Olympia and it's pretty like distance between him and the next few guys.

Speaker 2:          01:36:48       Now what is it though that it doesn't open the door for a current modern day? Dorian Yates, like some super dedicated person. Me physiologically, people can still do the same things that you did.

Speaker 1:          01:37:00       Yeah. But um, things have changed since the nineties. There's a lot more avenues that people could choose to go down. I was like doing a sport or in, for instance, UFC that doesn't exist in the early nineties. I remember watching the first show on a. It was in New York. I watched on TV the first, the very first one, you know, with, uh, always crazy. So you've got, you've got mma, you've got crossfit and it got all these other competitions now in the, in the bodybuilding arena, that's not bodybuilding. It's men's physique, whether we're the board shorts and they got the nice physique and abdominals, that kind of physique that most people aspire to have. I guess. A, you've got classic bodybuilding, so got a lot of different avenues and I think the interest in pure bodybuilding is a lot less than I made in the nineties. Everyone wanted to be a bodybuilder. It was like hugely popular.

Speaker 2:          01:37:52       Yeah. What's interesting now, what is this Jamie? What do you pull it up here? This a Mr Olympia from

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       996 is myself, Sean Ray in the middle and that's one of Coleman on the end who became a an eight time Mr Olympia

Speaker 3:          01:38:03       guys are on Jack also. It's so hard to tell them like, I'm looking at this. I'm like, fuck, I'll call the guy on the end is the best. Well, it's also got to be hard for that tiny dude that's next to you decided to do it. It's always been unhappy because it got been by me, but a thing as he had a great physique, just like frank. Zane had a great physique, you know, if he was the same size as arnold, maybe it would have beat him, but he wasn't in the same size as arnold. And same goes with a gentleman up there. Mr Shawn Ray. He had a great physique, but you know, I was twice as big. So big guy always beats a good little guy, right? Yeah. It's a crazy sport man. Now what about the top guys today? Like you said, Sean Heath is the number one guy to them. Phil. Hey, I'm sorry. Now there's so many different avenues now and a lot of them, a lot of people are going towards like the Internet route because you can make a lot of money as like a, an internet like famous person for being a bodybuilder. Then you selling things and selling. There he is. Phil Heath pretty jacked. Yep. Phil Heath is, you know, is not very wide in the shoulders, a weak point, but has got huge,

Speaker 1:          01:39:26       um, long muscle bellies on the most of his body as his pecs are not great, but the rest, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:39:34       the rest is a, it doesn't really have any weak points, so that's why he's is ahead of everybody else and you just think there's just less people doing it now. There's less

Speaker 1:          01:39:43       people go into to competitive bodybuilder because there's a lot more avenues and I think it's less popular now because it's almost like peeked out with myself and run in and gone down a little bit. It's like, how do you know, how do you surpass it? Got to a peak and guys are trying to do that so that they, you know, that they're trying to get big and they're getting big, but they're getting big with a big waste and everything as well. So it's not the same. It's not the same look as not the same quality.

Speaker 3:          01:40:10       That's got to be super dangerous, isn't it? When you see those guys, those are enormous bloated bellies. That's a huge debate. And the like, what is that? What is it? I don't know, internal organs that are

Speaker 1:          01:40:22       initially, uh, that's what people thought, right? And um, I, my wife started getting little bloated around 96, 97, maybe [inaudible] 97 when I was using insulin. Right. You got a little bloated and load standard. Um, but when I retired it went down and I actually in England because I was always like, oh, I'm taking steroids for this sport because I'm a professional when I'm not competing, I'm not going to take them. So stop taking them. And also I took growth hormone and that was the thing. A lot of people think hormone is going to increase the size of internal organs and that's why guys are getting bloated waistline. Uh, so I went and had a real, I mean a battery of tests where they actually measure all your internal organs and mine all totally normal. Apart from my heart was a bit bigger and stronger, but that's just normal athletic hot. Uh, so that wasn't the case. So I perhaps it's, I'm a fat this building up around the internal organs or maybe it's just a lot of water in the intestines and it just blows to the waste out of the short answer is the short answer is I don't really know who's that guy in the far left a. that's like a turtle shell.

Speaker 4:          01:41:34       There's not really a turtle shell. Yeah. Jesus Christ. So that could be insulin. That can be.

Speaker 1:          01:41:40       We only seen this kind of thing happening since the guys are using insulin and igf, which is insulin like growth factor. Wow. Um, so yeah, it's not a good look. It's not a, you know, a turtle show. Look, it's so weird. It literally looks like. So it's like the guys that got big but everywhere systemic, like growth, you know, when you're training with weights, you know, your major muscles are going to grow but not around the waist can thicken a little bit but not that much.

Speaker 4:          01:42:07       Now when you got off of everything, when you retired, what was the crash like?

Speaker 1:          01:42:13       Well, it wasn't something I was ready for. I had a lot of things going in my life. I had a divorce, I had a, somebody close to me pass away and um, you know, retiring, so you know, they say a death in the family or divorce or retirement is like a major stressful event or how about an old fucking three at the same time while you're not while you're coming down from steroids. So yeah, I definitely suffered from depression and anxiety. Like I don't know what's going on, like why do I feel like this? I didn't even like now I know, right? Because you fucking stopped cold Turkey because I'm extreme unlike I'm using them because I'm doing this. I'm stopped now and stop and I had no real help. There was no real like this guy is now and especially in the states that, you know, they specialized in patients that are using steroids and all the possible side effects and coming off and all that stuff. I didn't really have any of that. So I just went cold Turkey and after about two years my normal testosterone was still not coming into the normal. So then I went on the replacement therapy, which is like twice a month, a testosterone replacement, and then I felt normal again.

Speaker 4:          01:43:25       So the, the come down like you, you're taking this work. What were you taking like right before he stopped, like what was the, do you remember? Probably about a thousand milligrams a week total of testosterone, a total of every. All kinds of stuff. Deep on everything. But if testosterone but have a deck or something like that and then

Speaker 1:          01:43:45       then stop and then, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:43:47       was it a gradual effect where your body's freaking out or was it like

Speaker 1:          01:43:51       almost instantaneous? Um, it was probably after a few months I started like noticing I wasn't feeling too good, funnily enough, like sex drive didn't totally disappear and actually had my daughter was conceived while I was not on anything. So I think they did trials with testosterone as a male contraceptive and it was moderately effective but not enough that they would market it. So, um, yeah, probably like six to nine months it was really not, not feeling good at all. And you know, there's a lot of factors there. If I was still taking steroids, but those things happened in my life would have felt as bad, I don't know, probably not, but there were definitely a lot of traumatic stuff going on at the same time.

Speaker 4:          01:44:37       Now, was there any conventional wisdom in the bodybuilding community of how to slowly cycle off or what the factors would be and how you could mitigate them?

Speaker 1:          01:44:47       Not at that time now. Twenty years on. I mean, you can go on the Internet and find a ton of information, but, but not really. Then the only thing is guys were using was atg, which is like helps to Cheryl and testosterone. Clomid, clomid and some natural stuff like that. Um, I remember going to an endocrinologist and asking him like, you know, what she'll do is she'll do acg and this and that, and he's like, look at me. And he said, you know what, Dorian, you probably know more than me about this. Thanks for that. Now you know, he's talking about this situation and somebody coming off steroids, he didn't know. He didn't have a clue, man. Right. It's a different thing, but now you've got guys out there, they'd have a whole. I did a seminar and I'm in Canada and Ben Johnson was there, actually the guy that Olympic gold medalist for awhile, he was there with his doctor and has a couple of other doctors there and one of the doctors told me that absolutely every guy that was in the hundred meters race tested positive every guy. Um, but I think it was CBS was covering the contest and they're like, we can't fucking, you know, kind of have every guy like, yeah, you've got to choose one and make sure he's not American. Really. That's the story they told me and I believe that man,

Speaker 4:          01:46:01       there's definitely some real good evidence that they're all doing something

Speaker 1:          01:46:06       goat. I felt felt bad for him and he was like, fucking demonized. I remember all the newspapers. I remember my son went to school and they did a whole thing at school about, you know, and it came home. He must have fucking known. His Dad was jacked up. Like, like, uh, the guy was cheating and you shouldn't do that and all this stuff. They told him at school and I was like, alright, so not explained to you when you have it,

Speaker 4:          01:46:29       and he also had no recourse like Lance Armstrong today as a podcast. He's done a bunch of interviews. He can tell his story and now you know, I mean I think there was a period of time where lance was demonized, but over time that is greatly subsided and people now recognize, no, he literally was in a sport where everyone was cheating. But is that cheating? Well, if everyone's doing it, is it cheaper? Then the real issue I think was deception and lawsuits and saying that he didn't do it in suing people who said he did and there was a lot of stuff that wasn't exactly the smartest thing to do, but you're dealing with a cornered person who's a super competitive alpha male trying to figure his way out of this mess that he's found himself in and this mass that exists systematically or systemically in this entire industry. The entire sport that he's involved.

Speaker 1:          01:47:22       Yeah, I remember the um, there was a car that got stopped in the board or a few years ago and the Tour de France is going, you know, France to someone across the border anyway, and it was a team call, right. And they stopped the team car and it was just full of apo and steroids and all this stuff, you know. So it's how well, uh, when was the first Tour de France? I don't know, but I know environment, one of the very early ones, uh, the, the guy that was winning, he died because it was using amphetamines let back in whatever, I don't know, 19, 10, 19, 20 or something like that. So, um, it's there, it's part of the sport. When I came into bodybuilding, it's not like I invented steroids with already there, you know, my first Mister Olympia is in 1965. Larry Scott was the Mr Olympia and 90 65.

Speaker 1:          01:48:10       And he said he was using steroids and that was 1965. So when did this start being used? I don't know, but for sure in the early sixties, 1965, they had steroids. When did they invent steroids? Uh, I believe, well, you had testosterone. Testosterone was used in the Second World War. The Germans were using that with the SS soldiers. Um, so injectable testosterone was available then steroids, which are more refined version of testosterone. Um, I think late fifties. How is it more refined in what way? So you got testosterone is a male hormone, so it's basically 50 percent androgenic that's male, like characteristics, 50 percent anabolic repair build. So they want it to take this and they want to this pot the anabolic and minimize the androgenic because that's what gives you side effects, prostate growth and all that stuff. So they try, they refined it so that those effects are minimized and more of the anabolic effect.

Speaker 1:          01:49:10       That was the idea. And as a guy called John Stigler I think, and because they found out the eastern bloc, they had their own at their own stuff called to rentable. So a siegler invented, definable, and I don't know, don't quote me if I could be wrong, but I think it was about 58 or something like that. He developed that for us. Weightlifting team, 1958, I think it was 58 years, but before that you had testosterone, so who knows what a. When people started using it, but for sure from the early sixties it's been a part of bodybuilding and then other sports and they used to be a disclaimer inside the steroid thing saying anabolic steroids do not increase athletic performance. That's hilarious. Right? So they stated this and they also told guys if you take this, your fucking balls are going to drop off, you're going to fucking die.

Speaker 1:          01:50:01       You're going to get liver cancer. So guys started using them and seeing that that's all bullshit, right? So then they don't want to listen to anything. These medical guys you've got to say because you're aligned to us then. So you're going to be lying to us all the time. Not necessarily. So. Yeah, because you do have chances of side effects, but if you could say it's been greatly exaggerated and certain propaganda and deception, right? Yeah. Just tell the fucking truth, man, and let them deal with it. And uh, that's what I do because I saw all this stuff on the Internet about what I'm supposedly doing and I thought young guys are going to read this and maybe they're going to do it. So I did an article in a magazine, muscular development and I said, here, this is what I did, this is what I did in officer, this is what a different context and these are my opinions and you know, my honest opinion is like, I don't think it's worth it unless you know, you're competing and so on.

Speaker 1:          01:50:55       But ultimately it's up to you. Let me give you the information. What you do is up to you. And I don't know if 70 percent of the people like this is bullshit. He didn't really, you must have talked much more than this because I'm taking this. Actually I'm taking more than this and I will look like, oh, tough shit man. You know, I know a lot of guys that take more stuff than me. Then I couldn't even compete in a contest. I'm not even good enough. Is there a certain amount where it doesn't help you? I think it gets to like, the cup is full, right? You know, it's just a matter of hard work is the cup is fallen more than that. Isn't that going to help you anymore? It's just going to increase your chances of negative effects. Um, so when I was an amateur, it might, my policy was always take as little as possible to get the maximum effect and when that's not working then you can go up a little bit more, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:51:44       Um, but if you go a day one and just throwing everything in, the body's going to get used to that way you're going to go, where would you get steroids? Uh, where, where did I used to get them? I mean when I got them in in UK was just from the gym when I first started. I mean people were bringing them in, trucks loads full from Europe and there was not, you know, the authorities are not even aware of it or concerned about it or anything. Now the policy, at least in a UK, and it depends on every country in Europe, but in uk it's perfectly legal to have steroids for your own use, so you going to be driving your car with a bunch of steroids on the fucking passenger seat and the police call you and you're like, what's this? Isn't my steroids? Okay. For Your own personal use is selling, making money and not paying your taxes. That's all they care about. No. Well, that's I think how it should be. You know, as long as his education, as long as you're not lying, but the problem is when you lie to people about the effects of things, then they think you lied to them about pain pills.

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       You're find about all sorts of other stuff that is actually deadly.

Speaker 1:          01:52:48       I think all fucking drugs should be legal and it should put money into education and treatment and that's what they did in Portugal and the fucking results. Write down,

Speaker 2:          01:53:00       Glenn Greenwald actually post something today about that. Showing how it's changed over time and gotten actually better since they have made, especially in particular marijuana since they've made marijuana. Legal and started legalizing drugs and in Portugal they've had far less incidences of people having like real issues,

Speaker 1:          01:53:21       so literally and the money they use it to reeducate people and get them out of that cycle and try and get them back into society to, to get them a job and all that stuff is just going to punish people for doing it. How the fuck they ever going to get better? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:53:34       Well there's also a problem with telling people not to do something and they want to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:53:39       Especially when you're young. This is a label. Oh yeah. Let me do it. Here it is. You can fucking have it if you want, but this is all the negative consequences. And what do you want to do now? People are choosing

Speaker 2:          01:53:51       to do it. The bodybuilders. Bodybuilders that died. Um, did any of them die from steroids or did they die from complications involving a host of different issues?

Speaker 1:          01:54:02       Well, that's hard to say because there's been quite a few of bodybuilders and mainly male and mainly the bigger guys. Well that has been a couple of women that have died from heart attacks. So did steroids contribute to that? Possibly. What, what, uh, what else were they doing? You know, the individual cases, who knows with taking pain pills, a antiinflammatories or they're doing recreational drugs. There's a lot of, a lot of factors there. Um, but I think would be probably fair to say that using steroids over a longterm will probably increase your risk of heart disease perhaps. I think it causes some inflammation in the lining of the arteries. Can raise the blood pressure a little bit and so on. So yeah, I, I, uh, I compare it to smoking, you know, probably not as bad though. Yeah. So the way I look at it as I smoked for 10 years and then I stopped. So now

Speaker 2:          01:55:01       quit stuff. And now speaking of smoking good stuff. How did you get, how did you find out about DMT and how'd you get involved? Because I read something about you having these positive dmt experiences. Wow. How strange is it reading about, you know, massive bodybuilder now getting into psychedelic drugs while I'm speaking openly about that first time

Speaker 1:          01:55:25       did I asked her, was on in Brazil. I met, my wife was outside, she lived in Brazil, so we went out to the Amazon and the, well this was like 10 years ago, you know, so people weren't really not like now people know what I'll ask her is because so much information out there yourself talking about I'm talking about is a ton of stuff on the Internet. Um, it wasn't so much then, but I heard about it and I heard about this. It's a life changing experience and all that stuff. So we were out in Brazil and we've got this guide and ask him for Ios Oscar and he's like, bring me these two balls of brown stuff. I don't even know to this day if it was really Alaska, but I just got really sick and didn't see any great revelations apart from I've got this thing in my head.

Speaker 1:          01:56:07       Stop poisoning yourself. Well the night before I'd been out drinking, getting drunk and everything. So you know, that was my experience with that. Then a friend of mine out out here in California actually I knew about dmt. I used to live in Amsterdam and I read the DMT, the spirit molecule and all that stuff. So I knew about it, but I had no idea get the stuff away you can get it from and everything. So a friend of mine got it. And uh, that was my first experience of like leaving the room, so to speak, and the planet. And then since then I had to some very positive ios grew experiences, but with a shaman and doing properly and prepare in like five days of know, restricted diet and no sex and all these kinds of things you do to prepare and also afterwards, um, so dmt is like blow the fucking doors of your perception and realize that this world we're in is like, you know, it's nothing, it's just a little illusion, right.

Speaker 1:          01:57:06       There's so much more outside of it. Um, so there was that. But with the DMT, I think it's like you've got a computer with like so much storage space and you've got, it's like a thousand times more than you can retain. So you see all this stuff and while you're there you're like, I know everything. Oh yes, but when you come back, how much of it can you hold onto, you know, uh, so you've sent it and that's like, makes you look at everything differently. What the Ios is over hours. So I feel like from the Ios I actually benefited more, it was like going through therapy or something because it was much slower and I couldn't digest it, you know, so um, but doing it with the Shaman, uh, I did it with a guy called Gmo, other Railo and his, one of the top guys in the world from Peru comes to Spain a couple of times a year.

Speaker 1:          01:57:55       So I did it with him and um, yeah, it's probably, I don't know, it's probably two or three years since I did dmt because I sat down one day and I said, actually I fasted for three days before, so I'll be like, just in the zone. And I said, right, I'm going to sit down. I got my dmt here, I've got my vaporizer here. I'm going to fucking smoke as much DMT as I possibly can to like, like, you know, to like gone and pass out. So I had that experience and since then I just don't feel any need to do it. I don't think there's anything more I can take from it.

Speaker 4:          01:58:29       I've had many people tell me the same thing. They had such a profound breakthrough experience that they're like, okay, I get it. Yeah. I had a crazy one in around 2000, I want to say like two,

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       eight or nine or some point that. And I took a long time off. I didn't do it again till like five years later maybe. It was pretty intense man. I mean the, the Ios was nice because it comes in Nice and subtle and you go through hours of this thing. But DMT is like, last time I did feel very anxious when you'd like, like it's almost like you're leaving your body and you know, so you get that bit of anxiety, but once you go, oh yeah, that's cool. But if you've done it more than one time in a day, like multiple times in a night. No, I just, you know, just blasted it as far as it could go. And that was it. I've done it several times over the course of a few hours and uh, you know, you are more comfortable letting go that way and some sort of a strange way, but it never gets less alien.

Speaker 1:          01:59:28       Oh, he had a, I'm not gonna mention his name, I don't know his name, but we had an experience, me and my friend a few months ago, um, uh, that I'd never seen before because usually people take dmt, they very calm and sit in the chair and you'd go off and you might start laughing, but you know, you don't move much. Right. And this guy, he just like freaked out, like it wasn't for 10 minutes or half an hour on. My friend was a former MMA fights used to fight with shamrock. So we're hitting in a wrestling techniques. So we had to hold this guy on the floor to stop him from hurting himself because it was totally freaking out. So I could see the guy was going through some, something traumatic from the past. So today I messaged them, I say, hey, did you ever find out what the guy, what, what, what was that? You know, because it was, he said, yeah, it was from his birth.

Speaker 3:          02:00:15       What's his, from his birth when he was born, he had the cord around his neck. Oh Geez.

Speaker 1:          02:00:20       And then he went back and relive this and so that had been in the back of his mind all his life, subconscious, subconscious as a huge effect on us, but we don't know it's there. So now he opened that box and let it out and that's gone now, you

Speaker 3:          02:00:34       know, so it can be therapeutic. A, I thought this guy's like, oh, he's going to be. But when it came back, it was like, Hey, I'm like, you're good. He's like, yeah, I'm good. I'm like, do you know what just happened? He's like, no. I said, good thing. We filmed at them and go home and watch this. I had a friend of freaked out too. He freaked out. He threw up, took his shirt off. I was running around saying a bunch of crazy shit. And then, uh, after he came down, you know, we calmed him down and took like 10, 15 minutes. He goes, okay, well obviously I'm a work in progress, but never forget that, but did he know what it was that was troubling him so much? Well, he had a bad childhood for sure. Everything is like most of our shit is from that, right from the developing years? No, for sure. Yeah. I mean in especially like real traumatic ones, abuse being beaten by his Stepdad and the punches fucked up shit that was just haunting him, but he, you know, helps you to come to terms with that. Especially the Ios because it's longer. I felt like the first time I did Iowaska properly with Shaman, I felt like

Speaker 1:          02:01:41       I was a different person. The next day I felt it was done 20 years of fucking therapy or something and just a lot of stuff I'd worked out in my mind. I could even see other people's point of view on things and that I couldn't see before.

Speaker 2:          02:01:52       That's huge. Right. Seeing other people's point of view, especially a guy like you who's so determined and goal oriented and just cut out all the bullshit and get it done.

Speaker 1:          02:02:02       Yeah. It can be a little insensitive to other people's feelings around it because it's just like

Speaker 2:          02:02:08       nothing keep up my way. That's a male thing in particular. Right. And then, and it's like, and bodybuilding and intensity and competition and then being the best, arguably the best ever and just fucking finding every day.

Speaker 1:          02:02:25       A couple of weeks ago it was like that. You don't see yourself as other people see you. So what do you mean? He said like, I remember when I was a kid, first of all the size, you know, it was fucking huge, but it's your persona. You might've said to me something very like normal, like a, you know, you know, whatever. What are you doing with a dog? Like, just something normal. I said, no, I'll be like, because just your, your presence made me feel like the inner

Speaker 2:          02:02:53       right. That's got to be weird when you're a little tiny kid and your dad's a gorilla. Yeah, I remember he did a

Speaker 1:          02:02:59       it. It's a kickbox and right. So he got his black belt when I was about 11 or something like that and that was my thing. I used to take into kickboxing and pick him up and he's like, Dad, can you just, can you wait outside? I'm like, what do you mean you want me to come in and like,

Speaker 2:          02:03:15       just wait outside, like, you don't want to come. It's like, yeah, but everyone's like freaking out and looking at you and it's got to be nice to have like know I'm fucking coming inside man. Semi anonymous and crowds now. Yeah. Yeah. Unless someone's a hardcore bodybuilding fan. Well that's the thing, uh,

Speaker 1:          02:03:33       not necessarily slow because uh, because of the interviews I did on London Real, um, and I've talked about ios gear and dmt and spirituality and reality and all this stuff. I get so many people coming up to me like they're not from the gym. I get housewives that young kids. Like it's almost like you're the guy from London Real, you're the guy that, you know. So I got a whole bunch of other people that appreciate what I'm saying about spirituality about reality and life. And they're like, fuck man, what'd you said? That really helped me and I got so many letters and emails and stuff, people, you know, like they just took something away from what I was saying. So I mean that's, that's really why I do these interviews. It's just trying to help the whole general vibe and the, you know, put it out there and um, there's a whole consciousness awakening revolution going on now and I'm just want to push some dominoes, you know, like create that effect. And then, you know, if you touch one person, they touch somebody else and it's like the butterfly wings flap here and the other side of the as a, you know. Yeah. It really or something.

Speaker 2:          02:04:39       It does seem to be working in that, in that regard, right?

Speaker 1:          02:04:42       It is, it is the time, man. It's the time is so many people that are more aware now than like 20 years ago,

Speaker 2:          02:04:50       isn't it? Kind of like, I mean, there's parallels to bodybuilding, right? It net. When Arnold first started doing it, there was very little information for Harley and you guys got to see what they did and build upon that and more information came out and now because of the Internet, there's so much information, too much information. People are aware more of what it's all about. Well, with Psychedelics, I mean 20, 30 years ago, there's so much ignorance and so little understanding of and also so little understanding, especially when it comes to something as extreme as dmt. There's still a giant percentage of our population doesn't even know what it is.

Speaker 1:          02:05:25       Yeah. They should all take it. Especially the fucking politicians. I'd like to get those politicians, man, I'm fucking get them in a room and force them to take dmt and then see how they're going to behave afterwards, how they're going to look at the world and treat people after they've had that experience. I don't. I don't think it can be a, you know, so self centered and unfeeling as most of them are. After you've had that experience.

Speaker 2:          02:05:52       I think that any breakthrough psychedelic experience, whether it's silicide been or LSD or DMT,

Speaker 1:          02:05:58       they all pretty much, you know, ego dissolving roads to the same place.

Speaker 2:          02:06:03       Terence Mckenna used to say that DMT is the center of the Mandala. The way I describe DMT is it's like mushrooms times a million plus amens and then it just seemed so titanic. Lee Bizarre that there's like, I've tried to describe it to people, but I always say, look, I'm going to tell them what to do it. I'm going to give you some bullshit

Speaker 1:          02:06:23       or because you can't. It's no, we don't have the words to put it into words, you know, you can attempt to. I went to this place was not a place, but I don't have the word for it. The places everywhere is like. And there's colors, there's numbers, the shapes and people think things and this is like everything is all one fucking thing. And what I noticed is like my breath was connected to it. I don't know how it happened, but I was in the trip and I went like that. And the whole thing moved. I really let me try this then and then the whole thing moved and then there was music playing and the music was part of the thing as well. Like the thing, I don't even know what to call it, the thing that place, I don't have a word, you know,

Speaker 2:          02:07:09       we played a bunch of these shaman and the Shaman who grids is the last time I did it and the Shaman [inaudible] like literally made the DMT images dance like they had figured out a way with these sounds and songs to integrate these beats into dmt trips. And as you would take these trips, these shamans had figured out the right sounds and songs how to make

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       the trip more intense and sort of guided in a strange way.

Speaker 1:          02:07:40       What I had with um, with a shaman, with the Ios guy. He comes around and sings these arrows and like changes tone and then it goes deeper base in his chest and it's like, it's, it becomes part of it, you know. And I was even moving in voluntarily. I was my arms going up, my body was moving and it's like I'm not doing this. I don't know even know how it's happening. It's like somebody picking my arms up in a move and I was, you know, started dancing around with this becoming part of this rhythm. Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:08:13       I had an experience once one of the first times ever did dmt where I saw the difference between negative and positive thinking. Like I started thinking negative and there was all this like black and dark green and like these, uh, threatening shapes and colors and then something recognized what was going on in my brain that the shapes and images were connected to negative thinking. And I relaxed in the shapes kind of like settled down. And then I started thinking positive. Like I heard all these expressions of love, but like you're hearing it but you're not really hearing it. It's like the thoughts are getting into your head. Like someone's trying to say it without using words. And then I started thinking positive and from those dark images blossom these like beautiful, like geometric flowers and colors and impossibly spectacularly beautiful images. And I was like, oh. And I, I, I recognized in my mind there is an actual thing that happens when you think negatively and an actual, it's not just some sort of affect the program, they're in a program,

Speaker 1:          02:09:22       your thoughts, the program's coming towards you and your thoughts and it's interacting with the program.

Speaker 4:          02:09:28       Yeah. And that's why conflict, interpersonal conflict between people can be so negative. It's not just as simple as you and some person getting into an argument. It's those dark images and those negative forces becomes a part of your system.

Speaker 1:          02:09:43       I had exactly the same thing, so, but it was almost like a tunnel. I was in this tunnel and it was the same thing.

Speaker 4:          02:09:52       Yeah. Oldest

Speaker 1:          02:09:52       images around and scary and everything. And I was like, I instinctively I knew to be very relaxed and I started laughing like, fuck you.

Speaker 4:          02:10:02       And not even real. You're not even real. And when I said that

Speaker 1:          02:10:06       it went away and I just got this thing that came into my head. You have just been in the valley, um, was a cold. The Valley of the shadow of death is sin. And the Lord's prayer, I think though we walk through the Valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil because God's bought aside. I vaguely remember from school or something, but I got this thing that you were there and you're in the valley of the shadow of death and because you like, fuck you would like, ah, it's not even, it just, it just disappeared. And then it went to somewhere really nice. Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:10:39       Yeah. I just wonder how much his real, you know, it's, it's such a hippie thing to say like, how much is real? I don't know. You know, I've been having these thoughts a lot lately about how much of how much of live do you manifest, how much of life is real? Because it's such a bullshit thing to think it's such a hippie thing to think and so many people that say that are so annoying.

Speaker 1:          02:11:00       Yeah. But scientists are saying the same thing now. Quantum physicists saying, uh, it was a fingerstick names. Profess at guides know if you're familiar with him. Professor Gates. And uh, he said that they've broken down reality into the smallest level and it's a computer code. Yes. I've seen that gun code. It's a specific computer code of Zeros and ones. And it was invented in the 19 forties by something.

Speaker 4:          02:11:28       Yeah, I've seen that guy being interviewed. We actually talked about it with Neil degrasse Tyson and he, I tried to get him to sort of break it down and explain. But what it is is essentially that when you break reality down to the smallest level, it mimics a self-correcting computer code. Not just not just a computer code, but a computer code. That self correcting, which is right there. I just said a bunch of noises that I don't even understand. You know, it's just, it's gone beyond

Speaker 1:          02:11:59       now you're getting a spirituality and science coming together because the scientists are saying what spiritual masters, they're already telling us that we live in an illusion and everything is inside. Not outside. That was saying that thousands of years ago. But some of it is real,

Speaker 4:          02:12:13       like you have to work hard or you don't get results, right? Like your, your hard fast, pragmatic reality of being the best bodybuilder in the world revolves around actual work, real results

Speaker 1:          02:12:26       in this, in this reality and this program,

Speaker 4:          02:12:28       but also to do physical stuff. Yeah, probably there was a lot of mental shit going on there too. Absolutely. The work was being done, but also there was probably a lot. It's

Speaker 1:          02:12:38       all day. I mean that's all I thought about like literally all fucking day. So you know, I had to have the physical goods to make it happen. I could dream about being basketball player all day. It probably wouldn't help me because I'm not built to be a basketball player, but those thoughts were just going out all the time. And I was a kid in Birmingham, industrial city in England and I was thinking I'm going to go to America and I'm going to be a bodybuilder. And everyone around me was like the fuck you took. Um, so yeah, that was those thoughts all the time. So I think it's like a holographic program. We're in what we influenced it, we interact with it, with our thoughts. That's kind of where I'm getting at now in some way, and the guys that were spiritual masters like Buddha or the guy that called Jesus and all that know that apparently did things that were called miracles because they were outside the box, outside the physical reality we live in. How can they walk on water that's not possible, but if you are so advanced that you really knew it was a program, then you can like heck the program and that's how they able to do it. They're kind of remove themselves out of the program.

Speaker 1:          02:13:59       Yeah. How can you. How can you, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:14:01       how can guys levitate or. Well, yeah. Well, I don't know. I wasn't there. See that's the thing. There's no evidence whatsoever that anybody actually can levitate. Well, people have witnessed people doing it, but I have witnessed is a lot of.

Speaker 4:          02:14:15       We'll set some weird shit. The problem with people saying things as they might have literally seen that, but it doesn't mean it wasn't a hallucination. And then again, it doesn't mean that a hallucination isn't an alternative

Speaker 3:          02:14:26       reality. What is it, you know, people say you elucidate when you take lsd or dmt or just elucidating hio or you're just seeing more stuff

Speaker 1:          02:14:35       that you can't normally see because now you've shifted your, your, uh, your vibration, you know?

Speaker 4:          02:14:40       Yeah. Well, one of the things that I tried to explain to someone about dmt that have kind of used over and over again since then is that I felt like I met with the divine force of the universe, like have or he divined forest, maybe my puny little brain can only comprehend this level of divinity and that maybe perhaps it was something even more profoundly more powerful and knowledgeable and wise past that, but I wasn't ready to perceive it. Then maybe there's levels to that, that it's fractal just like everything else. And someone said like, well, you know, how do you know that wasn't a hallucination like a. well, it could have been, but here's the deal. Whether or not it was or wasn't the experiences the same. Like if you really go into some other dimension in God or you take a drug in which you experience going to another dimension and meeting God, it's still the same experience, the exact same experience.

Speaker 3:          02:15:37       And why? Why is everybody's experience kind of similar, right. To have a whole totally different fucking illusion. No one seems to think it's no big deal. No one that I know who's ever done dmt is like, hey, it's no big deal. You're not going to be the same afterwards. You know, you get your, your perspective.

Speaker 1:          02:15:55       Is it going to a different point of view is going to be different. And uh, it can only put. I've never, I don't know anybody that's done dmt. And then they've said that was not a positive experience. I didn't get anything from that. Every fucking body. I know it was said that lot. Wow,

Speaker 3:          02:16:12       the fuck, where am I? That's like, what are noises that come from my mouth? And nobody's like,

Speaker 1:          02:16:23       nobody's ever said to me that even the guy that I saw that looked like he was getting raped by the devil because that's that guy getting raped by the download. I didn't see that, but I saw his eyes and that's how I imagined somebodies eyes with

Speaker 3:          02:16:34       like that was happening. So he looked like

Speaker 1:          02:16:41       an absolute terror is all I can say, absolute terror. So in this guy's eyes for like 20 minutes, but when it came back it was like,

Speaker 3:          02:16:50       oh, this is the guy that was. He didn't even know. I'm like, you okay dude. Yeah man, that was fucking great. Like, do you know what happened? It was great.

Speaker 1:          02:17:02       Okay, you need to watch this video when you go home because we fell into man.

Speaker 4:          02:17:06       I had a friend, my friend Doug Stan hope and he's talked about this many times on stage. I got him high on Dmt at my house and uh, he's the only guy that I've ever got high on dmt that I worried about because he fell over on the couch and started moaning and like foam was coming out of his mouth. He was, but he's so unhealthy. He smoked cigarettes. He drinks constantly. And I was like, oh my God, did I break my friend that I was really worried. I was like, maybe I should have considered the fact this fucking guy doesn't really

Speaker 1:          02:17:36       take care of things. Uh, I think when your system's kind of toxic, you don't get the best.

Speaker 4:          02:17:42       Oh, he came out of it. He got great results. He came out of it. It was a fantastic experience for him. He came out of it with all these revelations. We had great conversation about it, but in the moment he was like, and I was like, oh no, I've killed him.

Speaker 1:          02:18:01       Oh, this guy was like spasm him and kicking him. And my friend had to hold him on the floor to stop him smashing the furniture in the south. So. Wow. And it was like thinking he was being chosen 10 minutes. Oh Gosh. 15, 20. Oh God. I was like, I was starting to get concerned. Like Jesus Christ, half an hour later he came out of it, but he's glad he did it. Now that he couldn't see himself at the time. Know. Do you ever a float a flotation tank? Yeah, I did it once. And you know, funny enough, when I was a kid, I read Frank Zane, Frank Zane was doing flotation tanks back in the seventies. Yeah, those Samati tanks. So I always wanted to do it and I saw this place when I was over in England. So I went in there and I said to the guy, like talking about it, I said, listen man, let me ask you a question. I said, is it good to smoke weed before you go in there? And he's like, I'll tell you the truth. He said, a lot of people come here, they smoke weed outside before they come in. He said, but the first time I think it should just go with nothing and see how it goes. And I'll be honest, I was in there for like an hour thing after 40 minutes, I just got really fucking bored.

Speaker 3:          02:19:11       I thought to myself, I meditate every day, every day.

Speaker 1:          02:19:13       Uh, so I was like, this is like, don't fail. This is any better than major in my meditation. I just getting kind of the same thing. So really I wasn't, I wasn't blown away by it. Like I expected to be to be honest, but then, you know, done dmt

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       and I'll ask her and asset and everything. So maybe my expectations were too high. Um, I always give the same advice I give. I say don't smoke weed the first time, just go in and experience it, but my thoughts are that isolation tanks and the isolation tank experience is something that it takes time to really fully relax and settle in and there's layers to the onion and you got to go deeper and deeper and peel those layers away. And I've done it so many times. I have one in my basement and so I've done it so many times now that when I go in, I can slide right in almost immediately. But I'll tell you this, I rarely go in sober. I almost always go in high as a kite and edibles preferably or the best way to really. I can have full blown psychedelic experiences in the tank on edibles, full blown visuals.

Speaker 4:          02:20:20       Well, going into the jungle, experiencing the center of the universe, like intense, intense stuff because the relaxation, the, the, the fact that you are the only information you're taking in is there's a mild feeling of the water on your body, very mild that you have to think about to be aware of and occasionally you'll touch the sides of the tank and you have to kind of write yourself. There's no some water gets in there or something, but other than that, I don't rub your eyes, get salt dries as a bad one, but other than that, you're, you're experiencing no sound, no, no visual input, and in the absence of that visual input, I think all those other thoughts become more powerful. So whatever the effect of marijuana is an irregular body when you're just hanging out, sitting around. That effect is intensified in a big way when you're in the back and try that next time, but when you're in town I can hook it up.

Speaker 4:          02:21:15       Alright, cool. If you want, how many, how many times are you in town for? How long you in town? For a we're on a hips so Thursday evening and go to vegas to do a competition that. Well they have them in Vegas too now. They have everywhere to make. When I first started doing the tank, I first. My first experience I think was in the early, early two thousands and I got my first tank in 2003 because when I bought my house, one of the reasons why I bought it is it had a basement and I was like, I want a place to put the tank. And because I had done the tank a couple of times at this place called soothing solutions in Burbank. Yeah. If you've got it there and you can do it every day then oh it's the best. I'll do it at night and I get home from a comedy show and I'll say I need to process my thoughts and go over my material and I'll climb in that tank and just take off to the center of the universe and figure things out and also makes me reconsider like how my thoughts are.

Speaker 4:          02:22:02       Be like one of the things about comedy is you know, you have an idea and you've got to try to figure out a way to get that idea into people's minds and sometimes it's the wrong way. Like sometimes it's too abrupt or too corrosive or it's too, it's just not, it's not, it's not smoothly getting into people's minds, so you have to like really consider it. So that idea of seeing other people's perspectives like that we were talking about earlier, that's huge with standup comedy and one of the best ways to kind of get out of your own way for me is to explore things in the tank because in the absence of any physical input, he kind of stopped thinking of your body and your brain and you as an individual as like the captain of the ship and all the other things start to become more and more.

Speaker 4:          02:22:51       You've got more room to us. Well that's the idea is like you and I are having this conversation, but one of the reasons why I like to do it in this room with no one else here but us. So there's no distractions, right? But if there was a guy in the other room with a Jackhammer, it would fuck us up. We'd want to get out of there. Right? We want to it go over here so we can talk more quietly in the gym. You want to go to the gym? You want to be sure. That's why a lot of guys put headphones on, right? You just want to fucking grind and get in your own head. Well, in life itself, like while we're sitting here, your chair is sending signals to your ass. You don't have your hands on the table. It's all data in the tank.

Speaker 4:          02:23:24       There's nothing. And in the absence of sensory input, I believe that your brain become supercharged and I think you can consider things in a much more clear way. I think you have more resources. As I said, I find the same with meditation. It's like when I've tried to explain to people, as I said, it's almost like I feel like it's slowed down my thought process. So now when I have thoughts, I see them coming in and I'm like, don't wanna act on this thought or not. Whereas before I already acted on it before it was, you know, I recognize that that's a huge problem as being a reactionary person and constantly dealing with input coming in and the like instinctively batting it away or stay stressed and anxious. You are always going to react like that. So you need to get rid of all that and people know that.

Speaker 4:          02:24:11       I think that's one of the reasons why people have a real problem with president trump. One of the real problems we have with them like this, the guy that argues with people on twitter gets mad and it was nail on the wwe. Wasn't that perfect training to be the president. But that's fun. That's silly to me. I mean that's the same thing, man. You're performing familiar. That's just what, uh, you know, the president, how much power does it really have? How much influence or is it just a, just a pantomime that destruction for people. But that was before he was president when I'm reacting to is like him tweeting things today, like shitting on people, insulting people. Like when you're the fucking president of the United States, he the leader of the free world. You can't be going on twitter and just insulting people, putting out that conflict energy that we were talking about for what reason? If people recognize whether they know it or not, inherently they know that this is not the way to lead. This is not the way to be above it all. This is not the wise person that we want at the top of the hill. Setting the standards for all the people who have a. which was your alternative. There's no alternative, but you go, I don't think there should be a president and I've said this a million times. I just think there's too much power. Does

Speaker 1:          02:25:23       the president really have. I mean you had to Obama, right? He said it was going to close down Guantanamo Bay. Yeah. Great. But it didn't happen. I don't want to know why did he want to do it, but he couldn't because other people are really in control or maybe they want to do

Speaker 4:          02:25:36       bullshit. I'm like, why? They shouldn't do it. There couldn't be a bunch of factors. I don't know,

Speaker 1:          02:25:42       but I think maybe you go there with good intentions, but there's other people that pull us, pull the strings and you know, presidents, just a front guy

Speaker 4:          02:25:49       in that sense. One of the things about trump being so bold and so egotistical, I think that's probably a positive, is that he's resisting the deep state. He's resisting all of these other outside influences. Any so wealthy that he has the financial power to insulate himself from these other people that are like him.

Speaker 1:          02:26:12       Well, I, you know, I got friends in the states and that was the feedback that I got. The, the guys that liked trump, they liked him because I felt that it wasn't gonna be controlled by the, you know, the big money, uh, the, the guys that own the Federal Reserve and, or pulling the strings on the military and all that stuff. But I don't, I don't think you can have, I don't think you can beat those guys, you know, control the money system, the control, everything. It's a mess. I think I like your idea. We need to get them all fucked up.

Speaker 3:          02:26:39       So let's get hillary stoned and make a real nice, cool lady. And she would just go, I have cancer. I confess is a picture of a deer that was on the side of the road that was dead. And you know, those one of those comic memes. And it said, what did this deer know about? Hillary Clinton seems to be dangerous to know too much about Hillary and Bill Clinton. People were killed just in the last couple of weeks that committed suicide. A lot of people know this shit, right? So like,

Speaker 1:          02:27:12       we've got this fucking psychopath. Well we've got this idiot guy that but maybe is a better alternative than the psychopath. So let's go with the orange guy with the orange guy because he's, you know, his not part of this cabal. And maybe he's gonna he's gonna change things for the better. So that's why people went with him. I believe because he was seen to be not controlled by the same forces, if you like the, you know, the Clintons, the bushes, the fucking, all these people, they're on the same club. Right.

Speaker 4:          02:27:44       Well, it just seems that change, especially change over our culture, you know, over a civilization happens in these like slow ticks to the right or ticks to the left, moving in a good direction or a bad direction is so. It's so slow to change and like, so when something like this comes around that is perceived to be a negative thing and it's perceived to be a negative thing moving in a terrible direction and quite rapidly. It scares the shit out of people.

Speaker 1:          02:28:13       Well, that's the feedback I get now. If people over here, they, they're concerned, you know? Well of course not. I don't think it makes that much who is president. So it's just a, it's just a fucking side show to entertain people came distracted. Do you think that's on purpose? I got all. Yeah, that old emotional like, oh, trump is a, uh, it's like it's just bullshit is a pantone. Mine is just to keep you distracted and I keep you entertained, just like football and everything else, like don't look over here, look over here. So magicians trick in.

Speaker 6:          02:28:44       Wow. Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:28:47       I like to think that way sometimes. Then other times I think it's probably just too complicated for anybody to really orchestrate and we're just reacting to these wants and needs and human instincts and all a variety of factors that have been set in motion, like the momentum of these things that have been set in motion forever and people trying to profit and people trying to figure out how to control various factions of it, but the idea of like one person or one group pulling the strings,

Speaker 1:          02:29:11       it's not as clear cut as that, but I find it less and less plausible. Yeah. This is a small group that controls that. The debt. It's not even money instead. So if your control that then it can control pretty much everything, right? Isn't everybody in debt is every country in debt is in China in debt to. So who. Exactly. That's fair. If everybody is in debt to everybody, like, is that really dead fucking front money and put a number on a thing and you know, you owe us x amount, let's just cancel a debt.

Speaker 6:          02:29:45       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:29:46       no, that's why they distracted with things like we've got to go after medical marijuana like that jeff sessions guy. He's, he's the ultimate distraction.

Speaker 1:          02:29:54       It's going to start crying, kind of versus like, that's a huge thing in the evolution of consciousness and it's getting more available and more accepted and uh, the so many layers to it, man. It's like medically, it's amazing. Spiritually. It's amazing. It's a hemp plant. Can fucking supply what you know. Henry Ford built the model t ford out of Hamp Hempcrete, right? Not only that, it's way stronger. So why is it with a hammer? He hits the fenders and rust. It's lighter, you know, everything. He filled it with ethanol as well. So did you ever see you see

Speaker 4:          02:30:31       them make that a video where they have him hit the hammer against the offender? It's like the first model t they had met fenders. They had made them out of hemp and he's whacking it with a fucking hammer and hammer. The people don't understand if you've never experienced it, the hemp stalk the actual stock of the tree itself. It'll get very big and thick and it's extremely hard, but extremely light. It's not like any other wood is light light wiring. It's fucking hard like oak, but light like Balsa Wood. Look at this. That is hemp. So he's banging his hammer against this fucking car and it's not even making a dent. So tell me why it didn't build the car out of because of William Randolph hearst. That fucking cunt. William Randolph was the guy who owned hearst publications. He also owned a bunch of paper mills and he's the guy who demonized him.

Speaker 4:          02:31:26       He's also the guy that was the motivation for Orson Wells to make the movie Rosebud. You are the movie citizen Kane Rather. He was in the oil and steel industries as well. It has to do with a lot of things, but a big part of it was William Randolph hearst because they had a cover of popular science magazine that was like hemp. The new billion dollar crop and they made that because there was a. There was a device that was invented called the decorticator and what a decorticator was. It was a machine that allowed you to effectively process the hemp fiber without the use of slavery. See, for years and years they had used slavery to process hemp and hemp was what they used for canvas. That's why I can have the name canvas comes from the word cannabis. That's. That's literally Lamont. He wrote the declaration of independence on him, so the first drafts on hemp paper, it's a far superior paper.

Speaker 4:          02:32:19       Then wood pulp paper. Well, when they had come out with this article in popular science magazine, hemp, the new billion dollar crop, they were essentially saying that hemp, because of the decorticator now hemp would replace Wood for paper for all these other things, so I don't need to destroy the forest animal. William Randolf hearst not only owned these newspapers, but he also owned these paper mills and he owned these forests and he decided to combat this competing industry with propaganda. So they started printing these stories about how these black people and Mexicans were taking this wild drug. Marijuana women. Exactly. And then everybody was like Jesus. So when the. When Congress first made marijuana, first of all, marijuana was not even the word for cannabis. Marijuana was a word for a wild Mexican tobacco that had nothing to do with it. As Mexican. It was the exactly careful danger, danger to the cross, the border around ones.

Speaker 4:          02:33:17       And so they people responded to this and they, when they made it illegal, they didn't even understand that they were making cannabis. They didn't notice to understand. They were making the, the commodity hemp illegal like to this day until recently on it. We sell hemp protein. When we first started on it several years ago, we had to buy all of our hemp from Canada because even though it's not psychoactive, it was illegal still to grow in America. It's so stupid. It's just so tied, technically stupid. But the, you know, there's a, there's a crack in the dam now that you kind of stop it, man. That bowl was rolling now and people are waking up to the benefits, you know, how many states you're gotten in us now that's legal is quite a few medical and I think there's something like, what is it like nine recreational, Nevada, Massachusetts, California, Oregon, Washington state, Washington, DC that I say that already.

Speaker 4:          02:34:17       Um, I don't know. I mean the other ones there are main Alaska, Colorado, of course. Yeah. So how many of them legalized canvas? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven, legalized. And then jurisdiction with medical decriminalization that there's a lot of funky, weird shades too, that there's more than three shades there. You just make it illegal across the board. Well, it takes time, man. The amount of money. What's fascinating is the amount of money that is coming in and that's affecting it because these people are getting into Colorado. The was massive. Put it back into the school systems and the metal giving people tax refunds. Sorry, we made too much money tax at 39 percent. And everybody's like, okay, nobody gives a shit. I read that in, in Nevada, in vegas that literally running out. Oh yeah. Urgency. Oh, that's right.

Speaker 4:          02:35:17       Yeah. Well I hope not because I'm going there Saturday. Oh, they'll get you some. I'll hook it up. I know people, Nevada declares marijuana state of emergency to avoid $100,000,000 tax shortfall because they wanted the money from the marijuana because they were making so much money in taxes because I think, I think Nevada has 39 percent as well, right? They had a 39 percent tax rate. If it's 15 for recreational, only 15. Really think so. Well, they fucked up. They should've went 39. Nobody gives a shit. It's still five bucks for when you're buying it. I don't know if this, the works are getting texts too for what they sell. Recreational marijuana tax

Speaker 1:          02:35:50       fingers. The bowl was all in as not going to stop now. And uh, so many people out there have cured cancer as well about using the concentrated oil and stuff. I got a couple of friends that have cured their own concept from changing the Diet, uh, go into a plant based alkaline diet and taking the cannabis oil. And the doctors are like baffled. Yeah. So there's that. And that's a powerful thing. If somebody kills a concert, they're going to tell everybody. I tell everybody they know all their family and it's just a matter of time. Yeah. They just had something on the, on a mainstream, which I was surprised a mainstream a news show in England where they had this case of this kid who was in hospital is dying from. Can't remember what it was. But anyway, just the point is his mother was sneaking in the cannabis oil and he got cured for that. And then they did this whole thing on the breakfast tv about how the, you know, the kitchen was got rid of his constant. Now what I noticed, they still, you know, the obviously told to say this or that, you know, there's told this whole story about the kid is like, you know, it's kind of gone now because his mom was sneaking in the cannabis oil and wow, we need to look into this. But, but we must state everybody. People, we must tell you that we must, you know, it's not a cure. Right?

Speaker 4:          02:37:08       What the fuck you're talking about? The kids killed while you're talking about, it's not a cure, but it's obviously something they've got to state, you know, because it's actually illegal to

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       claim that you can cure cancer.

Speaker 2:          02:37:18       Well, it's illegal to possess the marijuana, so it's illegal probably to use it as a treatment even though it's effective, you have to say it's not a cure. Exactly. Under the influence of the pharmaceutical drug companies that will come down. I mean there's pharmaceutical drug companies that advertise on these networks, which becomes a huge problem because of their advertising abilify and fucking Welbutrin and all this different shit that they're selling. They're not going to be interested in you telling positive stories about abandoning all pharmaceutical drugs. Then taking natural remedies,

Speaker 3:          02:37:50       of course not as competent it. So what they're trying to do now is make you know, slightly different versions of it that the complaintant a swan company, I think at Gw pharmaceuticals and UK. What? Guess what? It doesn't fucking work when you do that. No, so I'm laughing at them and waste all your fucking money. The plant is perfect as it is, as a perfect balance is it's. It works as it is, so, but they can't trademark you trademark it, so you want to change it a little bit to create something can trademark and make tons of profit off. But guess what? Because it ain't working. Yeah. Once you. Once you change it, it doesn't work the way it's supposed to work.

Speaker 2:          02:38:27       It's all people trying to control shit. You know, it's people that are trying to control how much agriculture you could sell. I mean that's what it is. It's agriculture with marijuana really is a psychoactive agriculture. It's plants like the idea that you tell someone they can't grow tomatoes

Speaker 3:          02:38:43       in their backyard. It's fucking bananas close. It's a plant that grows from the ground exactly as it is. God fucking made plant grows from the ground. How? How can that be illegal? Right?

Speaker 2:          02:38:53       So if you have tomatoes in your backyard, everyone knows tomatoes have lots of vitamins are healthy for you and you know one who would say, oh, you can't do that.

Speaker 3:          02:39:00       I go to the Chinese have been using hubs so thousands of years. Sure. Marijuana is just the same thing. It's just, it's the mother of all

Speaker 1:          02:39:08       the fucking top, uh, you know, sometimes people get confused about like, Oh, you know, you're supposed to be healthy. Is supposed to be an athlete. What'd you doing? Smoking marijuana. I'm like, this is the fucking healthiest thing I do every day. I got like 40 tablets here. Yeah, I got fischels. They got vitamin C, got resveratrol, I got her herbs, I got everything in know. Well, guess what? More powerful than all those fucking things together, although they're beneficial is my cannabis oil I take every day. This is like, I don't know if you're familiar with a guy called Bob Melamede. Dr Bob Melamede, his, uh, studies a free radical is a human biologist, I think. And he states that a cannabis is the most powerful antioxidant, most powerful anti aging substance on the planet. Period. That's it. So I, I consider it a health supplement and yeah, I get high enough.

Speaker 3:          02:40:03       It's a health club too. And there's also ways you could take that are non psychoactive. You know, people that take cbds or I take this stuff. Charlotte's web, hemp oil. Take this everyday. That's a high cbd. It's

Speaker 2:          02:40:13       fantastic. That makes you feel good. It alleviates aches and pains is good for anxiety. It's good for mental clarity. It's just great for your body. It's just some. It's an essential oil for your body.

Speaker 1:          02:40:25       I got my left knee. The cartilage is gone. Uh, the shoulders, you know, not only the supraspinous that's gone the, you know, when I go for a scan, they're like, oh, didn't know you had your shoulder is the arthritis is really bad. You must spend a ton of pain. I'm like, nothing. I don't have any pain. I don't know if that's down to my kind of issues, but it definitely, definitely a factor in the, you know,

Speaker 2:          02:40:51       I'm sure it's a factor. Do you think also a factor is mental toughness because of the fact that you, your understanding of pain is probably way different than that.

Speaker 1:          02:40:58       How you perceive pain, you know, like you're not going to dwell on it the way that advertising is not a big deal. I'm, I live with that every day from, from training, and actually look forward to it in a way. Yeah. So probably my perception of pain is like, is less than everybody else's, but for sure, you know, when I'm asleep, if you had to reel arthritis, I mean it's going to wait. You're going to get paid. I don't get anything. So something I'm doing is helping. Um, yeah. I consider cannabis to, they'd be the most powerful health supplement you can take. I'm better than all the other stuff, but I still take all the other stuff as well because I'm stuck in all the odds in my favor, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:41:35       Yeah. I mean I think it's really important guys like you that are going against the grain explaining your position and, and also you as a respected professional athlete where people will listen to you and they go, oh, well this guy is such a straight shooter about steroids and about training and about injuries and all these other things. He's not going to lie about this.

Speaker 1:          02:41:54       Well, the people have just been had this misinformation for so long, so strong in that brain is like, it's hard to change. So a change that you know, especially if you don't have any experience with a soft, like this fucking drug. Like I dunno if somebody put on the instagram, I can't believe you ate smokes weed. I just fucking hate lazy stoners.

Speaker 3:          02:42:17       That's a pretty strong reaction man. Like you hate somebody because they're smoking a fucking lazy calling you lazy. It's hilarious. It's like an ally that I need to smoke weed to stop me from doing too much fucking. This is a slow me down. So like a normal level. Why listen yet

Speaker 1:          02:42:38       it, it can fucking slow you down and you know, you can sit and smoke fucking weed all day and sitting in the couch and watch TV and eat pizzas if you want like you know, but if you're smart you use it when it's the time to use it. And I like, uh, sometimes I like to smoke a little bit of cardio because it opens my broncos and I get a better fucking will count or it's generally in the evening when I'm relaxing or if I want to do something creative like I'm writing or something. It helps me like think a little bit, um, but there will be times when it's appropriate and times when it's not

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       appropriate and that's it, you know? No, I completely agree. I just think that it's a lot like what we're talking about earlier with fats and sugar, that there's this misinformation that continues forever. It's like once you get an idea in your head, oh, low fat is good, high fat is bad, and then somewhere along the line you realize that that's bullshit. Like what you might realize that you might do the research, you might go into the article and then look at the studies and go, wow, this is insane. And how did this happen? And go into the New York Times article about the sugar industry, bing. But once you get to a certain point in time, you realize like most people are not going to do all this. They're not going to look into this. They're not going to get. So most people are going to hear what they heard when they were little marijuana is for losers. Marijuana makes you lazy. You're going to be a lazy stoner. I don't want to be that marijuana is bad. Like jeff sessions, the fucking guys on record saying, good people do not smoke marijuana. Dude. You're talking about millions of people. You're saying none of them are good people

Speaker 1:          02:44:13       generally. Is it? That is a thing of the people that smoke marijuana are generally nicer. Kind of more thoughtful people and realize that in some way we're all connected. We're all, we're not fucking independent, so how's that better

Speaker 2:          02:44:30       thing? Because he doesn't smoke pot. That's the problem. Oh, we need to fucking hold him down and make him smoke pot. That's what we need to do. But he'll freak out. Apparently Joey Diaz gave pauly shore some stars of death on his podcast and now polly won't release the podcast. He's like, hide it, burn it, burn it with fire, kill it, kill it like a demon.

Speaker 1:          02:44:49       I mean, cannabis is so good that when you smoke it, which is full of fucking tall and costage ins and everything in smoke into your lungs, it doesn't even damage your lungs.

Speaker 2:          02:45:02       Yeah. I think it's supposed to be a different type of smoke though, like the smoke that you get, it's probably harsh, but it doesn't have the same, but the properties of it don't have the same. Like the, the issue apparently with tobacco in particular, like just regular tobacco. If you're smoking, a regular rolled cigarette of hand rolled tobacco, just pure tobacco. No, no. Uh, other bullshit ingredients is not as bad for you as a cigarette, but still bad. I've got a ton of chemicals in this. Hundreds of chemicals by the way, approved by our government. They're like, yeah, pour it in there. It's good. It must be good, man. It's going to get people to throw it in there.

Speaker 1:          02:45:38       Government govern what government's meant is your mind.

Speaker 2:          02:45:43       But marijuana smoke has been shown to be an expectorant actually can clear the lungs of certain issues. It

Speaker 1:          02:45:50       highlights the Broncos as opposed to the backhoe is closing them all the time. Um, I don't know if you're familiar with a study that was done here at Ucla. I believe a guy called Donald Tuscan. He did it over 20 years. It was a properly funded study. While I was at properly funded, because it was funded to look for negative results, so the purpose of this study was to prove that smoking cannabis damages your lungs just like cigarettes, right? So the followed three groups over 20 years, cigarette smokers only or tobacco tobacco and marijuana together and marijuana only and to tobacco smokers over 20 years, of course, loss of lung function, a lot of cancers, all the stuff we already know. The middle group was way less and the marijuana group smoker, like daily smoking over 20 years was no increased cancer. There was no loss of lung function, in fact, that had a slight increase in lung function as compared to nonsmokers

Speaker 2:          02:46:55       other exercise and taking big tokes. That's what he gets

Speaker 1:          02:46:59       because you're taking in, but not only that, because the cannabis is dilating the broncos all the time. If you keep dialing and keep dialing and keep dialing, it's going to get more. You know it's going to get more functional. Well, it makes sense. I mean just it's counterintuitive to a lot of people that think that's negative. It's bad for you. So I just see it as a super health supplement. I don't see anything negative. I don't see it as a drug. Just the plant and yeah, you get high and you feel good. So what's in your life? It's silly shit. Good for you. Right?

Speaker 2:          02:47:30       I agree. And I think that people are starting to understand that more now than when we were kids for sure.

Speaker 1:          02:47:35       Yeah. I used to smoke when I was a teenager and in England we mix it with tobacco or this, just until I came here. I don't know, like people smoke it pure. I don't mix with tobacco now because I'm realizing the weed is good and tobacco is bad. Before I didn't know both. Probably bad for you and I'll give a shit, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:47:52       Yeah. How did that get started in England? Because every time had been over England. They do that too. They're like, do you make sure we'd. With tobacco it's was like, what? Yeah, I don't know man. That was like, that's how it was always done that way when I grew up.

Speaker 1:          02:48:02       Um, I grew up in Birmingham as a ton of Jamaicans, you know, so the Jamaicans were the guys that brought the weed and, and stuff like that, but even they used to mix with tobacco and a lot of people smoke cash. So how she got to, you got to Mexico, you know, with something. Right. So people mentioned it with tobacco, but I think last time I smoked tobacco was probably like eight, nine years ago when I became educated and I was like, wow, this cannabis is really good on its own.

Speaker 2:          02:48:28       A lot of people in America, they take a cigar, they take out the, the tobacco. Yeah. And they make a blunt out of it. But you're taking in tobacco and belief and he gives you this weird high.

Speaker 1:          02:48:40       Yeah, because you're getting that nicotine buzz, like a head buzz,

Speaker 2:          02:48:45       but you're also inhaling in a way that you don't do with cigars. You don't. Usually you puff it out, right? Yeah. You, you get the tobacco, it gets into your body from your mouth, but you don't really inhale deep into the. I like to use it, the

Speaker 1:          02:48:58       hemp papers and also I vaporize extract as well. Yeah, like dabbing Nicole here. Um, so I do that. I find, I don't know, I find it a bit different between smoking weed and Dab in the extract smoking weed. I find it a bit more relaxing. Dabbing the extract is like, I'll do that before I go on a bike ride or

Speaker 4:          02:49:18       cardio or something. And I'm like, man, they don't get tired, don't get tired. I know, right. Isn't it amazing?

Speaker 1:          02:49:28       Uh, you can, you know, whatever you do in running. First of all it's, it's dilating your bronco so you can deliver more oxygen. But I think also it's the mental thing they like get in that zone and perceived pain is less. Discomfort is less. So you just keep, just keep going. Yeah. Um, yeah. One of the guys in Brazil, like all smoke before the do Jujitsu because it helps to be relaxed, right? When you're doing that, you know, want to be all tense all the time.

Speaker 4:          02:49:54       Not just relaxed but also singularly focused. Yeah. Yeah. It's America to giant percentage of people smoke pot for the Jujitsu. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big, big thing.

Speaker 1:          02:50:05       Bought bodybuilding as well. Really mean I'm the only one that talks about it because all those guys are like scared, like uh, it's going to be viewed negatively or their sponsors are gonna like, you know, drop them or something like that. Yeah. Well I can tell you like half the guys on the Olympic stage, they'll stone us because it helps you relax after training. You can't drink. Right. You know, because the calories and if you're drinking the next day you're not going to perform so well. I mean you can get totally fucking high tonight and you can go in a gym tomorrow morning. One hundred percent have a negative effect. Right? Zero.

Speaker 4:          02:50:39       Do you remember the Arnold? I'm sure you do. Arnold is numero uno token on a little one though. I mean that was. People were like, what is he doing back then it was almost like he was getting drunk or something.

Speaker 1:          02:50:54       Yeah. People didn't even think about it and he was the only one. It wasn't. He wasn't passing it around other people. He was the only one on camera smoking. Yeah, they look guys, we'll probably schedule on the smoke on camera, you know? Yeah. Well, it's still viewed negatively, you know, like, uh, an athlete say he smokes marijuana, he's risking maybe losing is a sponsorship and uh, uh, I don't give a shit. I don't have sponsors. I'm independent. So you know, a bit more free to speak out.

Speaker 4:          02:51:25       Well, the crazy thing to me was the nfl, the nfl saying that these guys can't smoke pot and they suspend them for smoking pot. Meanwhile it's okay to run full speed at each other and smash into each other and the massive amount of damage that's doing, that's, that's not, that's not a problem, but the problem that would actually help with brain injuries because a lot of studies,

Speaker 1:          02:51:49       you know, with Alzheimer's and stuff like that, that's very protective on the brain. So maybe it could have helped them. If anything I would definitely wouldn't hurt. No

Speaker 4:          02:51:57       harm them. And even if it's just cbd oil, it's a neuroprotectant canabinoids yeah. Yeah. It's, I mean, we living in an age where information is leaking out there and people understand things more today than they ever did before where there's still a massive amount of ignorance that you have to combat,

Speaker 1:          02:52:14       but it's, you know, it's a head of 10 years ago. Yeah, right. And, uh, I live in Europe, although I live in Spain now and in Spain it's not legal, but it's, um, it's legal to grow in your house for your own use is legal to smoke in your house for your own use. So what's happened is, um, these collectors are being created, so, all right, so I can smoke in my own private residence and I can grow whatever, let's say three plants for myself. I'll get bullied. So what if there's 100 of us now in this collective, in this club. So now we can grow 300 plants. And so that's how it is. It's supposed to be nonprofit organizations. Um, so when you go and you buy your weed, you're not technically buying a weed, you're contributing to the upkeep of the collective. That makes sense.

Speaker 1:          02:53:03       So that's how it works. Uh, and then uh, in Holland it's um, tolerated they call it technically is not legal is tolerated, so the console in the coffee shops there and whatever, and Amsterdam, so those two countries a little bit ahead, but everywhere else is still still not legal. Like in UK where I come from, it's not legal, but the police have already stated then going to arrest people for smoking weed because they're considered a waste of their time. Um, so any major city in England, you go walk down the street, you can smell weed. People just walk down the street and smoking weed. If the police are there, they might say, hey, you know, come on, put that out. But that's as far as it goes. So technically it's still illegal, but it's kind of like, you know, the police are not, they don't care about it unless you're selling it.

Speaker 4:          02:53:53       I think Canada is set to essentially legalize it nationwide and think that's the most recent revelation from Canada. They're essentially ready to just kind of has always been a pretty good weed country. Right? Yeah. Well, the Vancouver in particular, there's a great documentary about the marijuana industry and it's impact on Vancouver. It's called the union fantastic documentary. Just showing how ridiculous it is and how inexorably tied marijuana is to their entire economy in Vancouver. I mean, it's, the money that comes in from marijuana is just a gigantic portion of their economy and it's all this.

Speaker 1:          02:54:29       So that's why Colorado setting such an example of making so much money, like we got to be other states looking at it like a think fucking Detroit should get on that.

Speaker 4:          02:54:40       Trying to fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Detroit's a mess. Right. And coming back with like, um, handmade stuff, there's a bunch of things like different industries and different small businesses are starting to emerge in Detroit that are kind of very, very promising. But yeah, that would be a huge factor.

Speaker 1:          02:54:58       Now there's a huge industry out there, uh, not just grow in the, all the other. I come here and it's like I'm a kid in a candy shop. You know, you got chocolate and it's like tells you how much thc is in each square. We've got breast brave man, you got butter, you've got cakes, you've got everything man, and I'm like, yeah, you're careful with those cakes though. Yeah, well, edibles. I always tell people, be careful with edibles because if you're smoking a joint and you take a couple of puffs, it's going to hit you pretty much immediately to your brain, so you're going to feel it and you're to decide whether you want to smoke some more on that or maybe you want to just put it down right and chill, but when you eat it, it's going to take 45 minutes to an hour, so hit your system and you don't know what, how strong that's going to be and if it's too strong, which most of the time it is.

Speaker 1:          02:55:49       If you're not experienced then you're on that fucking ride and you can't get off hours and it can be pretty unpleasant, mean like too much thc. For somebody that's not used to it, you can feel very paranoid and very uncomfortable. You can feel nausea, she might vomit. You're going to get low blood sugar a. all this stuff is not going to be a nice experience and probably then you're going to have a negative view of cannabis. Like, fuck that shit. I'm not going anywhere near that again. Um, so unless you're experienced, I would just say stay away from edibles or like just have a small piece and wait a fucking hour. Don't, don't be tempted to like, oh, I don't feel anything. I'll take another one, then you're going to be fucked. That's great advice. Go stepped gingerly. Yeah, go very slowly. And the edibles because it takes time to digest it.

Speaker 1:          02:56:38       Time to get into the bloodstream and time to feel it. So most people will eat some and say, I don't feel anything. I don't have another one. And then, you know, it's, I've seen it happen so many times that it's too late. Yeah. And it's not going to be over in five minutes. You're going to have hours of that. Like, you know, and then they just to say that's, that's kind of stuff is bad as you know. It's horrible. It's fine. That's the beautiful thing. Even after a horrendous, terrifying, nothing bad can happen to you physically, you might vomit as like the worst thing that could happen, but you got to be careful because I read the other day, right, that uh, there is a level at which cannabis can kill you. So you've got to be careful that you don't smoke 628 kilos cannabis in 15 minutes because if you do that, that could be toxic.

Speaker 1:          02:57:29       That could be lethal. Someone out there is going to try to prove you wrong. Yeah. One point five fucking tons in 15 minutes. If you're going to hail that, like good luck to you. I think that's actually the ld 52, which means liesel lethal dose for 50 percent of the population. Fifty percent of the population are most definitely pussies survive that anyway. I mean I couldn't smoke a fucking, I dunno in 15 minutes. How much could you smoke? Like five grams or something. Like, I don't know, in the. You could do more than that, but in a vaporizer you can get pretty deep. But yeah, you're not going to get anywhere near 620. I don't know why that came at 628. Six hundred and 27 or 600. Twenty nine. I Dunno, it's theoretical anyway because no one's ever died from it. No one's ever died from it.

Speaker 1:          02:58:14       So like what other substance? Kenya not die from it. Even water is you have too much water. You drown. Right? So I mean this is pretty harmless fucking substance. If there's no, there's no feasible toxic level. Alright, 600, 28 kilos. I'm taking the piss like, you know, I couldn't smoke that in my lifetime. How often do you smoke pot? Every day. Damn Day man. Gentlemen, every day I take my vitamin C everyday as well. Fish oil. The rest of us are at all, like all antioxidants. I said daily thing man. I might go, I go sometimes with not smoking for a week or two just because I want to have the discipline to, you know, to say I don't need to do this everyday, but I fucking luck to do it everyday. So why not, you know, I hear you man. And we're not. You know, I don't get up in the morning and smoke when I got shit to do because it might not help me do that stuff, but if I'm working out or if I'm going to lie on a beach, I'm going up the mountains.

Speaker 1:          02:59:13       Yeah. I'll take a joint with me. One. Why not? It just enhances everything. You know, enhances you. Your experience enhances food and sex. Enhances music. You're preaching to the choir, man. I know. I know. You know, other people are listening. I know what I'm saying. I'm saying I'm with you. Yeah. No. Uh, I mean I couldn't agree more. Listen man, we just did three hours. I crazy can went quick like that. Yeah. I wouldn't say that like an hour and a half or something. Anything else to say to the people before we wrap this bitch up? A. I hate to be the guy that goes on. Chet chosen promotes things, but I'm going to have to do this. Please do. Yeah. Am going to be in Vegas on Saturday and we got a thing called swiftly the, uh, the date. Actual date. Saturday is 29. Ninth. Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:00:02       I'm going to be in Vegas, we've got a competition called Super League and this is for bodybuilders slash strength athletes and it's somewhat functional because, you know, you get a bodybuilder on stage and the general public look at that and say what the fuck is this like strange and maybe a product of just taking drugs and they don't appreciate the work that goes into that and how strong and athletic some of these guys can be. So this competition is, has two rounds. The first round is lifting, so you get judged on eight different exercises you score a maximum of 12 reps at. So um, there's that and then there's the physique round, but it's, it's done by computer, so it scans various areas of your body and gives you a score on that. Sounds a bit complex. But if you want to go on superleague live, it's got explain everything. Have you been doing this for? This is going to be the first one. Ah,

Speaker 1:          03:01:00       and uh, we weren't sure like what reaction we get with the first one, but it's been off the fucking hook and I think we're going to get a new breed of athletes that are maybe not purely physique bodybuilders as like the Mr Olympia. We've got guys coming from power lifting, we've got guys coming from bodybuilding, there's a lot of guys out there in the gyms around the world that are fucking athletic, strong, freaky guys and girls. We've got both categories that maybe don't want to compete in a bodybuilding competition for various reasons or they do want to compete in a bodybuilding competition and they want something alternative to do. We've got a competition between a team la and team Atlanta as well. And we've got interest for the roll this out internationally. So

Speaker 3:          03:01:44       keep your eye on that man. People go to it. Where, what

Speaker 1:          03:01:48       superleague alive. And the contest is in the city Athletic Club, German in Vegas, which is like the biggest German Vegas.

Speaker 3:          03:01:56       Okay. And so the website for it would be hopefully live or superleague.live. I'm not sure what superleague live.live, something like that.

Speaker 1:          03:02:06       And uh, I'm going to be there Sunday and a lot of other people from the, from the sport and

Speaker 3:          03:02:11       on invite Joe Rogan. If you've got spare time. I'm actually going to be at the UFC Saturday. It's in Anaheim, so unfortunately it's a good card. Very excited about it. Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier. Oh Great. And that's in Vegas as well? No, that's out here in Anaheim on a cowboy cerrone and Robbie law. It's a great car. It actually, it's one of the best cars in a year. I'm just joking. So I would do whatever you want folks, but superleague is going to be awesome. I'm sure. Listen man, it was an honor and a pleasure. I really, really appreciate you having me on. It's been A. Yeah, like three hours has gone like nothing. Like nothing. I'm sure we could talk for fucking 24 hours, but I bet we could. It's time to smoke a joint. I agree. Alright. Alright everybody. Thank you brother. Appreciate it. See you guys tomorrow.
