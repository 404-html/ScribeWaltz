Speaker 1:          00:00:01       5 4 3 2 1. Now we're live yes. Hello.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       Hello. What's happenin. Not much I'm excited to be here.

Speaker 3:          00:00:14       I'm excited to have you here. Your father speaks very highly of you. That's good. What is it like to have Jordan Peterson as a dad. Is it weird you have to check yourself constantly and make sure you're on. Your unsteady ground and I say anything ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          00:00:28       No not at all. Not at all. I didn't realize it was weird until I went away to university and then kind of. So I just I was away for a while and then when I came back to the house especially because the house is full of like paintings and masks and statues and like 32 different paint colors and I came back and was like oh maybe he's a bit eccentric.

Speaker 3:          00:00:49       Now he's definitely IG centric. We were talking off air about what it was like to watch your dad become famous and become famous and in his 50s right.

Speaker 4:          00:01:00       Like yeah I hope fifty four fifty five.

Speaker 5:          00:01:03       That's when he became famous before that relatively unknown respected professor. One issue with this one transgender Bill the the preferred pronouns bill and then boom.

Speaker 4:          00:01:16       Off to the races. Yeah strange it was. Yeah it was super weird especially how the media was portraying him and how what was actually happening at the events wasn't what was being portrayed in the media. So that was weird to watch and then people recognizing him on the street is strange. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:01:34       When you say what what happened in real life was not was what was being portrayed like what was different.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       Mostly what he was saying. So most of what he said is on film anyway so you can go to YouTube and see what he's been saying like not there's not like some secret that's going around. But what's been portrayed has been so much more negative than what he's actually said or they'll take like sound bites and just weave a story that isn't quite true. Which I didn't read for some reason I know it looks silly but for some reason I just thought that what the media was portraying was honest always. Yeah yeah me too. Yeah yeah. And it's not.

Speaker 5:          00:02:13       Well the writers you know and what's there's real issue today that that issue I've talked about this before but the issue is clicks Yeah. It's not just about what's the facts of the story. It's about these publications are struggling to stay alive. And one of the only ways that they can get people to click on stories is salacious headlines real make things really click baby. And that's what they focus on and they focus on negative aspects that are going to get people riled up. They have to have an angle. And I've talked to people who are writers who will write something and then I'll talk to them and I'll say Hey man this is not what we talked about or what happened. And they said I'm going to be honest with you. I didn't even write that the headline was completely written by the editor. So the editor came and changed it all up changed this switch put some dot dot dot side of things you know. So cut off sentences so that they seemed more you know just more controversial than they really are because they didn't allow the counterpoint of you know sometimes you say something and they say or it could be this or the or it could be this part is cut out.

Speaker 6:          00:03:19       You know they do things like that just to stay alive because I think when you I mean really big publications whether it's the New York Times or whether you know the Boston Globe like big publications are struggling for their life right now because people who want to buy newspapers anymore and you know and getting people to read things online is very difficult and you have to you have to do something salacious. You have to do something that's enticing for them to click on it.

Speaker 7:          00:03:44       Yeah. Gasp and I wouldn't you say that's just driving them down. Yeah yeah. Yeah they're fucked. It's a bad place to be. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:03:53       And I think it's you know it opens up the door for alternative media. But some of those alternative media sources don't have journalistic integrity either. So that it becomes a real issue. You know that's that's a problem with lot of online news shows. It's like they take a very obvious editorial spin as well on the news.

Speaker 6:          00:04:17       And if you just read or watch their show you would go oh well it's this way because these guys are saying it's this way. But it might not be that way. There's no real objective source is very hard to find a good objective source. I mean sometimes I count on the New York Times but there's been some things that I've read from The New York Times that I know or not.

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       I think they had a terrible article about Dad. Oh yeah. Like June or something. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:04:43       He didn't make it any easier on himself by using that forced monogamy or term no enforced monogamy argument or term because I don't I don't even with the when you understand it as a psychological concept that it is a culturally enforced idea. I still don't think that applies to in cells. I don't I just don't you know only it makes any difference at all and he and I discussed it on the podcast you're not just because you say it's a good idea and the culture agrees it's a good idea for people to be monogamous I don't necessarily think that that is going to help these guys at all. I don't think we know what's going to help those guys. Yeah well obviously they're all individuals and their situations vary but when we're talking about people like what the fuck are they talking about. There was a quote in The New York Times where this woman was asking him what to do about these in cells which are involuntary celibate and one of them had driven a car into a crowd of people and killed a bunch of people because he was frustrated because he couldn't find a mate.

Speaker 3:          00:05:50       And your dad suggested that if culturally enforced monogamy would be perhaps a solution for that and then a bunch of you went crazy saying that like women. He's saying that women should sacrifice themselves fuck these guys that they don't drive cars in the crowds. Yes. Yeah. It was the whole everybody made a mistake. Yeah. Yeah. I don't see there's an answer for those guys. I really don't. But now with that but that is that those kind of articles are like the editorial articles and opinion articles. It's really it's a different thing than reporting on the news right.

Speaker 2:          00:06:30       Yeah I thought I thought so honesty was always a big thing in our house and was like Don't lie because if you lie eventually the lie will surface and will be so much bigger than the how you get from telling the truth. So I kind of just assumed that the media did that. Yeah the world just worked like that. Yeah no. Now I know that now. Yeah

Speaker 5:          00:06:54       . So you and your dad a bolt on this wacky diet you're both on this wacky carnivore diet and this is probably one of the most controversial things in our relationship in relation to food today. When. When people discuss diets you know there's a lot of people that are vegetarian or vegan or try and ketogenic diet or paleo but when you say carnivore that is one of the ones where people just universally seem to like step back roll their eyes. Most people don't think it's a good idea. They don't even know why they don't think it's a good idea. And then you tell them about people like you or my friend Chris Bell who has similar autoimmune issues and he's had hip to hip replacements. He's only 36 now and I think he had both of them done by the time he was 30 right. Pretty sure because he's had them for quite a few years you know massive joint pain of all sorts of issue and you when did you got a hip replacement. How old were you.

Speaker 2:          00:08:05       Seventeen and an ankle replacement. Seventeen. Days is a rough year.

Speaker 3:          00:08:10       That's crazy. What do you so your whole life. You've had arthritis issues or.

Speaker 4:          00:08:17       Yeah. So I started walking kind of funny when I was two. According to my mom and she brought me to the doctor and they said just having growing pains or something when I was 7 I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and I had like 37 joints affected. And then I was put on immunosuppressants in Grade 4.

Speaker 2:          00:08:34       So I was actually the first kid in Canada to be put on this biologic called Enbrel goes on and roll and methotrexate for ever like leading up to the hip an ankle replacement and they did help reduce some of the pain but I still ended up with no cartilage in my joint and hip my hip and ankle when I was 17 and this is just from the effects of arthritis and the inflammation swelling and just to the cartilage.

Speaker 4:          00:09:02       So I wasn't even particularly swollen I didn't have a very inflammatory visually inflammatory arthritis so my rheumatologist who had been at Sick Kids for 20 years said that I had the worst arthritis she'd ever seen. So it was very severe. It wasn't particularly like swollen my joints just disintegrated Wow.

Speaker 7:          00:09:25       Mm hmm. What do they think causes something like this.

Speaker 2:          00:09:28       They didn't know. So it was. Eventually after the hip and ankle replacement the diagnosis was changed to juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Speaker 8:          00:09:36       So it was literally like we don't know well.

Speaker 5:          00:09:40       And how did you go from these medications pharmaceutical medications to getting into this carnivore diet thing. What was this. This path.

Speaker 4:          00:09:54       Well OK I'll give you a background of the path. We were very like science oriented especially dad. So even though mom kind of wanted to delve into diet and was like we should go sugar free or stop eating you know whatever make sure you'd whole grains like all that stuff we never gave diet. A chance because there was no scientific evidence for it. So I basically got sicker and sicker and sicker and I ended up by the time I got to university I ended up with arthritis I was severely depressed. I was on anti-depressants as well. I had idiopathic hyper Sonia I was sleeping about 18 hours a day. My whole body was itchy all the time. That started when I was about 14 and so that was when I started university and then my diet just got disastrous in university and I was like drinking all the time and eating like pizza and beer.

Speaker 4:          00:10:52       And I gained like 30 pounds in the first year. And ginger ale a lot of ginger ale. Anyway I gained about 30 pounds in the first year. My mental health declined even further. And I didn't really know what was going on. And then I started getting skin issues so I started getting rashes cystic acne and I was like OK I can deal with like four really awful health problems but I can't deal with things affecting my skin on top of that. There's too many things. I went to dermatologists and they basically told me I was anxious and like causing these rashes by itching so that was the dermatologists opinion which is very unhelpful. Anyway I spent a lot of time. I was eventually prescribed Adderall for the hyper sommelier. So I spent all my time googling reading papers trying to get a background on skin disorders.

Speaker 4:          00:11:45       And eventually I came across this Celiac Disease rash online and that's what I had it looked exactly the same. So I cut out gluten. I read a whole bunch about the effects of gluten on the guide and thought oh there's actually some evidence that gluten isn't good for people why aren't people being told this like why didn't my doctor test me for celiac disease because Celiac Disease couples with autoimmune disorders all the time like they test type 1 kids for celiac disease. But for some reason they don't test kids with arthritis for celiac disease. So kind of gluten and that kind of helped maybe like 20 percent but it was hard to tell because it was the summer was like maybe I'm just feeling better from the summer. My rash kind of went down but it was still there and then. So September 2015 my mom dragged me to a natural path and they gave me the sheet of foods like try this elimination diet.

Speaker 4:          00:12:36       And I looked at the sheet and thought this doesn't make any sense like why can I eat lemons and not oranges and why are almonds on there but other nuts are off. So I cut. So I thought OK I'm going to do an elimination diet which I didn't believe in at all. I'll cut down to what I considered safe foods. And I had no idea what I was doing. So I just thought OK vegetables are pretty safe I'll get rid of nightshade because people talk about them being bad like cheese was nitrates next to AIDS like tomatoes eggplant those kind of foods for some reason there. I just knew that they were then referred to as nitrates. I feel like literally everybody has heard them referred to as Nightshade.

Speaker 9:          00:13:13       No. Have you heard them.

Speaker 10:         00:13:15       I've heard the term but not. I couldn't tell you what it was.

Speaker 7:          00:13:18       I wouldn't have been able to say it as an eggplant so I think maybe it's just kids don't make it to the end. I don't think so. No. Oh okay. Well at the YouTube comments. Decide. Don't let them decide okay. It's like calling demons for help too good.

Speaker 4:          00:13:38       Anyway I cut down so I was eating mostly like green vegetables. I was still eating rice at that point because I thought everybody eats rice rice is safe and meat but I cut out like dairy. Most grains soy sugar processed foods and then in the next month my joints got way better and my skin healed and my skin never healed like for a couple of years. I'd always have these flare ups and never went away. And that was just on a like relatively low carb diet just like just less. I don't know. I was still eating rice right. But it was still mostly meat and vegetables and I thought OK maybe there's something to this. And then I made almond flour gluten free sugar free dairy free almond flour banana muffins and I ate a bunch of those one night and I woke up and the next day my wrists were sore and I thought OK maybe that's weird.

Speaker 4:          00:14:37       And then I had a bunch more than muffins because the muffins were good and and then I went away to college that weekend and I couldn't walk because of my knees and I never had flare ups that badly like I used to get my shoulder was always sore when I slept so I took Tylenol three at night for sleeping and my wrists were stiff but I never had like a flare up like I couldn't walk. So that was that weekend. So then I went back to the diet and got really strict with it and then things were better like my skin was better I I lost. This was weird. I lost five pounds which wasn't a lot but I went down three pant sizes so it was all bloating that I didn't realize was bloating because it never fluctuated. So that was the first month and then 2015 and then I started trying to reintroduce foods because I was having cravings and I missed going out to eat with my friends and everything.

Speaker 4:          00:15:34       So I tried to read the first thing I tried to reintroduce was sour patch Candy because I was having really intense sugar look at me like that I was having really intense sugar cravings and I looked at the packet and I thought OK no one's allergic to sugar there's no dairy there's no gluten there's no soy. This will be fine. And I really wanted to eat them and I had those and the next day my whole body was itchy again and it was like like mosquito bites everywhere itchy. So I thought OK maybe maybe that was a bad idea. So I waited a couple of weeks and I tried to reintroduce almond butter organic almond butter because I wanted something fast protein fast and then I had a slight abdominal cramping diarrhea then this itch came back to Jesus Christ. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       So for the next year well I'll slow down. We've got some time. That was that was the almond butter. So then I waited a while and I felt pretty good. This was November 2015. And then I started feeling really good and I went off of my anti-depressants and I had been taking anti-depressants since I was in grade 5 a really high dose of an SSRI which had been very helpful.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       But do you wean yourself off and do it under a doctor's supervision.

Speaker 2:          00:16:55       No I didn't. You didn't right. I weaned myself down so I went down to half and then I went to a quarter and then I went to an eighth and then I stopped taking how long to wait time. It was nothing really. Over two weeks it was two weeks. Yeah. I didn't have withdrawal symptoms like I think maybe I was lucky that way. And so you died at this point was so at that point I was eating rice occasionally but it was mostly like broccoli salad chicken beef fish you know olive oil apple cider vinegar salt pepper at that point I was also eating pears and apples. So it was kind of like paleo kind of very restricted paleo dairy free.

Speaker 5:          00:17:39       And so you're feeling good you're off your medication your joints feel better. No more rashes no more rashes Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:17:45       So everything seems to be improving. I was shocked when the depression lifted because I thought that runs in my family that's familial we have some sort of brain chemistry problem that can't possibly be diet. I thought I thought the skin maybe that was diet because this gluten link and then maybe because of the celiac gene that I got tested for maybe the arthritis was part of that but I never thought mood was associated with it. So that was a surprise in November. Anyway I went off of the anti-depressants and then I'm about a month later I tried to reintroduce soy and this is when things started getting really weird that year.

Speaker 5:          00:18:21       So I was having are you reintroducing things if you're having all these positive benefits.

Speaker 2:          00:18:27       I was having cravings like crazy and I would miss eating out and I thought there were probably like four or five foods I was really sensitive to and if I could just figure out what they were I could eat pretty normally. I didn't realize like I didn't know what was going on. If I had known I would have done it much different. But I tried to reintroduce soy because at that point I still thought soy was a health food. So I ate a huge meal of like at a mommy beans and bean sprouts and miso soup that I made myself. So it was gluten free and soy sauce and tofu. I literally aid soy in every form and I had the same kind of reaction with almond butter. I had immediately got bloated I had diarrhea like within maybe 20 30 minutes of eating it.

Speaker 4:          00:19:15       And I thought OK that's OK I guess I can't eat soy. And then about four hours later my legs got edgy and then my whole body got itchy and I was like OK that sucks I'm clearly I'm reacting to soy. And then the next morning the depression came back and it came back like that was the worst depressive experience I've ever had. I was medication free and it came back in the morning and I got in the shower and I just like I bawled in the shower and thought how could I be so naive to think that my horrible auto immune disorder and the depression and everything was caused by food like what an idiotic thing to think how could I be that hopeful and then I had to remind myself OK. No you ate a whole bunch of this food then you had this like digestive distress then you got itchy.

Speaker 4:          00:20:03       And now the depression is back. There's clearly a pattern here. It was hard to think like that when I got that depressed so that day was like I spent a lot of that day crying. Then the next day got worse. And this is this is when it gets weird. So that night I went over to my parents and I was just like I don't know what's going on right. And they're like Well don't take a car back to your apartment. I said I don't think I can drive like I can't I just can't think I don't know what's going on. So my brother drove me home and I was like on the verge of having a panic attack for no reason writers just like my heart rate was increasing I was trying to find my keys and I turned around to look at my brother in the car and his head was a like a kind of a demon. This

Speaker 2:          00:20:56       I know how this sounds but he had like a demon head for about a second and a half and he looked at me and then he turned and then it was my brother again. So standing is what your. For like a Yeah about a second and a half the hallucinations that year yes. Before that. No. That year. Yeah. After this I'll get into.

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       So you eat soy and started tripping.

Speaker 2:          00:21:21       Yeah. Two days later. I know how it sounds. That's how it sounded to me too.

Speaker 6:          00:21:26       Have you found comparable stories. So.

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       So obviously I did as much research as I could possibly do to soy no to gluten. To people who are schizophrenic from gluten. Yeah there are people with celiac disease who have schizophrenia induced by gluten. So I found that but I didn't find anything for other foods.

Speaker 5:          00:21:50       But the skills of schizophrenia include hallucinations rarely visual.

Speaker 2:          00:21:55       But I did find a case study of a woman who was seeing demons from her Celiac Disease gluten.

Speaker 5:          00:22:01       Now when you say you looked over and you saw your brother and his head was a demon had like describe it like no I found them.

Speaker 2:          00:22:12       No it was like eat. You know when it's really dark in a room. And I don't know if you've experienced this but it's really dark in the room. And then you kind of kind of see things in the dark. Mm hmm. It was more like that. It was dark at night and it was like I was so anxious so distraught.

Speaker 3:          00:22:29       You're a mess and maybe you just caused yourself to while something idea okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:35       Yeah I mean I saw it like I can remember what it looks like but it wasn't a vivid demon or something. It was like but it was there okay. So you're freaking out. I'm so I'm freaking out so I'm like OK that's not good. I find my keys and I go upstairs and then I went into my bedroom and shut the blinds turned on all the lights. And then like smoked as much weed as I could possibly smoke to try and calm myself down and then hid under the blankets all night.

Speaker 11:         00:22:59       I would think that would be the worst thing to do. A demon.

Speaker 2:          00:23:01       You'd think that but then if you I've had that comment before but enough and it calm me down. Okay. So then I spent the next couple of weeks basically stoned because I didn't know when it was going to end. I didn't know what was going on and I couldn't find anybody on the internet who had had the same experience as me and then about two and a half weeks later it started going away. And so you say it.

Speaker 3:          00:23:30       You mean the depression.

Speaker 4:          00:23:31       Depression the arthritis. It wasn't that just the depression that came that's just just the words I know I didn't go back. I mean I need soy again but I went back to the initial diet.

Speaker 5:          00:23:41       I was eating so essentially just this one meal this one great meal of soy threw you off for a couple of weeks right.

Speaker 2:          00:23:48       Yeah like almost for like three weeks but after two weeks it started getting better. But the symptoms were like So that's deplorable the itching started I had bloating and then the depression came back. And then about a week later my skin started breaking out. And then maybe ten days later my arthritis came back. So I wrote all my symptoms down every day because I was going crazy and I didn't know what was going on and I wanted to write it down to see what was going on. OK. So then I started lifting and I started feeling better again and I was like OK thank God that's over and then waited while things were good again. My symptoms went away. And then over the next year I tried to reintroduce foods over and over and over again and I was making it like I tried whey protein powder and that didn't help. Nothing ever got to as bad as that soy experience but I had a number of other experiences where it was the worst depression I've ever experienced and it was on the verge of seeing like I don't know seeing faces and things.

Speaker 3:          00:24:57       So you're having all these health issues. How do you get to the carnivore diet.

Speaker 2:          00:25:01       So I decide about a year later I decide hey maybe I don't want to keep cycling in and out of a horrible autoimmune mental problems maybe I'll just stick with the original diet. Mm hmm. And then I got pregnant and so then my auto immune symptoms flared again during the pregnancy. Yeah like right away as soon as I found out I was pregnant it was like before I found out I was pregnant that my autoimmune symptoms came back so my legs were itchy again. I was. My joints were stiff my skin was breaking out my anxiety was back and it was hard to tell Well what part of this is pregnancy and what part of this is an autoimmune disorder. So throughout my pregnancy I cut down on all the carbs I was eating so I cut out fruit and cut out sweet potatoes I went down to meat and greens and I think dad was on here one time and he was on a meat and greens diet. So that was doing that part. So we're both on the meat and greens diet mostly because we didn't realize you didn't need Greens to survive so we were eating meat greens and then I have to say mostly because we realize you didn't well means we didn't love.

Speaker 11:         00:26:06       We didn't realize meat only wasn't organized.

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       Yeah. Yeah. We hadn't realized that we didn't know that. So as meat and salad it was very simple salad with like olive oil apple cider vinegar salt pepper cucumbers lettuces spinach pretty simple salad. And then meat and fish so we did that for about a year and then I had my daughter and then I didn't get better. So then I found out OK. So these symptoms aren't really pregnancy related it's just me now and for some reason I've lost the tolerance to these foods I used to be able to eat and and you're just eating salad and meat.

Speaker 7:          00:26:44       Yeah and I'm still having autoimmune so now it's symptoms that you used to have not in your reading.

Speaker 4:          00:26:50       Not reason not nearly as bad not nearly as bad like my fatigue wasn't back. My anxiety was manageable without medication.

Speaker 6:          00:26:58       But you hadn't achieved the levels of. I didn't know that you had. Yeah. You were eliminating things from your diet earlier.

Speaker 4:          00:27:04       Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Like I reached a really good point and then I got pregnant and I couldn't reach that point again. So then this is 2017 so it's like November and I'm getting really frustrated about being itchy. I'm just randomly itchy again and randomly early read about eating meat and veg just means salad.

Speaker 2:          00:27:24       Yeah. And I thought OK maybe I just have an autoimmune disorder and I can't control it with diet anymore. Maybe this maybe I'm just stuck like this. And so I googled like out of desperation. I think I Googled allergic to everything food wise something like that into google and I found the story about Charlene Anderson who's been mentioned a couple of times and she'd been diagnosed with Lyme disease and has been eating nothing but like red meat for 18 years. And there are pictures of her family online and I thought OK I know I'm not. I think I Googled allergic to everything except meat. So I found her then I found that Shawn Baker episode you did. And he'd been doing it for two years and I think that night I thought Screw it. I literally have nothing to lose here. I'm only cutting out salad so that's when I switched over.

Speaker 2:          00:28:16       That was December and then I switched over and the itching got better pretty quickly like within the first couple of days. But then my digestion just got totally screwed up. So like bloating and diarrhea every time I eat and after about a week I thought Kay this is a bad idea obviously diarrhea every time you eat meat just meat just name and salt roast. Yeah. So I thought this is a bad idea. Obviously this isn't working my body doesn't like it. So I reintroduced salad again. It was literally lettuce apple cider vinegar olive oil and salt and pepper. That's what I reintroduced. And I woke up the next day and the itch was back in my joints were stiff and I thought OK if I have to choose between itching and arthritis or diarrhea I'm going to choose the diarrhea. I was in a rough place.

Speaker 2:          00:29:08       Mm hmm yes. So I stuck it out and at six weeks of just doing this my diet the bloating went away the diarrhea went away and everything started to improve. So that was mid-January but I was still pretty skeptical because I thought I thought maybe the reason the carnivore diet worked for people was because they just accidentally cut out everything that wasn't working for them. Processed foods sugar grains all that. So I tried to reintroduce all lives like organic olives and all of oil. That was February and then I had this itching came back with the depression and my skin broke out and it was minor in comparison to like soy.

Speaker 1:          00:29:49       So you think essentially to give us the Cliff Notes you're allergic to everything Yeah that's fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:29:59       It's crazy. But then here's the thing. I started this blog so the blogs don't eat that. I started this blog because I thought if for some reason there's someone else out there like me and they're Googling these things it'd be nice for them to know that they're not alone right. And I've found other people like this who are equally as sensitive I'm sure.

Speaker 6:          00:30:19       I mean look if you exist there's probably quite a few people that have that issue. And since it makes sense that we all have different tolerances and we all have different allergies some people are allergic to cats some people have no problem with peanuts. Some people eat a brazil nut and they die just yet. We know this.

Speaker 5:          00:30:38       So the idea this is one of the problems with diet is that people want to think that a diet that works for them works for everybody and it doesn't work that way. And thing think people want you to follow their diet no matter what it is whether it's vegan or paleo. People are very ideological with that. They would love you for you to do exactly what they're doing. So to reinforce what they're doing is correct. There's a lot of pushback against this carnivore diet idea but I don't I I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that someone like you might actually really be allergic to everything.

Speaker 2:          00:31:14       Yeah I mean I was like very sick and from coming from that place to now I can see how sick I was and it was like I was dying.

Speaker 5:          00:31:22       You have a bunch of medication just trying to do anything with probiotics.

Speaker 2:          00:31:27       Yeah. I can't tolerate probiotics you can't tolerate them. No. So the original idea was heal my God repopulate with bacteria that maybe I'm missing and then maybe incorporate more foods right. So what happened when I tried to do the same autoimmune flare up.

Speaker 5:          00:31:42       OK but this is the same autumn immune flare up that you got when you eat salad.

Speaker 2:          00:31:48       No not quite not quite as bad not. It was different. It was like with salad there's more of the arthritis. Mm hmm. And like body pain and then with probiotics would you get mood issues. So like really volatile. And itchy. Right. So I still got the itch. Yeah. So I think it was I probably had leaky got into the program just going everywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:32:14       One of things your dad brought up to me when he was here was the most fires. Yeah yeah. And then I started reading up on it after he discussed it with me. And it's something that I never even considered before.

Speaker 1:          00:32:26       But fast rising yeast and all these different impulsive fires that they put in bread and wine and various foods.

Speaker 2:          00:32:35       Mm hmm. They're terrible for you. Oh my God yeah. Terrible for your stomach in there. They're so prevalent. They're everywhere. Yeah. Soy less often. Yes. It's in everything it's in everything. Yes.

Speaker 6:          00:32:44       And then I started really paying attention to it. I've read several articles on it. And then a couple of studies. It's it's crazy how this is something that's never even discussed and it has all sorts of negative effects on your gut and your gut lining.

Speaker 2:          00:32:59       It's awful. Yeah. Combining that and then it looks like grains aren't so good for people. Combining that in grains. It's no wonder people are ill. Some people yes.

Speaker 5:          00:33:10       Some people most people though feel look like obesity or I wouldn't go most I would say some let's say most people are sedentary. That's one of the primary Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:33:20       But I don't think that's the issue. I mean. I mean OK. Say I mean I guess I'm not a great example but I mean people start gaining weight if they're lucky when they're middle aged if they're unlucky when they're around 25 and they start gaining weight. I don't think it's from lack of exercise I think it's from diet and I think diners let's do it.

Speaker 3:          00:33:40       Yeah for sure. But it's also lack of exercise.

Speaker 2:          00:33:45       I don't know. I'm not convinced because people who've gone onto this carnivore diet especially lose that weight.

Speaker 3:          00:33:54       But there's a lot of people out there that are not overweight that don't follow the carnivore diet so how to explain that.

Speaker 2:          00:33:59       Well I'd like to see anybody above the age of 50 know on a standard standard American diet award is a standard American diet.

Speaker 3:          00:34:07       I mean you might say eating terrible.

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       No I just mean Standard American Diet.

Speaker 6:          00:34:11       I mean I saw I call it they gave me this these blanket statements are a real issue.

Speaker 1:          00:34:17       And that's one of the reasons why your diet is fascinating because like you know I don't think you can make blanket statements when it comes to people and diet. You know that I think there's some people out there that are damn food dumpsters. You could throw anything in there and they're fine.

Speaker 2:          00:34:32       They just don't care unseemly issues. Then closer to that. Yeah. My brother is pretty well he's not so good with it like lactose but he's pretty stable compared to me anyway.

Speaker 5:          00:34:43       Well you know Michael Phelps the Olympic swimmer. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:34:46       It's like 10000 hours a day in several pizzas. Yeah I know.

Speaker 6:          00:34:50       I read about him fucking jacked has no problems at all he's not fat. It's sad because it but that's an issue of enormous like expenditure of energy. I mean he's yeah absolutely exercising in his body as ridiculous cowardly calorie requirements. Yeah caloric. So yeah I mean it's it's hard to say but I think sedentary lifestyle is a giant part of it. But most of what people do is what we're doing right now. Most of what people do is sit down.

Speaker 2:          00:35:20       But is that because they don't feel like running around because some people like people who exercise. Generally you have to put in a little bit of effort to make yourself go exercise but a lot of people who are overweight and sick don't have enough energy to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:34       I don't know about that. Some of them maybe but I think some of them just don't have discipline. There's an issue with that as well. There's also an issue of momentum. You're not used to doing it. It's not a part of your life. It's not something that you're accustomed to pushing yourself. There's been many many many many many many many days where I don't want to work out. I just didn't feel like I had the energy and I just forced myself.

Speaker 6:          00:35:56       And I think there's very few people out there that know how to force themselves. That's a learn. Yeah that's a learned skill. Yeah. That that kind of discipline and focus you have to have like real rigid requirements of yourself where you don't allow yourself to back out of things and you don't allow yourself to slack off. And I don't think people put those kind of requirements on themselves as if it's it is a a daily principle of life like what you must get done. You know you must brush your teeth and exercise for 45 minutes. And if you did that I think you'd be healthier and happier and your body would perform more smoothly. And if you require your body to do things like that I think it rises to the occasion. There are very few people that have that kind of discipline. So because of that they come up with excuses and excuses are a giant part of the problem.

Speaker 6:          00:36:48       It's not simply a physical health issue. There's also mental aspects of it. And discipline is a big one. I just know way too many people who are weak mentally and I can't I can't just chalk it off to only you know their physical though the way they physically feel because I felt like shit 100 times and then I worked out and then I felt way better. Yeah it's just it's just a fact of life that's real. You know you just get the idea and people don't know how to do that. It's all. And if you're used to doing this get in your car sit down drive to the office sit down go to the lunch sit down you know go to the board meetings sit down get in your car and on the way home sit down get home in front of the TV sit down then go to the gym fuck off do not have any energy you know their bodies not the debate is like oh don't have it in me to do this and I don't believe that I don't believe that I think it's it's a lot of it is the mindset so I partly agree with that but because I know I'm like I was a very sick individual a different case you have real legitimate diagnosed physical issues.

Speaker 6:          00:37:53       This is a very different thing. You have a severe autoimmune disorder. I mean listen you get your hip replaced you're fucking 17 yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. You don't hear that this is different. I'm talking about the average fat fuck you just sit around being lazy. That's really what it is. It's like I'm sure a lot of it is diet and a lot of that diet affects their physical health but there's been many many people that have just put their foot down and said enough I'm gonna change my life and they they don't take an excuses and they feel way way better diet is most certainly a part of that but there's also a discipline aspect and these things are not mutually exclusive. They exist together they're all together there's and they work symbolically the way you. Your mindset affects the choices you make with your diet and the mindset also affects the choices you make in terms of like whether or not you require yourself to exercise and I think these are these are critical aspects that people like to gloss over or they like to make excuses about and they get very angry if you don't accept those excuses.

Speaker 6:          00:38:57       And that's a sign that they're trying to they're trying to enforce this standard in this idea and push it on you and give themselves an excuse. It's one of the reasons why they get angry. It's one thing if someone has a legit physical issue like you do but there's a lot of people who do not. They just have poor diet choices. They have a sedentary lifestyle and they have the momentum of this sedentary lifestyle that's holding them back.

Speaker 12:         00:39:21       They're accustomed to being lazy OK I kind of kind of agree.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       I just from like my perspective I've seen my dad and he was very like you can see from the videos from 2014 before he started going low carb and everything. He was carrying about 50 extra pounds. Right. And he didn't exercise and he didn't have enough energy to exercise doesn't. But he didn't look at those lights right. That's not true.

Speaker 13:         00:39:45       He just didn't do it. No I I don't believe that. When you say didn't have enough energy to exercise. Did he walk around.

Speaker 2:          00:39:51       Well yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:39:51       You want to drag yourself through things and you can drag yourself through an exercise routine. You can well you must. You most certainly can. He most certainly can. You don't have to do a lot. You have to do something. You walk up hills. You jump a little rope. You take a little tiny kettlebell you do a couple cleans impresses you do a few pushups and do a few sit ups. You get your blood pumping. You're moving. You're alive. You're exercising to say you don't have enough extra energy to exercise. That's crazy. Can you walk to the refrigerator then you can exercise. I'm not saying that you have to run marathons. You can exercise and everyone should fucking exercise. I agree. Everyone should exercise. Don't ever say. People are so crazy. They want you to believe I don't have the energy to exercise. God damn it everyone does if you're a liar. I cannot say I believe that I've been there.

Speaker 2:          00:40:37       I know I'm a different case but I've seen my dad there and then here's the thing. Once he fixed up his diet once he went to this corner of her diet he's exercising now Choi's got less weight on his body.

Speaker 13:         00:40:47       He feels better and he has energy that's wonderful. He could have exercise then too. He would've felt shittier for sure when it felt as good as you feeling now. But to give people as excuse I don't have the energy to exercise that is crazy to say Can you walk to the fucking refrigerator. Yes well you can exercise. You don't have to do anything crazy just walk around the block. There's a there's 80 year old ladies who take yoga with me they're fucking really old and they're in there they're going after it. They could easily say I don't have the energy to do that but they don't. It's a mental attitude. They make a decision.

Speaker 2:          00:41:22       Yeah I agree.

Speaker 13:         00:41:23       Like there's a lot of it's discipline you're gonna get people who just don't exercise to kill yourself you have to go to a cross fit class and try to do the work out of the day. You'd have to go nuts and do clean impresses with 150 pounds. You'd have to do that but you to do something just get your blood moving your body has requirements it wants to move. It really does and when it does you feel better. But people like to give themselves this excuse I do not have the energy to do this. Whatever you decide that that's true. But if you watch a motivational video this 100 of them on YouTube thousands even go watch one you'll get fired up like fuck it I'm going to jump some rope you jumps from rope you do something just do some pushups do something do some bodyweight squats you'll feel better but it's also like learning that learning that and having that as a part of your daily life it has to be you know again I'm not talking about someone like you who is in the throes of this autoimmune disorder where you're getting your hip replaced at 17 I'm not talking about someone with like serious degenerative illness I'm talking about just a regular person who's overweight you can do it.

Speaker 13:         00:42:23       There's a lady who's like 450 pounds it takes yoga with me she's enormous she's in there was probably really embarrassing. Very hard to do. Yeah you know and she's in there did you. We could. Anyone could do it. We can do it. And again I'm not saying do what Michael Phelps does. I'm just saying just do something.

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       Got to do something.

Speaker 13:         00:42:42       We have fucked up lifestyles. Yeah. The lifestyle. Yeah. We'll have are just the human body is not designed to sit down all day and it's certainly not designed to be stuck in traffic and be in an office and just be you know fluorescent lights sitting there in front of a fucking computer monitor watching your soul get sucked through the the LCD screen. It's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:43:04       Yeah yeah I agree.

Speaker 6:          00:43:06       I think we've got to be really careful with just the way we describe things. It's like say I don't have the energy to do something to fuck off. Stop.

Speaker 2:          00:43:15       I don't know. I believe it still. That was good. But I'm still not convinced. You still know I think. Well I think you change your diet and then you can exercise.

Speaker 13:         00:43:25       You can exercise without changing your diet. There's a lot of people do.

Speaker 2:          00:43:27       They do yeah. But I'm not as partly that's discipline. Yes but partly that's being able to I'm still I don't know you haven't. So what do you think is holding them back. Well I think if you're carrying around extra weight like a quite a bit of extra weight and you say I don't have enough energy there's something serious going on that isn't just oh I have a few extra pounds. I don't think we know exactly what that looks like but a lot of that has to do with energy. I mean dad was sleeping here sleeping for two hours a day in the middle of the day and he was impossible to wake up. He couldn't wake up and like shake them and couldn't wake him up.

Speaker 5:          00:44:07       Dad told me he was on a standard diet of legs sandwiches and pasta things on hands. Yeah have that big insulin dump. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:44:17       Yeah but I mean most people who don't have enough energy are in a lot of those people don't realize like we were eating whole grains. We didn't know that whole grains were just grains. We had the whole grains were healthy. So I was having sandwiches for lunch because I was having cheese and bread and that was protein.

Speaker 11:         00:44:35       Right your dad has autoimmune disease disorders as well. Yeah. A significant right. Crucial to the depression was at 17 if that was the main one that was very significant.

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       Yeah I think you know it's hard to do.

Speaker 3:          00:44:49       It's hard to also figure out like what is depression. We say no sign of depression to the person doesn't have depression like myself. I hear that and I go OK. What does that mean. Yeah it does it. Mean you feel bad. What does it mean does it mean there's like a thick wet blanket over your life that you can't get out.

Speaker 2:          00:45:04       Yeah it means like there's a couple of things. The closest it's it's impossible to think of when you're not depressed but the closest I've get to is if you're in a really really stressful situation and a whole bunch of things go wrong at the same time that's stress you feel is kind of like a really really mild version of being depressed. Being depressed is like if you look at something the colors seem muted you don't get joy out of anything. This color the sky reds like just colors everything's in gray scale kind of feels like you're walking through molasses and then you have a whole bunch of anxieties pop up all the time that are like worst case scenarios of everything in your entire life that won't happen but that's all you can think of all the time that things partly anxiety but it's hell like I having arthritis I would choose arthritis a million times over then this depression just wrecks you.

Speaker 3:          00:46:04       So what leads you to the carnivore died. This lady has been living on it for 18 years. You read about her and that she's still alive without eating and her Lyme disease gone and she looks great.

Speaker 2:          00:46:16       There's a before and after picture.

Speaker 3:          00:46:17       She loves taking vitamins as well. Nothing nothing beef and salt. Right. So this is what you hear so this anecdotal story is what leads you to give that a try.

Speaker 2:          00:46:27       Well. Yeah this is 2017 so December must. Yeah. So not quite a year. So I switched over and then I had these transient transition symptoms diarrhea. Yeah. That was basically it was craving.

Speaker 5:          00:46:41       It's bold to hang in there with six weeks diarrhea.

Speaker 2:          00:46:44       Yeah but the alternative was like anxiety and itching and arthritis.

Speaker 3:          00:46:47       Well you were also probably at the end of your rope right where you're like Oh yeah. Like I said I can't even eat miso soup right.

Speaker 2:          00:46:54       There's nothing else like I don't care about salad. I've already given up everything I love. Take it away. And then after six weeks it got better. And then I reintroduced all of not went badly and I thought OK I'm done with the reintroduction. I'm just sticking with meat.

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       Your dad said he's going to try to reintroduce mushrooms Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:13       We'll see how that goes. He seems to be weirdly sensitive to like in the same category as me. But instead of getting arthritis and all these other things as well he just gets the depression which is the worst one. Well

Speaker 6:          00:47:24       he said he he introduced something to his diet and he didn't sleep for like 24 days.

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       Yeah. So it's not even possible. Wow. Dead. No. That's what it felt like I had the same weight I had the same thing. We ate the same thing. I think it was sulfates in apple cider in a stew I made. I don't know what it was. I think that's what it was. And yeah. And then there was the edging came back and the doom came in. This depression came in and then. That's that's weird and it hasn't happened very many times. But I got stuck with insomnia and it felt like we weren't sleep.

Speaker 5:          00:47:59       So you slept like a little bit and you wake up.

Speaker 2:          00:48:01       Probably yeah. It does not what it felt like but I'm sure you know it's not physically possible to stay awake for that long but I don't feel like sleeping.

Speaker 3:          00:48:07       What's the world record that someone's ever stayed awake. I think it's only like 10 days. Yeah I think it's 11:00 10:00 or 11:00. Yeah something along those lines.

Speaker 2:          00:48:16       God why would he do that. Was it just a task version.

Speaker 10:         00:48:19       Eleven days and twenty five minutes.

Speaker 11:         00:48:21       Twenty five minutes. That's what it takes with that dude with Down a half deep.

Speaker 3:          00:48:29       Wow that's crazy. So I must unless you dad stomp the shit out of that world record.

Speaker 2:          00:48:37       No I'm sure he was sleeping but it was like it was you know it didn't feel like that and it wasn't very much.

Speaker 5:          00:48:42       It's just crazy that one thing. What do you remember what it was that he reintroduced to his dance that that was might have been.

Speaker 2:          00:48:49       It wasn't a reintroduction it was. We were just still eating apples at that point and it was a cider and it had salt fights at it and I looked at it and thought whatever it's like parts per million sulphide it'll be fine and then that was the only thing that was new.

Speaker 6:          00:49:04       So do you think that as you get onto this elimination diet and you start taking things out you get what you get. Yeah. You get more sensitive cards like one of things that that I noticed in a big way was when I cut sugar out of my diet. If I have sugar now like if I go crazy and have an ice cream sundae I hit a fuckin wall so hard where I can't even get up. To sit down the cast my oh it takes like an hour or two for it to get out of my system. So for like an hour. And I'm like oh God I feel like shit.

Speaker 7:          00:49:34       And then two hours later I go OK it's done. That's it. It's two hours. Yeah about two hours. It's like 24 days for me.

Speaker 3:          00:49:41       Yeah. Oh I believe you. I believe you. But for me it's just for two hours. I mean and again it's not I'm not depressed for two hours. I just feel like I have a brick in my stomach. Yeah. And I feel like I'm on a tranquilizer.

Speaker 2:          00:49:55       Yeah yeah yeah. So most of the that's how I lived all my life. No it's good tranquilizer like it's idiopathic hyper Sonia was like I was falling asleep during exams. I drove home on the highway one time when I was 22 and I was falling asleep at the wheel and I was like Oh my God. Like I can't stay awake passing out. And I moved over into a lane and a truck came by and honked at me and I was like home my God I'm going to die. And then I went on Adderall Whoa like I need to stay awake or I'm going to die. RFE RL Oh yeah yeah. I'm off of everything and the Adderall so I stopped taking the immunosuppressants when I cut out gluten just to see how my arthritic flare ups would go if anything would happen then I was then I got off the antidepressants November 2015 and then my fatigue lifted in January 2016. So I got off the Adderall right away then mm mm hmm. I was taking a lot and it was great when I was in that like feeling like I was on tranquilizers It was great. But once you don't need it it's kind of awful being on that amount of amphetamine all the time.

Speaker 5:          00:51:02       I know so many people are on that. It's so disturbing to me how many people are taking that and talk about their productivity and they're always it makes you feel like you're being productive.

Speaker 2:          00:51:14       I don't know if it actually makes you more productive and it just destroys your short term memory does it destroyed mine. I was taking a lot those on 40 milligrams a day on the morning long release this one of those things I've always thought about trying I'm like maybe one day if you have energy if you have energy I don't think he gives you a kick. Like if you're exhausted all the time it's just kind of unpleasant and it makes you like weirdly anti-social.

Speaker 14:         00:51:43       Mm hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:51:44       OK so you haven't been on this died for a year now. What has changed once you got over the diarrhea. What has the change been like.

Speaker 2:          00:51:55       So the arthritis and like the auto immune stuff went away fairly quickly when I was still having diarrhea and I went away. The mood started to pick up six weeks into the diet and then in May so I'd been December driver.

Speaker 4:          00:52:09       March April May. So five months into it I had a huge improvement. So things just got better and better everyday and I finally got to the point where I was pre pregnancy.

Speaker 2:          00:52:20       So since May as I would say it's still getting better. So it's only been three months. So you've been OK. No I've been OK since January but my mood went from like eight to like a nine and a half. Like great. In May. So it's feeling good after I started after this first six weeks. But then things got a lot better and may seem to be just improving now.

Speaker 5:          00:52:47       What kind of bloodwork are you getting while you're doing all this. Are you going and getting tested for nutritional deficiencies. Because one of the issues that many people who are nutritionists or who are studying biology have with this carnivore diet is that meat just meat is very deficient in many many nutrients.

Speaker 1:          00:53:09       It's just it's very deficient in vitamin C is deficient in several things that we think that you need in order to to live.

Speaker 2:          00:53:18       Yeah well I did get bloodwork done because people were asking and not because I particularly trust bloodwork because my bloodwork was always pretty normal. I was always low in zinc and vitamin D since I was a kid.

Speaker 1:          00:53:29       Even when you had severe arthritis.

Speaker 2:          00:53:31       Yeah. Everything was normal. I had no blood markers and I was like dying but Jesus. What about for inflammation my white blood cell count was high. Give me a sign of infection. Right. So that was high my vitamin D and my zinc were low. Right. But that's not what showed up.

Speaker 5:          00:53:47       But that wouldn't be normal right. If you went and you got your blood tested and they showed you you have a high white blood cell count that would go there's an issue here.

Speaker 2:          00:53:53       Yes. It wasn't abnormal enough to have caused the problems I was experiencing. But how about how how different was it from the normal white blood cell count. Well I had white bloods raised white blood cell count and I had white blood cells in my urine. And that's that's a little weird because that is generally like while some sort of bacterial infection which I didn't have symptoms of. Mm hmm. So that was a little weird but that was never focused on from the doctors. Why not.

Speaker 6:          00:54:25       Well that seems like that's that's an issue. If normal people don't have that and you have problems that normal people don't have. I would say my blood work is not. I mean your blood work is not normal. That's not normal.

Speaker 2:          00:54:37       No but I mean I was on all the medications they could put me on. So there wasn't and they never looked at diet so I was kind of at a standstill.

Speaker 5:          00:54:45       Well but you when you said that you don't trust blood work and then.

Speaker 2:          00:54:48       Well I did get it done right. Mostly for the blog so that everybody could see I wasn't dying. I can pull it up.

Speaker 6:          00:54:54       OK. That was one of the issues with Shaun Baker. Shawn got his blood work done and one of the things that people noticed is that there's quite a few issues there. And one of them was very very low testosterone which is crazy because he's a gorilla. Yeah he's a big huge 6 foot 5 250 pound dude. So it's like well he didn't look deficient in testosterone like what the hell is going on here.

Speaker 2:          00:55:14       Yeah I don't have testosterone readings.

Speaker 6:          00:55:16       He also said that part of that might you know he I have gone back and forth about this. He said part of that might have been that had to do with taking the test when he had done a very heavy weight lifting workout the day before. If he'd done squats and deadlifts and all kinds of stuff and so maybe broke his body down a bit.

Speaker 2:          00:55:34       Yeah. Kind of makes sense. I'll be nice first. Like a medical professional to take some of these groups of people doing this diet and just do a study. Mm hmm. So we could actually get some information. Yeah. Instead of like everything's anecdotal and I put my stuff up but just because so I can show it to you but everything is normal. Everything is normal. My Farrington is slightly slightly elevated but like fair it's an iron. OK. So that's slightly elevated because you're eating a little lightly red meat but that's not bad. Not necessarily. And it was still like my doctor said he didn't care it wasn't elevated enough but like what about vitamins. So for vitamins vitamins my zinc is still low. My Vitamin D still low that hasn't recovered. It's been like that and it's been like out forever. Well it's hard in Canada like I have some pictures on Instagram and I'm Green because there's no light for like six months and then I'm outside all summer so I'm probably deficient. I think that has something to do with the auto immune disorder. I tried supplementing with really high dose vitamin D and didn't see any benefits. So I hope I don't take supplements anymore. The high dose vitamin D. Yeah. I tried once when I was 21 for about a year and then again when I was doing on the low carb diet.

Speaker 5:          00:57:03       Well what about now when you're issues with vitamin D or in your blood.

Speaker 2:          00:57:07       Just got my bloodwork back. Okay so I was doing no no supplements so that I could see what happened.

Speaker 1:          00:57:13       Also I wouldn't recommend high dose of vitamin D. Oh just recommend supplementing with a normal dose of vitamin D.

Speaker 2:          00:57:20       I think I'm just going to wait and see and get tested in a year. I'm not too concerned and see what happens because here's here's what's interesting. When I went to the low carb diet my B vitamins were low. So this was during the pregnancy I got this first test and it was my b twelve was fine but everything else was low folate was low B one B three B six and Biogen were all low on the low carb diet. Right on my natural path said maybe you have a microbiome problem whatever that means whenever someone says my natural process they just go Oh yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:57:56       What else. I was like need a costume like that. Yeah. Crystal with you at all times.

Speaker 2:          00:58:02       You know what they were they're telling me to cut out gluten for years and I was like What do you know. Right crazy person. Yeah I could have probably stopped you need to stop some pressure on your wall put a Jewish culture above your bed. That'll help. Mm hmm. Anyway this new micro nutrients test the vitamin D and count not calcium vitamin D and zinc are still low but all my bees have gone up so none of my bees folate is still borderline but it was deficient before and all my other bees are have gone up to normal. What about Vitamin C O vitamin C was always normal Vitamin C hasn't changed at all.

Speaker 3:          00:58:44       That's fascinating because that's one of the ones I think people are deficient if you are on this diet.

Speaker 2:          00:58:50       Well I did some background reading because I've been I thought people died of scurvy if they didn't eat vegetables just like everybody thinks that well. But it turns out vitamin C and glucose compete. So if you don't eat glucose you just don't use as much vitamin C.. Mm hmm. Yeah and I haven't been supplementing my vitamin C is totally fine.

Speaker 5:          00:59:12       Yeah. Sean Baker said something about something along those lines. That was some of the vitamin C that you're taking in is competing with glucose and that you need far less of it and it's far more effective. So there is some vitamin C in beef.

Speaker 3:          00:59:29       Yeah. Are you telling the grass fed beef or you do care.

Speaker 2:          00:59:33       So initially I tried to get rid of all the variables because I didn't know what I was reacting to. So I was eating grass fed antibiotic free. All that stuff and now I'm eating mostly I try to stay away from the antibiotic and hormone meat but I'm eating grain finished because it's just so much cheaper than grass fed and it doesn't. I have no problems with it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       How would you know whether or not beef has antibiotics or hormones in it you just trust the labeling right.

Speaker 2:          00:59:57       That's it but I. But I've gone out to eat in restaurants where I'm sure the meats lower quality and I haven't had an autoimmune flare up with that. Mm.

Speaker 3:          01:00:05       Hmm. So when you go out to eat you know one of things you posted the other day was that you had steak that had pepper on it.

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       Yeah I had pepper on Monday pepper like ground pepper and you're freaking out. I was freaking out on Monday. Yeah that was like I don't know what happens. It's OK. I'm fine. But yeah I was freaking out I was stressed out for the whole day. But it's like if it flared first of all these flare ups don't happen instantly. So it gives you enough time to freak out about if they're going to happen for a couple of days. Right. And then it's like a month of an autoimmune disorder and depression and brain fog and not being able to think is horrible. So yeah I am freaked out but I'm OK. The one thing I found really helps. The only thing I found that helps these reactions is an infrared sauna.

Speaker 3:          01:00:50       If I get in there like once a day and sweat only an infrared one what about a regular one. Do you know. Honestly no I don't know. You don't know. So the idea just elevated heat temperature whether it's infrared or not.

Speaker 2:          01:01:03       Yeah I don't know if it's. I've just read all the benefits of infrared but I haven't any fits over a regular sauna. Wow. There's like longevity studies from Finland.

Speaker 3:          01:01:13       Those are done in the regular sauna. That's a regular sauna. Yeah. The ones that are done that show the decrease of mortality of 40 percent. It's a regular sauna regular sauna. Yeah. But mitochondrial helps you go that. Please there's a study maybe Rhonda Patrick has it up on our Web site but because I asked her whether I should get a regular sauna or a infrared and she said the studies that were done were done with a regular sauna. And she said the real issue is that your body is producing heat shock proteins. So whether it's infrared or regular the whole. The real issue is your body's in this extreme 170 degree temperature produces these cytokines and these cytokines cytokines taglines and your body is reacting to this incredible temperature and this is what produces anti inflammation effect. I would think for someone like you with arthritis in particular anything that reduces inflammation would be a great benefit.

Speaker 2:          01:02:05       So yeah. No it's sorry. Awesome. I just if I'm reacting like Sonia makes me feel like 20 percent better. Like a lot better. Laughter I get out. Yeah. If I'm not reacting I don't sweat as much when I get in and it's nice but it's not like a huge relief like it is when I'm reacting.

Speaker 3:          01:02:22       It's giant for me. I mean I don't have the autoimmune issues that you have but boy for me it's just it's a game changer. Yeah. Get in there for 20 minutes half hour and I get out there it's just like everything just feels better.

Speaker 2:          01:02:33       Yeah yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:02:34       And it hits me like about 20 minutes after I get out and I get this mood up and it's just like once your body I think that what that is is your temperature normalizes your body temperature normalizes after you're out of that heat and then everything's just like Oh yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:02:48       No it's great. It's great. Have you done the crime therapy. Yeah. Similar feeling right.

Speaker 2:          01:02:53       Yeah. Not as good I don't think. No but similar feeling it's better actually for pain so I have my ankle replacement still gives me problems because it's an ankle replacement so I've done trial therapy for that and that's works better for pain I think than the sauna does.

Speaker 5:          01:03:10       Now what do they do when they replace your ankle. Do they cut off the bottom of the joint and recap it and put something else there.

Speaker 2:          01:03:17       So they cut off yeah. They cut off the bottom of the tibia it's a big bone tibia and then they replace the top of the Tallis. It sucks and I got it done in 2009 when the ankle joints weren't as good as they are now. So now I'm left with this like old ankle joint and I'm 26 so I have to get it looked at because it's giving me problems.

Speaker 7:          01:03:45       You going to get another one. Oh God no I hope not. I think they're just gonna try and fix I had it some super dope carbon fiber a new model. I know they don't have that. Nobody's like making anything cool. No no. It seems like they're constantly improving that I mean it looks like on YouTube but that's not really what it looks like in real life. No. Now it's like maybe I could just get a new foot I could get a better foot right on a new foot to a new foot. Well some robot foot maybe salon. Like what the fuck is this.

Speaker 11:         01:04:17       Depends on the robot foot.

Speaker 5:          01:04:19       You'd be down for a robot foot if it like took away all your pain.

Speaker 2:          01:04:22       Oh my God. Yeah. If I could run again I can't run with an ankle replacement.

Speaker 3:          01:04:26       What about you. Hip replacement can I have replacements resign. Yeah but they I have friends that got a hip replacement they said of running out of the question. So I love the idea. Like you said no way. You can't run.

Speaker 2:          01:04:36       I could run on the hip replacement really and I can limp along with my ankle but the hip replacement gives me no problems.

Speaker 5:          01:04:43       It's great but I thought that the load that is placed on the hip is not.

Speaker 2:          01:04:48       I don't think they recommend activities like that all the time all the time. But even like a watch an elliptical that's pretty low impact. And I can't do that because of my ankle but my hip is fine.

Speaker 3:          01:05:01       Have you ever tried to verse a climber. No. We have to know that. So when angled like a beam like with handles on it and you do this phenomenal cardio it's amazing. Works your core because you're at an angle so you got you're kind of planking almost a little bit while you're doing it. Oh wow. Yeah. My or sadder. Yeah. Do you do sprints with it and then do two bodies like 2010s. Wow 20 seconds on 10 second break 20 seconds on ten second break. Phenomenal huh. Yeah. One of the best exercises in terms of cardio huh.

Speaker 2:          01:05:38       I stopped. So did you do a bike. No I can't really do anything with his ankle but I did start it. Yeah it's a huge pain. I'm gonna need to get surgery I think I'm getting something done in January. And what are they gonna do. So basically bone has grown into the joint so it's basically fused. So I just don't have any movement and it kind of hurts and it doesn't hurt like it hurt when I needed it replaced but it hurts so they're going to go in and clean out all the bone and pray that that works. Jesus. So that's that's what my January is gonna be.

Speaker 5:          01:06:14       Does this make you think that like if you got on this die.

Speaker 7:          01:06:17       Yeah. When you were younger you could have ordered all the shots is why I'm not very pleased with the medical community. What the hell do they know me.

Speaker 2:          01:06:23       They didn't know back but they could have said I don't know. They could've look to the celiac thing and I would have at least been clued in that gluten was a problem and maybe just removing that would've been good enough.

Speaker 3:          01:06:33       Well it seems that the amount of research that they would have to do. I mean think about how many different things you have to look out to come to that illusion the time you had to spend like three years. Yeah. And Canada has public.

Speaker 1:          01:06:45       I mean you have public health care right. So it's it's it's weird right. Not as motivated.

Speaker 2:          01:06:53       They're not it's not ideal for people with very special problems. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:06:58       Good for general public and it's great if you don't have money and you need to get taken care of but they have a lot of people coming in and out. Right. It's constant.

Speaker 2:          01:07:07       I'm getting this surgery done in North Carolina.

Speaker 1:          01:07:10       Wow. Just fuckin turn your back on Canada huh.

Speaker 2:          01:07:14       I could wait around for like three and a half years for a surgeon that's not as good.

Speaker 15:         01:07:18       Yeah yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:07:20       That this infrared thing I'm finding very interesting stuff. I remember reading what you said but I'm not finding that and I've only found stuff that I can't find. Ben Greenfield I think it was a transcription of a podcast today with Rhonda. Mm hmm. And something else very similar which is information from Dr. Jill Kahn. Mm hmm. That says only sunlight sunlight and far infrared sonnets have been shown to increase core temperature for effective detoxification because they get you can stay longer in the threshold area they want to around one hundred and thirty degrees you can be there up to forty five minutes or so. Mm hmm. And you I guess you can't unless you can withstand it in a trailer heat one because it's heating the air around you not light heating your body.

Speaker 3:          01:08:06       Oh interesting. Yeah. So the infrared one is heating your body in specific rather than you being in the heat. Correct. Interesting. So you can do it longer and that's where the benefits. What how much longer. How long you supposed to it said at least 30 minutes. But that's what I do anyway. I don't know the difference. So infrared song is good if you're a pussy. So that's why I didn't want to say that. But hey maybe that's what they're saying I don't know. Well it seems like you get more benefit with less suffering that's what it would seem like because you could do it longer.

Speaker 10:         01:08:40       I think that's what they're getting at but I don't know if that's the reason why I got enough people off to just quit after 20 minutes and I can't get to the 30.

Speaker 5:          01:08:46       Well people do man they get does get uncomfortable with it but if you could have if you get the same benefits you could avoid the discomfort why wouldn't you do that right.

Speaker 2:          01:08:53       Mm hmm. It also just it's just uncomfortable right before you start sweating when you're like oh I'm really hot and then you start sweating and you're it's not as bad.

Speaker 6:          01:09:00       There's a new company that's making an infrared sauna that you work out in. It's got a chin up bar in and it's got all these like like resistance cables.

Speaker 10:         01:09:11       The other part of this too which is I'd have to go more into science is that I don't know is that the LCD is like the infrared light can penetrate your skin whereas the heat maybe can't because it's just heat. It's heating up your skin. It's not like infrared is literally a wave. It's a lightweight.

Speaker 2:          01:09:28       It's a different kind of it invigorates your mitochondria so many works and that love.

Speaker 5:          01:09:32       The studies that they did in was in Norway Finland Finland. Maybe they just didn't have infrared there. Maybe I maybe I don't know because like those Russian Banias they do the regular saw on us these regular saw on us and they go hot cold hot cold and they've had some pretty awesome benefits of that.

Speaker 10:         01:09:50       And so there might be something to that because they're using light like dentists using light now to harden fillings.

Speaker 3:          01:09:55       So that's pretty new. Yeah science. She Blinded Me With Science. Fascinating stuff. It is all very fascinating stuff. But so sauna definitely helps you either way.

Speaker 2:          01:10:08       Yeah yeah. And I think like I've read some studies on it working out a mitochondrial level. I don't know anything about it. I'm just there's something to it and it after about half an hour is the only thing that's helped. I've tried like I tried everything to get rid of these reactions faster like detoxification things or mostly just different weird different sort of detoxification things and nothing's helped except the sauna they still last for as long with they're not as awful.

Speaker 15:         01:10:36       So I was telling you that this guy Kevin Bass who's P.H. Dean a scientist and he contacted me and I contacted him put on my glasses I can see you better. And he we went back and forth about this online and so he sent me a bunch of stuff what he thinks. And one of them is nutrient deficiency and that immuno suppression from a nutrient deficiency and that in the ideas that maybe in having less nutrients and having less that you're a dietary immuno suppression V A deficiency might be helping you. Oh and he said basically crazier things have happened and that you reported still having symptoms when you get sick even on a carnivore diet. And he said this shows that the carnivore diet is a symptomatic treatment. It's not because she's removed the offending antigen but yeah so I don't even know if I understood all that properly. Well this is a very long. He wrote a very very long piece on this and I appreciate that he took the time to do this. One of the things that is saying is like Vitamin A and that this this that this diet could be vitamin A deficient Vitamin C deficient we went over the thing is I have an E deficient vitamin K deficient. So you got your results back so you got tested in my vitamin K.

Speaker 2:          01:12:17       Everything's good is normal vitamin A's normal normal like above it says anything above 30 is okay for vitamin K to minus 40 everything about 70 is okay for vitamin A mind seventy nine mm hmm.

Speaker 6:          01:12:31       He said also that a lot of your symptoms including joint destruction fatigue depression etc. can be caused by the drugs that are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis although our rheumatoid arthritis came first though.

Speaker 5:          01:12:42       Mm hmm. Right. But then the joint destruction was that.

Speaker 7:          01:12:47       How do you test was that post that you being on those medications were those studies even done. How do you test that. I mean it's the drugs or the arthritis causing it.

Speaker 3:          01:12:54       I don't know. I mean this is his take on this is the potential scenarios. I mean without rejecting it totally. You were on those drugs far far earlier than your joints destroyed right.

Speaker 2:          01:13:06       Yeah I started the drugs. Grade 4 and then grade eleven.

Speaker 3:          01:13:11       Mm hmm. Were the replacements. Yeah. Look this is this whole thing is a very fascinating subject because people are not having the response that nutritionists would like them to have no right nutritionist would like you guys to be freaking out falling apart. And it seems to be doing well. I have a friend of mine lives in San Diego who's been on the carnivore diet for a while and you know he's a Navy SEAL. He said he feels fucking fantastic. You said you know he said You just tried it out see what it was like. He's never felt better in his whole life. Yeah elimination diets.

Speaker 6:          01:13:47       This is this is a big thing like getting getting yourself down to a very small number of foods you know and that this seems to have some sort of a a large benefit for people as well.

Speaker 3:          01:14:00       Yeah I mean I think it would depend on the foods you know it's like your body not having too much to manage.

Speaker 5:          01:14:07       And people with autoimmune disorders and diseases. Having less to manage could potentially be what. What is benefiting you as well.

Speaker 2:          01:14:19       I don't play as last though because if you survived only off of soy you're not going to do well. I think it depends what you're eating.

Speaker 6:          01:14:25       One of the things that he's saying too is that when you get sick the systemic inflammation probably opens up your intestinal barrier which causes auto immune systems to kick in again and said the same thing happens with any food that causes your intestinal barrier to open up.

Speaker 3:          01:14:40       He said Why is this happening I don't understand and that you and your father both think this could be some sort of hereditary thing. Have you guys done any twenty three and me test. Yeah. And what is that. I have an genotype for a different gene disorders perhaps.

Speaker 2:          01:14:56       Yeah. Nothing showed up. I ran it I ran it through Rhonda Patrick has something on her Web site right. I ran it through that I ran it through Prometheus. Nothing shocking shows up. I have a celiac Gene. Dad doesn't. So that's not exactly the issue.

Speaker 8:          01:15:12       That was it. Wow.

Speaker 6:          01:15:17       The whole thing is just it's one of the more interesting things is how people they always want to attach all these other things to it that environmental concerns and the concern for you know the the health and welfare of these animals and that you're supporting factory farming and always that it gets very it gets very ideological.

Speaker 2:          01:15:42       Oh yes super fast real quick. Right. But does not we're talking about. No I also I don't like I'm concerned about other people who are suffering as much as I was suffering. Yeah that's it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:54       Right before you're concerned with animals like everything a way before like try living.

Speaker 2:          01:15:59       If your choice is to live with an autoimmune disorder and like die slowly that way you can do that and not eat meat if you want to.

Speaker 5:          01:16:08       Well this. It's also I think a disingenuous argument because 97 percent of the people in the world eat meat or something.

Speaker 2:          01:16:17       So it's easy to tell other people that when you're not experiencing those symptoms it's also.

Speaker 1:          01:16:22       Yeah. I mean definitely it's definitely easier if you're not experiencing those symptoms but there's so much meat eating going on already. And if you if if people really can benefit greatly from just an all meat diet we're going to tell them Don't do that. Go vegan and keep us pagan and be covered in hives and itching and and being depressed states the rest of your life. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:16:53       It's just it's such a hot subject and I feel like this is something that we're gonna have more insight on over the next few years. Oh yeah. We're starting to study it now and it's starting to be mean. You know Shawn Baker who's you know he's a physician and then you've got some really dedicated athletes that are trying it now. You know Zach bitter. Mm hmm. Who heal what does he owe on the North American record for 24 hour race. Wow. Or if not for 24 hours for 100 miles he ran 100 miles in 11 hours and 40 minutes which is how fucking insane. And he eats almost nothing but meat. Yes. Almost his entire died. He supplements with high levels of glucose like those gels and shit like that. And Ramsey's carbs way up when he's going to do 100 mile races and things like that.

Speaker 3:          01:17:43       But that's that's honestly a ridiculous requirement on his body. He's Yeah. He's asking his body to run 100 fucking miles and 11 hours and 40 minutes. Wow. Wow. Yeah that's crazy. He also weighs five pounds. Yeah. It's just. He weighs like a hundred forty but it's just you know his his his diet shows that it is possible to do extreme physical feats while while you're on this. Yeah he does a podcasts also with Shawn Baker. So this is something that people are really starting to study now and there's a lot of argument there's a lot of hesitancy not anger. Oh I've read some article today criticizing you and your dad and now.

Speaker 2:          01:18:31       Yeah. That's okay. I find it kind of like I can understand a lot of people who go on that kind of raw diet get really like vegan Haiti. Well that's what I was doing.

Speaker 3:          01:18:40       They were. Well that's true. But what they were doing is they're going off about the environment. This was like like methane gas produced by cows. I don't think I saw this article. It's just it's not it's not a good argument because this is this is happening like if you're a person. OK I'm not saying that you we don't all have a responsibility to do our part to try to save the environment.

Speaker 6:          01:19:00       But if you're a person who is deathly ill you go to the supermarket there's a lot of fucking beef you can go buy beef. It's right there. Yeah. If you could buy that beef and it fixes you what. Why don't you stop and think about the ecological concerns the environmental concerns and then the physical concerns of people that are forced to take on these fucking ridiculous pharmaceutical medications. Oh my God times years into their lives and think about you're also empowering these pharmaceutical companies and they're lobbying to stop natural natural cures. They're they're trying to make kratom illegal. There's there's a lot of thuggery that's involved in pharmaceutical companies that we're well aware of. A lot of cherry picking studies. Yeah they'll do 100 hundred studies one of them shows that there might be some benefit to this. Ninety nine shows it fucks you up and they ignore those and they're allowed to do this. There's a lot of weird shit that we really should take into consideration before we support any sort of pharmaceutical alternative and pharmaceutical drugs aren't demons. There's a lot of people that benefit greatly from pharmaceutical drugs.

Speaker 2:          01:20:05       I did. I don't think I would have been able to figure this out unless I'd been on Adderall and had the energy to Google I'm sure.

Speaker 5:          01:20:11       I mean look there's these benefits it's not they're not all bad. They're not all good. But I don't like that argument like hey you know if you go on the carnivore diet you're you're contributing to methane that's fucking up the world. OK. Is it better or worse than pharmaceutical drugs. Is it better or worse than what they're doing.

Speaker 6:          01:20:31       Is it better or worse the fact that foot pharmaceutical drugs are in the water supply. You know they've they've done tests on reservoirs and found pharmaceutical drugs in them. They've found pharmaceutical drugs in rivers. Fish. Yeah. Lakes. Shut the fuck up. There's a lot going on here. Don't don't. If you're going to look at this you better look at it in a if you want to make an argument against it you better be balanced about this because otherwise you're showing your ideological bend like to say that it's about methane and about cows and factory farming. Not really no. There's a lot going on. There's a lot going on yeah. It's this is a there's a long and nuanced discussion and if you're you're painting this this article in one way and talking only about the negative health and negative environmental concerns that are associated with beef production like look that beef production is going on a matter with you like it or not. Yeah. If you think we can curb it back and slow it down a little bit that would be wonderful. But we have to look at it accurately you know and also I believe they've proven that methane see. Google if this is true that Methane production from cows and Sony makes sense is far less when they're on a natural diet when their pasture raised than it is if they're corn fed. But it makes sense because they have all sorts of corn.

Speaker 2:          01:21:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:49       And also it's Ishan idea when they're eating grain.

Speaker 3:          01:21:53       You know that that could easily be a part of the problem is they're trying to fatten these cows up quicker and they're forced them to eat something that's not natural for their body. Have you ever seen that King Corn documentary. No great documentary but it's a real corn. Yeah it's a mindfuck corns and everything. Everything in your DNA like your whole body's like filled with corn.

Speaker 11:         01:22:15       That's crazy because there's so much I want to hear that it's crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:22:19       They've done. They did. These guys did tests on the carbon in their body and they found corn is in their body. Yeah things the carbon in their body whatever it was they just eat they go through the supermarket aisle and they find how many things have corn in them. Yeah. And that corn is subsidized by the government.

Speaker 2:          01:22:36       So I grant soy and everything. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:22:39       I did the articles but again this is this is also part of the problem.

Speaker 6:          01:22:45       These people who are writing these articles about your diet and about your dad and in his heart.

Speaker 2:          01:22:51       This is just taking a shot at dad. So yeah that's the other problem. Yeah. Certainly a lot of that. But no the articles aren't great. I mean it would be nice if someone instead of saying maybe she didn't have arthritis or maybe she's just placebo balling herself into this. Or maybe it's deprivation that's making her feel better. It could be nice if someone actually did a study.

Speaker 3:          01:23:13       What does it say Jamie. It says cows are being fed a new dye they reduce the amount of burping and cut emission methane by 20 percent. From 2008 article. What are they being fed. What's this new diet didn't specifically say I don't think they're being fed other cows. Cow what does it say. Okay. Special machines used to cut the straw. Okay. But still huh. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:23:39       Mixed with Slash edge silage wheat maize soya or sugar beet which can be mixed with. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:23:49       See if you google methane by cows who are pasture raised methane by cows methane produced by cows were grass fed.

Speaker 2:          01:24:01       See if there's land weirdly enough I thought I read that it was grain fed cows that produce less nothing really. Which isn't what I would have guessed.

Speaker 3:          01:24:09       That's interesting grass fed cattle do more methane what does produce produce do more methane on the foot. I'm not reading that grass cattle dupe. Produce do more methane because it's harder to digest OK obviously to produce more methane because it's harder to digest grass than grain. However some argue grass that is continually grazed by grass fed cattle sequesters enough carbon to make up the difference in methane. OK. That's what it is. Yeah. And healthy soil keeps carbon dioxide underground in the atmosphere. OK. Yeah there's a big story behind there. Right. So that's why it's it's better for the environment if they eat grass which totally makes sense because they've been eating grass for a million years. Yeah yeah. So so here you are here you are on this diet now and you've started to what are you doing consulting people online. So I am now yeah I started about a month ago and how what does that involve people Skype me and basically.

Speaker 2:          01:25:15       Want to see me and how I'm still alive only eating beef and then they ask me how to cook and things because nobody knows how to cook meat without anything on it. Well how do you cook like how do you cook with just beef. They don't know what to do. They're like what oil do you use. I don't use oil I think most of these people I've been talking to a lot of low I used tallow. Used a lot but most of these people are really sick and really desperate. And they haven't had any help from the medical system and so far and this is completely true. Anybody who's gone on to this like beef and salt and water diet anybody I've seen who's been able to stick through that transition period where you get off of carbs and explosive diarrhea not everyone gets that Dad didn't get what you want.

Speaker 11:         01:26:05       Like it seems to be 50/50. It looks like the sicker you are seven. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:26:11       No it seems to be but like seriously 50 percent of people and it seems like the sicker you are the more likely you are to get that and I don't all of its inability to digest that amount of fat right away or if it's a microbiome switch or something but it seems to hit 50 percent of people the other 50 percent just switch over. But everybody gets some sort of carb withdrawal especially if you go from like a standard American diet over then it's insane cravings.

Speaker 5:          01:26:35       Oh do you get your ketones checked if you don't like data. I went to paleo effects this year.

Speaker 2:          01:26:42       And I got my ketones checked and they were ridiculously high. That was with a breath test. Mm hmm. And then I have like urine strep tests which I know aren't as accurate but I haven't gone out of ketosis my diets about 80 percent calories from fat. So it's them. I eat ribs which are really fatty. I eat ribeye sometimes but I find eating more and more fat. So just caloric Lee I'm getting about 80 percent from the fat.

Speaker 5:          01:27:09       Mm hmm. See I eat a lot of meat but eating really lean meat because I'm eating a lot of wild game. Mm hmm. I'm not getting as much fat thank the fats the good stuff. But definitely it has a factor.

Speaker 2:          01:27:23       Mm hmm. I just finished I didn't finish. I'm halfway through a book called Fat of the land by I'm going to butcher this but like ville how your Steffensen and it was this dude who went to live with you at people in Canada for five years and eight eight like they eight. And it's amazing like historically it shows how they dressed and how they lived and what parts of the animal they ate. And so he lived off of what they eat which was basically just meat and sometimes eggs for five years and then he came back. I don't know if he was in England or in the States but he came back and said hey look how healthy I am. All I eat is meat. This isn't like the 30s. And they said no way you're supposed to have scurvy. So him and his partner who is his last names Anderson went to Bellevue horse hospital and they stayed under monitor just eating meat for a year. And there are six studies done on them and you can find them online. And they monitored like vitamin levels. They monitor over everything because kidney function because back then like nothing's changed in the last hundred years they said you're supposed to be dead of scurvy. So I'm reading that book and he says. That was one of the main things they ate.

Speaker 12:         01:28:31       They also didn't eat any salt.

Speaker 3:          01:28:36       No they were eating like whale blubber and seal fat.

Speaker 2:          01:28:39       So those lines mostly karibu karibu they also has a brain though. Yeah. But they I ate he said they gave a lot of the really lean cuts to the dogs so they ate a lot of the fatty or cuts they ate the brain. They eat fat behind. He goes into some serious detail a fat behind the eyes. Yeah. They boiled a lot. They boiled bones for the marrow so they got fat out of that. And then for part of the year they'd also eat seal the fat behind the eyes.

Speaker 3:          01:29:07       Tastes like it's like bread like dough you know that. Yeah. I haven't had that. Yeah. How did the first deer I shot. We eat the fat behind eyes tastes. It's like good.

Speaker 14:         01:29:19       No no it's it's not the best guy.

Speaker 3:          01:29:26       But it's it's definitely. It's just weird like like doe.

Speaker 2:          01:29:30       That's weird huh. Yeah it's a good book though and it there is another person who was just eating meat and for some reason people have forgotten about him.

Speaker 5:          01:29:39       So like maybe the best deal would be those really fat Japanese cows was Kobe beef cows or why.

Speaker 7:          01:29:46       Yeah because those are fat as fuck. Yes. Those things you you look at those marble cuts and you like when they're doing a cow. I don't know. It's terrible. Probably nothing good. Yeah I think good. Now those poor cows.

Speaker 2:          01:29:59       Yeah. What I've been doing recently which is a lot cheaper is getting ground beef which is lean and adding tallow and just frying it. That makes sense and it's way cheaper than steak but it's super fatty just spoonfuls of tallow in there and you just eat it is put in a bowl and eat it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:15       Are you getting bored with this.

Speaker 2:          01:30:17       No no not at all. So after the first week sucked because first line kind of sucks I was one of the reason it sucked but I was also like a missing salad. I was having and I only went from Greens down so it's a pretty easy transition kinda by the rest your family almost died as well as your whole mass.

Speaker 7:          01:30:36       Yeah he's on it as well. Yeah really. And how does he have any issues health issues. He was depressed and pretty severe depression really.

Speaker 2:          01:30:45       Know what was causing his depression like foods. He had the same issues as me and I know how that sounds but my dad was like this seems to be genetic. How can you have it too. Well but so it's not genetic.

Speaker 12:         01:31:00       Hmm that's interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:31:02       Yeah. Action. Well he was like this is a little incredulous. Well I mean those food reactions were kind of strange.

Speaker 5:          01:31:09       You know people have like weird sympathetic disorders you know like someone around them has something they start to develop the same sense.

Speaker 2:          01:31:16       So that's what dad was thinking. It wasn't like this though he'll turn green his skin turns a different color when he was the wrong thing. Yeah I mean not like green but he gets pale you can see it. Huh. Oh one thing I wanted to address when I was on here in Sean Baker's episode he said something about eating apples that gave him low back pain and you were like apples give you low back pain and people in the comments were freaking out. Well that's a symptom that happens to me too. And it's not over yet when my mood drops I get lower back pain and so does dad. And it's funny to freak out about to get it but that's very commonly associated with depression and it is triggered by food with me too.

Speaker 3:          01:31:55       Well I know that that's triggered by some people that have lower back issues when they eat and flip inflammation causing foods like pasta and sugar. Yeah. Mm hmm. So I went to a physical therapist once when I was having had a bulging disc in my neck and she suggested that I cut out gluten. I thought she's a crazy person now what are you talking about cut out gluten. My cousin she was I know it sounds crazy but a lot of these things cause issues and they causes inflammation. That was like the first steps that I thought was the first idea. Gluten. Yeah. Well also the first steps that I took to understand that foods cause inflammation. I had never thought of that at all. I thought oh no someone yanked on my neck and then my next her and tried to fix it. How do you fix my neck. And but when she was saying this that the reduction of inflammation causing foods would lead to healing in certain issues. I was very incredulous. Sounds like some fucking wacky car Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:32:50       Bullshit.

Speaker 5:          01:32:51       Yeah but there's something to it. And you know there's there's something too. First of all the weight reduction soon as you cut out all these sugary foods and your body's just carrying less stuff around you carrying less meat.

Speaker 6:          01:33:05       I mean and people don't realize how much it has to do a workout do like a body weight workout. Now do that same body weight workout with a 40 pound vest on it's way harder fucking way harder. Yeah. And most people out there wandering around Italy's 40 pounds overweight at least 40 pounds. Yeah it's a lot of weight. A lot of weight. You know I do this I have this this backpack that I put metal plates on. It's it's by this company called outdoorsman. And it's like a basically leg of the frame of a hiking backpack. He snap it in and it puts an Olympic plate on the back and locks it in place allow. So that it really centers in your back as opposed to like a lot of people do weighted hikes but they put sandbags in there and it kind of shifts and moves around.

Speaker 6:          01:33:47       But this was like really centers in and locks it in place. But if I do 45 pounds and I go hiking around like it kind of kicks my ass it's hard going up and also 45 pounds. Think about what most people just go through life with a lot of people go. Your dad was 50 50 pounds overweight. Yeah. Think of that. It's a lot of weight on that whereas your ass out that. And then that's one of the reasons why people say they don't have the energy to exercise so carrying around all this way their ass I was like it like really heavy overweight persons people and I look at their legs and like that dude probably can kick through a wall. Someone could teach him how to kick like think about how much weight you're carrying around the time their knees are probably super strong like all the tissue around their legs just constantly carrying this heavy load upstairs. Yeah. If you could lose weight you'd probably have amazing legs.

Speaker 2:          01:34:37       Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Now look at diet.

Speaker 5:          01:34:40       So how do you go though from this to doing consulting and is it. Is it a big leap to like. I mean you're just trying to figure your own life out to try to help other people online. You don't have a degree in nutrition or anything. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:34:54       God no. Well but what am I going to get a degree in nutrition for.

Speaker 11:         01:34:59       They still teach people eat grain so that was never in the books.

Speaker 5:          01:35:04       Do you think that today like if you went to a university today like a really good school do you think there would still be saying that grains are good. Good idea to eat.

Speaker 2:          01:35:13       I do.

Speaker 3:          01:35:14       I don't know that so I could be wrong but yeah I would say it's still pretty food pyramid de Well I don't know if they go the old way with the like when you read and I don't change them as all rice and wheat.

Speaker 2:          01:35:28       I don't think it's really changed. I think it's like eat a good mix of Make sure you get your fruits and vegetables grains. That's what they tell you when you're pregnant. But for most people I don't think so grain really. We've been eating grain for what like maybe twenty thousand years in some areas. More like 10000 years and in some areas 2000 years and if you're Native American like 200 years haven't been eating grain for very long Why do people suddenly think they can digest that just because we're people so you don't believe Rice. Rice is a green rice I think is a lot less inflammatory than some grains like the gluten grains are obviously a lot harder on people. And even I tolerated Rice kind of for a while. But yeah I don't think grains feed a lot of people. And so that's why the agricultural error came around now. We can feed tons of people which doesn't make people thrive and I don't think it's good for their god. I don't think that's surprising considering we haven't been eating it long enough to evolve with it.

Speaker 5:          01:36:27       But other than grain what are the issues you have with what we would call like a paleo diet or a healthy diet.

Speaker 1:          01:36:35       So with vegetables and do you think there's an issue eating vegetables.

Speaker 2:          01:36:41       I think it really depends on the person. I think that this beef salt and water diet is a really good elimination diet. And if you're seriously suffering and you have nothing to lose you can give it a go suffer through the transition period and then try and once you feel OK try and reintroduce foods and see where you stand.

Speaker 3:          01:37:00       What about vitamin supplementation though and why wouldn't you tell people what move why wouldn't you recommend multivitamins or a multivitamin pack that covers all your basics.

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       I say if you want if you're really concerned about vitamins get vitamin infusions I react to multi vitamins so the fillers there aren't any pure vitamins you can take unless you take them in powder form so you can get vitamin C powder potassium powder but it's hard to get the other vitamins in powder form and I react to everything. So so even the filler often caps I probably wouldn't react to pure gelatin capsules but like filler what kind of filler micro appears to lean cellulose isn't a lot of them. Why do they put that stuff in there. Well a lot of them is to bind it together you know if it's like a tablet then most of that is like powdery stuff that isn't the actual vitamin. What about capsules. I don't know. I haven't tested it out like buy because it's this month long reaction I pretty much just say get rid of all the variables you can get rid of and start from scratch and then you can see if if things are bothering you if you're worried about vitamins get infusions.

Speaker 5:          01:38:06       Right. But what I was saying is that you were talking about these binders do they exist in capsules as well.

Speaker 2:          01:38:13       Yeah you have to check the ingredients. There are just it's very hard to get vitamins that are pure unless they're in powdered form or either by infusion. I couldn't find a multivitamin I could take a lot of the vitamin KS derived from soy so I'll react to that amount of soy. Mm hmm.

Speaker 6:          01:38:28       Wow. So infusions you're talking about.

Speaker 2:          01:38:32       Yeah and I did those though I did that during my pregnancy because just in case I don't react to that at all is fine I didn't find I didn't see a benefit. It didn't make me feel any better. How do you react to fish oil not well but it was hard to tell because I was reacting to other things at the same time so I don't I don't eat chicken anymore and I don't eat fish anymore because it doesn't make me feel as good as beef but it doesn't give you a bad reaction.

Speaker 4:          01:39:04       Not like soy or grains.

Speaker 3:          01:39:07       But what if someone took it to a restaurant and lobster was on the menu. You would need a lobster. No.

Speaker 12:         01:39:12       Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:39:16       No dessert. No but the thing is the cravings go away after you transition over so I don't even care how has gone three times usually. If I'm doing more I eat more. Otherwise I'm eating about two and a half pounds a day. If they're fat fatter then I'll eat less.

Speaker 3:          01:39:34       To just sort of walking beef catastrophe.

Speaker 2:          01:39:36       Yeah. It's great though. It's um it's amazing. And I drink like sparkling water which I love Perry excites me.

Speaker 5:          01:39:44       So just Perrier and beef and salt. That's a now. What do you think about people that say that this idea might work in the short term in the short term but in the long term it's not sustainable.

Speaker 2:          01:40:00       I don't even know what kind of response to have to that like what I was doing.

Speaker 3:          01:40:05       For example on vegan diets right. With diets as they start off they feel great. They're like Oh my God this is the diet for me this is amazing. And over time their body starts reacting to the lack of nutrients lack of cholesterol lack of saturated fat and it doesn't doesn't in different bodies. I mean obviously some people have no problem with it but some people have like legitimate like Chris Crestor is a perfect example. He started out with a macrobiotic vegan diet and had real serious reactions to it over time. Yeah started out doing well. And then over time started to break his body down. How long did it take. I forget but when he started reintroducing meat back into his diet he had a massive ramp up.

Speaker 2:          01:40:44       You know it's ramp up like he got worse health health while Oh yeah fantastic. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:40:49       And suddenly everything started kicking in again.

Speaker 2:          01:40:51       Yeah yeah. So I'm not worried about it like I was so sick before this and now I'm better. What I was concerned I was going to die in the long run before and now I'm feeling good. I don't see why I would just randomly get sick suddenly I'm getting my vitamins tested because people are curious but I I don't have any symptoms.

Speaker 5:          01:41:12       And who is this besides this woman. Have you been in contact with this woman that's been doing this for nine years.

Speaker 2:          01:41:16       Not personally no but where were you.

Speaker 5:          01:41:19       Somewhere in the States. Mm hmm. And so Sean Baker is probably the loudest proponent and one of the most vocal and more most public and he's been doing it I believe two years my friend Chris Bell's been doing it for a while as well.

Speaker 3:          01:41:36       I think he's less than a year but he apples. He loves apples.

Speaker 2:          01:41:40       I had a hard time giving up apples. Let's find Sara. Seriously it's because I limited I went down on all my sugar and then I was eating hoards of apples and that was my sugar right. And that was hard to kick in apples.

Speaker 3:          01:41:55       Somehow or another give you low back pain among other things.

Speaker 2:          01:41:59       But yeah. Huh.

Speaker 3:          01:42:00       It comes along with a depression and arthritis the whole thing is a really interesting conversation because there's so much going on with it. It's and it's not an objective conversation for the most part. Like many people that get into this they get into this it's very charged it's charged almost politically it's charged ideologically it's charged whether it's ethically and morally it's it's charged where people are very skeptical. Also they have this diet that they believe in that they've been following. And so anything that's contrary to that they reject.

Speaker 2:          01:42:37       Yeah well I used to be like people when I was really sick. People come up and go Well have you looked at your diet. It's like what you like me mean disorder I'm dying have I like what stop eating sugar and all my problems will go away like thanks. So I've been on the other end of the spectrum and I used to get mad when people said but it was like condescending right. If you'd like tried. Have you tried exercising have you looked at your diet. No it's like I'm dying.

Speaker 13:         01:43:06       And then I thought maybe now that I look back on it. How crazy is it then. It wasn't even a conversation 10 years ago right.

Speaker 2:          01:43:13       Yeah like ten years ago. You ever hear this. No.

Speaker 6:          01:43:17       That's what's so weird like the cutting the sugar out and cutting the carbs out.

Speaker 2:          01:43:21       This is so new it's so new and this like meat diets really now. And but by the way but when I say new I mean in terms of like being popular really popular like yeah or something people have heard us. Yeah it's it's it's really interesting.

Speaker 3:          01:43:37       It's and when I see your dad and how healthy he is and how he looks so he again looks younger it looks thinner.

Speaker 2:          01:43:45       Like it's like it's like he's all sucked in. Yeah looks like yeah. Looks healthy. I know he looks like a different person than the person I knew. And I look like a different person than the person I knew. My face looks different in a good way.

Speaker 5:          01:43:58       Yeah. Well I think there's something definite definitely healthy about getting a lot of fat. Yeah. And this is something that I think we've ignored with our obsession with carbs and one of the things that is a giant benefit for people that cut the carbs out is the way you you feel about food. Like you don't get these massive craving my God.

Speaker 2:          01:44:19       Yeah yeah. I used to so when I used to go to eat I was starving all the time I just felt like I was starving and I'd eat and then I would feel so full. And it turns out it was bloating right. But I know that I just feel so full that I would literally have to ask people to take my plate away or I would keep eating because I was starving but stuffed. And that was just my state all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:44:43       You know it's fucked up no matter how full I am. If you put a plate of french fries with salt and in front of me I will go after those bitches. I can't help myself. This I'll eat one Mike is so good. And then with some ketchup like fat steak fries that are like kind of well done ish with some salt them and ketchup there's just something about that trick that biological trick that those goddamn potatoes play on you.

Speaker 2:          01:45:07       Yeah that's. Yeah. It's kind of addictive but so addictive. I know. And it turns out that even like the amount of salad I was eating lettuce was still kind of addictive because I had like lettuce cravings lettuce cravings. Yeah I mean not like my apple cravings. Not like my sugar cravings but they were that they were there.

Speaker 5:          01:45:28       So when you just eat only me your body takes that meat in through process of glucose Genesis converts it to glucose right.

Speaker 2:          01:45:36       Yeah. So I'm. I haven't been out of ketosis and I'm always in ketosis but my glucose is normal that's what's weird.

Speaker 5:          01:45:45       The fact that you're always in ketosis because most people think that if you eat try a protein.

Speaker 2:          01:45:49       Yeah but that's the thing is if you like convert what I'm eating to the fat ratio 80 percent of my calories or I'm getting from fat. Are you doing this on an app or something. I'm mostly typing in the cuts and then I can kind of add in how much tallow I'm adding to lean ground beef.

Speaker 5:          01:46:08       How much time do you how do you do about tablespoon or I do it.

Speaker 2:          01:46:12       Yeah I do it kind of by tablespoon I just scoop it in. But if I if I was measuring it I'd like four five.

Speaker 6:          01:46:18       Who do you heat the tallow up first and then cook the beef and do it or do you kind of like some older guy just mix everything together.

Speaker 4:          01:46:26       It's way more satisfying though because eating lean ground beef just isn't good.

Speaker 3:          01:46:30       It gets drier dry ground elk is even worse. Wow. It's delicious but it's so sinewy you know. But when I mix it with butter and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          01:46:40       Yeah. So I'm just mixing a little. It's great.

Speaker 9:          01:46:44       All. It's going on my voice.

Speaker 1:          01:46:46       So when you're you're looking at the future and you know you're saying OK this is going well this is you know much better than anything I've ever done before. I feel so much better. Do you feel like this is the way you're going to eat for the rest of your life. Yeah. Do you think it's sustainable. Yeah oh. I'm not arguing against it.

Speaker 2:          01:47:10       I'm just I'm wondering sustainable in what way nutritionally. Oh my God. Yeah I think so. I'll keep getting my vitamins tested. But this book that I've been reading about this guy lived with anyway. That's what they ate. They were healthy. They don't have teeth that fell out like they weren't sick like were sick.

Speaker 5:          01:47:27       The annuals are the people that went up there anyways. Yeah but the annuals didn't evolve that way.

Speaker 2:          01:47:32       I mean if you stop and think about it I mean but didn't we evolve that way too. I don't know. I mean we can't say we changed like 10000 years ago in order to eat grain. Looks like we've evolved to hunt. Kinda yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:47:44       Yeah I mean but different people that grew up in different areas of the world. I think they have. I mean isn't it been proven that there's different nutritional requirements that different people have if you're you grew up in different areas.

Speaker 2:          01:47:57       I don't think so. No I haven't read that. No what does that.

Speaker 1:          01:48:02       That diet that people. There's there's like some. Some diet that they they try to was based on bloodwork.

Speaker 2:          01:48:13       Oh the blood type diet.

Speaker 3:          01:48:14       Yeah. The idea is that different people that have different blood types that they're coming from different parts of the world.

Speaker 2:          01:48:21       Yeah. I don't know. I don't really look well man. So my diet with a summary of your guide to zero about diets. I'm. I know Dad told me like he went over and he said I don't think I can eat fish. I think fish is giving me a flare up and my response was like well that's not possible. Feel like all I'm eating is meat and I still have the same response. And then I told you I don't eat chicken. Well when I switched over. Chicken started to make me not feel good. When I was eating it. What about ostrich. I haven't tried ostrich. I've just given up on birds ruminant animals seem fine. I tried bison bison was fine bison.

Speaker 11:         01:48:59       What do what do you call it bison.

Speaker 2:          01:49:02       Is that a Canadian. I'm just gonna go with that's a Canadian obviously bison. By God I hope it's the Canadians. Well dad says it's his fault.

Speaker 9:          01:49:11       The ostrich is interesting because it's red. It's a bird but it's a red meat. That's interesting. Yeah. They have ostrich burgers at FUD records. You can get an ostrich burger. The fucking good that ribeye the sky bird. I haven't had that. That's a Sandhill Crane. Yeah Sandhill Crane is a really die guy. That's what they call him.

Speaker 5:          01:49:32       They stay there they they hunt them and they cook it.

Speaker 1:          01:49:36       It's a really delicious lean but like soft juicy tender red meat. Huh. Yeah well you got get a photo of it.

Speaker 9:          01:49:47       Yeah look at that. That's what looks like what. Yep. Sandhill Crane. Wild Canada Goose. Where. I don't think we're allowed to eat that in Canada. Well some some. You're not allowed to eat some migrating geese right but Sandhill Crane. I bet you could eat. Wow. Wow I wonder.

Speaker 5:          01:50:08       I have some buddies that hunted those in Texas and they said they were fantastic. So that's some of the best meat they've ever eaten in their life. What if you could eat that but I wouldn't want you to eat it then get fucking hives and shit.

Speaker 11:         01:50:18       Yeah. Now I may find a job for a mine for five weeks. Yeah. Yeah. Diarrhea.

Speaker 5:          01:50:24       Everything all over again. Yeah. So your plan is just sparkling water and steak forever.

Speaker 2:          01:50:30       Yeah and I mean it could be more like I could be surviving off of eggplant. Could be worse. Oh yeah. I enjoy everything I read all the time. Yeah right. I love it and I don't get bored. I thought if there's one thing I have to eat forever I hope it's steak because I'm not gonna get bored of steak. And like I said the first month was kind of rough but then the cravings go away and now it's like every meal and like mom stay you get hate from vegan people. Not really. I don't think I'm as inflammatory as some people because I can understand. I mean if you're Italy. Ideology. Ideologically possessed. That's different. But if you go on a vegan diet you cut out processed foods you get rid of dairy. Dairy was a huge trigger for me and you feel better than I can understand why you'd be going around saying the vegan diet is the way to eat right. So I can can I can understand where those people are coming from. If you're ideologically possessed and you're saying well it's the environment all this stuff I don't really care. So no I don't get it. I've got like a couple of emails about me spreading lies like well I just don't I don't really don't care.

Speaker 5:          01:51:41       There's a lot of loonies out there. What a loony people but that is the issue with the the the vegan diet is that it carries with it a moral high ground.

Speaker 2:          01:51:51       Yeah but other diet. So yeah. That's too bad. That part sucks. The people trying to figure out their health and going to that because it's they're trying to figure something out that's different. Like the whole moral thing like just let it go.

Speaker 5:          01:52:06       Well listen I think this is very interesting stuff. You know I don't have your health issues and I think very few people do. But obviously for you it's it's made some massive impact at home and for your father as well.

Speaker 6:          01:52:21       I mean it's really it's very very interesting. And like I said my friend lives in San Diego. No problems. I mean he's he's loving it. I know several other people that have jumped on board as well too and they're seeing big benefits from them.

Speaker 3:          01:52:35       I mean it's almost enough to make me want to try it but you should try. Well the problem doesn't take long. But I I have hundreds of pounds of wild game meat. That's perfect. Yeah. But I have to eat it with fat and have to figure out a way to get fat into it.

Speaker 2:          01:52:48       You can order towel here. Mm hmm. Yeah. This order towel. It's on it like I haven't I've talked to people like programmers in Silicon Valley who've Skype me and they're healthy and they just want to be more productive and the cognitive benefits it takes like six weeks and it's worth just seeing what it's like but they get that just from the ketogenic diet. No. I've had people switch off of the ketogenic. There's there's something here there's really something here and it's worth are you seeing. No I think people would see benefits if they tried it. Even healthy people.

Speaker 1:          01:53:18       What do you think those benefits are coming from.

Speaker 2:          01:53:22       I don't know. I don't know if microbiome switch or if there's less you're just ingesting less plant toxin or if it's a toxin. What do you mean by the wild plants have like naturally occurring toxins depending on the plant to get bugs and things to stop eating them. That's just their defense mechanism. So like oscillates that's a big one lecterns like all those types of things are inflammatory and it just seemed like we've just found the plants that we can tolerate as humans we found the plants we can tolerate the easiest and don't kill us and we eat those and we've bred them so that they're easier to eat but so maybe removing those from the diet seems to help people. But it seems like giving it a six week try I don't see a downside. Again I've only I haven't seen anybody switch back. Really. Mm hmm. And I've been talking to a lot of people on Skype over like periods of months and I haven't seen anyone switch back including the healthy people. All right.

Speaker 3:          01:54:23       Well I'm curious this conversation's evolving. That's for sure. And you know it's evolving with many many people all across the country. And you know when you take out the ideological or the moral high ground argument that vegetarians have it's it's it's interesting to me at the very least is interesting. Yeah something going on. So if people want to check out your blog what would that be.

Speaker 2:          01:54:49       Well that's McKayla Peterson dot com spell. Am I k h a I L.A.. All right.

Speaker 7:          01:54:56       Peterson dot com dot com. And is there another name for it isn't it. Don't eat that. Don't eat that. If you go to don't eat that dot is that it. No I don't have that somebody has bought it or are trying to sell it back to me for a lot fuckers. Now these fuckers. Thank you. Thank you Carl. Thanks for having me. Yeah. Good bye everybody.
