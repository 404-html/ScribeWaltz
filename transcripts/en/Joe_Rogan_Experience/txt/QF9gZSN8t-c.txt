That's not a bad idea because people probably can't spell crusher twice.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Yeah, the wrong. The first time I tried it when I just yesterday I had to go back and look at my Twitter and get it right. It'd be great if I was in Germany. Why is that? Because then everyone knows how to spell cards should be a crutch for us. You mean like Rogan? Yeah. Crushers. A tricky one, right? I think birth prep work. Could you get that Bert?

Shit on it.

Speaker 1:          01:50          I almost had Joe rogan.com at one point in time. Then this fucking real estate guy got it out from under me. The same thing I didn't think of, well, it was a website. Then I can give a shit about website available. Is that take the bait so people will know. Find me. Prepper bird on Twitter. Oh No, it's Holly Koon is the girl's name. How about Bert? X three x three that's ridiculous. What if I got Burt Reynolds? You can get burnt. Raul's fuck yeah. He spelled the same way. Or is it B u r t though? It's, Oh, it's B u r t but I'll be br drunk. Bert. Bert. Did you try to give birth to conquer to it's too many. What letters? Travel. Telegraph.

San Diego, how you want to say hi to everyone? Listen, this is being recorded so don't say the n word. Okay. Keep going. I love you. I'll talk to you later. All right. Greetings, civilized gentlemen and ladies. Throughout the land we break, we drink wine like the sophisticated we are, we are multifaceted. We have wine, coconut water, and yeah, we don't fuck around. We have a plethora of beverages here. Kevin Pereira is here from attack of the show

Speaker 1:          04:00          and just life. I want, don't want to define you, but one thing that's all right. Most people do.

Speaker 2:          04:05          Hey Man, you talking about your factor guy. Nice legs on the line, legs spread. And you were telling us this, this wine is, uh, it's, it comes from some guy who was an infomercial came apparently he made a bazillion, uh, off of infomercials in the 90s. Bought a bunch of land and they have it. I love stories like that. Like how, how to ditch slow me. How did Mr Slap Chop? Really Matt? Yeah, that guy. Yeah. He fucked up with a hooker. Prostitutes. You the slap chop guy shot him. Right. Did she bite his tongue because he was telling her and then he hit her. She bit his tongue and he thinks that, yeah. Your timing in a hooker man, woe to, you know, he's like a beat directory. Direct studies, the worst damn comedy movie or something like that already. Just did, uh, did the last movie with them and I guess he's just a dirty fuck. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:55          you shouldn't in promoting the Shama then he could have cleaned up the shame and the crime afterwards. Yeah. That guy's probably rich as fuck from that sham. Wow. Fun though. Huh? Fuck yeah. Now I could fund movies. He had Lindsay Lohan and that was the last one. I guess I just watched a ridiculous, this commercial with Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whatever. What does it is a bit hassled then had a really, really conservative ones interview and she's on a fucking app thing. Stupid machine. There's no way it fucking works. And she's standing there ripped and chisel looking sexy as fuck. You know, like with a little thing. Total exposed APP. Talking about this allows me to keep in shape. If you're like me and you don't have the time to get to the gym or the view will enjoy this view, vaginal muscle, it's a stupid product, but I bet she's going to make $1 billion.

Speaker 2:          05:43          Every time I see another plastic thing with belts or police or leavers, I go, I gotta come up with the next one and I go, there's no more ways to do a crunch. And then some asshole comes up with the, here's the device you strap on, lay down, and it works your core. They always keep coming up. There's one that's just a spring with a stick and he'd go like that. Have you seen that one? Yeah. It's like sticks between your life looks so stupid, like a shock absorber. And he pushed down like my dad believed in the weight belts. That would shock you like a little ad belts. Right? My Dad's big old gut, so he went and got two of the most powerful ones you could get and he would put them on you supposed to be like lose your belly with Kay white jelly or something like that so it doesn't conduct right to the skin.

Speaker 2:          06:19          He wouldn't do that. He's giant in Portuguese and angry. So He'd wear two belts, like sit there for like four hours and just watch Jerry Springer and then he's done. He would have either played, connect the dots on his belly, but he was just shocking his gut to some ways that didn't work. It didn't work. That doesn't work well. Electrical muscle stimulation they use in rehab so it has some sort of an effect, right, but it's more grainy nine plastic belt that you're getting at 4:00 AM is not going to be the same of stem you're getting from. But if just chiropractors crank him up, have the same effect at times, make noises, but 23 does that. When he moves in bout what? I had a, I don't know, bad muscle pull. My leg wants to put me on that shit. Electrical muscular stimulation and try to revive the area that was torn.

Speaker 2:          07:02          It's interesting to work. Um, I don't know, you know, everything heals up in time. It's hard to say what exactly made heal up. But, um, they had, they were selling them on, on TV for bodybuilders, but if that shit worked, there'd be due to her addicted to that. I do think maybe wearing right now it was actually a place in oh wow. Or a member and there was a place back in Boston, um, when I body by design, I believe it was called, it might be, I might have made it the wrong name. I think it was babied by design though. Um, that might be totally wrong though. Don't sue me on us. But it was a, um, a place where all you did was go and get zapped. You go there and lay down and they would cover you with these electrodes and they would give you a body by design.

Speaker 2:          07:44          Like that was the idea, you know, and I they couldn't have possibly are you sure? But that's, and that work, there would be no 24 hour fitness or la fitness. I want to make the cheap version of that with the plastic Chinese parts. And you would just do it wast just be break up in the morning. I'll swole. But Bruce Lee was into that shit too. It's like, I think it's, you know, people tend to buy these machines that you stand on and he's cleaned that Russian cosmonauts he was done and it just shakes you and the clean up makes you and shame. Oh, Ryan doesn't make any in shape. No, it doesn't get you in shape. It stimulates your glands. There's really the Russian cosmonauts wherever those stand space. We'll talk about it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. All right. Kevin Pereira.

Speaker 2:          08:24          Oh, podcast pitches that everybody know what's up bitches. I don't think so. I used to be, I used to be fat. I got and then I got crazy the other end of spectrum. Okay, do this. Just this 35 pounds. That's like, but and using your whole body, you do two things. One, you made your body work as a unit. What'd you don't do? Just like, I don't agree with any of that stuff that's very isolating stuff. No bench, no curls, no tricep extension. I think all that stuff is bad for you. Yeah. I think it gives you an imbalance. I think the best one you use your body, it's used at all as one unit.

Speaker 2:          09:12          Yeah, it probably is though. Like my, with my knee issues, that's going to limit what exercise blew it out to the slots, you know, click. So I'm not spending all this stuff, but you know he's doing, yeah, he does. But he knows what he's doing for him and he's a, he's a monster. I'm a ton of time. It should be 35 pounds. His playing weight. Is it right to count bass by tapping your penis and other for it? I feel like that's something that he's just doing. This is not going to let you cheat. You didn't do a little newbie. Again, like same thing. It's still like this clean hold it there like that. Yeah. Press it up big time. And this is one 35 times in east side sheep decree and keep your back nice and straight and go deep.

Speaker 2:          10:04          Hold it down, hold it. Delays. I'll play dungeon rate on a stair master. [inaudible] my out. Well it was a scared as well. Do you remember were there in Phoenix where there's a video game and you could play like a boss again? No, it was tanks. We've got an elliptical machine or I'll come back from Atari that combat with that too much. Well that's the neat, it's like what is wrong? Your name? Great question. I got to go see somebody about it. How long ago did it happen? December. December? Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember what happened? Um, I've always had issues with that was a rollerblader drummer. Constantly Bang on it. So I'll feel a shipped and then it's just pain in the area now it feels like when I, when I actually moved as it as a distinct click and in his pants, that sounds a little bit like stability thing.
