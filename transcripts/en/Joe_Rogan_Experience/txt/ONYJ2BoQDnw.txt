Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Yes. And we're live. Mike Baker, how are you sir? I am too. I'm very well thank you. Very happy to be coming back, man. Appreciate it. Good to see Ya. This world's in chaos. We need to talk to a rational man like yourself who's got the inside scoop. I have never been built that way before, but thank you. That's a bonus in this irrational world. Your rationality, you, you're, you're deemed a rational man. That's what we, we've been lowering the bar, lowering our expectations. We were talking before the show started about the current cover of the economist that has Donald Trump dressed up like, because Uncle Sam and it just says really, it's perfect. You know, and it's what you want to say to everybody who has jumped that chasm. Right? I had a stand that everybody's upset. People are angry people if for whatever their motivation, right? So there, you know, they get Jones got up, look at that fucking cover.

Speaker 2:          00:01:01       This is what we're down to.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       That's brilliant. But how do you get to, how do you get from, okay, he's entertaining and I understand that everybody wants to be entertained. To some degree, but how do you get to the point from saying it's entertaining to leader of the free world? And that's the part that I can't understand when I talk to people who are, are, are absolutely supporting him.

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       Well, you as a man who's been deep in the world of security or CIA operative, you, you've got the inside scoop would, how this machine runs to a certain extent. Don't you think that at this point it's so, it's so complicated that almost no one wants to be president. Like the, the, it's not a job that like people are scrambling to get any more,

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       right. Nobody in their right mind would want to put themselves through it or, you know, unless you're independently wealthy. Yeah. Um, and, and uh, and just don't care. And there's, there is, I think you're right. There's, there's a, you think about the kid who wants to become president of the young Republicans club right in, in, in middle school, and then, you know, all through his life, that's all he wants. He wants to be an elected official somewhere. So he goes maybe to the town council. Then eventually in his big goal was to become a congressman and God forbid, then he gets that and he goes on, there's a certain personality type, right, that's way up its own ass that allows you to think that. Yeah. So I sh I should be president of the United States. I look in the mirror every morning and I think, yes, I should lead the free world. So right there, I think you've got a flaw in all the people who are pursuing elected office, but then you've got the money that's behind it. You've got, you have to be independently wealthy. I watched, and not to disappear down a rabbit hole, but, uh, I lived on the east coast before we moved out to Idaho, which is a great state. Oh my God. It's a great, beautiful. It's, it's, it's, no, no, no. And if we probably shouldn't say anything

Speaker 2:          00:02:45       orphans, I think it's flat or something. If I had this conversation with these two guys, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       About it. And they were like, well, you know, it's mostly farms, like what it is. I mean there's a lot of code, there's a lot of agriculture, but you know what, he has more, if you, here's a, here's an interesting fact about Idaho. People can write this down. If you took an iron and iron, Idaho flat and then you did that with all the other states, the only way the state that would be bigger would be Alaska. And the same for river frontage, right. The river miles of rafting is, is insane out there. So, but the point being, I suppose it, before we moved out there, I was on the east coast and um, my wife is involved in politics to some degree, but we spent some time in Connecticut, right watching, uh, the, the governor race there. Um, and they would have to go from town council, the town council, it workspace that way.

Speaker 1:          00:03:33       I mean, you have to get the vote of the Republican Party of the Democratic Party in the town council. And the first question any of them would ever ask was, can you self fund? Basically, you know, how much money do you have? And so you put that together with the idea that nobody wants to open their family up to the ridiculous scrutiny that's involved and you, yeah, you did. We get what we get. We get this, this crazed campaign season. Yeah. It seems like we're down the assholes. It's only people who want to be it and Bernie Sanders is just, I mean, he's kind of an old Kook. I don't think he's an asshole. I think he's got all these asshole. He seems like a nice guy actually with a lot of good ideas socially and I dunno. I Dunno. It just, it's like, it's the biggest example in my opinion, of picking the lesser evil.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       That's how I'm looking at this campaign. It's like, what's the lesser evil? It's going to be Hillary Clinton who basically I just, I can't, I don't, I don't feel any sincerity from her at all. It's so hard. She's been in the business for so long. She's been involved in politics for so long. I don't know if she knows how to be just herself. That's a good point. I mean, I, my problem with Hillary is it's purely an operational one. I know that if I had handled, I mean even in a conservative way, if you look at what she did with the email server and her colleagues or cohorts did, uh, and, and you say, okay, it's, it's, you know, it and conservative way I'm looking at at how bad it was. If I had done that, I would have been sent to prison. And I know because we had various counter intelligence operations and else or you're, you're trying to find the lake, you're trying to find the problem.

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       And I, you know, you watch people get banged up for less egregious acts then what she's been involved in. So my problem with Hillary is looking, you know, you one set of rules for everybody, right? And you know, David Petraeus is a good example. He hands over some, uh, of information to his mistress who had a security clearance and uh, he gets a couple of years probation, you know, a large fine has to plead guilty. Um, she literally handed it over to the Chinese, the Russians and any other state and non state sponsored a hacker out there and explain which again, for people who don't know, she for whatever her motivations, she initially said it was simply a matter of ease after saying that she didn't really know because it wasn't her gig. She set up a, uh, a private email server in her bathroom and the bathroom in her bathroom at her house in, in a server in their bathroom.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       I know that seems like a weird choice. Well, you know, you're multitasking. Maybe you don't have that much time in the day. And she's constantly, she did not use that excuse as I recall. It still doesn't make sense. It doesn't make any sense. I know they like, they'd have no extra rooms in the Clinton House. It's a small place. You made about $190 million over the last couple of years. So we're supposed to believe she's living in a one bedroom, one bath place, you know, 800 square feet. And so she, she used this and essentially the problem is she traffic was directed through this unprotected, uh, server that now, you know, and she's arguing semantics, she's saying, well, I never saw that it was classified and yet it's either classified or it's not, and you know it at when and when you sign on to be, whether it's a senior official at her level or, or some milk that's walking around just carrying papers at the agency, whatever it may be, you sign agreements, you that you will protect classified information.

Speaker 1:          00:07:05       And it doesn't say it has to be more classified. It says that you are aware because you go through a briefing about what is and what is and, and how you look at a piece of information to determine. So she's saying it wasn't classified when she saw it or when it hit the server, but what they were doing is essentially cutting and pasting from classified documents so that they could bypass traffic and what their motivation was. I have no idea whether they thought it was quicker, whether it was easier. You know, I don't read a lot of nefarious intent. I just read, uh, an egregious mishandling of classified information that anybody else would be punished for. And it's, you know, I don't think it's going to happen. I think the bureau is engaged in a couple of different investigations. I think they have all the information they would need to put the ordinary person, you know, uh, or move for an indictment.

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       I just don't think the DOJ is going to do it. So what is their motivation to ignore it? Well, I think it's, I think it's political top cover because there's not, there's only one other person running for the Democratic Party. Right. A lot of people aren't too excited about having Bernie Sanders become the president. Right, right. And I mean, again, it's sort of, you know, the, the, the left makes fun of the Republicans as they should because look what we've got is our front runner. But, uh, you know, they make fun of the idea that, you know, the Republicans were all upset because they're anointed one, whether it's rubio or whomever you know, is, is in the dust right now it's the same way on the other side. Right? I mean they, you know, there's a lot of people, you know, with our knickers in a twist on the, on the, on the left upset that perhaps they are anointed one isn't going to get in. If if whom Abbott in or one of her cohorts who was involved in this who also were being looked at in a very, very serious way. If one of them gets banged up for this, then I don't know how it doesn't spread to her. She was in charge and you know, I understand that shit rolls downhill. But anyway, so that seems like the only way it wouldn't is the whole thing that we're talking about her in the first place, that she's just so deeply entrenched

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       in the system. She's so political and she's washed so many hands and you know, they're, they're all tied in together and this is the fabric that sort of keeping her afloat right now. Her whole sort of, you know, political operating mechanism. I mean, she's just so deeply entwined in the Washington system and that seems to be what's keeping her from, I mean, if this was going on and if somehow or another this was someone like trump, someone who is an outsider, Jesus Christ, they would chase him down. Yeah. Forget about it. I, this is, this is a remarkable situation. Um, somebody who's is a, from it and I get it not taken away. She's got a lot of experience. Okay. I understand that. Um, I liked, you know, Bill Clinton, I liked the guy. I thought he was a, you know, there was, it was a lot of good things about him.

Speaker 3:          00:09:42       Uh, it's just, it's, it's pretty, it's pretty fucked up. And I don't know how else to put it. We've got trump on one side. We've got, we've got hillary under investigation on the other side. We've got Bernie Sanders and I get it. I understand why people like Bernie because, hey, who wouldn't you like free stuff? Free stuff is, I'd give me some of that. You know, I've got three little boys I've got to put through college. I mean, so people feel like there's an imbalance and they feel like this is the only guy that's saying, hey, it's imbalanced. And the, the people that understand economics or apparently upset at him, I don't understand economics. I'm lucky I don't have to, but the people that, you know, if I was a fucking accountant and shoot myself, I jump off a bridge. But it, the people that understand that are like this guy's policy, this is not going to work.

Speaker 3:          00:10:27       Like none of this is gonna work. So that's an argument for other people. But the people that feel like we got screwed in 2008 with the, the, you know, the, the whole bailout and the, the banks and all the craziness with the economic collapse, they feel like at least some guys coming along, this is addressing that. And he's the only one. So that's what people are gravitating towards. And there's a lot of social stuff like his gravitating towards the black lives matter movement and wanting to make medical marijuana legal and all that stuff that I understand too. But it does not one person that stands out where I go, there's my guy, there's my God. Yeah, I agree. 100%. 100%. Yeah. I mean, if you could take Bernie, cause I think I, I think one of the things people like about Sanders's, he's been consistent over the years.

Speaker 3:          00:11:09       Yes. Right. So he's not, he's not changing. And, and, and again, there is something to be said here or this political system where apparently you're not allowed to evolve your thinking. Right. So the, I flip flopper yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. Well you can't do that. Or it's so that part of it or you can't negotiate a compromise as if somehow that's a weakness. Negotiating and compromising is how you get shit done, whether it's in government or business. But, so anyway, I had to stamp people like sanders. They like his, his, uh, his consistency. Um, I understand the social side of it. I think it makes good sense. I, you know, I'm like you, I don't, you know, I've, I've spent most of my life overseas, some of them in some pretty crappy countries where socialism has been tried. And I understand he's a democratic socialist and so it's a kinder, gentler form. Uh, but I've

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       seen some pretty harsh results from those systems overseas. And I, uh, I'm surprised that, I'm surprised that there, I understand young people jumping on that train. Um, and I'm just surprised that the, uh, the other folks who are on board, you know, there's a lot of people up in Wall Street that are saying, hey, Bernie, Bernie is going to tax the shit out of those people. Uh, and he said, he said as much so I don't know how much he's going to tax people. I've tried to pay attention to how the, I mean, essentially what he wants to do is anyone who makes more than a certain amount, he wants to impose a very large tax above that certain amount. You know, Phil figured out whatever that number is, whether it's $10 million a year, whatever the hell it is, anything over that, he's just going to attack the fuck out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       But the problem is that's not going to pay for everything he needs. He needs to, he that tax is going to roll down to the middle class and the lower middle class. And that's sort of the elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about. I mean Hilary's ben talking about it a little bit. She's been bringing this up but, and I, the Republicans have been talking about it cause I don't think they view him as, as anybody that they're going to be facing in the general election. But you know, taxing, taxing that 1% the 2% to 3% whatever it is, you know, you could raise those taxes up to 99% you're not going to pay for free healthcare and education for this, this country. It's not only that, everybody's always complaining about the government. There's too much government. The government's intruding in our lives.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       The government, this government is that when you charge more taxes, you take more taxes. What are you doing? You creating more government. That's just what you're doing now. The money's not going to go or directly to people. You're not going to get a check in the mail folks. It's going to go to the government and then the same incompetent fucks that are handling the irs and all the other shit. Those are the people that are going to be handling this money. What do you think they're going to do? They're going to create more jobs. They're going to have more people working for less. They're gonna make more money and work, get less shit done, and it's going to be more catastrophe. And it's, it's a cluster fuck. There's too many goddamn people is too. And you know what, when 2008 hit, when the, when the economy really went in the Shitter, you know, growth in terms of employment, you know, where it happened.

Speaker 1:          00:13:58       Uh, most of this country was in Washington DC. I mean, you saw the growth of government as, as the economy was absolutely heading south. And that's just, that's the way it works. There's certain, there's certain things about, uh, big government that hold true, whether it's here or outside this country. But anyway, so I, you know, I look at Bernie and I think I hate, yeah, I get it. I liked, I liked the fact that he's been consistent. I think it makes sense. But then you look at the Republican side and then we go back to that picture of trump and you think, how does that, how does that fucking happened? How do you get to this point? And you think about poor, what's his name? Scott Kelly. The astronauts coming down after a long sleep up in the space station. I hope to hell that they haven't told them shit about what's happening. Cause how funny would it be for him to land and trump is the leading candidate and nobody said anything to him yet. And he just comes home, turns on the TV. It's Super Tuesday, trump's one everywhere. And he's going to be, I mean, he's dealing with gravitation and all that stuff. I guess this isn't

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       his biggest deal. Don't take kid like Internet up there. I think he's got something. I'm sure they do. He's got satellite pregnancy and delivery. I mean, he's got to know, I mean, you, you'd go crazy if you're completely removed from life when you're up there. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       I think, uh, I, I'm, I, I would love to think that he doesn't know and he'd be the one person who'd you get gobsmacked when he shows up here and finds out what's going on.

Speaker 3:          00:15:15       You could run last minute. Yeah, look, look, look, look, stop, stop. Well, here's the thing. It's, it's, there's no one else. If Hillary gets tossed up in this email exchange thing, if she gets in trouble for this and you know, it's, it's Bernie. That's it on the, on the democratic side and on the Republican side, it's essentially down to mean cruise. Seems like he's fallen out of it. It's Marco Rubio and Donald Trump and rubio is a distant second and people are so excited about trump because he talks shit. He's, he's bold and brash. He insults people and he's got his own money. He says a bunch of crazy shit. Like this is a great picture of him where it's, it's a photo shopped picture of a, somebody made a picture of him and he's got a gun and he's pointing it out of the window of a car and it says, get in Pussy. We're going to make America great again, but it just seems like there's so many like goofy white guys who are ready. They're ready and psyched to have trump as president. Like some insulting reality star, kind of a president

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       who wants to impose trade sanctions. Yeah. That's what you want to do when when the economy is troubled and weak, that's a great idea is to, is to shut down international trade. That's, that's always proven to be right.

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       Smart thing to do. There's the picture. Look at this picture. Oh God, look. That was my screen saver. See as a comic, I should be excited about this. Yeah, you should be. I should be like, I am going to have a great four years when you have to do anything. You wouldn't have to, there'll be no work involved in that. They would just go on the Internet and it would be a rush to get to the stage quickest with the material. That's, that would be the problem because everybody's going to have the same jokes is the folly will be outrageous. I think people are excited though that he's got his own money. He's not entrenched in the system, the Washington system. But God dammit,

Speaker 1:          00:17:08       no it can't. We can't, uh, we can't have this happen. We have, we have more crisis around the world right now. More hotspots, more potential, very, very serious conflicts going on. And now is the time you would think, whether it comes from the left or the right that you want really clear minded, strategic, smart, pragmatic, reasoned leadership. An essay that, I mean, you know, trump isn't, isn't the guy, um, a hey great that he's insulting people. Great that he's talking outside, but he doesn't, you know, and I'm sure this is going to piss off the, I don't know how many trump supporters you've got listening. Uh, he doesn't stand for anything, right? I mean, he stands for what? I mean, I suppose the sport has, would say stands for winning. Uh, but what the hell does that mean? Tiger blood. Tiger blood. That's it. I had a tiger.

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       It's got Canis Panther bits. Maybe Charlie. She could be his running mate. We'll fucking, he'd win for sure. Thank God. But I mean, but the fact that we've been having a conversation about it, what we're talking about, whether a guy like trump is, is, is suited to be president is astounding, right? We, we get that far in the weeds. We shouldn't even have that conversation. You should be up at the 30,000 foot level. Says, now let's push that to decide. Well, you know, who oddly is impressive to me is Ben Carson. I know he believes a lot of wacky stuff. Like he's not entirely convinced that evolution is real. He's got, he's quite wrapped his head around that one. Yet he's got some wacky ideas. Like he's got a great picture of himself that he's painting, that he had done at his home where it's him and Jesus is behind him and Jesus has his hands on his shoulders.

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       It's, yeah. Okay. Um, and that is this. Oh, hey. We found it. First of all, if I was Jesus, I'd fucking smack him. Why is my head so small? Why are my hands so big? Why am I wearing a bathrobe? What the fuck you and I can extenuate that weird evil widow's peak thing going on. It took a crease in his head like a pit bull. Look. He looks, he's ready to bite your face off the clean line had. You're right Jamie and he's wearing it. Comfy hotel bathroom. That's what that looks like. It doesn't look like, uh, you know, garb from, from the Middle East. Necessary at all. Looks like he's just walked out of the [inaudible]. I talked to your hair. I don't even think they have bleach back then. Did they have bleach in the Jesus days? I mean things were like natural cotton call it. I'm pretty sure they had no tide capsules or even though I don't like how he made Jesus smaller than him either.

Speaker 1:          00:19:36       That's kind of weird. Yeah, that's rude. You know, who knows who painted it for him, but I agree with that. I liked the fact that I get and get to talk about someone who's reasoned. I like the fact that he's reason, but he's not, we got to a point, he's not presidential and we've gotten to that point where there's so many problems with our system. But one of the problems is I think that people are, are hell bent on finding the candidate that they agree with everything on it, agrees with them on everything. And I've got my three little boys are what, eight, six and four. And they know they're not going to get everything they want, right? But they also know that if they, if they work at enough, they'll get some of what they want, right. And then they're going to be happy enough and they'll go off and you know, the day continues, adjust their expectations, their expectations.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       But nobody wants to do that anymore. Been in politics. And so you're, you're getting everybody's splintering off. And so, you know, the worry obviously, and it's not an epiphany, but people talking about all the time on the republican side, it's just, you know, people throw these verbal hand grenades out and there's no way to repair the damage once there is some nominee, if there is a nominee. And he's trying to do that. Now, Chris Christie's now friends with Donald Trump, he's endorsing Donald Trump, jeff sessions and Donald Trump. Newt Gingrich is reportedly talking to Donald Trump. How, how much, and I don't, this sounds wrong, but how, how do you get to the point where you can set aside, um, all your concerns and agree to step forward and say that he's the guy? Um, I don't, I don't know how that works, but yeah, there's, there's not one person that, and that's fine.

Speaker 1:          00:21:10       So what you have to do is you have to look for the combination of character and experience. I think that's what we used to do. And, but it's all bread and circus now. So it doesn't, that shit doesn't matter anymore. I don't know. I think we're going towards the third party at some point. We can't, you can't have a president that is, has any secrets. They can't have any, any sort of a weird kink or weird background. Like could you imagine if JFK was alive today? What kind of shit they would dig up on that guy's alive. Oh cause he was at free. Great. Great President. But he was a freak. The guy was a sexual freak and, and the press corps kept that segment. They do it just like what they did with the Roosevelt and being in the wheelchair tacit agreement. We're not going to bring this up.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       I mean that was how they did it back then because they felt like they had a duty to keep America strong and they just, everybody just kept it to themselves and kept their mouth shut. Yeah. Well I mean taft taft was crazy and you know, with the Preston and bring up any of his shit. How about when Lyndon Johnson literally was doing a press conference while he's taking a shit? That's right. That's a true story. Yeah. Press conference on the toilet, taking a shit in front of a bunch of reporters. He would talk to his cabinet guys or guys would come in and, and he would be dictating notes and he'd be, you know, squatting on the, on the pot there and you've got to admire, they, the guy was comfortable in his own skin. But, uh, I think that, you know, everything's gotten sliced and diced.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       Um, and which is by itself also very divisive. So the more that you do that, the more you take, you know, the country and say, well, we're going to, we're going to slice this up in the various demographics and sectors and groups and opinions and we're going to go after this one. Well by definition you're going to end up pitting groups against each other. And that's what we've been seeing. And I think that's in part why we're, why we're so fuck now. You know, and, and it's not, it's not a new phenomena. I'm not going to throw all that on the current administration. You know, they've been, I think they've been more divisive than they have been unifying. But you know, overall as a country. And part of it may be the speed of information and all the rest of this shit, but it just seems like, you know, we're, we're getting to the point where I think we're going to have to get rid of the two parties, says, Hey, we'll keep the two party system, but we're gonna have to have a third, maybe a fourth. There's got to be more potential opportunities for people because that's what they're demanding. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Anyone else? I think, I think there shouldn't be a president anymore. I think it's a ridiculous ideas to cabinet. Just a committee. Just having one guy that's in show me, we know he's not really in charge. We know there's just too much shit going on. There's no way he could be. There's not mean when something happens, if something goes wrong, like someone, someone said to me something, a drones,

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       they were talking about drones and Obama has blood on his hands. Mike, do you really think he's in charge of all that? Do you really think there's any way this guy could be on top of the economy, can be on top of international trade? It could be on top of international relations. And he's also piloting drones.

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       There's a lawyer in the White House basically, by the way, who makes that call on high value targets and whether we get to go or not go a lawyer, a lawyer does. Yeah. Yeah. Go figure. How does it know with no real national security experience? Who's The guy? Don't even say his name. I won't say, I won't say the name, but, so this guy decides whether or not it's worth the potential casualties. Yeah, there's a, there's a shitload of work that goes on in, uh, in getting to that point where you can say, we've got the target package. We, uh, can we go or not go? And people, you know, and again, I understand, you know, when people think that the, you know, the agencies out there, you know, look at the, create a one world government, a screw everybody over. But, um, how the fuck could that ever happen? I had all that shit

Speaker 2:          00:24:47       drives me fucking crazy. The FBI and CIA can't even get along long

Speaker 1:          00:24:51       and you can't, well I mean, and sometimes you don't get it right. Right, exactly. I mean there are so many, and maybe cause we talk about checks and balances, we talk about the Intel committees and you know, the sort of that nature, but maybe what maybe what really keeps us safe from the one world government has affected, you know, there's so much territorial pissing that goes on between the different agencies. But the point being is that once you get that target package and you, and you, you, you've got to go get approval and the approval is not housed in the, in the agency. It's not housed at the Pentagon final decision makings over at the White House. And it's, it's, it's, it's basically a legal perspective. And so once that's done, then yeah, sure you can, you can fire a rocket up their ass if, you know, if they're still where they are and you can get the decision made quick enough.

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       But it's, uh, yeah, I, but I agree with it. So your, your, your point is correct. You know, the president, you know, it's like a CEO of a company, you know, he didn't know what the hell is going on past his division leaders or no, he could, there's no way he could possibly know all the things that are going on that the United States is involved with all over the world. There's no way. I mean, what do we have? How many different paces don't we have like bases in more than a hundred countries? Yeah, yeah. I mean if you just define a base as the u s you know, permanent or semipermanent presence. Yeah. It's, it's a, it's a lot. But there's no, and then, and not just that, but I mean every, every other operation that goes on, every other activity that goes on, every, there's, you know, that's why, but I will say that's why you want at the top while we still have a president.

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       That's why you want someone who's very reasoned and, uh, clear-eyed, uh, not thin skinned. She wants someone who can negotiate. You want someone who doesn't think they're the smartest person in the room and then they need to be able to pull together the cabinet that is going to actually start making decisions. And I think presidential candidates even at this stage, should be required to WHO's going to be in their cabinet. Who would be your choice for, for these various, but yeah, I think, you know, that doesn't really get brought up, right? No. Oh No, no. I and I, I, you know, I think it would make a big difference. You want to know who their team is going to be and you know, who knows? Maybe that would cause a scramble for top people and then you'd, I don't know what that was all that would mean, but it, it's a, let's just say it's a very disappointing political season.

Speaker 1:          00:27:09       My big fear is that we're going to have artificial intelligence and then one day artificial intelligence is going to govern world policy and world world issues. I really believe that. I know I'm a Carter for thinking this, but I think that there's a co was going to come a point in time where we establish rules of operation, you know, do no harm or do the least harm possible. You know, these are the laws, these are the parameters that we need to uh, operate in. These are the rules that we need to enforce. And this is when something gets like, like something like Isis, when it gets to a point where everyone agrees, okay, we have a, we have a tremendous issue. We've got to do something militarily, strategically. Some, some choices have to be made. What do we do? And that you could punch this in somehow or another to something, some sort of artificial intelligence and it will dish out some sort of a decision based upon the rules of engagement based upon the, the agreed upon parameters that we have set.

Speaker 1:          00:28:07       Yeah, I mean, yeah, we're kind of marching it, I know what the world would get to that point. But you know, we certainly work games scenarios out where you're, you're running a large number of potential possibilities, um, through the system. And it, and it is literally like you said, it's spitting out, you know, likely outcomes. And you're weighing that against me because one big part that it's always missed because you know, again, there's this tendency to think that, you know what, people are just out there doing shit for the hell of it, but there's a, there's a big risk versus gain calculation that goes on, whether it's at the agency or the military anywhere else. And so you're constantly evaluating this and part of that eventually becomes political risk, political blow back. Um, so yeah, that's like the Benghazi thing. How did I end up on that?

Speaker 1:          00:28:50       Um, but you look at Benghazi and you think, um, here's the part I don't understand about that. And not that you asked, but all they had to do during the course of that attack and they had no idea how long that attack was going to go on for. All they had to do was put the birds up with the guys in them and head towards Bengazi. That's all they had to do. And then this would not have ever been a story. They probably wouldn't have gotten there in time to save lives, but they would've gotten there. They would have been there, they would have secured the facility, they would have helped with the dust to clean up and they it, and it wouldn't have been an issue. But the idea that they could all be sitting around in the war room watching this and not have that, you know, pop in their heads because three to four weeks down the road was a national election.

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       And all I could imagine was who's going to be some goat rope. And they couldn't get the, to the point where they thought there'd be zero risk, but it doesn't any sense. All those guys on the ground wanted was to know that the calvary had been called, they didn't expect to be saved, but they thought that help would be on its way because that's what you do. And, and it's a, it's one of those strange. So when you talk about, you know, scenarios in war gaming and potential political blow back and all that, it's a fascinating world where you sit in a war room and all these different sides are being debated. My perspective on my gaseous, I just don't understand why they didn't just try. That's all they had to do. And so we would have been a stories because of the election. I think there were, I think there were more political operatives in that room then a then tactical operators. And I think that somebody got jammed up, um, who wanted to spin them up and send them. And I think that it was probably because, and again, I understand it's speculation and I get it, and I'm not one of those people that said they could have saved those lives. That wouldn't happen. But I just don't understand the simple concept that one of those political operatives who said, you know what, if we don't try, yeah, we might get fucked on this.

Speaker 3:          00:30:40       Well, shouldn't there also be a scenario or at least a, just a rule in place that whenever there's an attack you send in the troops, that's, that's the component that you're supposed to be keeping. That's a promise is supposed to be there. And that's why I promise that's a great way of putting it. And that's why all those, all the guys have been, you know, in the folks that were in that program

Speaker 1:          00:30:59       and, and everybody I know was, is people say why, why would you be fixated on this? Why, why, you know, why is this important? It doesn't mean, you know, like Hillary Clinton said, what Ma, what difference does it, yeah, exactly. And for that reason that you said there is, there is this understanding that you will make the effort, you'll try and nobody out there on that pointy edge of the spear expects that there'll be saved. But they do expect that someone's going to call the calvary

Speaker 3:          00:31:26       and throw the idea that you're left hanging to be hung out to dry with an a. It's not like there's no resources. That's where it doesn't make any sense. You know, we have no sources. Yeah. That's why it's so disturbing to people. It's like if this was a political decision, it's like to try to minimize blow back because of the election coming up. So let's just not do anything. If that was the decision, well that that's contrary to the whole purpose of having military in the first place. Like if there's a fucking attack he supposed to send in the troops, particularly attack on your facilities and particularly to make sure that that fucking never happens again because you know that every time there's an election coming up and well they're not going to do shit because there's an election coming up in two weeks now we can go in and it's time to do it. Yeah. That's a crazy precedent to set. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:09       Well it, it, it, it is. And again, I wasn't there. I don't know. I just, in looking at it all the various scenarios and knowing what resources were available and knowing what the guys expected on the ground, I just don't, I don't, I don't get it. And you know, for a group, meaning the administration that's supposed to be so clever and politically savvy, it just didn't make any sense. And now they've been having to suffer with it ever since. And aside from the fact that they did, judges didn't fucking make the effort to try to save these people. And again, not that they would have, but how do you not, how do you not try? I don't, I don't understand that.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       I don't understand any of it. I don't understand. Whenever they're making decisions based on whether or not there's an election coming up and you would do something differently if there was and in people's lives could be lost because an elections coming up versus how you would behave. It was first term or first year, first term. I think it's all madness.

Speaker 1:          00:33:00       Well, there's a risk aversion, um, that that takes hold. And we got to a point, and it's not just a recent thing, it's not just this administration, you know, to be fair, but there's this, this understanding or this belief somehow that we can get to a zero risk on a military operation or an intelligence operation. And you know, so show me that we won't have casualties. Well, what the, what the fuck does that mean? You're at a risk taking business. You want to try to minimize that risk for sure. But when, when, when your decision making gets to that point and you start, then it starts feeding down through the ranks and you start getting mid level managers rising up who believed that, you know, uh, a good watch is when nothing happens on their watch. You've got a real problem because it's unrealistic. Yeah. I mean you don't, again, you don't, you don't want to rush you out there. You know, until you, you, you, you want to have a game plan, right? You want to know what you're doing operationally. But you know, there, there are certain things that are worth bend and you spear over now for a guy like you

Speaker 3:          00:33:57       that was in the CIA for so long, it's been involved in this stuff for so long. How exhausting is all of this because it seems to me that like, it seems like it never ends. It seems like you

Speaker 1:          00:34:07       like

Speaker 3:          00:34:09       is step back for a little while and it just piles up more. It did. Indeed. If you retire, the new guy comes in and you look at the new guy doing it and like the same shit's happening and it doesn't seem like anybody put a dent in anything and it continues to go on like the Middle East at one point. What point in time? I mean how I know what you're getting at there. That seems pretty buttoned up. I think we've got that under control. It's the craziest fucking place in the world. It's the if the whole world, okay, let's put it this way. If the whole world was serious, right? Yeah. It was just one big one. Big series. Syria. What, what the fuck if the whole world he was Olivia. Yeah. Yeah. Imagine the whole world was Libya. What?

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       Nah. You know what? I, um, if you had told us, we spent a lot of time trying to get the Soviets out of Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the Soviet strike. I spend a lot of time trying to get themselves out of there. About four years into their occupation, their, and they realize, and we know this because we've seen the, you know, the Kremlin papers and we've had, you know, access to a lot of their, their thinking at that time. Uh, they, after about year four, they said, this is fucked up. We gotta get Outta here. But what could they do? So they spent the next five years or so try a variety of things. They tried to, first of all, they tried to find a government are individuals that they could, they could leave and place that we continue to push their agenda.

Speaker 1:          00:35:31       They couldn't find anybody. They were dealing with corruption. We know that they couldn't, you know, they couldn't get past a lot of the corruption. That sounds familiar. They retreated from the countryside and decided, well, we'll just hold the urban centers. So that's exactly what we did. So they went through the same problems that we did. If you would said anything when we were out there handing a weapons systems, the Musha Dean, and in retrospect maybe that wasn't a good idea. Um, but if you had told us that we'd be back two and a half decades later, doing the same thing that the Soviets were doing, you know, trying to, I don't know what, what we're trying to do, build a nation, you know, uh, sell democracy where they don't have a fucking clue what we were selling. Um, so we don't, part of it is what, what you were saying.

Speaker 1:          00:36:15       We don't learn from our mistakes. So that's why that's the probably the most tiring part is watching shit happen over and over and cycles and every generation thinks they can do it better. And so that's, and that's a good thing probably, but there's a lot of Hubris involved, right? And thinking that you're going to do this somehow, it's going to be different this time. I had a guy debating this guy who, uh, uh, will remain anonymous. She was in the military and, um, we were in, we were in Afghanistan, um, at that point already with trying to nation build. And I was very pessimistic about the whole thing. And I kept saying this a fucking, you know, uh, this is not what we should be doing with our boys are women as well and the resources and everything else. I said, they don't understand what the fuck we're after here.

Speaker 1:          00:37:00       And we did a great tactical mission, you know, right after nine 11 we did a beautiful, I sound like trump. Beautiful. That's the mission. And that's what we're good at. What great attack, tactical missions. But then you know, about springtime in 2002, we should have gotten the fuck out so that if you do it again, we're going to come back. And we didn't, we stayed because we wanted to build a road or improve their literacy rate by a couple of points. So this guy said, well, it's different this time, because I was saying, look, it didn't work for the Russians. Why do you think it's gonna work for us? And he said, well, they hated the Russians. And I thought, wow, that's, that's your reasoning is because somehow they like us, they or they, they're gonna, you know, we're going to fill chocolate bars out to him and they, you know, they're going to end and stockings and they're going to come running.

Speaker 1:          00:37:40       I mean, what the Hell is that point? But we have this, this mentality that we're going to do it better this time. So you look at, you look at, uh, you look at Isis for example, and I mean, who couldn't have guessed if we completely walk out, you can debate all sorts of things about Iraq, but who couldn't have seen, if you'll walk out of that place, it was going to devolve into chaos. If you leave a vacuum, it's not good. And so that's what we've got. But we keep doing the same things over and over again. And you could argue what we've doing in Iraq. We did all those years ago after the Soviets left Afghanistan. And so we left and it evolved into what it devolves into. And oddly enough, there were a lot of neo cons who thought that was terrible. We felt guilty about that. So now we're going to get it right this time. We're going to stay not thinking about what happened to the Soviets. I Dunno. I Dunno. I remember when Mccain was debating Obama when they were running for president and Obama was

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       talking about going into Afghanistan. And uh, I remember this is a very sobering moment where Mccain said, what, what are you talking about going to Afghanistan? You just going to send troops in. Do you understand that place? And it was clear that Obama didn't, you could tell by his body language. You could tell by the way he was speaking about it, mccain had this really clear sentence. He said, that plays hasn't changed since Alexander the Great was running it. And when, when he said that, I remember thinking like, Whoa, what the fuck? So then I started researching Afghanistan, then I started researching the terrain and how crazy it is. It's like literally like trying to control like the rocky mountains, like the back country out of hell. It's so remote. It's so impossible to get to. And then you find out that there's really only one city. There's Kabul in the entire country. This basically, you know, it was a few little towns. There's one city. Yeah. And it's just warm.

Speaker 1:          00:39:31       Don't know what they don't know what we've been trying to sell them. And it's the same with, with Iraq. It's the same with Libya. Libya's a complete hot mess. Now,

Speaker 2:          00:39:39       isn't it crazy that getting rid of Qaddafi made Libya

Speaker 1:          00:39:42       worse? Well, it, it Kadafi here's the, that wacky thing. Kadafi was kind of our guy, uh, on counter terrorism for a few years before he got, you know, got pushed out. And because he had, he had found Jesus and you know, not literally I guess. Yeah, whatever, however they put it. Um, and he had started to cooperate with us and then the Arab spring happened and then there was this bizarre belief that democracy was going to sweep through the region. And the Italians and French came to us and said, you know, we've got lots of interests there in Libya, widget back us up. We had no national security interests in Libya and yet we went in and we did what we did and now it's a shit hole. It's 130 some odd tribes in Libya, and we're still talking right now. We're still talking as if somehow we're going to find a federal government and that's what's going to help us.

Speaker 1:          00:40:27       Because then one of the genitals just came out yesterday or today or whenever, and he said, well, I don't think the Olympian Olympians are gonna be able to take care of isis themselves because Isis, now you've got a very strong, uh, holden in Libya because they're smart because they realize they're having problems in Syria and Iraq. They've been looking for another place. Libya is chaotic. So the general says, I, you know, what? You know, so once we get this unified government, then we can work on training and assisting and providing resources and it just over and over. So to answer your original question, but in a very roundabout way, yes, it's, it's, it's tiring because you see the same shit

Speaker 2:          00:41:01       over and over again. Yeah. I can only imagine. I can only imagine just trying, just trying to nation build the scene, seeing these people that, first of all, you're dealing with completely different cultures, completely different cultures. Completely different educations. People who are so backwards so far gone that taking a 45 year old man who is so fucked up and crazy and religious and trying to convert him to the ways of the west, like these, these fucking people that executed that kid the other day in the middle of Iraq's yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       For playing music. Yeah. Because he was playing western music. They beheaded him.

Speaker 1:          00:41:37       Yeah. Probably don't understand that. We can't process it, but we have never been able to, you talk about the Viet Cong and we used to go in and you know, we thought we were helping a village and go into the hockey league village and the Viet Cong in to come in there and kill them because, you know, they'd had contact with us. One of the first people that we hired, uh, uh, sometime ago from my company and diligence, uh, for all your information and security needs a little plot. I don't blog. One of the first guys we hired was a Russian came out of the, their gru. And, uh, right after we'd gone in for the tour bore operation, he came to me and he had been a tank driver out in Afghanistan during the occupation for the Russians and, and, uh, and he came and he, you could just see, he was like the intensity on his face, you know, and, and, uh, I had known him for a while and so anyway, he grabbed me and he said, he said, he said that was brilliant.

Speaker 1:          00:42:30       He said, meaning Tora Bora, meaning what we have quickly, we had acted. He said that was brilliant. He says, don't stay. He said, don't stay. They're like cockroaches. He says [inaudible] meaning you step on them here, they show up over here and you could just see in his face and that, that son of a bitch was right. And if I'd been smart, I would have dragged him back to the states and taking them into the Pentagon and had them say that every hour on the hour, you know, until somebody figured out what the hell we should have been doing. Um, but yeah, we don't, we don't seem to listen. Sometimes you got to jump in. Sometimes you got to take charge and sometimes you need somebody who's in charge. You need a leader at the top of this food chain around the world because if you don't have, when you get what we get now, I would argue that part of the problem we have is the administration for whatever their motivation, whatever their reasons. And again, you know, fine, they want to do it. That's their, that's what they're gonna do. They've stepped off the world stage to some degree. They don't want to be the world's policemen are the world's lead or they don't want to be at the top. And when you do that, it's not as if suddenly a community of nations fills that void. Some other interest is going to try to become the top dog. That's just the fucking way.

Speaker 3:          00:43:35       So it's almost like there's a balance that's already been achieved and you have to maintain that balance some way in some way, shape or form. I would respond to us,

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       be at the top of the food chain because I think, and some people will argue and there's always, you know, the folks who think we never act in [inaudible] best interest of anybody and you just

Speaker 3:          00:43:52       pretend I'm them. Sure. It's the greatest terrorist organization, the world, man. Don't you know that's, you know what? That's exactly what I'm talking about. Spin invading countries forever, man. Why don't you just leave them alone just for oil. Yeah. All we want is oil and gemstones, diamonds. We definitely want that stuff. We didn't want that stuff. Sure. Yeah. The problem is we want that stuff too, right? So it's, but it's not that cut and dry. You've got some fucked up parts of the world and the more I talked to people that have been the fall, those fucked up parts of the world, the more that picture is starting to be clear and clear. The Mar Mar, I talked to guys like Jocko willink who've been over there, seals, people that have served over there. You get this of this place that's

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       not America. And you get a lot of people that are talking about the rest of the world as if we're talking about America, like bad spots in America, like oil. We need to fix Chicago. Well it says fucking fix in Chicago's Goddamn cake walk compared to fixing Cabo or fixing any of these spots in the world. Syria.

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       Yeah. And by the way, we could, we could, we could be at the top of the global food chain and still fixed Chicago. Yeah. We can multitask. But in, I guess that, yeah, I spent enough time behind the curtain, a of the u s government and that, you know, my, my view was his college somewhat. Right. And I understand everybody's got their opinions based on their, their experiences, my experiences, what it is. I don't, I, I don't believe the US government is out there to fuck everybody over. They, sometimes they make a mistake. We tend to be a pretty self correcting nation. We try, sometimes it takes awhile, whatever. But you know, we, I would rather us be the ones up there, uh, trying to, to uh, direct traffic. Then some other nations like China or Russia or Iran for the Middle East just make decision making and we don't always get it right.

Speaker 1:          00:45:39       Absolutely not. And you do have to have checks and balances of course your fucking toe. I mean it's, you know, that's, you know, that's where people always, you know, fall on one side of there while you're just, all you want to do is steal oil and treasure. No, I just want, I want to try to ensure that we've got some good intent at the top of the food chain and I think the u s is, is well positioned for that because we try, and again, we don't always get it right, but we make that effort so people can disagree and I'm sure they are right now saying, ah, he's got an opinion, but well, yeah I do. Well you, you,

Speaker 2:          00:46:11       you actually have a qualified opinion and that's the difference between your opinion and someone who's going, the United States. Man, we need to stay out of other countries, man. Th I think we need to pay attention to what's going on outside of the United States for sure. I just don't know what you could possibly do to sort of smooth over the Middle East and bring them up to date. I just don't know how you could, how do you bring Isis up to date? How do you say, hey guys, you really, you can't execute 15 year old kids for listening to rap music.

Speaker 1:          00:46:40       You can't, you can't negotiate. You can't, it's not an organization that we're going to be able to deal with in, in, in, in a, in a manner that would make us all feel happy because we talk them down from, you know, from the ledge and, and, and then I could have committed violence anymore. That's, that's not going to happen. Um, and you can't also kill your way out of it. There's that, that's the other part of it. So how do you do it? Well, you try to, you try to manage it and you manage it in part by not allowing the extremist to have their own fucking territory because that, that caliphate that they'd been Jonesing for all this time. That's one of the reasons why they've been having so much success in recruiting foreign fighters. And that's when a shit load of people going into that place and they do it because, hey look, we finally got our own turf.

Speaker 1:          00:47:27       Now we can take that turf. Uh, it's, it's, it's now much more problematic because we sat on the sidelines for some time and the Russians are in there and nobody wants to get into a shooting match with the Russians at this stage of the game. But denying them territory and then realizing that like with cockroaches are going to pop up over here and then they've got a more fun, they're going to be over here. We're just gonna have to play whack a mole for the rest of our lives. Probably this doesn't go away, but we can minimize it. And we can be aggressive enough without saying we're going to try to nation build and also sell them something that they don't understand. So I don't know. I just, but, but I can't, having sat on the sidelines for a while, we've created more of a mess, um, at this stage of the game, the Russian and Iranian influence, uh, in Syria, uh, the neurons have more influence in the Middle East now than they've had in modern times. And this is this. They can't imagine their good fortune. And so now what are we doing one? Now the headlines are, look, they just had elections and the reformists are winning as if somehow Rod's going to change its tune. It's insane. We've had that hope for decades and decades, and every time there's a little glimmer of, you know, maybe the reformist, the moderates, you know, are going to rise up. It, it doesn't happen.

Speaker 2:          00:48:38       Well, didn't we have a part of that too though, right? Like we're, we, we brought in the ayatollah to get rid of the shah. Yeah. I'm, they're like, uh, well we, we, yeah, we didn't, so much foam ended as we just stood by and watched it happen. And so what happened, I mean, it wasn't sort of influenced that at all. Now the shot was our guy, the Shah was our gunshot was our guy. We brought in the shot though, right?

Speaker 1:          00:49:03       Yeah, yeah. I mean we, we, and the Shah was a son of a bitch, you know, just in the same, he was,

Speaker 2:          00:49:08       yeah. Frankly, it was not much different than Bashir Assad or Assad's Dad. I got it confused. So the ayatollah came in and how did the ayatollah get into,

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       oh, he was in exile in France and, um, there had been for some time because of the brutality of the Shaw, there had been a hard line, a clerical uprising, you know, sort of directing traffic amongst the population.

Speaker 2:          00:49:31       And so the Shah who was our guy was brutal and he was fucking up.

Speaker 1:          00:49:35       Right. Right. And he had it, he had a very brutal intelligence service. And, uh, so that was, yeah, that wasn't a happy chapter in the sense of, um, you know, was the Shah our guy? Well, yes, but have we had other guys that were, you know, dead spots or, or not, not so much. Desk spots is just really unsavory. People that in an ideal world you wouldn't want to associate with, but the real world doesn't work that way. There are some fucked up people out there. And the fact of the matter is sometimes you got to deal with a person that's there. Oh, that was the argument about,

Speaker 2:          00:50:11       but what's going on in Iraq, right? No, that was the audit or the argument about Saddam Hussein. It's about Saddam Hussein was a horrible person. He's a dangerous guy. But getting rid of them might be worth.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       Yeah. And then there were a number of people that said that and what turned that tide and people will, you know, people like trump himself, you know, ah, you know, Bush lied. People died. You know, it was only George Bush who thought there was weapons of mass distraction.

Speaker 2:          00:50:33       Lady shifted. He said, if he gets an office, he's going to find out the truth about who brought the towers down. Oh my God. No, he's a fucking truther. He's a truth or not. Not only that, he's also remember, remember he's a birther, he thinks Obama was born in Kenya. Do you remember that? Everybody's conveniently ignored this. I know. Yeah. Nobody is going after the obvious shit. I didn't know, but I didn't know about that. The truth or bit. Oh my God. It just keeps, it keeps, keeps piling on. This is a recent statement that he made.

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       Um, yeah, I, you know what? It's a, how does that, how again, how does it, how does it happen that this country is fantastic country? Again, I spent most of my life overseas. I can go to the deepest, darkest shit somewhere out there, middle of nowhere. And someone will, will say, if I go to America, I can work this hard and I can do really well. I just have to, I, you know, if I can get to America, they still people out there in the middle of nowhere, still believe the American dream. And yet you worry about it because I think we seem to be given up on it here. If this is the best we've got, if we're willing to follow this guy, you know, down the down the tunnel. I don't know. I know where we're heading, but it's not good. And you know, and I also worry about part of it with Bernie Sanders going back to him is I think sometimes the young people who support him, part of it is sort of being disheartened, you know, since 2008 they don't see themselves as being part of the American dream. And if you don't imagine yourself working hard and becoming wealthy, then you don't give a shit whether tax rates go up to 85% or not. It doesn't matter to you because it's not going to be you. It's going to be somebody else.

Speaker 2:          00:52:10       Well, it's just so confusing to people that no one can get it. Right. I mean, everybody had these hopes and dreams for Obama and he was going to get an office. I remember this, this lady that was when Obama got elected, she was, uh, she was, she was so happy and she was saying, I'm so happy because now I know that if, uh, my mortgage needs to be paid, he's going to help me. And it was like, there's this really weird like moment where I realized like, wow, these people don't really understand how complex this entire system is. And you dealing with a guy who's stepping into the office, right? When all these banks are failing, right? When all of this collapse is happening and people think that all of a sudden this guy's gonna come in and he's going to have a completely different set of priorities and he's going to find all these people, you losing your house, we're going to fix that. We're going to get that guy to that. There's 300 million people in this country, ma'am. And there's not enough money to buy everybody's mortgage back and fix it. It's just not going to happen. We voted the guy into office who had no experience. He never had a job.

Speaker 1:          00:53:12       And yeah, and, and so you get what you get. And I understand. Okay, everybody was excited. Sure. Hope and change and all that idea. It was, it was very powerful message that they were delivering. It was a smart, smart campaign, but you would think that over a period of time then what we'd really

Speaker 3:          00:53:25       want now is somebody, and again, I didn't know where to find them, but if somebody with that combination of experience and character and a proven ability, a track record to work both sides, right? To say, look, we're going to be able to negotiate. We're going to compromise. We're going to find, you know, it's not rocket fucking science to work out some of these problems. Right. But the more problems we get and the more negative we get about them, it seems insurmountable. But we should be able to find somebody in this massive country of ours who, um, you know, can propose some, uh, clear-eyed ideas. I don't know. Well, for me it almost seems like taking a guy who, this is analogy that makes sense to me. Taking guys never fought before and then, um, make him run for the UFC and now all is you're going to fight in the UFC.

Speaker 3:          00:54:12       What was your fucking experience Fridays? I, you're welcome. You don't have any experience. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like all of a sudden this guy gets his job. It's the most complicated an impossible job in the world. And he's, he's never, he's never served. He's never been overseas. He's never experienced combat. He doesn't know what it means to be involved in a war. He's never been there physically boots on the ground. Okay. I'm not saying he has to, but I'm saying in that help, but what wouldn't that flavor, how you would understand and consider military action if you had actually been there, whether you'd been there like at least Bush senior had been in the CIA. He had been the head of CIA. Bush Jr was class senior was a World War II. Yes, that's right. Right. This guy shot down, it's Bush senior was probably the most qualified guy and to shut up, asked her to China, China, head of the CIA.

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       A war hero. Uh, I mean look the guy, you know, but yeah, you're right. Shit on now left and right and, and that's where we're at. You can't, you can't disagree with somebody's opinions without crapping on them. Right? Yeah. You can't just say, look, I get it. You've got different opinions than I do. Yeah. Okay, fine. Let's talk. Let's figure out where is the workable solution that you have to have this. Speaker two, this is the other thing. You have to be this engaging, entertaining individual who I'd like to hear talk. I want to hear like one of the things that was so great about Obama was how good he is. A giving speeches. It's brilliant, brilliant orator. I mean, he had me, I was like, this is my fucking guy. Yeah. I listened to him talk, finally got a smart guy. And as opposed to Bush, who was Bush jr who was an awkward sort of a guy.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       I mean, w just wasn't that good of a talker and you know, people would say he's stupid. He's a dumb guy. Go back and listen to him when he was running for governor of Texas. He's not a dumb guy. No you don't. You're tired and overwhelmed. You don't get, you don't get to those positions. You know, by being an idiot. You made disagree with people's positions. Like I disagree with Bernie Sanders. I don't, I don't wish him any ill will. I don't, I'm not horrified that he's running. I think that's the way it works in this country. Um, I disagree with the concept of, of socialism or democratic socialism, but at the same time I understand and I appreciate the fact that that's what he believes and he's believed it for a long time. So great.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       Let's, you know, and, and you're right, we should be trying to, to, to help people that need a leg up. We should be trying to provide a safety net, you know, for the, for the people that need it. We should be trying to at the same time promoting the concept of hard work and success. There's, there's nothing wrong fucking it all. There's nothing wrong with success. You work hard. It's like, it's like monopoly. Monopolies decided they're going to, I don't know whether for all their board games now, but monopoly is going to take away the paper money and give you a bank card wide. Yeah, yeah. That sets, I couldn't believe it when I saw Hasbro, which owns when offaly they said, well, we're going to use a bank card for now on. So all those kids out there, because I don't know, maybe they don't want them to learn how to count paper money because maybe it's unseemly.

Speaker 1:          00:57:01       I'm reading something into it. It's not there obviously, but it just did not. Yeah. It's part and parcel of my kids. You know, they started a, they started playing basketball a couple seasons ago and uh, I remember the first league, they didn't want to keep score. Oh yeah. That's a big one. What the fuck? Yeah. You're not allowed to be a loser. Yeah. And we don't want to put these kids through stress, but you know what? I was playing softball. Nobody. One, what the fuck are you doing? Why are you playing? Get off the field. Let's go do something else. If you, if nobody's going to wink out to feel bad, that's part of being a kid. Feel bad. And you go, did fat fucking sucked and then you practice. And you know what? And those kids know I could ask my six year old, I could ask, I could ask sluggo way into the third quarter of a basketball game and say, what's the score?

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       And he would know the scores. All the kids knew the score, they all all keeping score. And so we're just blowing smoke up, you know, the parents asked and, and, and, and consequently, we think we're being clever with our kids. The saying, Hey, you know, this will be fine. They got, but I don't know how I got off on this, but my kid walked off the scooter, the oldest one walked off the lacrosse field, uh, and looked at me and he said, so how'd I do? And I said, well, yeah, I don't honestly, do you want me to be honest or do you want me to blow smoke up your ass? And I, I'd said it and I didn't realize it, where the parents around and they were horrified. And then I got a dressing down. And, uh, anybody said, God bless him. He said, I want you to be honest.

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       And I said, well, you didn't, you didn't really try as hard as you could. I said, you know, you don't have to be the best, but you got to try really hard. And the only reason that other kid was with scoring on it was because he wanted it more. And I said, and you can do that, you know, and, and you, you can tell kids that they're, they're not playing their best. You can in a nice, you know, constructive way. But God forbid we should, we should hurt any of these little snowflakes, right? By telling him this crap, and now what do we get? All those kids that started years ago when we started this movement to not keep score or anything. Now they're all at Yale or Amhurst and they, they think that being contradicted means they're being persecuted. And so we created this monster ourselves. And now a lot of those people that, you know, they, they look and they don't believe because they've been told they're victims and the system's rigged and they're getting fucked every day. They don't believe they can be part of the system. So sure. They look at Bernie and they think, yeah, that's about right. That's what we need. And they find likeminded people. They band together, they all agree on the same thing, and they're, they're, they're having a battle right now to try to see who can be the most open minded,

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       the most liberal, the most accepting. And that's where the competition is. The competition is being the most left wing, the most progressive that they're, they're fucking each over other, over on progressiveness. Yeah. I just asked progressing even the words of justice, it's not even know. It's, um, it's madness. It's so, Madison isn't even a word. I can't even have a word for it. Yeah. Progressive. Making the word. Yeah. George Bush made that up. We're getting to a weird porn point where we're trying to coddle people and we're not allowing them to experience defeat. We're not allowing them to experience discomfort, which is how people grow. When if you don't feel uncomfortable, you don't learn. You don't learn from every mistake that I've ever made made me feel like shit and that's how I get better at things.

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       Yeah, cause you learned. I don't want to feel that way again. So how do I get better? How do I, how do I do this? But if you don't do it with wrestling, that's a good question. That is, he can get pinned. You don't get pinned. Okay. Shit. You know, I mean how the fuck they call up before you get pins and say, Oh hey were okay. You look like you're approaching a pin, so let's stop it. How are they going to do it? Because I'll tell you what, man, I, this fucking times I got pinned when I was 14 years old. It's still fuck with my head. Cut me. Carry that. All these years in the gym, lifting weights. Think about some kid pinned me fucking high school and I'll get angry little Bobby Schwartz. That's father fiber. I'll start doing extra chin ups for that prick. I'm going to go find. That's what motivates you,

Speaker 2:          01:00:46       motivates you, you know? I mean, getting tapped out in Jujitsu there, there are guys that have tapped me out that are literally like, when I'm tired, I will think about them tapping me out and I will push further. That is the only thing that motivates you is that fee. What's one of the only things that's really a powerful motivating factor that everyone can relate to is that feeling of defeat, that horrible feeling where you go, you know what? I got to get better. I got to get better because someone's better. And the idea that you're saying that no one's ever better, you're perfect. That's not true. It's not true. You get better at stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:01:19       There's always somebody that's always just like, I tell my kids, because always somebody is going to be bigger than you. There's always somebody that's going to be smarter than you. That's fine. All you can do is the absolute best you can do. And you work at it. And if you fall down, you know, if I could lose, yeah. You got to learn how to lose weight, how to lose as an important part of being a grownup. But we've got, I mean, look at it, look at it again. Look at this. The, the, the irony of, of kids and expensive colleges, um, denigrating free speech because it, it, it upsets their feelings. Rest the fucking kidding me. Progressive aggressors. We've got to look that word up. Can we get some help on this? My God. Yeah. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:01:54       the idea of being a progressive is a great idea. You know, you want everybody to be equal and you want equality as far as law and how people are treated and how you address people. And no one is, no one starts out in a worse spot. But once that's established, then you've got to compete. Yeah. And you have to, and it's good for everybody. It's good for you. It's good for me. It's given, as long as you're competing fairly, it, it generates that competition. Generates a lot of good things. First of all, it generates ambition. It generates success. If you overcome these, these obstacles that are created by competition, you understand what, what needs to be done in order to achieve things. You, you, if you're going to go through life and you're never going to have any obstacles, you never going to have any character testing moments. You're not even gonna know what you're capable.

Speaker 1:          01:02:47       No, I just started, I mean, and that's not much of a life lived. I mean, at the, at the end of the day, if you're not tested and you, and you're not pushed and you don't, and you don't fail, I mean, I remember times when, yeah, it just, it didn't even, uh, you, you, you knew it wasn't going to work out, right? Yeah. But you just, it like you said, it made you work harder. It made you push harder and you realized, uh, it's like, you know what it's like, it's like interrogation trading. I don't know. I don't know why this popped in my head, but it's interrogation training. The whole point of interrogation training is to break you down. So that you realize you've got a point where it's just going to happen. So an interrogation training, like is it training you to be able to deal with being interrogated?

Speaker 1:          01:03:26       Yeah. So what are they doing? But you also have the other side of the coin, which is, you know, learning, learning how to navigate and negotiate and all the rest of it. We like to call it negotiation. Um, so, but the idea being is that, you know, when you're in, in a, in an interrogation training, the idea is you have to understand that at some point, no matter who you are is you're, it's gonna fall apart. And then what you need is you need to be able to pull yourself back together again. So the idea of interrogation trading in part is to show you that hey, you can go farther than you thought you could, but also at some point you're just going to say, fuck it. I May. Because, uh, you know, depending on where we're at, you know you're going to break. I mean, it's going to happen. And when you do, you've got gotta be able to, otherwise you're just a puddle of Goo, right? You've got to pull yourself back together again. So it's a bit like that failure. Like you said, failure teaches success. Failure drives success. Unless, you know, unless we teach waning a culture of just fucking mediocrity and what we are. Yeah, we are. Yeah. Well that's a happy sign.

Speaker 2:          01:04:25       I have to learn the consequences. We Egan, no, you can't nerf the world. You have to learn the consequences of fucking up. And if you don't learn the consequences of fucking up, you never understand what it takes. There are people that work harder than you. There are people that are smarter than you. They're people that want it more. There are people that are more ambitious. There are people that are more intense and more focused and more disciplined. And if there are not, then somehow or another, we're all perfect and equal. And that's not the case. And that's not the case. Well, this, this competition fuels everything. We have like, look, here's a perfect example. Every year cars get faster. Why do they get faster? Because they're fucking competing against each other. Chevy is competing against this company. They're competing against forward and they're all trying to make a car that goes zero to 60 and a half, a second night, and every fucking year they get closer to that.

Speaker 2:          01:05:08       I mean, there's one reason for that and it's because there's other cars out there that are doing a better job there. Skid pad and numbers are getting higher there. Quarter mile numbers are getting lower. They're getting faster, they're handled better, they're getting safer. All they're doing this because of competition. And that's the only thing that fuels innovation. Competition fuels innovation and this desire that everybody has to, I want to get the newest, greatest shit. Right. You know, and that's where they talked about cars. We were talking about phones where they're told what it doesn't matter what it is. Yeah, it's everything. Human beings look whilst they have the Olympic records, why? Why is everybody trying to break records? I mean in the UFC we're constantly going over statistics. This guys, one more fights. This guys landed more significant blows. This guys landed more submissions. These, these, you're, you're competing.

Speaker 2:          01:05:54       This is why people like watching things like the UFC is because it's contrary to this participation shit that's going on. There's a participation trophy bullshit that's going on with little kids. And, and like I said, I go back to that same point, which is it, we're not fooling any of them in a sense, over a period of time, we create a bad precedent and a bad mentality. But at that moment that kids know what the hell this score is, they know what the hell is going on. And they, you know, and they know that it's, it's bullshit when you tell them they're wonderful every time that they're not, I mean, if I told my kid, you know, every time he finished a practice or a sports game, you know, hey, you did great. I mean, it would, it means fuck all. It means nothing to them at a certain point.

Speaker 2:          01:06:31       And then he loses when he loses respect, but he looses also motivation. He thinks, well, fine, if I'm great all the time, what the fuck? I don't, you know, better thing to tell them is you know this horrible feeling that you've got in your stomach right now. Use that as fuel. Fuel yourself with the fuck ups. Fuel yourself with the failures, but it doesn't mean we love you less like your, your parents and your friends are going to love you no matter what. You know, Randy coture said this to me once. We were talking about fighters and how he talks to fighters that he's training and he said the most important thing is you can't be afraid to lose. It's going to happen at one point in time. If you keep fighting, everybody loses. But you have to think to yourself what, what is important in life?

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       Your family loving you, you're friends loving you, they're still going to love you. They're still you. It's still going to be all, all those pieces are going to be in place. If you lose except that, and then go out there and do your best. And as long as you've done your best, you can keep your chin up and you can, you can understand that whatever failure that you've experienced there, whatever mistake, this is a, this is like a mathematical problem you've learned, well you can't throw a one, two and then drop your left hand. You get hit with a counter right now. You know, but if you don't get hit with that counter right, you'd never know. If you go through life just throwing a one, two and winning every time you think you've got the perfect game plan, then you, you, you teach that to someone else and that, that person realizes, well no, this game plan's no good. You got to keep your fucking hands up. If you don't keep your hands up, you get hit these, these, there's a certain reality is, it's one of the reasons why I keep going back to fighting, but it's one of the reasons why people like fighting cause it's so absolute, right. Absolutely. Going to decisions because decisions can be fucking bullshit. But other than decisions, when someone hits you, they hit you and they don't hit. You know, it's very clear. It's very decisive

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       for the most part. And you know, there, there is no fucking about, it's, it's, it is what it is as opposed to so much of the rest of the world or what you're trying to find examples of whatever words

Speaker 2:          01:08:25       gray and murky and I don't know if they same as a score of all goes in the net. It goes in the net. That's it. It goes in or it doesn't go in. And to raise kids to this, to have this foggy concept in their head that it doesn't matter. Well, no, it does matter. It fucking matters a lot. Right? Here's what does, here's what doesn't matter. Your parents are going to love you. Your friends going to love you if your parents don't love you because you didn't drop a ball in that. Your Dad's a piece of shit. And that's something we all need to laugh. Yeah. And there are there we all experienced folks. Yeah, we've all seen, I mean, I've, I've seen him on the side and one of my, my kid was going to soccer practice. I was watching his dad screaming his daughter and it was like, God damn it, dude. Don't do that. Go. So let's go hustle. Let's go hustle. And you're like all the fucking sports terminology. Let's get that one. We can get need to get that one back. We gotta get that one line.

Speaker 1:          01:09:19       If you're a parent and you're living your life through your kids, sporting exploits, go, go fucking do something else. Encourage them and give them what they need to succeed. But don't, don't value yourself through what your kids are doing and sports. And there's so many parents out there that did that. I, I coached for a while. Uh, my daughter, who's now in college, she played a lot of softball. And so I was coaching at one point, you know, before she got to the point where I had nothing to offer. And so they had to actually get coaches who knew what they were doing. But I remember at one point there was this one dad who was just like, he was just a complete douche and he was always a Douche and he'd just show up and he'd, and he'd berate his kid and his kid was fantastic.

Speaker 1:          01:09:56       She was a wonderful, and one time she actually walked up to me and she was as she was, you could tell she wanted to cry, but she didn't choose it. She was a great kid and she apologized for her dad's behavior in the dugout because the dad, she's like leaning over the fence and screaming. And how long was he at that time? She was 14 I guess. And it was just, and I said, look honey, it's not your deal. Your, it's not your fault. And then I had to go over and I said, look, you have fucking Douche. And I said that to him and he was eight and I thought he was going to try to take my head off, but he was a, he was a big boy, but he couldn't argue with me. I think he knew deep down he knew. Yeah, okay, the guys right. I am a Douche. And I said, you've got to leave. You can't come back. And for a kid to apologize for their parent's behavior, but yeah, you're right. You see it, you see it fairly often.

Speaker 2:          01:10:38       Parents get fucking heated up. There was a crazy story about a dad who killed a another dad in a hockey fight. Yes. You remember that? I remember that the kids were playing, the kids apparently had got into it on the ice and this fucking big giant guy beat a guy to death, beat the guy to death in front of his kid.

Speaker 1:          01:10:56       There was another guy, this guy, I think it was in Connecticut, softball also. It's girl's softball, you know, they get very competitive, but how the fuck do you get so wound up about, about any really, really anything. But so this guy, this dad went after, literally got upset because their kid wasn't getting enough playing time and so the coach turned and walked away. The picked up a bat and went after him and hit him in the head with a bat and put them in the hospital. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember that. Yeah. He hit the coach, right? Yeah, he did. Yeah. Yeah. Cause kid wasn't getting enough light. I mean, okay. Yeah. Have you ever, my daughter needs more plain

Speaker 2:          01:11:26       competition then that's, that's what people are afraid of with competition. That's why they're coming up with this idea of participation trophies. There's a lot of people that are moving away or trying to move away from this. They want a kinder, gentler world and they think that that's the way to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:11:42       I, that's why I'm, I'm happy to be out in Idaho. We don't, we don't necessarily go for the kinder, gentler world outside. It's too fucking cold. And Yeah, I can call you got coyotes and wolves and bears and shit that I got to eat you and uh, and yeah, so it, it's very much just sort of pull your boots up and just get on with it. It's a, it's a very good, uh, culture out there and it's a great place to raise, raise kids, you know? And, and I couldn't be happier because it's, the outdoor activities are just fantastic. The climbing and the rafting or incredible skiing is obviously great fishing and hunting is fantastic. I mean, I sound like the Chamber of Commerce, you know, you do, but it is a beautiful place. Yeah. I have a friend who has a house in Coeur d'alene and they send me pictures and you're just like, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       That's real. That's a real place. You can fly up to spokane and that's the easiest way to get to quote Atlanta. Yeah. You drive beds. It's about 40 minutes or so. That's it from spokane. But if you drive from, if you fly into boise and you drive up to core Delaney to take you about a century and a half, it takes a while cause it's got to big fucking state. Yeah. Yeah. But it's a, it's uh, again, it's, it's, it's interesting because that Wyoming and Montana, that whole part of the country or the, yeah, it's just still a little bit different. You know, the urban centers are all starting to kind of unify it and become a little bit similar. But I think when people,

Speaker 2:          01:12:55       we'll have to deal with nature when they're dealing with winter and storms and, and just the reality of being in nature. It humbles you. And it also hardens you a little bit to the realities of changing climates and the realities of just wild life and all the dangers and all the wonderful things that come from nature

Speaker 1:          01:13:18       and, and that's it. And the expansiveness of it. And it kind of humbles you a little bit and you can you drive up what got we, we're not, we're very fortunate. We're not that far from yellowstone. I mean not far being, you know, a handful of hours drive and you go off to a place and if people haven't, their listening haven't been to yellowstone, good guide. You know, do yourself a favor and go there. Don't go during a high tourist season. But if you want to see something that just is stunning, spend a few days up in yellowstone and it really does, it puts you back a little bit and it makes you realize a how, how amazing, you know, this, this planet is b, how incredible this country is. And it, and it also kind of puts your priorities a little bit more in shape. We try, we attract a bunch of grizzlies up there for a travel channel show.

Speaker 1:          01:13:58       And there were times when you just, you'd forget what you were doing. You just stand there and just stare out there at the, at the scenery and you just, you know, there was, and of course it was a travel channel show. I was supposed to be co hosting and, and yet I was just gobsmacked. I didn't have the, you know, which is not good for a cohost. Apparently you're supposed to be able to describe what you're seeing. And I would just say, man, this is fucking incredible. They say, okay, you can't say that and say that I allowed to travel journal and beep. But yeah, you would think so. I don't think they wanted, you didn't want that impression. Um, so, but yeah, getting, just getting out,

Speaker 2:          01:14:30       seeing, seeing that environment, seeing the wild bison and buffalo and wolves and all the, just the, the landscape

Speaker 1:          01:14:38       and you learn also where your food comes from. Right. And I think that's part of it too. And that, that tough, it's like my kids, you know, they know where their food comes from. They know, you know what it takes to go out hunting. They know what, what fishing's all about. They understand it. You develop a respect for it. You understand that the world's not equal, you know, I mean, all those precious uh, animals out, those bison are going to get a baby bison. I watched the baby buys and get dragged down and you think, you know, and I was with somebody who was on the, on the production team that was like, well we should enter, we should, you know, get in there and help that. What does it getting dragged down by getting dragged down by walls and it wasn't, you guys were there while this was how they've actually yellowstone's did a wonderful job of bringing back a number of things and there it says a fairly active wolf population up there.

Speaker 1:          01:15:22       The bears are looking great, the grizzlies and everything and says, but the point being is that, you know, if you grow up out there I think, or if you spend a lot of time out there, you want to stand that yet life isn't, isn't fair. Right. And if we just keep telling our kids that life is fair and everybody gets to be equal and it's not the way it works. And even in the human species, it's not the way it works. Like you said, somebody is always going to be harder, tougher, smarter, more intense. And that's a good thing.

Speaker 2:          01:15:49       Well it does. It is. Here's the thing though, it doesn't make you less of a person. It doesn't make you love the less, and I think people value there. There's a, there's a real problem when people think that winning is the only thing, cause this is not the only thing, but there's a, there's a giant spectrum of things that we value. We value comradery, we value friendship. We value intelligence in a sense of humor. And someone who's interesting and fascinating to talk to. Well, there's so many things that people value out of a human being that being the best at one thing that you compete in is not the only thing in life. And this is a real problem with athletes once they retire because all of their sense of self worth a lot of times is wrapped up in competition and they have been obsessed with greatness and then afterwards they feel this like hollow, sad life. It's a big issue with fighters. A gigantic issue with fighters [inaudible] fine.

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       Something that that takes that over right?

Speaker 2:          01:16:51       A lot of times they turned to drugs because the, the high of competing is so intense. Like so many classic situations were great fighters turned to drugs. Joe Lewis, um, Sonny Liston, I mean there's, you can go down the line, Aaron, prior, there's a lot of great fighters who turned to drugs later in their life

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       because they just didn't know what the fuck to do. Right, right. You're always looking for something that's going to fill that void, I think. And then one of my brothers is a flew f four is in Vietnam, uh, for a couple of tours. And, and he was one of those guys, he was like, that was it guy's name, Robert Duval's character and apocalypse now. Just one of those guys that, you know, he appreciated the moment. Right. And he appreciated the rush that he was getting smell flying home in the morning. Oh yeah. I mean, and so, you know, and by the point being is that, you know, he came back and it was like, you know, now, I mean, he's a great guy. He ended up being a senior pilot of the commercial airline and he's never had an issue. But at the same time, you can always tell that when you sit down and you know, over over some drinks, you know, there's always that that was, you know, that moment in time, you know, that was that event or that was that activity that I don't know what you ever fill that again.

Speaker 3:          01:18:03       You don't ever get to that point again where it's you're, you're experiencing that same sort of rush or that, that, that, uh, that challenge when you get addicted to hitting 11 when everybody else is hitting six on a good day, a crazy day. Today I got up to six, you know, imagine if your truck with Dell, you know, he's like, oh, what did you do today? You did a fucking mile. You ran a mile. You fuck. You know, it's like the, the idea of danger and reward of consequence. These are, these are all there so intense to someone who's been involved in like really heavy competition. I see with fighters all the time, this very reluctant decision that they have, they're very reluctant to step away from the game when they've been knocked out a bunch of times and they start to lose their chin and they start to experience some cognitive issues and it's so hard for them and they need someone to step in and grab them and go, listen to me, man, if you don't get out now, it's going to get real ugly in the next couple of years.

Speaker 3:          01:19:05       And you could, you could reach a point where you're never going to bounce back. You get a few more knockouts, three, four more knockouts and you might be fucked for the rest of your life. And we see it now with a lot of NFL players. We, we've definitely seen it with a lot of fighters. I mean, Jesus, look at the greatest of all time, the greatest boxer of all time is a physical wreck. Mohammed Ali is in the worst shape of like literally any public figure that has ever been so graceful and beautiful and as Moose Mints and the weight talked and so charismatic and now you look at him and he cannot talk at all. He cannot walk. That is a direct consequence of boxing. Like you said, look at the NFL and look at what they're finding now. And that's, you know, that that's filtered down to the youth. You know, you don't have a full contact football at an early age. That's a good move. It's a good move. Yeah. A lot of parents are just refusing to have their kid play, play football. Well, I have friends that you know, they, they'll, they would let their kids fight, they'll let their kids fight, but they won't let the kids get involved in, in football because they're like, look, if you fight and you get

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       really good, it's you and one guy and you might get hit and you're probably going to get hit. But if you do your diligence and you work on your technique and you understand footwork and you understand the rules of engagement and you understand like correct strategy as far as movement and do all your work in the gym and understand how to defense number one, that's the number one most important thing. If you do that, you're going to mitigate a lot of that issue. You're going to the, there's a lot of fighters that walk away from the game and they're okay. It is possible to do look at Floyd Mayweather. Yeah. Fucking guys 49 and, oh and he's fine. You might not like them but Shitty, right? He doesn't get hit. He doesn't get hit. I mean the difference between him and a guy who decides to bite down on his mouthpiece and just slug it out and to see whose last man standing. There's a giant difference in his strategy and the consequences of his strategy versus a guy who just likes to put on a show for the fans. Well that guy is going to be in a fucking wheelchair when he's older. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:04       But I just, the other day I had to deal with the was sluggo the middle boy who said, you know you want him cause he's been a Johnson to play football. And so then he found out that the only league available was flag football and he looked at me, he's not that he's what? He's almost seven. And he says, well what's the point that was, that was his comments. What's the point? I said, well honey, I don't know what the point is. Yeah, you raised an interesting question. I said, so let's, let's just focus on on other sports, get them involved in Jujitsu. That's what I always tell someone who's gonna, who's got it

Speaker 2:          01:21:32       kid and they want to get their kid in martial arts. I got involved in martial arts at an early age, but I got involved in striking, but it was because there was no Jujitsu when I was a kid. But if I, if I had a child that was interested in competing, I would get them involved in Jujitsu because you might get your arm broken, but guess what? The fucking put you in a cast. He'll heal up. You learn to tap.

Speaker 1:          01:21:52       Next time you know you'll, you'll, you'll get John Broken falling out of a tree. When did you start? How old were you when you started?

Speaker 2:          01:21:58       I got sick. Well, I started my first, I took karate when I was 14 but I really got serious when I was 15 I took it a little Kung Fu when I was younger than that, but I didn't get serious until I was a soft my right before, like from the summer of my right before when freshmen to sophomore, so forth. There's something team during that time. Was there some reason why you got interested or why? I've been interested because I was small and I didn't want to get picked on. There was definitely that. But the big thing was, it was just straight luck. I was a baseball fan and went to a red sox game at Fenway Park. I was walking home and I was, so I was walking home, me and a buddy of mine, we're going to the, you know the, the t, the public transport, there's a dry line cause it was the baseball game we could let out.

Speaker 2:          01:22:42       So we were walked by this taekwondo school and I walked upstairs and it was as long staircase up to the Jay Hahn Kim Taekwondo Institute. And as I was walking up, just by luck, there's a guy named John Lee who was the national taekwondo champion, national light heavyweight champion. And he was training for the World Cup and he was in just peak for the World Cup. And I, as I got up to the top of stairs, this, I heard this sound, this lump, and then there's like chink, like these chains, like chains, like shake womp, Chink. And I was like, what the fuck is that sound? And as I got to the top of the stairs, there was this era you had to take off your shoes and you had to walk in. You could watch these guys train. And John Lee was kicking the bag and he was doing this spinning back kick on the bag and bending this 100 pound bag in half and sending it flying. And I remember thinking, I got to learn to do that. I couldn't believe anybody could hit anybody that hard. I'd never seen anything like that in my life.

Speaker 1:          01:23:45       Did jump, did the guy that you were with the buddy that you were with, did he go up there too? And he quit? He started for a little,

Speaker 2:          01:23:50       but he, he was a buddy of mine, still a buddy of mine actually. We're still friends. Um, W we watched it together and uh, I became obsessed. I joined right away. Interesting. I joined right away that that guy, because that Guy John lead became like a, a big influence on me. He taught me a lot. He was living in Boston. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And uh, he wound up having, um, a lot of drug problems himself. Um, it was crazy to watch as well, but that guy taught me, he took me under his wing. It was crazy. You know, just a total random turn of events. Me Walking up those stairs at the exact right time that that guy was there. I mean, who knows, I could have walked up the stairs. It could have been a children's class.

Speaker 1:          01:24:31       Right, exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          01:24:36       The up there and the baddest motherfucker in the country was killing this bag test. It was just perfect timing.

Speaker 1:          01:24:42       Yeah. And it life's a lot like that. I mean, you know, there's this shift that happens and you think, wow, that's, you know, whether it's happenstance, coincidence, or it's supposed to be that way, who knows? But, uh, yeah, I don't know why

Speaker 2:          01:24:56       you could add all this meaning to it and you might be right. Or you might, might just be guessing. But to me it was a, a gigantic moment and decision in my life to go up those stairs and to see that guy doing that changed my whole life because that became my life. And from 15 to 21 that's what I did every day in my life. I mean, I trained every day

Speaker 1:          01:25:17       and that's what you got to find. You're gonna find whatever's going to spark it. You see parents do that all the time with their kids. So, you know, I want him a kid to be a baseball player and they just push and push and push. Instead of saying, look, I want, I want to expose these kids to various things and see if they spark the find themselves, find the thing. And because it's got to be part of, it's got to be internal. You can't, I mean, you can for a period of time and then, then you know, that's it. It's not, it's only gonna go so far. But if you could find that thing like you did, but that sparks something and the kid realizes, you know, I could become really good at this and we're in. I enjoy it and it sets me apart. It makes me different. It makes me special. And God bless, you know, if you can, if you can do that with your kids, you're halfway home.

Speaker 2:          01:25:56       I didn't even know if I could be good at it because I didn't have any talent. I mean it wasn't like I walked up there and all of a sudden I was the right, you know, I walked up there, I was like, Holy Shit. I was surrounded by black belts who were kicking people's heads off and I was like, this is insane. It was just, to me it was, it was so terrifying, but it was also in a good way. It was very much like a cult because it was in a good way. Like they didn't take advantage of you, but you had to bow. You had to say yes sir. There was some intense discipline and you got to see some intense consequences to fucking up. Cause I got to see a lot of guys get knocked out. You know, I, I saw a lot of guys get knocked out and tournaments and start guys getting knocked out in practice and there was also the belt system.

Speaker 2:          01:26:42       The belt system, I think in martial arts is very important for kids because like you started out as a white belt and you get that blue belt like you tie, like here's a perfect example, Anthony Bourdain's 58 fucking years old. He just got his blue belt and he told me it was the happiest he's ever been in his life. More, more important than anything other than the birth of his child. It was like, to him it was like, I fucking did it. And here's a guy who like used to be a heroin addict, smoked cigarettes, just drinking all the time, was at a terrible lifestyle. His wife who's obsessed with Jujitsu got him to take a Jujitsu class and then all of a sudden for whatever reason that switch goes, I look at them, they're very, he is getting his blue belt. And for people who don't understand that is a very difficult to accomplishment. To get your Booba is not easy to do. It's very hard to do. And that if you can get your blue belt and he's like, I'll never get my black belt. I'm like, bullshit. Listen to me, man. If you can get your fucking blue belt, you can get your black belt. It just keep going. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:27:40       But it said, it said, like you said for kids, it's that success, which runs counter to sort of the concept of team sports right now anyway. Right. Kids. So you give them that opportunity. And uh, I've got again, the middle boy who's, who's, uh, you know, six and right now he's, he's that kid who likes to know what, what the, uh, what the parameters are and likes to know that there's a system in place. Right. So he's the kid have all been, he's very aggressive too, is, he's very physical kid. So that's, we've been looking at what's out there and where we live to see where would be a good spot for him. But, but he's definitely the kid of the three that he looks at that and he goes, I get it. I can go from here to here to here to here, and that's a good thing.

Speaker 2:          01:28:20       Well, if you want to get them in more involved in martial arts, we'll talk afterwards and I'll find out what, what's near you. That would be good. That would find out what's good. But I can't recommend that enough for kids, for young boys, especially because it takes away this fear of engaging with other kids. It takes her with his fear of getting your ass kicked, a fear of the unknown. If you don't know how to fight, you wind up getting involved in fights accidentally because your posture, you stick your fucking chest up and you don't know the consequences are so alien to you that you, you wind up talking too loud or trying to bluff someone and you can fuck up and run into the wrong dude.

Speaker 1:          01:28:59       It in a way, it's like a, it's like a concealed carry permits. If you don't know what the hell you're doing and if you don't have the discipline and if you're not constantly training. Yeah, there's, there's a serious potential for fuck up.

Speaker 2:          01:29:11       What's a serious potential for fuckup and that's my own issue. My personal issue with all these fucking states that are, that are there open carry states. Yeah. Well you don't even have to have any training. Like I think it's kind of crazy. I think first of all, I'm a big sport is second amendment. I have guns so let me get that out of the way. But I think you should learn how to fucking use a gun before you should get one. Yeah. How can you, how come I can get a car? I have to go through all this shit. I have to learn how to drive. I have to fill out forms. I have to learn the rules. I can just go get a gun. Yeah. All you do is just not be a criminal and you can get a gun. That seems crazy to me.

Speaker 1:          01:29:46       The training aspect of it. Is it anybody who's serious about, about weapons? Anybody who's, who's dealt with them, anybody who's had to carry them for, for a livelihood, you gained a real appreciation for how quickly things had south and, and, and, and, and, and the idea that I agree with you on a percent. Uh, and I'm a huge supporter of the second amendment. Um, and, uh, I got, uh, you know, they go walk in safe and happy to have it, but at the same time, if I just can't get behind the idea of people going out and, and not training, not practicing. And that's a large, not a large, but I, and I, you know what I'm about to speculate, so I probably shouldn't, but there's a, there's a decent percentage of people who go out and they buy it and then they put it in a lockbox.

Speaker 1:          01:30:29       Hopefully they put it in a lockbox and then that's it, you know, and then they, you know, maybe sometime they're gonna need it and they don't know what the fuck they're doing. So it's the, it's the training and you just have to be constant repetition, constant repetition. Cause if you do need to use it, everything else shuts down. And you know, haul your little, you know, controls go away and you're, you're depending on your big muscle mass and, and, and repetition and muscle memory. And if you haven't been practicing, you're fucked. You might, you might as well turn it on yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:30:57       And that's the same thing with fighting. It's the same thing with everything. When you're, when you're nervous, all the training comes out and that's what you're going to fall back on your training. If you train incorrectly, you're going to perform incorrectly under pressure. And that's the same with firearms is same with everything. Yeah. If you don't prepare the, but see we have this country where everybody's like, you tried to take well goons, which will do well. No one's trying to take away your guns, but I think it should. The idea of firearms owning a firearm being a right, I think it should be a privilege. And I think much like driving a car is a privilege. I don't think you should keep anyone from doing it just arbitrarily, but I think you should prove that. You know what the fuck you're doing before you put other people in danger. That's what we have with cars by the way. It's speedboats too. Yeah. We got not a lake. He gets up

Speaker 1:          01:31:47       gasol who's never gotten behind the wheel of a boat before and all of a sudden he's doing 30 down the lake and you think, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          01:31:52       Some rich dick head of buys a fucking one of those cigarette. Yeah, exactly. You ever seen those videos of those cigarette butts that go a hundred miles an hour? People flip 'em up in the air and everybody dies.

Speaker 1:          01:32:01       Yeah, I like it. Like A, like a fountain boat. You know, those things are insane and yeah, you'll get some, you know, get somebody or buy one and then they'll show up on the lake. Next thing you know, you know your kids out water skiing and you're, you're, you know, fearing for their life because, yeah. But so point taken, I think, you know, uh, I don't know how you would tie in the, uh, the purchase with the training with the, uh, showing approving, the ability. Uh, I don't know how you'd do that, but it's extremely difficult. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:32:32       Psychological evaluation as the bad idea either. I don't think it's a bad idea to ask people a bunch of questions, you know what I mean? Just try to get someone who's a qualified individual to, uh, talk to this person. I mean, you're not going to, you're going to have some fucking psychopathic going to be able to trick you, but that's just, you're going to weed out some folks that could be a problem and people have a problem with that. Well, you're trying to take where it guns. One of these liberals get involved in this process and they say, no one's qualified. That's what they want. Don't you understand? Don't you worry

Speaker 1:          01:33:03       burry slope. It's a slippery slope. Do one thing and it's all gonna fall to hell. Yeah. No, I, it, that's a hipaa issue. How do you, as Addie is, share medical information? How of you share is share information from a [inaudible] office and, um, I, you know, it's, again,

Speaker 2:          01:33:20       never had medical attention. Yeah. It's definitely like a nuts out there that haven't had anybody look at them.

Speaker 1:          01:33:25       Right? No, I haven't. You know, one of the other things, I've never woken up in the morning and thought to myself, good God, I gotta get myself another 45 or I've got to get myself in another ar 15. I gotta have it now. I, I have no problems with waiting and I've got teams in my company that do nothing but, but due diligence on people, right? And No, it's not, not for purposes of, of a weapons permit, but um, I know how difficult that process is even for relatively straightforward due diligence. And so the idea that I have no problems with expanded background checks and I noticed that a lot of people, you know, right now a screaming and saying, oh my God, the drug, and again, I'm a huge supporter of the, of the Second Amendment, NRA member, all the rest of that shit. And I, and I and I, God bless it.

Speaker 1:          01:34:07       But at the same time, we have to be able to, uh, find those, those, those ideas, those answers or at least talk about them without immediately started to pull the pins on the grenades and thrown in each other. And that's, you know, going back to the earlier conversation about politics and the yachts and so, you know, it probably no other, well there's other emotive issues, but certainly with the second amendment, you know, the idea that you're going to spend a little bit more time on a background check, you know, if you got to rush into the store and buy your, your, your, your handgun and get out of there as quick as possible. What's up? I mean, just take, yeah, you can take a little time. Um, so otherwise to kill yourself. Yeah. So I dunno. It's um, but again, nobody, nobody exists in the center anymore. Nobody exists in the middle. So.

Speaker 2:          01:34:49       Exactly. Even if guy who supports a second amendment saying something like that could be problematic and you're going to get criticized.

Speaker 1:          01:34:55       Oh my God, if I run for governor out in Idaho, I'm sure someone's

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       going to pull that one up. Did you see what he said? And you're thinking, how is that a problem? Yeah. I just don't understand how anybody could be against background checks. Right. It doesn't make any sense to me. How could someone be against training? How could somebody be against firearm education? How could somebody be against that? Yeah. Well when you, when you get a hunting license, you have to go through a hunter's safety course. And the hunter safety course is pretty extensive. It takes a long time. There's a lot of questions you have to answer. You have to know why the fuck is that the case with hunting, but it's not the case with a gun. Yeah. What about self defense? So it shouldn't, you have to have all these junior have to have an understanding of how to use a safety. Shouldn't yet have the variations in training for uh, or classroom work for concealed carry permits.

Speaker 3:          01:35:46       You know, you got, you got great training programs and then you got less than, less than great. Significantly less than. Great. And you're talking about carrying a weapon out in public. And that is an enormous responsibility. And, and I think it's important, you know, and, and I think it's, it's just, it falls in line with what we're talking about. How do you have, but how do you get to that point if as soon as you raise that issue again, people start throwing hand grenades agile and you'd think, well, wait a minute, I'm just, I'm raising this as a possibility. Maybe there's something, some other tact here that we can take and not, you know, not just the second amendment, every, every fucking thing out there, right. Uh, Obamacare, I'll let you know. I, you know, it's, it's either all this or all that. Instead of saying it the early outset, we, you know, what would have been wrong with saying, hey, you know, let, let's, let's do preexisting conditions.

Speaker 3:          01:36:33       Let's keep kids on their health plans for their parents a little bit longer. And then let's try to figure out where else we can make improvements. But it's all one thing or the other. I think one of the things about owning a gun, and this is, it's very important to anybody that has a gun. You should want to be educated in proper firearm safety. If you have a gun, you should want this. So training shouldn't be something that you would fight. It should be something that everybody would embrace. If you have a gun, you understand the dangers and the consequences of having a gun. You also understand that you need someone to show you how to do it right. If you don't have anybody who puts it in your head, you know, always have your finger off the trigger. This is the safety. No it no it when it's pushed back, you know, you're, you're here.

Speaker 3:          01:37:20       When it's pushed forward, you're ready to rock. Like no, these things understand these things. Well I think it's, it's, um, yeah, if you live out west and not, again, not dead, dead. I mean cause down south you could argue to say anything, mountain culture and everything else, but there's a certain appreciation for both the use of weapons and the responsibility involved because there are so many people out there that a hunt and there are so many. I mean, I the, you know, I, I would suspect that, uh, I mean everybody I know that that owns a weapon, uh, goes to the range they, uh, or they're out practicing their target hunting

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       and you know, before hunting season, Shari shows up there. They're working the problem. Uh, I don't know that that's true in, in a major urban centers. I don't know. I mean, I have no idea, but, um,

Speaker 2:          01:38:07       there's a few people, I mean, there's ranges that you can go to where, you know, I mean, you can take firearms lessons. The thing is that it's not mandatory. And then there's also the variants, the different rules that you have in different states. Like Arizona is an open carry state. Right? Right. So you just go to the store, you're not a felon, you get a gun, just walk around with a gun. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:38:28       You have it. Got It. Yep. Okay. You don't have to know shit. And it causes problems. I mean, depending on who you're talking to in law enforcement, it's, you know, there's, there's a lot of folks in law enforcement, they look at it and go, yeah, I mean, it's not, it's not what they would prefer. It's not up to them to, to make that call. But at the same time, I, you know, I look at it and then I think if, if there's one issue that probably summarizes, um, the, the, the, the sort of, the emotive nature of, of politics nowadays, it's probably, it's probably this one. I mean, I think that's a big, we've gotten past the whole gay marriage thing and you know, the abortion thing always flares up and always will probably, but, but the, the second amendment, you know, and so you do think, okay, well how do we can set the default position for the administration is always, you know, um, it's always, you know, blowing it up.

Speaker 1:          01:39:19       Right? And so, you know, they misplayed as well. I think if there was more compromised, more discussion in the center where they had this quietly outside of the, you know, the, the, the realm of media, but they just seem to be unable to do it. So every time there's an incident, the first thing you see is somebody from the administration up behind the podium, you know, making statements and talking about gun control. And that fuels the other side that fuels the right where the side with thinks they're just trying to take away all our weapons. And because they see this and there's nothing reason to going on

Speaker 2:          01:39:50       right here. There's no reasonable consideration of the pros and cons of this issue. And no one's, there's no one's stepping in the middle, right?

Speaker 1:          01:40:01       It's like the FBI and apple dispute. That's what it's like. It's not the same thing. You got it all on one side. You've got all on the other. And the reality is, you know what, we could have found a solution here somewhere if, uh, you know, if, if, if we'd been at, and I, although who knows, I don't know. Apple seems to be inclined to draw a line under this particular,

Speaker 2:          01:40:23       she was there trying to get into that guy's phone. The killer who killed those people in San Bernardino. They want to get into his phone and uh, they, FBI wants apple to engineer some sort of a back door.

Speaker 1:          01:40:34       Well, here's, here's what it is. So this guy, uh, side for had, he had, uh, three phones, at least that we know about two of them, he destroyed, he completely destroyed him. And, and the, the bureau has been looking, they take nothing recoverable off those systems and they've asked a lot of people for assistance. So they had the other phone, which was in his truck, which is his work phone. It was belonged to the county. And so they went to the county bureau, did they went to the county, uh, when they pulled this phone out of the truck and they said, we need to get the information off of this thing because you know what, a phone, a phone nowadays everybody keeps everything on their phone. Right. And so they, uh, they got the support they pulled and they found out that he had shut off the function that a uploads data to the cloud, uh, in October.

Speaker 1:          01:41:18       And so they were able to get everything up to October, but then that's two full months prior to the attack. So they said, okay, well we can't get this. And the, and the, the, the phone has, you know, this default position where if you try the password 10 times and it erases everything. So they took the phone, the bureau took the f, the phone to apple and this was well before they had to go get a court order. Well before it became public knowledge. They actually went and had numerous quiet conversations with apple and they went to apple and they said, literally said, you can take the phone, keep it on your campus, keeping in your facility, put it in a, we don't, you know, wherever put it in your lap. All we're asking is for you to create a systems information file that you can force on that phone, that one phone and pull the tech, which then allows you to brute force the password and get the texts off of there, get the data off of there and exists and then you can destroy the sif, the systems information file.

Speaker 1:          01:42:11       You can keep the phone. We don't even need to touch it. We can, you know, whatever you just give us the shit that's on the phone. An apple has has been helpful in the past. They've been, they've been helpful in the past and this time for some, for whatever motivation they've decided to draw a line in the sand and say, no, we're not going to do this. And it's not as if they haven't been helpful. And there's an ongoing dialogue. And so it's, it's disingenuous to say that apple is now, you know, uh, the bulwark for privacy because they have been helpful in the past and they will continue to be helpful, I suppose in their own way. But for this particular phone, for this one time where they could have held onto the phone, created that Sif destroyed the sif at, at that moment that they've pulled the texts off.

Speaker 1:          01:42:57       So that's it. That's done. So now what Tim Cook is saying is not that it's creating a back door. He's not saying that he's saying it creates a precedent, but the precedent was already that if the bureau goes through the, the, the process the congress has set and then goes through that process and gets a court order and the court, then it looks at it and says, yes, you've got probable cause you've got reasonable concern here. Uh, they provide a court order, then they go and they make this request for assistance. You're also talking about a dead guy talking about a guy who shot 14 people, 14 people killed, 14 people. Um, I've heard all sorts of things. I've heard people say to me and I, and again, I understand, don't get me wrong, because I understand fully the importance of finding the right place on the pendulum for Security and privacy.

Speaker 1:          01:43:45       I get that. I get that. And that's an important discussion. I'm not saying it's not, it's, you should always have that conversation, but part of that is then during the course of that conversation, Congress and the courts, they make those decisions. Where does that pendulum, you know, settle between security and privacy and that settles here. Okay, fine. Then that's what the bureau or whomever has to go through to get approval to get some assistance and that's where it stands. But you know to say that because now you've got all, all three branches of government have said, yeah, we think that really we could use this information off of this phone. But I've heard everybody say, well, why don't they just do the rest of the investigation? Well, of course they fucking done the rest of the investigation. They done all the other investigative steps. So what are you saying in a situation like this?

Speaker 1:          01:44:29       Uh, you just want them to do 80% of the investigation. And if you've got, you know, that you've got material on here who, which may lead to operational activity, uh, in, in finding other people who were involved or finding people overseas who were in somehow assisting or whatever it may be. If you're saying, well, just now, you know what, for the sake of this, we're not asking for a back door. They're asking for that, that, that, that one phone. And that's where this whole thing is, is really headed south and it's become this idea that, you know, which is erroneous. But I understand what Tim Cook is saying about the precedent, although not really, because again, they've done this before. For some reason for this one, they're drawing a line. So anyway, I, but I've heard that, why don't they just do the rest of the investigation and skip this part?

Speaker 1:          01:45:12       What I don't, I don't, I don't follow that logic train. And then the other people, other people were saying, well, why don't they just get it off the metadata? And that's another one of those things where people never believed what the government was saying. But the metro fucking data was numbers and volume. That was it. There was no information to be had there. You could sit in a fucking room full of metadata and not know what the hell you're looking at. You had to go through the court process to then get that particular numbers information.

Speaker 3:          01:45:36       So here's my question, because this is what came up with the Edward Snowden thing. They were saying that the government is monitoring all cell phone data constantly and they can get information all the time. Well, this kind of proves that not to be true. Yeah. But people don't look at it that way. They don't, they don't. They don't make that leap back and say, oh, well maybe that was a fallacy. Yeah, sure. The metadata was sweeping up all that, that those numbers and volume. But again, it's not enough to what end. Yeah. And so some people would say, once they realized what it was actually doing, then they say, wow, but that's so what? So they're just collecting the shit in the basement. It's not doing any good. So they shouldn't even collect that information. So what Edward Snowden was talking about is essentially just when it pertains to email, I mean, he said they're collecting all this information that the NSA is collecting all this information in regards to cell phone data and the recording. Every phone call, the recording, all these text messages. Yeah. Um, so is that not true? Well, no, I frankly, I'm here. Of course nobody's going to, again, this is a very emotive, right? So there's all these people out there, they're going to say, fuck you. You don't know what the fuck are you talking about?

Speaker 1:          01:46:40       Yeah, no aluminum. There is nobody right now unless you're a terrorist, a terrorist suspect or a criminal. This, nobody in the government hooks up. Fuck you. I'm here to tell

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       you your Dick pics or safe ladies and Gentlemen, Dick Pics are absolutely Jina pictures that had been floating around all your boyfriend. Okay. Goes a secure, nobody's going to route those around that you would rat you out for those as a piece of shit and unamerican in the first place. Yeah. So that's a, that's a really eyeopening thing though, because this case kind of throws that all into jeopardy cause everybody was like concerned. Like, Hey, the government can check in on all your phone calls and all your text messages. Well this would clearly be a case where they would want to do that. So they don't, they can't do it here without the, did the judge granting this order and what, so tell me why did, there was a recent court order right there ruled in favor of apple.

Speaker 1:          01:47:30       They did. And that was in New York. And that was an interesting case as well. And that's probably going to set a precedent for maybe, maybe we'll see cause it's a little bit different what the judge essentially was saying in that case and it involved, uh, uh, uh, narco trafficking investigation that was going on. And by the way, this isn't just for terrorism. Imagine what if this was for pedophilia? I mean, I imagine a large Pete Ophelia ring, what are you going to say? No, we don't want to catch those fucking Douche bags that are involved in that because privacy, you know, I understand the privacy aspect, but each case has to be looked at on its merits and if, and if you say through the courts and through the, through the congress that these are the hoops that the bureau has to jump through and they jumped through those hoops, then then what?

Speaker 1:          01:48:13       Then it's up to each company to decide whether they want to support it or not. I don't know that, that seems strange. But anyway, the point being is that the one in New York, the judge essentially was saying, well look, you want us, you want the courts to make a decision on this for something that Congress should really make a decision on this. And so in a way, his decision was a pushback against the concept of that, that the, uh, the bureau was basing this on, which is a very old law. And so the judge is saying, look, you relying on a law that's a couple of hundred years old or whatever. Um, maybe instead we should be having this looked at it through the legislature. And so there was a, there was an interesting sort of legality to his, his response to this, but it definitely a favorite apple and, and, and and sure.

Speaker 1:          01:48:53       That's great. Let's legislate it. But do you think that just maybe, um, there are times when from an operational perspective, you might want to move a little bit quicker than asking Congress to take up, uh, an issue and debate it and then maybe eventually come up. So maybe occasionally you're going to have moments like this, the San Bernardino shooting where you've got a phone in your hand and all you're asking apple to do is take possession of it. And who knows? Maybe their problem is they're worried that if they create the sif at that moment, someone's going to steal it from them, one of their employees. So maybe they've got an internal security issue because then they can destroy it. The bureau's not asking for that phone back then, not asking for that Sif. They're not asking them for to do it on any other, what is a sif, but he says systems, information flour. So you just force it onto that phone. And that bypasses the,

Speaker 2:          01:49:41       essentially what the court has done is made a very conservative, conservative interpretation of

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       the law. Right. And basically saying that this needs to blame. This is a place where the courts should be deciding, we believe you should be taking this to Congress. And so therefore I don't see why you're legislating or asking us to make a decision on this. See, I understand the common person's perspective. They don't trust the government, the whole Edward Snowden thing. And the next thing. Everybody's freaking out about that. And then they look at this saying, well, this is the slippery slope. Again, this is the thing that if the government has access to your phone play, we're talking about a fucking mass murderer and a guy who's already dead and we have one phone. Yeah, yeah. It's, and, and, and so to say that you're going to only do a limited investigation, even though you know you've got potential information and a way to do it, like on an individual basis, just one phone only.

Speaker 3:          01:50:34       That's what the cover, that's what they're asking. But can it be that you could never grant ag? I mean it's, it's, it doesn't make any sense to me. Well, it wouldn't want to get access to that guy's fucking data. And here's where, and I think going back to that overriding theme, which is nothing resides in the center anymore. Uh, you're right. We do have to be concerned about privacy. And I agree. Okay, what happens if you don't? Big Brother. But there are times when, you know, operational concerns probably override at least an element of this where you have common pr or a reason to, people can exist in the comment in the middle and say, yeah, on this occasion, because you've gone through all these, these orders and because we've set up this protection now, meaning, you know, apple holds onto it and it, but you know, that's not the way it works.

Speaker 3:          01:51:17       And so therefore apple comes out and says there and then the misinformation, oh, they trying to create a backdoor to all our apple devices. By the way, what do you think apple does with their devices that they sell in China? You think that Chinese government would allow apple if someone got a talk about this in the media, do you think the Chinese government would allow apple to sell devices that they can't get into? I, uh, we could ask apple, well, Ascap, I'm sure it would be an issue, but I can speak from a friend that I have that worked at Google. They had a gigantic issue in China with Google because, you know, they have android phones. And that was, that was a big part of the issue is the government wanted to have access to phones. They also want to have access to what you're searching.

Speaker 3:          01:51:56       They wanted to know what people are searching. They wanted to limit google searches. There's this gigantic issue they were having. Then on top of that, Google, uh, was having to deal with the fact that China was kind of ripping off their system and creating their own version of it. And is China, is these tactics state sponsor of uh, economic espionage and cyber crime and shit and counter fay openly support counterfeit shit to the point where there's entire stores that have apple logos, they sell apple products and none of it is legit. All the computers are fake. All the phones are fake. All the laptops are fake. None of it is created by Apple. It looks exactly like this shit right here. And it's just all man, they don't have laws to stop that. Now. There's not a rule of law there. Even though they'd been to, they were talking about this for a while. They've been saying, oh, you know, it's a new, and

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       this is again, this is why you're going back to that. You know, everything goes back in circles. But the idea that we need a leader right now that's, that's reasoned and pragmatic and smart and you know, clear eyed is, is a look at. You look at China and you look at a look at their economy and their is is heading south and if using ping their, yeah, their economy's not doing well, their growth projections are way off. There's always been this belief that their numbers have been cooked in numerous ways. A G that the head of China has been consolidating power. He's been creating new security apparatus. He's been hiding behind this anticorruption drive to some degree, which is again, part of is consolidation of power. Um, and this idea that Oh, somehow this rule of law is coming up. Nobody actually believes that. And they are continuing to be incredibly aggressive in economic espionage.

Speaker 1:          01:53:38       I mean they're not the only ones that have these, everybody acts in their own best interest. But the, the Chinese have, I dunno, four dozen plus academic institutions that have funded by the Chinese military, the PLA and have a responsibility for uh, economic espionage, developing new, new new means of basically stealing shit. They've got a couple dozen, at least information warfare units that we've identified run by the PLA that are specifically designed to hoover up intellectual property and research and development and all the rest of that, not just from us, I mean from around the globe. And you know, we, um, so the idea, yes, the idea that that we would do business there, uh, and, and believe somehow that the, uh, the authorities there in China aren't going to have our shit. They're not going to have whatever it may be. A pharmaceutical company that sets up a facility out there isn't going to lose their R. And. D of course they are. Everybody knows anybody in a serious manner who is doing business out in China. Knows as soon as you set foot in there and you establish yourself, you know, manufacturing or just a sales, whatever it may be, your information becomes their information. It just going to work that way. So,

Speaker 2:          01:54:45       well, that's a problem too because our shit is made over there.

Speaker 1:          01:54:48       A lot of Shit's made over there, including stuff from, from Donald Trump. Um, but who knows, maybe he's going to bring it back to the states.

Speaker 2:          01:54:55       Well, I have a friend who works for the bureau and he was explaining to me how Chinese espionage works in the United States and how they catch people that a guy will come over here and live a completely normal life and won't look like there's anything going on with him whatsoever. Family Guy, no weapons, no crime, no nothing. Be Friends, someone who works in some sort of an intellectual capacity, whether it's for some sort of a corporation that makes computers or something that works for the United States government that the wwe and rocketry or whatever, they'd be friend that guy and then slowly make their way in to the point where they say, listen, I know people that can pay you a lot of money for some of the information that you have. And by the way, this information is out there anyway.

Speaker 1:          01:55:42       It wasn't information and it can be much less.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       It oftentimes as much less threatening than that. It's just like, you know, I, you know, I need, you know, maybe I could, I could have you consult with me on a paper that I'm writing for a very legitimate organization. I mean, how do these, a lot of these folks come over here and they start going to school and then they get a grad degree and then they get a job and then what do they want? Well, the Chinese would always want them to get another job and then they get in. Eventually they end up at Northrop Grumman or they end up at Lockheed or they end up, but you know, so it doesn't matter. Dupont, Dow, wherever it is, information is of interest to them. The Chinese are a little bit different than, than we are. We, we tend to be very targeted, very specific in our tasking and part because we're a smaller operation than they are.

Speaker 2:          01:56:19       They devote a huge amount of resource to this, but they just hoover up whatever's out there. And then they make a decision as an interesting or valuable to them or not. And you know, again, people will say, well, you know, you can't be coy about this. We do that too. Well, you better hope we fucking do it because it's otherwise, it's a, uh, it's a hugely unlevel playing field. It, we're sweet angels out in the field of murders, criminals, right? And we'd, all we're doing is, you know, yeah, we're all snow precious snowflakes. I'll just try to get together and not a not keep score. This is where Hillary's email problem becomes a real issue, right? Because she, by doing this and this sort of in a roundabout way, we're bringing it all back, puts it in perspective why it's so dangerous that she had this unprotected email because by copy and pasting classified information or deciding through her own decision making process with the people that were with her, what's, what's okay to copy and paste and what's not okay to copy and paste and not whether or not you go by the established protocols of top secret or not top secret clearance or whatever clearance level you have.

Speaker 1:          01:57:22       You're handing that over. And, and, and the, the interesting thing is they don't necessarily care. I mean, obviously they, you know, they, it blows her skirt up to get top secret, you know, information, but they'll take anything, they'll take it all, they'll take a, you know, the daily, you know, dribble that goes on through her email and, and just to gain a better understanding as to what makes a person tick or who are the people around her. They're looking for potential targets. And that's, that's part of it. You're looking for, you know, where is there a chink in the armor where there's an opportunity to, uh, to get in to her organization? Is there somebody on the periphery could be a landscaper. Hey, I, now I know who landscapes, they're great. You know, it's like, it's like you're targeting a company. Well, who are you going to target?

Speaker 1:          01:57:59       You're not going to target the CEO. You're going to target the cleaning service. We're going to target the secretary and the caterer. You know, you're, and so, yeah, I, and again, I, you know, I get it everybody, you know, it's like with Ben Gazi, people roll their eyes all the private email server era. But if you've been involved in this and you understand how aggressive it is out there, you know, and not, again, not just the Chinese or Russians that, you know, everybody's, everybody's added. Um, that, you know, we, we, we need to understand that it was, it's, it was, uh, it was a serious problem. It was a breach. And, and, and again, going back to the same thing, if it had been me, yeah, sure I would have been done up and all, if it had been somebody else, they would be backed up and probably done time.

Speaker 1:          01:58:37       So it's a little, it's a little discouraging. That's kind of that it is something that someone would go to jail for and yet mishandling classified information. Yeah. I mean, you can't series of facts. It's a very serious offense and it, and in particular, when you're, when you're a senior official, yeah, good God. You know, she's a very smart person and she shouldn't, you know, so this idea that somehow she just didn't know or, you know, she was, you know, I was too busy or I don't know how by blackberry works or whatever. What a load of crap. Anyway. Yeah. Well this whole, this brings us back to this whole Edward Snowden thing. What, what is, what's your position on this and that guy and what he did and sort of exposing the fact that the NSA was involved in this wide scale, this gigantic sort of information gathering process, the hoovering up of, of a metadata program.

Speaker 1:          01:59:25       It's gathered me this stuff up. Well, first of all, again, I think, you know, everybody should have spent more time understanding what the actual technical aspects of it work because he gets it though was problematic. He was saying the people that worked with him were accessing the emails of ex girlfriends and they were, you know, there were, do I buying on, maybe that might've happened. Well, yeah, it's a human system. So yeah, there's gonna be some fuck ups. There's no doubt about it. So he has a problem. Well, I mean, I don't know what the INS and outs of a NSA are, you know, in terms of their protocols for, you know, uh, protection firewalls on, on systems at, uh, you know, it at government agencies tend to be, if they're used properly, are pretty robust. But at the same time, you know, any human system, it's like, it's like Tsa is someone going to be asleep at the wheel and somebody gets through with a shoe bomb?

Speaker 1:          02:00:11       Well, it could happen because the human system, but where do I stand on it? And no surprise. And you know, um, again, it's all based on what your experiences are. And I'd get the fact that people consider him a hero or a whistle or whatever they want to call it. Um, you know, he's signed paperwork that said he was going to protect national security interests, that he was going to properly protect the information that he was given responsibility for seeing. And he didn't, he didn't do that. And he also, despite what people may want to believe, um, he caused a lot of damage. It's a tremendous amount of damage in terms of information that was released about the way that we do things here. Uh, sources and methods that were of extreme interest to not just a terrorist organization, but extreme interest to Russian interests, extreme interest to Iranians.

Speaker 1:          02:01:05       And it's weird that he's in Russia right now. Yeah, I know. Go figure. Huh? Uh, yeah. Uh, so did he do any good? I don't know. Did he do any good? Well, you know, having that conversation is always good, but we can have that conversation without him doing what he did and um, and, and we should, in part of that responsibility lays on a, on a, on an aggressive and inquisitive. I'm constantly aware, um, checks and balances that exist within government, so the Intel Committee and then that would send it in until committee and, and all these people that need, they tend to play a game in Washington. They know what the fuck's going on. Like with the interrogation or rendition program, these people were briefed, they knew what the hell goes on. But there's a political game in Washington where they, they get to express outrage when something becomes a political football of course.

Speaker 1:          02:01:47       So, um, but yeah, so I did he do any good? Hey, we're talking about it and that's important. I, I, again, I keep going back to that. I'm not, um, I'm not an, what's the word? I'm not unsympathetic. Doesn't sound right. I understand. I appreciate the importance of finding the proper place on the pendulum, but I have probably an overriding appreciation for security because of what I did. And I understand that other people have an overriding appreciation for privacy because they didn't have the same experiences that they've had, different experiences. And so that's great. I appreciate that. And all I'm saying is I look at it from, from my perspective, uh, I don't look at him as a hero whistleblower in any way. Um, I, you know, I signed same agreements and, uh, I'm expected to live up to those just like anybody else who does. He didn't, he found a way that he thought was appropriate to make his point. I don't have no idea what goes on in his head. Um, I w I just would've thought it would've been nice if, if, uh, I dunno, we've made the point in a way that also protected our national security

Speaker 2:          02:02:54       just a little bit better. How could that be done though? Well, without exposing what he, what exactly did he expose? He exposed the fact that they were gathering up metadata and that, but there's been people that have said that it was more than metadata.

Speaker 1:          02:03:08       Well, there's eight. It talks about, you know, surveillance programs and here's his, his, you know, there's lots, there were lots of little bits and pieces because he, he, he, he, uh, he misappropriated, he stole a lot of, a lot of information. That was then essentially, if anybody thinks that, that Edward Snowden was smarter than the Chinese authorities or the Russians and that they didn't get a hold of everything and that somehow he just secreted that information with Glenn Greenwald and a couple others are those who have interests that are completely against ours, didn't get ahold of that information is, it's a pretty naive thought last time. I don't believe that Edward Snowden is smarter than the PLA and the resources of the FSB and Russia. I just, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he's like the lex luther of it. I don't think so. But uh, as an example is the surveillance programs supposedly that we had against a European leaders.

Speaker 1:          02:04:00       Remember the outreach with Angela Merkel and the fact that, you know, we're listening in on some of her conversations, the ones that we would have access to, uh, oh my God, really, really, because you know what they're doing. They're listening in on the conversations of their allies and the, I mean the French, the former head of the dgse, the French Intel service turned to the head of France at one point when the head of France was secretary blue and seek the Lord and how could we be doing this? And the former head of the Intel service looked at them French guy and said, are you fucking kidding me? What do you think we do? This is what we do.

Speaker 2:          02:04:33       So this is just always what he's exposing is something that everybody knew. So the mock outrage, you're saying it's like

Speaker 1:          02:04:39       walk out. It was, it was Kabuki theater in Europe for sure. I mean all they asked mostly theater. Yeah. I mean they, the hand wringing and all the, all the, Oh, I can't believe that they are Americans would be allies would be doing this. So they kind of assumed that everybody was doing it already. I guarantee you what was going on in the back rooms was the Intel service directors were all, you know, sitting down. And I would hope to think that our, our director was looking at them and saying, what the fuck? You know? And they were probably having a, you know, having a drink and saying, yeah, okay, we get it. We get to joke, you know, everybody's doing this. And so the idea that somehow we're the bad guy, uh, look to French Intel services, incredibly aggressive as an example. And there had been numerous cases where they've targeted a u s corporations for economic espionage. And the idea that somehow, you know, people should be shocked that one nation is, is acting in its own self interest in listening to other nations. Again, same theory with economic espionage. We better hope we're playing offense and defense in the way the world actually works. It'd be great if we all held hands and whinging monkeys on Unicorns. Fluid are acids and we could all sing songs together, but it's not how the world works. So we, you know, anyway, so that's me disappearing down a rabbit hole.

Speaker 2:          02:05:48       But, but this rabbit holes kind of important to talk about because you actually have some pretty deep knowledge about this rabbit hole and this is some of the things that get speculated left and right and back and forth. And either you'd take one side or the other and everybody argues about it. I mean, no one wants to government to have unchecked access to your emails, your phone that, yeah. And that's what people are worried about. Again, that slippery slope that is headed towards that. But what you're saying is that everyone is always spied on everybody's phone calls. They've always been involved in monitoring leaders whenever they could and that it's not just, it's standard, it's standard protocol.

Speaker 1:          02:06:25       It's every nation acts in its own best interest sometimes. It seems like the u s is the only one that apologizes for it. But if you, if you did nothing else other than approach foreign policy from the perspective that every nation action his own best interest, we wouldn't get caught short as many times as we do. Look at Putin. I mean, Putin absolutely is, is, he's an old school kgb guy. He's, he's always regretted that the Soviet Union fell apart. He considers it a huge catastrophe. Uh, probably the biggest catastrophe called it of the 20th century. And he's been busy ever since. Trying to figure out how to rebuild at least, uh, uh, influence, if not territory. And Eh, 2000, whenever it was five, he made us a, one of his first statements about how it was a, it was a horrible thing that the Soviet Union fell apart.

Speaker 1:          02:07:09       And then a couple of years later, three years later, he, he, the troops rolled into Georgia and they still own territory and Georgia and people don't talk about that. Uh, Kazia in South [inaudible], they've still got a large numbers of Russian troops in there. So he got that. He got Crimea. Um, you know, eastern Ukraine is for all intense purposes going to become part of Russian territory. And he's always been the same way. He says what he means. He acts in Russia's best interest. Chinese are the same way. We always seem to, to feel like that's, that's unusual. I mean, I remember times when we'd be engaged in, in some counter insurgency operation overseas and um, we'd address him up and we'd give them money and party hats and we train them and then they go out, meaning the, the, uh, foreign service foreign military and they wouldn't act like we would write.

Speaker 1:          02:07:56       There would be problems. So there'd be, um, human rights abuses or whatever. And you know, the Senate, the Intel Committee, which say, I can't believe this. How come they're not well, because they're a fucking different culture, just like you talked about earlier with the Middle East there. You can dress them up and give them money and training and they're always going to act differently. It just the way the world. But we never seem to quite get that. And it's sort of like this acting in your own best interest. We always seem to be what we do it, but we feel like it's unseemly. Somehow every other nation out there is doing it. Allies and others, everybody.

Speaker 2:          02:08:27       So is this a part of the problem with people getting access to information on how the world works? As time goes on, that information becomes more and more accessible and people get more and more upset about things that essentially have always been like this? Is that what's going on? Yeah, I mean, I think it's an interesting way to put it, but people have a problem with it, but they don't offer up a solution or what, I mean, the, the, the, the, the argument is always United States should do better. We should be better. We should inspire. There are American citizens. We shouldn't spy on foreign leaders. We should be the shining beacon of democracy and of honor throughout the world.

Speaker 1:          02:09:04       But, you know, that's a lovely idea. And we try it. And it's kind of going back to what I'd said earlier. I, you know, and people would disagree, but I, again, I've spent a lot of time overseas dealing with these issues and we try, right? We don't always get it right, but we try to do that. We try to be that, that you know, that that bright beacon and we try to be the right direction, all those things. And, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Um, we had, uh, I remember one time I had a guy in a foreign service, a foreign military. We're sitting having a drink and, uh, and they've been engaged in a long conflict. And anyway, this guy says, Hey, he says, uh, he says, thank you for, for bringing us democracy. And then he paused for a minute. He says, please don't do it again. I always thought that was a great line. I always thought, yeah, I get what you're saying. Um, but yeah, it's,

Speaker 2:          02:09:58       it's not that easy to bring democracy. Democracy doesn't really work.

Speaker 1:          02:10:02       It doesn't really work. And, and you know what we, so, yeah. So what do you do? You end up dealing with people that are unsavory end up dealing with, with countries that, you know, hey, we'd love them to be more in step with us, but it's just not the way, it just not the way it works.

Speaker 2:          02:10:17       It seems incredibly confusing and I don't think anybody's ever offered up a reasonable scenario where you could take places that I liked the Middle East and straighten it out like no one's offered, like some sort of a step, like a or a program. Or you can say, well, here's where they are now. Here's the rights violations, here's the, the real problems they have with religious freedom and this is how we can get them out of that. And we can get them to a place where the United States is right, where people have much more freedom. We know it. States isn't free. Freedom is an illusion. It's an illusion. We're not totally free. No, it's totally free. There's no, there's no total freedom. But it's also, uh, it's also because of the way the world is.

Speaker 1:          02:10:57       Yeah. I'm telling you, I'm, I'm here to die again. I've, I've been to a lot of places and, and, uh, we won the lottery and I realize everybody's coming from different positions and you know, places in life and, and, and you know, it's pretty fucked up for a lot of people here sometimes. And, but this is a good place to be overall. And there's still as the potential, even though it may seem far off sometimes for some people, but there's still the potential if you work hard, you can, you can do really well in this country and, and you know, and, and even those times when, I dunno, maybe, maybe I'm just kidding myself. Maybe I'd like to continue believing that and maybe who knows? Maybe it's not true. I, you know, I got young kids so I'm going to, I'm going to continue to believe it's true.

Speaker 2:          02:11:39       I think it's true for the most part, but I think it's complicated. And I also think this is a very unusual place. This country's only a couple hundred years old. And that's weird. It's weird to believe that. We mean really essentially founded in 1776. I mean, th 200 plus years is not long at all.

Speaker 1:          02:11:56       Hear you talking about it's going to what you're, I mean, 1776. Yeah. George Washington knew the importance of intelligence. He talked about the importance of intelligence in the revolutionary war. I mean, the first, and I'll probably get this wrong, but the first entry into the, uh, the, what do they call that book of expenditures, you know, that the accounting book that they kept anyway, basically the first entry was to pay for spies. Um, and, and, and it was, it was to establish a spy network, I believe, outside of Boston. And so they understood even at that time, the importance of it. So, yeah, to your point, yeah, it was, this has been, telephones has been people listening in and, um, and you need to check and balance that and you need to ensure that it's not overreaching. I get all of that. Uh, I'm just saying that when you do find that point and congress enacts a law and the courts, you know, go with it and say yes, when you do that then and you're jumping through the hoops that have been put in place and you've got to theoretically again the place to, you know, you would always like to think that we have committees up on the hill that are inquisitive and aggressive in their questioning and you know, are paying attention.

Speaker 1:          02:13:05       Um, but when all that is done, then you'd like to think if you have an operational concern and you go through those hoops that yeah, you'd be able to get the job done. Kind of bringing it back to the apple.

Speaker 2:          02:13:16       So I think kind of in a lot of ways we're talking about, we're talking about a lot of similarities that we have. On one hand we have the, the ideal utopia, we have the shining light of honor and dignity and then you have the dire

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       of the worst case scenario, right? And we're trying to, we're kind of in the mix, right? And that's, that's sort of life

Speaker 1:          02:13:41       slowly off. And I think that's people it, you know, there's one thing you learn in the agency is that it's not black. There's nothing black and white about the, about about the world. And you learn the CIA is very good at teaching you how to sort of exist in the, in the gray areas and understand that you're never going to get all the information that you want. You know, if it's not, it's not like the beach books for the feature films where they get all the details and okay now it's time to go, let's do that operation. You know, I remember most of the stuff that I was doing, most of the operations, you know, in the back of mind you're thinking, boy, I hope this isn't getting fucked up. You know, because we're, you're not, if you wait for all the information, you know, before you, before you do something, something bad's going to happen.

Speaker 1:          02:14:18       It's going to, it's, it's, it's going to be a fucking go up. You've got to get off the exit a certain point. And usually that's before you have that full comfort. And so you, they teach you very well how to do that, how to do risk versus gain calculations and how to figure out, okay, this is what we're going to have to, but you got to make a decision at some point the world like it to be, you know, again, sort of a zero risk. That's why we always talk about counter terrorism and they say, well, what am I going to get this over with? We're not, you know, it's just a,

Speaker 3:          02:14:44       and you evolve as a species. Yeah. I, that's really what it's going to cry. It's going to have to come down to something pretty fucking astronomical to have no more violence, no more crime, no more espionage, no more, no more hate. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, you know what I suspect I didn't in, in your lifetime. In my lifetime. I know. I know. It's so disappointing. Uh, what do I give everybody? Mushrooms. I might do the trick. I don't know. That's it. Mike Baker for president. Give everybody mushrooms. That's, that's your tagline. That's it. You don't want to be president. Nobody wants to be fucking president. And I really think we should get rid of presidents. What would we have instead? I think a giant committee of super intelligent people that aren't entirely responsible. One, not one figurehead. I think that figurehead is a primate thing. I think we always want the one alpha primate, they had a big silver back. Yeah. The wanting to watch the whole leader of the tribe thing. But that shit just can't work with 300 million people. It's just too crazy. And they all go gray so quick. They get so fucking old man. There's so much pressure on those guys.

Speaker 1:          02:15:51       Yeah. And it's, and, and you know what it's, it's also uh, yeah, I mean yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:15:56       President Obama. Yeah. He writes a good looking guy. Smooth faced, handsome young, vibrant looking guy and now he light hair. Yeah. Not only that, its face has fallen off his bones. Yeah. The Guy, he's, he looks so tired. Well, slept in years.

Speaker 1:          02:16:13       Say It, the weight of that job. Um, but you know, someone who has always shouldered it and somebody is always watching it,

Speaker 3:          02:16:20       the job. But wasn't it a different weight? Was it different? He was

Speaker 1:          02:16:26       dealing with depression, the recession, the, and dealing with world war two. I mean, I think it's always been, it's always, it's just a terrible job. Terrible job. Part of it. I think that the biggest problem now is the speed of information, right? So everybody's a fucking journalist on, on twitter. Uh, everybody's a judge and jury and all through the speed of information, uh, nobody bothers to check facts anymore. Everybody's racing to get ahead of the news cycle, which exists in, in minutes now instead of hours. I mean, remember we used to be white, you know, like the five o'clock news, the 11 o'clock news all day long. Journalist had time to check their facts and their stories and their sources because they just had that one newscast or two newscasts in the evening. And now let's fucking throw it out there and hope that, you know, we don't get it wrong.

Speaker 1:          02:17:10       So I think that weighs on, on anybody who's in politics. Uh, maybe it serves a good purpose as well. It keeps, who knows? Maybe it keeps them more honest. I don't know. But, uh, anyway, I think that has something to do with it. Looking at Obama then and now look at this photo. Look at this. Geez, that's incredible. That's a 20 year difference. That's a 20 year difference in less than eight years to 2006. January, 2016. You can throw up like a seven year split on trump now and see what trump will look like after seven years in office is going to look like Jabba the hut. His face is already fighting gravity. Wow. The poor guy. I so rich to one, Jesus Christ. What are you eating then? None of them are healthy. How about Bernie Sanders? Bernie's Bernie Sanders is going to look like a question mark.

Speaker 1:          02:17:57       He's going to like Ben completely over his posture. So awful already. Like someone should teach. That guy had a stand up straight and he's not that old, much older than Clinton. Right? He's only a couple of years older than she was like, Shit. Yeah. Well she's not holding up that well. She doesn't look good. Yeah. Well they did this bill. You look at that. I look out, he was like, Shit. Oh Geez. They rolled him out. I think they realized right away. That's a bad idea. Well, didn't he have, he had like some serious heart surgery, right? Yeah, he did. Yeah. But he's a smart son of a bitch and he was, you know, he, he was fortunate in a lot of ways. And He, and he governed well and he, he understood the, the, the, the importance of compromise and negotiation, I think. And that was still at a time when you could do that.

Speaker 1:          02:18:33       I think, I don't know whether it's still possible. I mean, look at the, some of the shit that comes out of that, the Capitol Hill where, you know, I mean, it Scalia is barely dead and people are saying, we're not going to listen to anybody who gets proposed a, you know, come in here and replace them. And you think, well, you probably could have held off on that statement for a little while. Democrats were so excited to get a liberal in their, oh, Bama can appoint a liberal. Yeah, exactly. And now he's throwing a left curve and said, well, maybe I'll, you know, who knows? Maybe somebody who is a Republican and you can imagine that's, is that what he said? That's what he said. Yeah. What's it? I forgot what the guy's name is. He's a former governor and is a salad. What about hope and change and now we've got to get Bernie in there because he'll, he'll, he'll hold the flag. I love to go camping when Obama just spent a week with them just to get drunk with them every night. Just tell me every day. Yeah, what the fuck is going on? What does that kid like? The guy is only three or four older than me.

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       It's gotta be a good feeling to have that last day. I mean, I know this probably, there's obviously a lot of sadness and there's a lot of worry about, well what, how am I going to be remembered? But that last fucking day when you finally get to hand over the keys, get the hell out of there and go have a, you know, a few pops and not have to worry about waking up in the middle of the night because some disasters going on. Yeah, but he's still got, he knows too much. So the consequences of all that knowledge, you've got to been weighing on his head. All these pieces that are in play, where are they going to wind up in a book or the book deal, a book deal and his own conscience mind. And then also the fact that he's got to have secret service for the rest of his life.

Speaker 3:          02:20:03       He was driving around and bulletproof cars forever. That guy can't go to the fucking mall. He'd give up your right to go to the movies. Well, I wouldn't mind if I didn't ever go to the mall again. Quite frankly, I'll be pressing if that means I can't go back into a mall so much he can do though. I know you're right. You can't go to the ball game, buy a ticket at the last minute and go in and just sit in the bleachers. You imagine if you do that and say Obama comes and sits down next to you with a dog and a pretzel and it's a Co parent who would be sell feed Nachos. Yeah. They would swarm him. If he didn't have secret service, they would smother him with selfies till the, there was no air and suffocate died of selfies. Hey, you probably should have held off on the whole selfie thing when they was in the White House.

Speaker 3:          02:20:41       So it'd be fair that walking around the White House with a selfie stick was at and selfie sticks or unpresidential. Yeah. I think there's certain things you do and you don't do and whether it's him or whether it's any other president, I think there's, there's something to be said for maintaining the dignity, the dignity of, of an office there. Yeah. There to fucking take a selfie just by yourself and you need a camera to do that just seems weird that I uh, eh, that's odd. And what a sign of the Times that is though. Seen him there with a magic wand where the fucking phone and well did you see him before when he was like a pure and around the corner with his sunglasses but tending to be James Bond and you know what also, I bet he has the iphone six and not the six plus because they, well we don't want you to look excessive, Mr President.

Speaker 3:          02:21:30       It's probably a decision. Go with a smaller phone. Mr. Preston. A little bit more approachable. We don't want you outrageous like I want a viper. You can't try the viper. Not Fiber, but it's an American car. I can never have a fight for, I can imagine. Drove a viper on at Ford 158 corvette convertible. Oh Man. Fucking big elvis sunglasses. Yeah. I'm afraid you fucks. If it was me and I finished up, I would drive away from the White House in my last day in an El Camino. This is, this is the fact that drives my wife crazy. I, I've always always wanted an El Camino. I've always kept my eye out for, you know what, uh, you give me an El Camino every year. Uh, it was manufactured and I would be a happy boy. I don't know why it's, it's, it's irrational. And my wife hates it because she thinks it's a, it's a horrible looking car. Do you have one? I don't. I've got my latest, my latest by was a as a, uh, a wagon

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       here. Remember the old jeep wagon? Yes. With a wood panel on the side I bought, I bought one of those and it's uh, it's uh, actually being redone at a, at bucks four by four. And uh, in Idaho for all your, all your automotive needs. So you bought it and you're refurbishing it or is it the last year they manufactured it? 91 91. And it's got an original Shag carpeting in there and it's, uh, it's just, uh, it's a brilliant vehicle. I've got the big bench seat. Remember the bench seat you'd have and cc that was, those are good when you went around corners just slid all over them. Now that it, depending on if you had to girl by your side, then you take a hard left turn. Oh, what are you doing over here? It was bench seats. It is. Yeah. Almost like that. Huh? I ain't even one car. That's a piece of shit that is done. I can you say that, look at that son of a bitch. That's a fucking ugly. God is a car right there. And you know what that thing weighs about 400,000 tons. It is solid steel. I tap you tap. That's been, yeah, that's weird. Yeah. That shouldn't happen. You want it classic classic test, right? You keep it classy and like the wood panel. Oh, are you kidding me? Of course. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:23:40       See that's validate all the common sense that you've laid out on this podcast. The less, there's a lot of people out there that they would look at the woodside wagon here and say, yeah, I get it. That's a great vehicle Camino, to be fair. A lot more throwing up in their mouth. Yeah. Well, you know, thank you for that. Um, but yeah, that's, that's sort of the, uh, I know. And then another thing that the 57 Bel Air, I'm a big Belair Belair. That's a beautiful thing. There's no doubt about that. I sit and watch for entertainment and my two older boys will sit there and just be as happy as clams watching with me. I'll watch Barrett Jackson auction and meet too fancy. See, look at me. Come auction. One time I got caught in a rabbit holes sitting in my house and it came on. I watch it for two fucking hours.

Speaker 1:          02:24:28       Just watch people buy a car. It's all you do. It's insane. And you know, and, and it's just so much, I look at that whether it was a 1970 challenges. Oh that's, that's a beautiful car. Damn car right there. Wow. What our car, what a shape. I know that a 55 and 57 the old days when it was, what they would do is, I mean it was all based on aspiration, right? So we had the space program, you know, there was starting to build and you know, and you could see it in, in the vehicles, you could see, you could see what that, what that time was like by looking at the cars under the excess of it all. And then the dreaming. It's special. Yeah. Bumper. Oh God. The shyness. It's such a strange shape too. So gorgeous. Anyway, and then there's five mercury, a Sun Valley's mercury. Sun Valley's are another good guy. Could go anyway. Nomads. I mean just, it's just so many good cars

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       out there. But um, yeah, I went to high school with her dad had a 55. Oh my God. It was gorgeous. It was one of those cars to drive it. No, no, I didn't know her that well and he would never probably let anybody drive it, but he would just drive by, you know, it was, there was two cars in my neighborhood when I grew up that were one, one, uh, my, uh, sister's boyfriend's brother had a 65 gto convertible, cherry red. That was, he was the king. This guy was the king. He would drive down the neighborhood neighborhood. Cliff's June was his name. It said Chirps on his bumper. Stickers. License plate was chirps and he would drive this thing and he would slam through the gears and the wheels will go cause they had a little skinny ass fucking shitty tires back then.

Speaker 3:          02:26:09       And then there was another guys car. So, oh my God. Yeah. There's something about those cars to this day, like commanding the top dollar now. It used to, it used to be, you know, you'd get, you'd be into the 50s and, and that was when the big dollars where, but now that they've gotten back into the muscle cars, you know, there's a year that they go the get to where they're not worth anything. Like the 1980s shit. Well you remember that point in time, there was a very sad point in time when all of a sudden you realized that the trans-am, the Camaro, the Mustang, they all started to look just the same and you started, it fell apart. Oh, mustangs were pieces of shit. Now they, they've, they've done a good job of trying to revitalize that. But there was that period of time when cause everything, that Camaro, he used to be 68, 69, remember [inaudible] 69 Camaro was one of the greatest looking at muscle cars of all time and hugger orange they had. And they made a hugger orange. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:27:01       fuck. Yeah. It had me and I know that with orange you saw this thing. No, it's a special, it's a special color. Oh, hugger orange. Look that up. Anyway, so, uh, yeah, so I'm not sure how we got into that. Not Bad. That's actually not bad. But you know what, that 69 camaro shape is so fucking spectacular. It is the perfect muscle car shape. Yeah. I mean, it's hard. It's hard to beat. It's hard to beat that. That's about as good as it gets, man. And that's pulled top dollar now. Oh, well they're taking those now. And they do what they call a pro street conversions. You know, they take a car like that and they do everything. They do a resto mod. Right. So all the breaks are new. They have modern suspension, you know, they have these um, uh, art morrison chassies that are custom built for those things.

Speaker 3:          02:27:49       So they take out their funky frames and they put in like a really spectacular, well-designed frames, specifically me. Look at that for those seats. Those seats never used to show up at auction because it was like, yeah, look, it's not, you know, it's not original, but now. Yeah. Yeah. Well people saying there's still a lot of people that like original, they're assholes. They want, they want to die in a car accident. Those fucking things. He, he hit the brakes and it's like, you better be ready. That way I can hear redone. Yeah. Cause I got dragged those kids around in there and when you're going to get modern breaks, put in it and everything. Yeah. The whole thing has been been a, basically, you

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       know what got everything except the wood. Are you going to do the engine? Yeah. Well the idea was a complaint, read belt on the engine fuel injection because first of all, that's what you want. You don't want to go on a carburetor. Oh my God. Personally in Idaho while I had it for a while before I put it over at, uh, at bucks four by four for all your automotive needs, gas and the carburetors. I'd run out there, I'd be in a hurry yet jumped in and I think anyway, my faculty out there, I was looking to sell their El Camino. You get in touch with me really that deepen and, Huh? I don't know what I didn't know. I remember part of it is, I remember as a kid I had know I had a great hot wheels collection and I remember the El Camino was one of my favorites back then.

Speaker 1:          02:29:01       Anyway. So to me it looks like a pickup truck. Fuck the Chevelle. Yeah. Yeah. Basically. Yeah. I can't argue with it. Yeah. I could have Chevelle. So that to me is like, why would you have that when you can have a Chevelle and 69 Chevelle and one of the most beautiful muscle cars ever created, but a 69 el Camino like wow. There it is. There's the hot wheel. Yeah. That's nice. I think. I think that's mine. I think you've got a picture of my very own hallway. Ooh, I got one of those sit on my desk in the office. People walk in, they start and they go, why do you have this fucking toy? El Camino. Google of real 69 El Camino. Jamie, let's see what a real one looks like. Not a hot wheel one C for a nice looking car though. The, you know, it's, the front is so good looking like don't go down that one.

Speaker 1:          02:29:46       The one the black and white right below that. Ooh. See The bay. The back looks like shit though. That's fraud is so good. Look in the back. Doesn't look that bad, but you know it's a place to put your dog and you know. Anyway, I forget that you can't drive with your dog in the back of your truck out here. We do all the time. Can, it wasn't illegal out here. I suspect somebody would turn your in right now. How could you dare put your dog out in the back of your truck and drive down the street? That's, I was in northern California this weekend. Some guy was driving around this dog in the back of the car and my daughters are freaking out until like he just has to tall. The dog is just running around in the back like that's what they do. We drive down the street and I see kids in the back of pickup trucks.

Speaker 1:          02:30:25       I mean, do you remember that car though? Remember that car or that car that had the plastic seats when the handles in the back facing facing. What the hell was that? That was, it was like a Subaru. Yeah. There was some kind of guard. It had fucking black thing, little seats in the back. We could put the kits and they had little handles. That was the safety feature. This little plastic handles the kids get a hold onto as you drove down the road and the highway doing 70 miles an hour. I have to have it. A couple of Martinis at the old club. What is that? A Subaru pickup truck thing. I don't remember it like it was lacking station wagon that had, I got a picture of one but a Volkswagen station wagon. Wow. Well, yeah. Facing seating now. Yeah. Yeah. My, yeah. My Dad had a chevy that had the rear facing wagon seat and we also used to fight with me and my brothers would fight over it and you know, we literally would go to the officer's club. My Dad would have a few drinks and then the pile, all the kids back in the, in the, in the Chevy wagon and, and barrel down the highway as we're all flying back

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       and forth over the seats, argue with each other and fighting about who gets the rear facing seats. And there was not a fucking seat belt to be had. Well you remember those Toyota land cruisers that had the seats that face each other side facing Jay's Fj he's forties what it we, yeah, it was Fj 40 right.

Speaker 1:          02:31:36       I forget what it was, but it was, yeah, it was not that long ago that they, they, they had those in the, in the Land Rovers for years and years and years. And including, you know, I want to say like 10 years ago, they were still building those things in the back. Yeah, I think so. It's not that long ago. It was, it was an option on a cause. I got a like got a land rover one time and it was probably okay to be fair, it's more than 10 years. There's probably 15 years ago, but I remember that was an option to get was the the back seats face and I thought well at what point am I ever going to use these?

Speaker 3:          02:32:06       Yeah, maybe the F's Fj 40 but that was way more than 10 years ago. See the F Z J 80 was a classic Land Rover and now I was like, I think they stopped making that 97 or 98 and that's a classic one because it has a solid front and rear axle and those motherfuckers can drive over everything. They just, you know, to this day people refurbish them. Land cruisers are a great vehicle to see those. I mean those, we used to put those things to all sorts of, she'll come up in London special. Exactly. All the Taliban had those land cruisers because they never broke down. You build that exhaust pipe up over the top of the roof for the crossing the fjords, fjords towards in the desert, the fjords, the snorkel, the desert snorkel, the safari snorkel. They would call it a lot. And we've just released more documents from bin Laden.

Speaker 3:          02:32:57       More documented. The CIA released about 110 documents from the bin Laden raid. Oh, that's right. It was also about like what he wanted to do with his money. He died. He wrote a will for his $29 million. He had 29 million when he died. Yeah, I'm surprised. Yeah. I'm surprised he didn't have more. Frankly, it's days dad was worth billions. Well, this is weird that he was living in some fucking strange compound and everybody kind of knew it. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know. Well it was bizarre. We haven't done it tonight. Should we didn't fight Osama I that I no, you're kidding me. And he was in that weird compound in that ha like hiding out. Yeah. It's so, it's so strange.

Speaker 1:          02:33:33       And we got lucky because he was, he was looking to move. It was looking to get on the move again. I think he probably sensed in part because he, he'd had some problems with one of the, one of the facilitators that he had and he was looking actually to, to, to replace one of his people that actually dealt with them sort of as liaison guy between the Pakistanis and al Qaeda and him. And so it, you know, we, if we, if we held off, if we hadn't found him and then only had a month to plan, uh, you know, it could have gone completely the other way. We could have shown up and it would have been an empty place because he was, he was actively looking to move to a different location.

Speaker 3:          02:34:09       Well, it's kind of funny that the way they had to do it was doing in the middle of the night land helicopters, one of them crashed, break and then

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       shoot him that way. What really, they knew where the house was. If we were really evil, if we were able yes, drop one right on that house and fucking incinerate and they talked about that as a scenario. In the end, the decision was looking, he's got, there's women and children in there and how many people were in the house with him? He had his extended family with them. I'd effect, you know, there were, there were, uh, I dunno, seven or eight plus guards, but the women and children were there and so, and the decision was made, no, we can't do that. We can't, we can't fire a rocket down there because we don't want to take out all those people. That's an indication, you know, I can't, I mean, people are to say, wow, fuck you. You just want to go after the oil. But um, you know, trying to do the right thing.

Speaker 1:          02:34:56       So to signing a, an insanely complex operation like that, just to save those people that were with him essentially. Right. And to do, and to do the right thing and the idea of being, well, maybe we can, maybe we can recover them alive. Maybe we can actually died in that rate. Or other people do it too. Right? Guards died. Yeah. Yeah. Did you ever see photos of them? Did they let you look at the photos? A body allegedly? Is Anybody listening? Um, no. No. It's just between you and me. Just don't know. I didn't say no, but if you did, you could do something to let me know that you did. You could just to like just my last act weird act like you're trying to hide something right as I ask you a question, like he can't fucken answer this question, but no, I would say, I mean there's a insanely complex operation, um, you know, full size mock ups, you know, put together of the, of the, uh, of the facility of the [inaudible] compound.

Speaker 1:          02:35:52       Um, again, talking about, we were talking about before muscle memory, right? You know, how many fucking steps do I have to go here? How many steps do I have to get to the end of this wall? Right? You have to know exactly how is places laid out, where he could possibly be and how do they do that? Well, they, I mean, that's all that work. People think that somehow we just rocked up on his place. That was, that was eight plus years of insane effort trying to locate him and then confirm it was him and then, you know, design this operation. And so there were a lot of, a lot of moving parts. It wasn't just like we said, oh look great. Now we got them. And that was an impressive that he was able to hide for that long. Yeah, it is. But there was a lot of, uh, accomplices and mainly like the Pakistani Intel service, the incredibly duplicitous had someone actually, uh, as his liaison officer within the packy Intel Service and, and there were a lot of people yeah, that, um, had a very invested interest in making sure that he, uh, stayed hidden.

Speaker 1:          02:36:55       And so, uh, I know people say, well, he was, it was a tall bearded dude. You should've been able to find them. Well, it ain't that easy and all, and you know, it's not as easy as it in the feature films. It just doesn't work that way. It's not, no, I know, I know that's disappointing for a lot of people to hear. But, uh, it was a great operation and it's interesting that they've released these documents and, and uh, at this point in time, and it is, it's fascinating to see kind of inside his mind a little bit more and understand to what degree he did or didn't have a sort of operational understanding of what al Qaeda was doing at the time. Um, yeah. So anyway, for those of you that are looking for something to read, zero, dark 30, that move, how accurate was that movie? Um, they make day people. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:37:44       The girl who was in charge of everything and telling navy seals.

Speaker 1:          02:37:47       Yeah. It's a composite of people. It's like, it's like Hollywood does, they do some things really, really well. They do the military a recreation's very, very well. I mean, he's incredibly well and um, and then they take bits and pieces and turn them into a character. Right. Which is what they do. And that's, that's the nature of it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:38:05       A dramatic representation of what kind of went on, but not really

Speaker 1:          02:38:10       good. Juicy or so they have to make an entry door. You got to condense it down. You know, if you, if you showed what actually happened, the audience kill themselves out of boredom because you'd be watching eight years worth of, of surveillance in eight years worth of struggling and understand what one credit card receipt meant in relation to something that was happening over across the other side of the world. All these things that go into this that nobody ever sees. So they, they, you know, they condense it down and it turns into a movie and then, and then, you know, up on the hill in Capitol Hill, they get confused and they don't realize that maybe it's a, maybe it's a movie, you know, and so they, I don't know if you remember that kerfuffle they had after they released it where they called them back and said, well, you know, maybe over the interrogation program, maybe you didn't tell us everything, you know, and you think, well, no, they just made a fucking movie. You know? I mean, because there were people that were upset with zero, dark 30 because I thought it, it put too much importance on interrogation. And there were people that thought it didn't put enough importance and I'm thinking it's a fucking movie. You know, it, part of it's just entertainment. You know, you're not watching a documentary. But anyway,

Speaker 2:          02:39:09       well there's a, there's a movie that they made, I don't know if you saw the, um, Fox catcher movie that's based on Mark and David Schultz. The wrestlers. Yup. Yup. That movie is just filled with bullshit and it's a real problem for Mark Schultz, who was an Olympic gold medalist, one of the best wrestlers the United States has ever produced. And they, they, and that's that guy's alive. Okay. His brother got shot by that crazy dupont fuck right. But mark's alive and they changed all sorts of Shit in that movie. That doesn't make any sense. Historical Shit about his career as a wrestler, his career as a UFC fighter, they put the, they even changed the time where the UFC was invented. They made the UFC, they made him watch the UFC like almost like six or seven years, I think before it ever really existed. And then on top of it, the guy he watched fight, was it historical character?

Speaker 2:          02:40:06       Big Daddy Goodrich. Gary Good rich was one of the original pioneers of MMA and he in the movie watching Gary Goodrich fight, Paul Herrera when in reality he fought Gary Goodrich and his first UFC fight also in the movie Mark Schultz is in fighting in the UFC. In his first fight he's fighting in some small organization and it's like kind of sad and he's fighting a white Russian dude. He fought a black guy named Gary Goodrich. Gary Good, which is a historical figure. It's like it's historical fact in the world of mixed martial arts than Mark Schultz was like one of the greatest talents from wrestling to ever compete in MMA. And Gary Goodrich was a real pioneer. A guy was very dangerous and mark took them down at will and it was kind of crazy to watch like how good of a wrestler he was. Well, in the movie they bullshit their way through all that.

Speaker 2:          02:40:59       He didn't even fight. Gary was there. Was there somebody who served as a consultant, who knows, but mark went crazy after the movie's released and one of those twitter rampage and we were supposed to do a podcast about it. But he's, he's an odd guy, you know, he's just, he's, he's very elusive and he's talked about doing it and I said, look man, let me know when you want to do it. I'll fly you out. We'll talk about it. But he went on this rampage about it on twitter. And then someone compiled a website where they talked about all the things that they got wrong in that movie and all this stuff they made up in that movie to make it more interesting. But the story itself is fascinating that anytime,

Speaker 1:          02:41:34       but he releases a story or anybody, uh, you know, signs over something or anybody, you know, it picks up a book and says, I'm going to make a movie out of this. And, and that's it. It's, it becomes an editorial process. It's like saying, you know, how does raw intelligence get out of the field and then suddenly becomes something that's not, well, it gets into this editing process and you've got a bunch of people taking a whack at it, you know, over at the National Security Council and eventually, you know, they've got to spin on it.

Speaker 2:          02:41:57       I can kind of understand that. If you're talking about someone who died before things were recorded, right? Making a movie on Lincoln, you don't really know what he said. You've got to kind of put words in his mouth. It's in a little bit. What did he say to his wife? Let's make up some shit. He said to his wife, but Lincoln's Lincoln's dead. Mark Schultz is alive and he's not that old. I mean he says, I think he's probably 50 they talked to him about it. Did they? Oh yeah. Well, whatever. They talked to him about it. He fucking wasn't happy when the movie was released, so I don't, I don't know. Right. They made him look gang in the movie. They made it. They alluded to some sort of a weird gay affair with him. And Dupont. It was frosted tips. It was very odd.

Speaker 2:          02:42:34       Very odd what they did. I'm impressed. You know what frosted tips are. Oh, they're out there. So I was like, I know a lot of things. Strip club, no saying or his hair. Yeah, I know, I know. I know. You know, we all know who hasn't had frost 10 we don't know. I don't know what the hell that is. Yeah, when I had hair, it's not about Camino. I never had frosted tips, but I could have, I could have been talked in. I've could have gotten to, I've could have fallen into the wrong crowd of people in my twenties and I could've wound up in rocking tipsy after that game at fenway and found a hairdresser upstairs, do a hairdressers and said, that's it. That's for me. Anybody saw the perfect guy

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       with frosted tips and it, this would have been completely different conversation that you and me are having. Right? Ice Man from top gun, Val Kilmer, kilmer kilmer, he's not looking as good as he did back in the top gun days. He kind of slimmed down a little bit. He got back to like a more manageable form. Okay. But for him, he definitely shape. He went, he went full trump for awhile. He just ballooned up to this strange sort of, that's odd because he was a fucking beautiful man. That was alien movie and he did. He did a tombstone. There's the frosted tips. Dad is nice man. Fuck it in the air force were in that hairdo. How does a guy go from that to, have you ever seen that photo where it's like lol? I used to remember when I used to be Batman. Ever seen that picture?

Speaker 3:          02:43:58       His fucking face looks like a giant pie. Yeah. I saw him one time over at the Chateau Marmont. I was sitting there, uh, working on my laptop and I look up and he's across the room and I thought something familiar, but it was during his, a large stage. I remember staring, thinking there's something familiar about that dude. And it took me forever to figure it out. I finally, I was about to close my laptop at that. Aha. It's, it's a, it's a huckleberry guy. There he is. Hey guys. Remember when I was Batman. What the fuck did he do this? Does he just boozing it? Oh, nuts, donuts and booze and bring a lot of people doubt. Stop. Stop doing this. Spring up some pictures of the Camino. He got so big belly up there. Look at that one. Go Up. Look at that one right at his belly to the right.

Speaker 3:          02:44:47       Oh my Jesus Christ. Stop turning that roll down. I don't want that role. Well, actually look at his face there. He's in the, not as fat with its face as he was in that. Remember when I was Batman? He all by God Travolta. Look, they're a little bit, what the Fuck, man? I wonder what he did. We'll need to age better out in this town. People need to age better. They need to learn to age gracefully. It's hard. Well, you know what the doctor just tells you, hey man, I'm just give you a little, a little nip, a little talk and we'll be fine. Tell you what I'm talking about. A slippery slope. Good looking man, but thank you. It a little better. It gets some frosted tips and pull those eyes up a little bit. Just it's gonna make your mouth. Sorry. That's a weird one.

Speaker 3:          02:45:28       That's not a good one. Make your mouth a little bigger. That's the weird one that women develop this mouth that looks like they could eat your head. Yeah. There they're fucking choke her mouth because they're pulling your face and in pulling your face they stretch. They do something crazy where they're stretching your mouth. They tightened the, uh, they tightened the Jina and they enlarge the mouth and nothing wrong with Titan and China. I know, I guess I, I just realized what I was saying. I think that medical responsible mass, yes. Fight of a, John, I'd want to tighten. I know this is exactly what people would expect to us to be talking about when I come in on that afternoon on this podcast. Yes. Because this one guy, this podcast will go south. Well, we'll as

Speaker 1:          02:46:09       well it has. I think it might have. I wanted to ask you one question before we get out. I can get, I think we're closing in on the three hour mark. The interrogation school that you were talking about, like what do they do to you when you're in an interrogation school to try to get you to understand what it's like to break? You'll have to talk about that to some degree. Yeah. I mean what you go through is a lot of what the waterboarding, Nick's work. So yeah. I mean waterboarding has done to, to, to us, to our people. So you've got waterboarded uh, is anybody listening? No. Okay. Just keep telling me that. I keep imagining because we'll probably actually just recorded this. You're just being nice to me there. It actually, you're not even recording it. This is just happening and it's going to go in the dump lot.

Speaker 1:          02:46:47       Yeah. Anyway, the point being is yes, that enhanced interrogation techniques including sleep deprivation, which is probably at the end of the day, uh, sleep deprivation, white noise, stress positions. Um, a, an interrogation facility is a very, uh, finally controlled, uh, very labor intensive place. And it's not like people think, ah, it's like a apple grape. Well, Abbott, Greg wasn't an interrogation facility. I have them grade was a military holding cell run by uh, you know, uh, people that didn't have the experience, they basically turned it over to junior officers and people that shouldn't have been in there running a facility like that and it was completely wrong. But an interrogation facility, you go in and it's, it's, it's all about doing your homework. You don't ever go in and sit down with a, a detainee unless you have done all your homework. You know where you want this conversation to go.

Speaker 1:          02:47:45       You know the questions you want to ask. You don't want to appear to be wavering. You didn't want to appear to be unsure. And if you don't do your homework, it's like a, it's like a polygraph. If the polygraph operator doesn't do his homework, lie detector, if he doesn't do his homework and that exam is fucked, do polygraphs work? Uh, you know what, in a way, it's not a science. So it's not, it doesn't work in the sense that yes, it will tell if you're lying or not. It's a tool in the kit bag of understanding what, what kind of person you're dealing with. So for some people it works because they feel guilty about everything. Right? Right. And so they remember that in 1902 they stole a pen and now they feel bad about it. So they're gonna, you know, and so the physical, the physiology of it is, it is starting to react.

Speaker 1:          02:48:28       And that allows for the operator to go, well, there's something strange about that question. They reacted a little bit differently. They're breathing, whatever it may be, the sweat, they how to react. She had a reaction. Now, let's now let's go in on that a little bit, but I guess my point being is that, or interrogations or even negotiations or interviews, I mean, if you're out there and your, your job is to interview people, well then, you know, you know what it's like, you gotta know who you're talking to and that's how it becomes effective. But in, in training, yeah. You go through all these things, um, and it, you know, it can be, it can be fairly intense. But the idea, again, part of it is to show will look, this is, this is what it does. This is how you can deal with it.

Speaker 1:          02:49:06       This is how you, you know, you stay close to some something that's um, that's, that's plausible. You know, it's like a, it's like a, an alias or a, a backstory or whatever you want to call it. You don't want to treat it. Try to keep it close to the truth. You know, the problem that people have in interrogation sometimes is they'll say something that's not true. Now they got to remember that. Then they go back in for another session. They got to remember what they said before. Now if they say another line, now they've got to remember those two things and they was pretty soon after three or four interviews, they're trying to remember this string of lies where what you really want to do is you want to try to keep it as close as possible to whatever the truth may be so that you don't have to spend all your time struggling to remember what was the hell I said last time.

Speaker 1:          02:49:46       So like, if you lie to someone that you're interrogating, that's you're saying, not if someone's being interrogated or someone's, I mean, that's an or, or you know, in the interview process. I mean, it's just, so anyway, I, I don't know where I'm going with that other than to say that it's, uh, it's, and whether it's military, whether it's mild outfit or whomever, um, it's an important, uh, part of training because, you know, again, you have to understand what's possible. Now it's, it's a changed world, right? The Doj and the White House and everything came out and tortured people in the mall. Well, you can't use enhance techniques, you know, and, and, uh, yeah. So, Hey, go and how people are screaming and sexy. That's fucking torture until I your dope. But I mean, the idea of being is all you can use. This is the field manual, the military field manual.

Speaker 1:          02:50:28       And what does that mean? Well, it means I couldn't break my, my daughter with a military field manual. You couldn't, I don't think so. What does the military field and what I mean by that is, I don't mean to be, uh, I don't mean to be flip or dismissive. What I'm saying is once, once people out there know what can and can't be done, they know how much they can take. They know exactly what they can take, they know what exactly what's coming down the pike and they're just going to keep their Yap shut. And people say, wow, but you can develop a relationship with them. That's what we did. You know, most of the time, all the information we got basically if people took the time to go through Dlj memos and look at the, the actual information, most of what we did was based on conversing, based on knowing who you're talking to, doing your homework, figuring out how the pieces fit together and talking to people.

Speaker 1:          02:51:14       Um, but those people don't have much incentive to talk sometimes if they know that, well, you can't do shit to him anyway. Right. And so I'll have to do is keep their mouth shut and you're, you're saddled down by the rules. The advantage of, of, uh, enhanced techniques. You should do air quotes when you say that it's tech. And what I mean by that is, yeah, and it has techniques. Let's see, as a perfect representative. I know. And, and you know, and there you go. And I know that was, that's also, it's like everything else, right? It's like the, it's like all the other discussions we've been having in terms of people based on their experiences. And so those people that you're never going to shift off this position. You're not going to shift off of this other position. It was all torture or it's not.

Speaker 1:          02:51:55       And there's some things that exist between talking to a detainee and what is torture? The United States is noble when we don't torture people. Yeah. Well, um, yeah, I want them to, that we do. I don't want to, but I want them to not know what's in the kit bag. Okay. So enhanced techniques. So like when you say enhanced techniques, is sleep deprivation and the enhanced techniques to sleep. So you can't use that anymore. What? No. What if you read, read what, what took place? People read those deal memos and realize how much it wouldn't take it if they actually took the time and understand all the back and forth that took place between the field and headquarters over at, well, can we do this? Can I put my hand on his chest and push him up against a wall? Well, okay, build a fake wall.

Speaker 1:          02:52:36       So it's not like, can you do this? Okay, no, can I, what can I do? And there was back and forth and back and forth over what could be done and yeah, okay. It's not supposed to be nice and it's not pleasant. And we can argue and I, and obviously people do, I don't, torture is wrong and we shouldn't do it, but do I think that there were some things like a sleep deprivation or stress positions or truck noise, you know, like, uh, put your forward against the wall and walk back, you know, and then, you know, lean, lean your head against the wall and walk back and, and stay in that position for, you know, 15 minutes or whatever. You make them do that. Uh, what if they don't in the old days? Yes. Yeah. I mean, you know, people are pretty compliant in an interrogation facility back when they didn't know what was coming down the pike.

Speaker 1:          02:53:21       Right. And that's why I keep saying the same thing. I don't, I don't, I agree it shouldn't be torturing, but at the same time, we shouldn't also be telling the hostiles what we can and can't do. All right. You say you shouldn't be torturing, but what if you have someone who knows that a nine 11 is about to take place and you've got to get information out of them. What other ways are there? If you have a small window of time? It's not really the unsatisfactory answers. There's not really, torture doesn't really put through this information. I agree with Senator Mccain and lots of other people about that people will say whatever they need to say to make whatever that horrible torture is to stop. And so it's not from an operational, I, you know, again, I understand that some moral aspect to it. I tend to just look at things from an operational efficiency point of view.

Speaker 1:          02:54:02       And it's not good. You can't, you can't count on information. So beating somebody up doesn't get information off their fingers, doesn't get information out of them, but does sleep not that, not that are not, that are hostile is out there and not to. The people that are after us wouldn't do the same. Of course they do that, but they're not really after accurate information. They don't care. It's a different, it's a different world that they existed. If we're after actionable intelligence that you can count on, then it's just a very, very labor intensive sources. Well, there there's ways to get people to talk, right? Well, yeah, I mean this gets to a point psychologically speaking. Sure. I mean there's ways to get them to comply, get them and that's, that's part of the processes, you know, uh, in a well controlled environment, sleep deprivation or, or, or a white noise.

Speaker 1:          02:54:44       How do you keep them awake? What do you have to do for sleep deprivation? Ah, you keep him standing or you, uh, you know, keep moving them from place to place or you pump in some, uh, you know, Arabic music or a baby crying or whatever it may be. Um, and it just keeps them awake. I mean, it's, again, it's labor intensive because you got to keep checking on them, making sure they're awakening. But you do that in under a controlled environment. You don't, you don't, you know, we're not talking about, you know, five days of this. And, and again, if people took the time to understand or read, they would realize that we're a lot of doctors, psychiatrists involved that were saying, yeah, you can, or you can't do this. Um, it wasn't, you know, I, again, I, I, you know, I get conflicted because I understand why people are so emotive about it and I get that.

Speaker 1:          02:55:26       Um, and I do agree there's, uh, you know, you have to look at what you can and can't do and you have to be very, very critical about that. And you have to be very careful. But I guess I keep coming back to the same thing as we've kind of given up the ghost from now on going forward. Everybody out there knows what we can and can't do. And so whether we were going to do it or not, which we wore in terms of the torture side of things, they didn't know that. And so you could speed the process up of getting them to comply to some degree because they didn't know what was coming down the pike and you keep them on the back foot and you keep them guessing. And that's your advantage in a, in a, in a situation like that. So, um, but yeah, I again, I keep going back to the same thing.

Speaker 1:          02:56:08       I get it. I understand why people are so, uh, you know, and, and to be fair, the left really did a great job of framing the argument. You know, they really took it and said, you're either talking to somebody or it's all torture. Well, if torture doesn't really produce actionable information, then it makes sense to not torture people. Right. Absolutely. That's my point. That's my point. And I agree from ecstasy and hookers either. No, it's not. It's not supposed to be a pleasant situation. And so people say, well, I can't believe you would, uh, you know, put somebody in a stress position or you would, you know, make them uncomfortable or you would keep them awake for 36 hours. I can't believe you would do. Well, really, I mean, what the fuck you want to, of course. And we'd always try, you'd always try to develop relationships with people that is in fact the best way to do it.

Speaker 1:          02:56:50       Develop, try to Pry, you know, find out about their psychology. Try to find ways to get them on side to, to get their sympathy or to bring them on board. Whatever you can do. But um, to just say we're taking all these other things out of the kit bag, whether we ever gonna use them or not. And here's all we can do. You're pretty much guaranteed that there's a lot of people out there who are walking around on Syria and Iraq for Isis carrying a field manual in their back pocket who know exactly what we can do. What we can't do now,

Speaker 3:          02:57:20       but isn't there a ways we circumvent that by not doing it on American soil? No, no, no, no, no. I know people would like to think that. I like to think that there's like some secret CIA holding place that you take people on the moon of question get stick rockets up the ass and they start talking. I'm moon. That would be you gotta be sign. That'd be a lot of money. Too much money on moon station. Um, no, like one Tahmo for for instance, like a lot of dark shit has gone on and Guantanamo, right?

Speaker 1:          02:57:46       Um, no, actually, you know what, here's where people will say, ah, I can't believe it. Uh, Watada Mo, uh, has always been more about, um, uh, a holding facility. And you could argue that though the, the, depending on how you want to frame it, if you want to say it was all torture, fine, then the torture or the enhanced techniques, whatever, uh, for the most part took place overseas in a facilities that, you know, we were running that were temporary or our host countries were running. And that's where I would much rather have, we treat people a lot better than some of our allies do, frankly. And particularly a lot of our Middle Eastern allies. I could only imagine there are a lot of guys in, in, in Guantanamo who would like to stay in Guantanamo right now, frankly. Um, then go be repatriated to the Middle East and really?

Speaker 1:          02:58:37       Yeah. Oh yeah, you're kidding me. Rather than if that didn't go back and face a Egyptian justice. Yeah. Or, or the Jordanians are. Yeah, absolutely. But I mean, I again, I know people are going to say, well, they don't actually want it. They're not clamoring to stay and get my dog get me wrong. I'm saying that they are treated better in that facility. Then they would be, if they find themselves suddenly in an Egyptian prison, if they were interrogated by our allies. So, but having, there've been people that have been found to have been detained there that really were innocent. Let's put it this way. Uh, did we throw out a big net and uh, err on the side of caution when we were picking people up off the battlefield? Yes. Um, did we do a lot of good by removing a lot of these people and some of the key players off the battlefield and out of the operational system within al Qaeda and some of their, their supporting elements.

Speaker 1:          02:59:29       Yes. So it's not, you know, it's not satisfying answer because it's not black or white. It's not all bad. It's not all good. Again, like we were talking about before, the gray, it's the gray. It's unfortunate, but a part of reality. It's the way that, you know, I don't know. And you know, and yes. What are you going to do it? Close it down and say, well, we're sorry. The recidivism rate for people coming out of a Gizmo is, is up in the 30% outright. It's, it's, it's a third plus. And will you actually going to get my, would probably encourage them to want to fucking hate America more. Well, you wouldn't. Yeah, I got, no, don't probably that. I think that's probably a fair statement. Um, do I want them back out on the battlefield looking to kill us or our allies? Uh, no.

Speaker 1:          03:00:11       I think we, you know, but again, you know, what's the answer? What's the area we've got to close Gitmo and bring, you know, the 46 or so that we're never going to repatriate over to us soil. Who knows? I mean, as a president gets his way, I don't think he's going to get passed congress, but it, again, it's one of those things down, right? He wants to close it down and this is probably want to do with this 46 people that are being told is 91 there. But by the time you get to the ones that just aren't going to find at home, I mean, look, the Bishop Bush administration and the Obama Administration, we've spent years and years trying to find places for these people. It's not like anybody, you know, didn't want to try to get these people sent somewhere else. That's been a goal of, of this administration and the previous one and it just some folks who just aren't going to find another home. So there's about 45, 46 of them. And the idea of being, bring them back to the states, I guess,

Speaker 2:          03:01:00       how do they catch these people? And then it's all various different ways. Right, right,

Speaker 1:          03:01:04       right. And, and that, that was, I was old days. You don't, you don't, you don't hear us talking about catching a lot of people anymore. And part of the reason why it's because you'd rather just paint that target and, and blow the fuck out of him then risk your career, uh, picking up somebody and then getting accused of, of, you know, mishandling a detainee, um, or, or all the crap that can happen because suddenly they've decided, you know, a program for capturing somebody and bringing them back to go autonomo wherever is not appropriate. So what you've found over the years, recent past is it's a lot easier to just smoke them then to pick them up. I hate to say that. I mean that's a, that's a, that's a sad thing to say. But that's, and so what does that mean from an operationally efficient point of view?

Speaker 1:          03:01:47       That means your pipeline of potential intelligence is drying up because you're not, you're not picking these people up live. It's just easier to, to, to whack them. So it was a harsh reality. Well, it's, it's part of the way it's part of the way it works. Nobody wants to, everybody was getting their ass kicked for being, you know, involved in, uh, a, uh, approved program of whether it was rendition or the interrogation program or, you know, whatever as part of that or the periphery. And, you know, people look at the, the drone program and think, wow, that's really expanded under Obama. Well, no shit, because it's just, you know, just take 'em out

Speaker 2:          03:02:23       the heartburn. So that's why the drone program has expanded because capturing detainees, administration, administration wants more people to put in Guantanamo. Isn't that fucked up? That it's easier to kill someone politically, like to have civilian casualties and the civilian casualties are pretty fucking high with drones, right?

Speaker 1:          03:02:42       Well, uh, yeah, I mean this, again under the theory that nothing's going to be perfect. They try everything they can to limit that. But yeah, of course there've been civilian casualties, no doubt about that. But then it's something crazy like 80%. No, no, it's not that high. It's, it's, you could argue even once too high. Right. I mean it, but it's not, you know, again, once again, the same thing. Numbers get thrown out on one side. So it's not a, it's not zero. It's, we've had, we've had, uh, we've had unfortunate instance, there's no doubt about that. And like I said, one is too many, but at the same time, I guess my point being is the drone programs expanded, um, in part because it's perceived as a cleaner, which sounds awful. And it is awful because again, from an operational perspective, I'd rather have my hands on that detainee to know what they know. And once you smoke them, you're not going to know that shit. So what

Speaker 2:          03:03:34       if they come up with a way one day to actually, I mean, I know that they have something called f Mri, functional magnetic resonance imagery, I think it's called, where they've used it. I believe in India it was a real problematic case because they convicted someone for murder because they had functional knowledge of the crime and people who I talked to this neuroscientist who was, she was kind of an expert in Fmr I and she said that's a huge, there's a huge problem with them that would never fly in the United States because functional, functional knowledge of the crime could have been established through her interrogation process, through questioning, through asking her about the case. She could have functional knowledge of the crime scene. So like proving it through an Fmri she's like, is not, it doesn't work. So what they're convicting someone on is something that would never fly in America. But what if they could, if they could one day figure out a way

Speaker 1:          03:04:34       that one's like minority report or whatever that movie was with Val kilmer before he gained weight? No, I was Tom Cruise. Same Guy. Yeah. Yeah. They think it's the same one. We never seen him photograph together. You don't even notice that. It's like Yasser Arafat and Ringo Starr. I think you were in a movie together, man. They weren't top gun. Of course they weren't. But what am I talking about? I forgot. I was, I, I had my memory wiped clean by seeing a deicing fat val kilmer. Oh, well, uh, you know what I got to tell you this has been, I'm sure the viewers are tired of it, but I've had a great time.

Speaker 2:          03:05:08       Great. John to thank you very much for doing this. I really appreciate your, your candor and your openness and, you know, exploring some uncomfortable and difficult subjects and uh, and given us some inside information that it's very difficult for people to get any other way unless they're talking to a guy like you. It's a lot of it is speculation and, and bullshit and posturing and reading websites. It might be completely inaccurate. So I think you've, you've, you've helped us a lot.

Speaker 1:          03:05:33       Well, I really appreciate, I just encourage everybody, just read everything you can. Don't, don't settle on one source of information, right? I mean, that's the right and the left. Make that mistake again. You know, we're, we're, we're, we're getting to a point where it's pretty fucked up, right? We've got to find a way to get back to the center and get shit done. Otherwise, I don't know where we're heading, but anyway, that's, that's my last little bit, but this has been a great experience. Loved the show and, uh, really appreciate it. I'm going to check with you about my middle boys martial arts.

Speaker 2:          03:06:02       Yes, please do. Please do. I'll help you out. Thanks brother. Really appreciate it. Thanks. See you. Tomorrow. We'll be back with the Ian Mccall. We're going to preview this weekend's UFC and have some fun. See that bike?

Speaker 4:          03:06:19       Okay.
