I failed. Go ahead. But you did succeed in losing a ton of weight. I lost. I lost 35 pounds I think so I, I, I'm happy that at least I'm not as fat as I am. Just start. What if you look better before we do this? I will not better. What if you decide like, I like the new Burke. Maybe the new, it's new bird doesn't, doesn't right

I've worked so hard on that area. You worked on. What did you do? I just grew it out and I sculpted it all sculpted area vulnerability. How's it scope? But what I do is I, I went to a black barbershop and I told them that, that people might cut my beard. He taught them, I asked him, ask them,

I'll fill you on the podcast then to be going really hard. No, no. It looked good. So you're sculpting you. You're not entirely shaving it off. Tommy, talking to the microphone please. Soap Bar Tommy. Why we decided to go high. That's one of the yard as Amy Jo Jawline. Tommy, why have you decided sculpted and not completely shave it off? I see this is a guy where like I see so much potential and I just want it. I want it to maximize like, oh, where are you going to work? Your phone is exploding with text messages. While I'm holding this up, I could barely look at it because the screen keeps fill it up with he's giving you a Hitler son. Oh my God, this is so stupid. What's wrong with us? We're all adults.

Speaker 3:          10:41          He's got to fix it. It's not done. You know? That's what weird. We never really determined when he's done so Tom can make step back, look at it and decide to do some changes. Oh my God, he found the rash. Yeah, man. Sometimes we have rashes. Ladies and gentlemen, it's not your fault. I know you feel like you did something naughty, that the Lord punished you with a rash, but that's just superstitious

Speaker 1:          11:06          crashes. In fact, a really bacterial infections on the surface of your skin feels so weird. It's definitely better now are I recommend defense soap.

Can you imagine making out with me in the dark and you're like, what does that on the top it would be covered in the beard. What was that movie? Fucking break kingpin. Was that movie? Good source. Flirt with a girl and he goes, not you. Yeah, yeah. Oh Man. Remember when, uh, we had to have sex with his landlord and order to pay for the rent. Nothing like that to loosen up, but shit, throw it up into the toilet. You remember that? He, um, he has the planned like robbery with the guy and then, uh, sorry, my face in it.

Speaker 1:          12:22          Then he, uh, he throws hot coffee in that guy's face because he has to act like that. It wasn't a scam. You know, like, like the landlord comes and he's like, what? You're here and you just takes the hot coffee and splashing in the guy fucking screens for his life. Jesus Christ. This feels so weird, Huh? This looks so, I can only imagine. It feels weird. So I didn't know my face will be this close to my bones. Well do do you guys view, just don't do it like this, like this craziness, but just keep going healthy style, you know? I mean we've got to figure out a way to get you guys to not, I mean, let's be honest, if you're not, there's no way to do it. Like if you, if you, if you, if there is a target weight, you're going to dehydrate yourself, right? Yeah, of course you're going to, you never know. Very seldom does someone go, I'll get below that. You Post that picture of me, the dog to me right now we're going to get totally used to it, but I do suggest you keep the mustache. I think it's a wonderful accoutrement to your face. Okay. It helps you party man image and again you'll kill your curling champion from Saskatchewan.

Speaker 1:          13:30          It looks like a duck hunting guide is a totally different person. So wild to do head shots while you live at a guy who teaches people how to fly fish. The guy that knows the difference in a Mallard duck. Exactly. Less a diver duck. Totally different kind of meat. You look how you definitely don't live in your hometown and you got to Pennzoil Tattoo. I like this bond a mustache. How's it look good? He looks really good. Really? Yeah. You should see it closer. Let me see your Instagram. I do think there's something to be said for bringing back a mustache. There's a few people who do it and it's a strong look. No, it looks good. It looks like they're look stuff up there. Oh, uh Oh. I need to get my teeth cleaned. Jesus. This just looks sad. No. Oh, it looks actually, I guess it looks like a guy who lost a fuck ton of weight, just not to win a competition. A mustache.
