Speaker 2:          00:03:00       let's get the party roller Preston experience trace fast commercial day. I'm not fucking around cliffy be, I get to those pitches. I just hack 'em out. Cut to the chase, cut to the chase. You're a free man. Look at you and all right. You're a bad motherfucker. Dick Sling and video game controller and you're out there a free man. After 20 years of servitude, you worked for a epic games for a fuck load of time. I met you there. Jesus Christ was like five years old. It was a long time ago. You were a young lad running a big company like that I was having in my first marriage back then too. You got a different thing going on, but it's a good way if you're driving a Lamborghini or out of Raleigh, you first visited, it was a viper. Oh, that's right. And it was fucking terrifying.

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       Those are terrifying. Are you talk about like a poor Paul Walker and though the pores career, I mean that's car was squirrely, has held to like really fast in a straight line. Well those cars were super fun, those vipers. But the idea behind it was the most ridiculous thing ever. No anti lock brakes. Yup. No traction control 500 fucking horse by the earlier ones. And if you weren't careful getting out, you would burn your leg. Yeah. Oh that's a side pipe. And then to add insult to injury, the top of the car, if it was the convertible, you had to take an Allen wrench and unscrew the thing and then get a friend to help put, it wouldn't even fit in the boot of the car. You had to leave it at home. So I and I used to live five minutes from epic. I'd sit there on my second monitor and I have the WRL doppler hub and a storm was coming.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       I'd have to like drive the car home. Otherwise he'd be the Asshole Stop Layla Guru. Right. So stupid. You can't put the roof inside the car. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Dave Perry, he had one for awhile. We were big on the viper for some reason. And he told me the story, went to dinner with like some, some say gay executive and when he was a younger developer and a, he had the top off and this is Las and like Laguna and it can never fucking rains. Right. And uh, he said it's just started pouring and like he just walked home because he didn't want BV and have the embarrassment of driving the car or the SIG executive seeing him the next day. He could see he was starting to rust already. He traded the Fucker, ran as fast as he could before the waste actually hits. So somewhere out there, there's a guy who wound up with Dave Perry's Rusty Viper.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       It's probably worth a couple of bucks because of that. Really Dave Perry. But yeah, I mean it's a, I worked, I started working with them when I was 17 men and uh, I was, I was emotionally like 12. That's insane. Working for epic games. It's 17. How old were you when I met you? Uh, mid twenties, I think. Yeah. That was way before gears when you guys were just working on the tack of gears. Yeah. Come in with Dunkin. Was it Duncan? Trussell? I think it was Dunkin. You, you played a the trolley. Good night. Good Nights. Yeah. It was just there as a, what's his name? Joey Diaz fucking be asthma and uh, he's a, he's, he's good actually. And uh, we went to Jillian's and that was like downtown and downtown. Dude. The last time you visited Raleigh, even since when you visited then versus now. It's like night and day. Yeah. It's like a mini Austin now. Really? We have the hipster infection. We've got fucking

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       food trucks. See if he could do something about that. Dude will open. I opened a restaurant right there. Did you really? Yeah. With my partner. Is this a giant six foot eight Irish fucker? He used to bounce in Southie back before south. He got gentrified. How old is he? Uh, he's 43. Those guys don't last long. Yeah. Yeah. Six foot eight. Well, we're going to take one key man insurance. Yeah. You got to keep that guy. Yeah. He's a, he's a, he's a rock star though. He handled most of the day to day ops. He's been in the restaurant business 25 years. One of my best friends and uh, yeah, it's in a gentrifying neighborhood, Italian comfort food. It's called the station on person. We were just there. I'm about, I want to say like six or seven months ago, Duncan and I did a tour of North Carolina, which is where he's from.

Speaker 3:          00:06:38       We did that and we did the, the mountain joint. Yeah. Ashville, Ashville, which is amazing. Yeah. It's beautiful out there. But they hate the tourists. They do, but they do for a reason. Yeah. But the tourist bringing the money. That's true. But when you go to Asheville, my feeling, and I don't want to Romanticize it too much, cause I really liked doing that with some small towns. My feeling, it was like, oh my God, nobody knows about this. Like this place is like at the perfect level. Like the perfect amount of you can walk around and it's like very little. Like seediness. Even the homeless people were pretty polite. Yeah. Just a bunch of Weirdo. Even in downtown Raleigh, you get to know him. There's like, oh there's the guy with the bags. There's the guy with a cane who talked to everybody and the ad actually become like friendly and shit and they don't.

Speaker 3:          00:07:18       Instead, they didn't like San Francisco where they actually physically touch you fit. San Francisco is one of the worst spots ever. Fucking grab you man. It's just like, come on man, we're coming off the freeway of in the Uber on the way over and there's these three d hipster looking dudes playing music with a sign. You need gas money to get home and home. Of course they list is Portland and I'm like, you know, at least you're doing something for it. Singing for your supper. Right. Long drive me to come by. Rollie should even made a comment. Yeah, we couldn't. We had a young and I had to do, yeah, any time. And then we had a drive to Asheville the next morning, but it was really beautiful up there. It's really the mountain ash Asheville's beautiful. But it also has that like, feels like they took it like a kit for like a hamlet, like of a town to like put it together and it's like, oh, the mountain vibe to it.

Speaker 3:          00:08:03       Like this Bavarian thing going on. Yeah, it does. Right. It's got this weird sort of, it's just interesting. What did you drive down the slopes where they were reminded to be careful with your brakes and there's like runoffs for trucks and everything going down the hills. Yeah. He has some serious fucking hill. You gotta be careful with that chat is the mountains especially in the wintertime, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's beautiful out there. It's fucking incredible. Unbelievably gorgeous. Like as we were driving up those hills, it's like, wow dude, I love it out there. You know, and I've said this a million times, the west coats is fucking fantastic. The problem is the word got out, you know? And if I get around to starting a new game studio, I pay a programmer of 75 80 grand in Raleigh, the he or she can live like a king, great house, a great schools. The downtown's just growing exponentially. And it's just a, you know, it has certain political issues that have been in the news lately. Get her done that, uh, that those assholes all be voted out. But I don't want to get into too much of that. It's too early for this bad stuff going on there. Just, you know, GOP has got

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       lost their fucking mind, like GOP making, trying to shut down all the abortion clinics and all this crazy sure. Old dudes now that's the problem. Or an old white men are currently terrified young men with balls become libertarians and only the ones who are trying to hide from the gay become Republicans. So you've got this weird thing where you got old dudes and young guys that are gay trying to pretend they're not well and that's when you were pressed something that much. It bounces back five times. People right now fucking screaming. Good. I told you this fucking cock suckers. A liberal dude. Our fucking marriage has been in shambles since they legalized gay marriage. It's just been horrible for us. Legalizing gay marriage fight. I said to stop watching gay porn because I felt too insecure about my abs. Smart. You should be careful. Really ruin your mind.

Speaker 2:          00:09:40       It's like doing acid one too many times, you know that's out there. You know those abs are out there and you look at yourself when you go to the bathroom, you're like, Shit. The point where I'm in the car and suddenly like I start feeling this little like Mirabelle right around here. What are the abs you speak of? I know to some crossfit or something. The idea. Do you have, what's your workout routine? Do you do crossfit? I do kettle bells. No, no. I don't go to a crossfit gym. Fucking coffee to me. Yes. Very called to it. Like my best friends into it. Not One of the reasons I love him is because he doesn't talk about it all the fucking time. I think it's culty, but it's, it seems to me to be a good thing to be culty about if you're going to be called [inaudible] health.

Speaker 2:          00:10:20       Those people like really motivated. I met a lot of them. I've never met any of them that espouse weird culty shit. It's all just a fitness culty. I had a friend of mine, dear friend, but she's got hardcore into it and she's like showing us how shredded her hands are is like a badge. I'm like, that's not the practice. Yeah, I saw some, there's some photo shoot that some woman did who's like, I guess she's a NASCAR mechanic or something. That's Chris. That's Christmas Abbott. That's the girl I've known her. I like, I know her. She lives in Raleigh and she didn't want, you were talking about Tanya was as my friend used to work. She works at epic right now about to have a baby actually and a great girl. But um, she got so hard corner crossfit and she was just was like, no, you can't wear gloves.

Speaker 2:          00:10:59       You have to suffer for your work. Yeah. There was a video of the fucking crossfit founder or one of them, uh, doing these kipping pull ups. Like, he's one of the head crossfit guys and he's just mangles his hands and he's like proud that his hands are like cut open from all half the crossfit videos. You look up a Christmas girls in it. She's totally cool and she's like a local celebrity and she's like the first female to do a NASCAR pit, I believe. A fucking body. That shit's ridiculous. She's she shredded and you wouldn't know it when you meet her like, like she's like a whole celebrity in that whole scene. Like she's totally chill and cool. You mean in the crossfit seen? Yeah. Yeah. Well I found out about her on, I think on mixed martial arts.com there was a website about a thread on the message board rather about her and I'm like, yeah, that's a weird thing. But that really strong muscular, pretty girl like that. That's so you know, if you've got to do is or any of that. That's my thing about tattoos also. Right? Like if you're going to do it, do it. Like go on out. Right. Like

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       I say, I have a star on my butt for my mom. You know, I'm just like all the way, right? Mom, you always [inaudible]. I mean, I got an [inaudible] state symbol, my butt and that's my thing. I just got two shitty ones that I got when I was like 20 something and they're flash and they weren't even custom designed and like, do I regret it? You know, we were sitting, I was visiting with, uh, my wife's family in Florida this summer and uh, Destin, the old fun in La trip. Right. And it was cool. It was fun. But, uh, Lawrence baby sister is 19 and she's just getting into dragons now. And I'm like, and she looks at this Tattoo, this Shitty Dragon Tattoo. I have my shoulder. And she's like, did you just get that? And I'm like, look at it. You know, it's like the old sailor anchor.

Speaker 3:          00:12:28       It's like bleeding. What is it? Let me say it, a dragon date. It's just like, yeah, this is just all elaborate trick to get he beat to take your shirt off. It's cute little gut. Two cute little dragon. Yeah. But I, I was bold 19 year old and I'm like, lacy, I like dragons. Before it was cool, like, oh, you know, she was wounded. When was it cool to like dragons now it's cool. But it was always cool to like track and just isn't dragons driving has been around admitting when I grew up that if I was a dork and the dragons and things like that dude, it was not cool for the cool kids. Yeah. Well when I was in high school, I remember someone was like shitting on me because I read the Lord of the Rings, you know, it was into the hobbit books.

Speaker 3:          00:13:09       I'm like, that's my, that's my point. Exactly. So it's cool to be nerdy, right? Yeah. When did that change? Uh, about eight years ago. Video Games. Why? What made it change? Uh, video games. But you think it's a cultural thing? It's like Big Bang theory, right? Like if you get, like I tell people like, yeah, I gotta go to comic con next week. And everybody's like, I'm so fucking envious of that. And I'm like, okay. And like if you ever read a comic, like do you know who half these people are and a bump me out this year. Have you ever gone? No, we may. We saying the guy is saying he's envious is just rather no, he actually isn't actually, people actually really want to go to comicon because I mean it's not just comics, it's video games. It's pop culture. In one minute you'll see like John Fev Rhogam we'll go walking by then there's like a person dressed up as Princess Leia.

Speaker 3:          00:13:53       That sounds like two things. I want to avoid that stations you want to stay here. But Joe, Joe, the thing is it's like, just get John Hopper players. Dude. Just kidding. The cost players are fucking amazing these days. Like the amount of word they, there's, there are girls and guys who spent all year working on an outfit and then just show up and they let go like dry from like Boise and sleep in their friend's floor and ocean side. I've been there. I'm not in the actual event itself. I went, we were there, uh, doing shows that I'm a American comedy company. Yeah. And I just was down there for the fun of it, but we had to cut out early. Just fucking a lot of fucking people, man. It's, it's, it's madness. It's still is just getting a hotel room, getting a ticket. You have to have a good connection through like Warner brothers or something like that. And we were only able to be there. I mean, I love it. I fucking live for it every year. It's like everything I love in one place and it's just very sweaty. And uh, we um, had to leave early cause my wife's, uh, uh, one of her bridesmaids was actually getting married back in Louisiana. She's from New Orleans, so I was like, damn it, I had to miss out because you know, you go to like the entertainment weekly party there and it feels like prom.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       It's just so many cool. There's this whole like Josh Sweden circle of people like Nate filling in and all of them that just are who these people are used to be. Go from firefly and serenity man and like Buffy and all that. Right. You know the firefly and serenity. What does that, what does that, what the fuck are you talking about? It's like you're not speaking my language. This is only 24 hours in the day you wear this. How would you even know about these things? Why would you allow him to answer? It's your memory to the point where you think that another grown man would know what the fuck you're talking about. Shitting on Scifi classics right now. Firefly and serenity. I'm like what dude? Watch them trust. No, I've heard serenities Badass. Yes. Ready? He's fantastic. But most people are not going to know what the fuck you're talking about was my point.

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       I actually no, I went to the, the like my Scifi show. Was it the uh, they were at the premiere. I like a lot of the guys, they played clips. It's really great stuff, but most people are not gonna know what the fuck you're talking about. Oh, fair enough. You fucking, you guys are so deep and I've heard a Buffy. Well, I've, I have a whole like there's like a 10 year rule where you, anything that was like cool 10 years ago you can reintroduce it and then people act like it's new. Like zombies, vampires, people like, like things like if you go back to like Buffy the vampire slayer, who the fuck would have thought that would become like as huge TV show and why didn't they use the same Buffy magic buff? These agent fucked up that deals Kristy Swanson. Right? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:16:13       She's not as Buffy as she used to be. I think it was probably the reason, you know, they really look at Luke Perry who's also in any, that'd be creepy if you had Luke Perry and that TV show. Luke Perry was it a TV show because his hair's not as straight anymore. It's kind of wick to the side. Like a classic thing of 30 year olds is high school students. Yeah. That way we do like the dude's hairlines like worst thing fucking nick Cage's and he's playing a high school kid that don't buy it and he wasn't like a Tom Cruise 30 either. Tom Cruise at 30, looks like Tom Cruise at 20 minutes. Very similar to Tom Cruise at 40, which is very fucking similar to Tom Cruise at 50. Now. It's a big difference. This isn't vampirism going on there or something like Cindy Crawford. She was hot as fuck. She was dude, it said Luke, that's that nineties look.

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       Yeah, that's right. He was in Buffy the vampire slayer. Yeah. That was not the vision that Josh's originally wanted. The studio of fucking total in the director totally changed what he wanted to do. That's why he went on to do Buffy as the show, which wound up being like this cold classic. Really like what it, what was the difference between what he wanted to do and what they want. They want to do it campy and uh, the name like Buffy the vampire slayer, he went into being cheesy and campy. Right. And so for the show, the whole point of the show was that was demons and vampires as a metaphor for high school shit that people go through. Right. She finally sleeps with their, her to crush angel and he turns into a giant asshole. You know what someone needs to do, man, La Femme, Nikita style realistic, Buffy the vampire slayer like Buffy fucking up like those 30 days of night type vampires like something really scary, something freaky and scary instead of this, you know, true blood.

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       It's like, it's like the high concept ones, which are really good. Like the idea of like a really hot chick who slaves vampires. I got a buddy of mine's concept, but he means doing a comic book. Uh, you know the whole Zombie thing, right? He's fine. I think what I think is the last take you could possibly have on zombies, it's comic, but call the other dead. And uh, it's Josh or Taylor who wrote gears two and he's doing it with a Kevin Eastman who was one of the teenage mutant Ninja turtle guys. And the idea is the Zombie apocalypse hits, but it's just the animals that get infected. Hmm. So it was a Zombie animals everywhere. The picture, any, any animal you want everything from like a fucking alligator through like a honey badger, like anything. It's just when, when I was talking about Buffy, I think that people take concepts like that and they're like, well, we know how to do this.

Speaker 2:          00:18:23       You know, let's do this. Let's just like the rest of these shitty fucking movies that are basically the same. Do them exactly the same. It should win in the end. No twists, nothing. Nothing's going to pull you out of the art form itself. So you guys are talking about black fish recently? Yeah. Fucking dude. Depressing. Very depressing. Yeah. They were saying about the captivities like, you know the F is at her now. She still looks fucking hot as fuck. It's Kristy Swanson. Now wonder what happened, man. What kind of a disagreement there was where they didn't use her as Buffy. You never know. Right? Like Twitter. Maybe you could've been that she was like too much of a woman and they wanted someone who looked like a high school girl because it's Buffy is supposed to be in high school. Yeah. That's so ridiculous. Sarah. Michelle Gellar is not high school. I could fat how? How many years did they do that though? I thought you were going off for it. I think six or seven seasons. I haven't watched it all out and they must've been like, damn, we've got to get this pitch out of high school. I tried it. They did at some point. Yeah. Fuck, she's married.

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       She's verified though. How many followers does she have? 12,000 isn't that weird? Like in how they get verified, these publicists, the publicists getting a black eye. We got verified because my agent has a buddy who's over at Twitter. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's something. It's that simple, dude. I've had three publicists try, but I keep on getting denied number of people that hate you at Wikipedia. I really think I fucked somebody. Ex girlfriend or a girl, current girlfriend or someone just listens to the podcast and want to kill you. Fucking, it's really that simple. Some guys like don't soil Joe Rogan's podcast and like, what the fuck does that mean? Because like drop prowl and take a dump on the table. Soil. It could you do possibly soylent. What ideas did they have in their fucking BD minds? Talk about RSS feeds. Dude, I gotta fucking abusive relationship with the walking dead.

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       Speaking is, I'm over it. I'm feeling good abused boyfriend. Did you ever read the book side of them yelling at me? No, I didn't. The comics were stacking, told me they were amazing. What happened was, uh, when frank Darabont left it, like the, the, it just started getting wildly uneven. Oh, he left. Yeah. Frigidaire. But, uh, there was a controversy over the direction or money. I don't remember what it was, but it had that great of Buffy Frank Darabont vibe to it at the beginning, you know, with Green Mile Shawshank and at that heart to it. And he's in the mist was actually a really underrated movie. It was spectacular for awhile. And, uh, it just, you know, this last ending though, I mean, I don't want to give away any spoilers for anybody, but I felt like an abused boyfriend. There was a whole, there's a whole relationship in the books between me, Sean and the governor that was fucking amazing that they barely scratch the surface of, I think she, uh, in the comic books, she nailed the governor's

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       nuts to the floor at one point. If I recall, like it was some pretty hardcore shit and cut. He can get away with that in a comic book, put it down on a TV show and you're going to get people protest. Here's the thing, man, the amount of like you see World War Z. Yes. I didn't like it. I just wasn't a fan of it. I liked it. I didn't love it. I liked it. The problem is, is they get to the point where the budget is so fucking huge. They got a paper ad pitch. He's probably getting points in the back end. So they had that, that line where it's gotta be PG 13, they can't make it are so the Gore on the walking dead is 10 times gorier Nastier than you would be in the PG 13 movie. The Gore, the walking dead though.

Speaker 3:          00:21:19       I really have issues with, I have issues with how easy knives go into heads first. Like butter knives go right through foreheads like nothing to four. It is a fucking tough bone. Try stabbing someone in the forehead with a big knife. Yeah, that shit is not easy to get a try to get a knife through some bone. Just from personal experience. That would be so gross TV show if you actually, it was like, like it was just like extended scenes of trying to put nice things like the stabbing scene in saving private Ryan. Show me with a cadaver that you could stick a fucking knife through its head. That easy. That's ridiculous. You can't do that. That's fucking hard to do. Well that's the favorite Internet mean was who's willing. The lawn and the walking dead like all the, all the grass is cut it about their faces.

Speaker 3:          00:21:58       They look beautiful. The girls always have the same length hair. No one ever cuts their hair. They all have like a subtle hint of makeup on all. It would take us one good shot of a hairy leg. On a girl to just be like, sold, sweat the details. Yeah. There's no hairy legs. This one abused me this last, this last episode. I see what they're doing. I was like, yeah, you know what, man, you're just fucking with me here. This isn't necessarily that good. It's just, dude, this shows just drag on to drag on breaking bad, which ended it fucking perfectly. It's hard. It's hard to fucking keep a show like that going on. I'm sure you need a defiant, creative visionary. Like somebody who's going to put their foot down and say, here's what we're fucking doing. Sound like you're pitching cliffy be dude.

Speaker 3:          00:22:35       Cliffy bees ready to step in and take over the walking. What you need. A defiant visionary. What you need. Look at a guy like the guy like Ken Levine who makes bioshock infinite. Right? He's stuck him. Yeah. He's stubborn as fuck. It's so let me, let me pitch this to you. Okay. Uh, it's an alternate universe that they can't think. It's like 1930, where this guy made a giant floating city called Columbia. And, uh, it was basically a bunch of tea party evangelists went off into the sky and created the utopia that eventually turns into a dystopia. And you go there to find a girl who can create a rift between dimensions and there's a robotic George Washington. That sounds pretty dope, dude. It's fucking with it. And it sounds pretty, the ending is like twilight zone, unworthy, like, and that's really, yeah. One thing we've been doing like late at night in the wee hours in the mornings, I get up at noon every fucking day as we put it in the old, the Blu blu rays at the twilight zones.

Speaker 3:          00:23:20       Oh, I love them. And we're burning through every single one and they're fucking fantastic around SkyFii like almost every night. And it's like, it's like, it's like Shawshank redemption once it's on, you got to go the distance. You got to watch the whole thing. I watched the um, uh, the William Shatner one the other day, man, the man on the plane. Oh my God, it was so good. So fun to watch. And then a w, w the one with the, uh, there's one where the astronauts crash land on an alien planet. They land there and they find tiny little people. And then this guy becomes like a God, Oh shit, you got that. I got it before it becomes like a god to them. And then at the end of it, it turns out there's another species that's like as big to us as he was to the little people.

Speaker 3:          00:23:58       And then he gets essentially squished and they just in rod sterling man, the intro is just slice. Like they might have like, you know, zooming over to him and he's like always smoking. He's like, you know, sitting in a wing, back chair in front of a fucking fireplace. Imagine if you will. Well, he was so original to, when you stop and think about it, there really hadn't been anything like that. And he was tapping, he's tapping into lake, you know, key Scifi writers of the time. Right. Just so much good shit. What was that? I think your laptop says laptop. Okay. Um, making sure that, but just, you know, the effects, you know, they knew what they could show and they knew what they couldn't. So it's very light and affects the characterization, the sets. Sometimes you can tell it's the same like diner. They've repurposed 15 different times for the different episodes separately.

Speaker 3:          00:24:42       Brian one the other one would William tractor where uh, there was like the little thing that told the future which one was a, there was like the little machine that tells the future. Like, you know, you ask a question. Yeah. That was fucking brilliant. Yeah. That you just had footage of a bioshock infinite. It's downloadable content. Another one I watched recently was the one with um, the uh, the puppet that was running the show and they were robbing people and the puppet was doing all the robbing. It doesn't ring a bell. Yeah. It was like a, an uh, the little kid knew that the puppet was, that the puppet was actually real and the little kid was like, and on the old man who is, this is the puppet set them up. We were watched. The one with the Trans dimensional hole in the wall, the little girl goes through.

Speaker 3:          00:25:24       So you go back and rewatch all of those in so many movies. Just took the same idea and updated it. Like there's the one with the guy can hear people's thoughts and that's what women want the Mel Gibson movie. Right. Well that was cool. What was that guy that you just showed Brian? That guy's face? Yeah. This is from that bio shock. What was the, go back to that as a scene with that guy's face. The graphics or be there that guy. So Sandra Cohen, eyes wide shut. This is amazing. It's a, it's a, it's actually a Zit on they put on PC. I don't remember. I played on console. I don't know. Yeah, I played the DLC on PC cause yeah, he's the only the only games you would ever play over a PC. First person shooters. Right. Joe? Me. Yeah. I only played online too.

Speaker 3:          00:26:01       I wouldn't play against the game. I get bored too. These, yeah. Well that's, you know, every time I go to event human there, that's boxhead. Some guy comes up to me and he's like, Yo man, it's all about the multiplayer. And I'm like, there it is all about the multiplayer. This is the game that I would highly recommend if you want to play on a computer instead of a console. Oh, this looks amazing. It's one of the best games ever created. This looks so good. And does this available for Mac to Yep. I think so. This will waste my day. Yeah. This looks fun. Shit man. It's really beautiful. Sky Hooks and shit. Yeah. See the good thing about that is I won't really get me addicted because it's not online. Yeah. If it was online, do they play multiplayer? I think so. No. Oh Dude, look at these zombies.

Speaker 3:          00:26:41       Bad Ass. Yeah. The idea is that they're uh, their kids creepy and there's a whole dirty, there's a whole, well, you can go now with the dude. It's brilliant. Wow. Is there so much creativity involved in video games these days? I had a chance a few years ago, uh, to bring Josh Sweden over to e three, and he walked out of there. He said, I did 15 minutes. I just saw more creativity than I've seen in Hollywood and years. Yeah. Like when, you know, like when halflife came out, I remember thinking really clearly, why can't someone make a movie like this? Like, why is the, why? How come the video game gets to be so cool? Like, can't these same guys figured out how to write a movie? Well, what's gonna happen now is, you know, with the advent of Youtube and people being able to create their own content, you know, people can do that and they can put it up online and it could become an online sensation.

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       Right. That sound Neill. BLOMKAMP got to start. He did these shorts that he put on Youtube. It's like lost in, uh, those, the one about the robot and Africa, I believe. And then he wound up doing a Elise IOM and district nine, no shit. Yeah, that's how I got founded. Wow. That makes sense. And uh, he can see his style. He was going to do the halo movie at one point. But so much of creativity is just finding an outlet for it. And when you're talking about something specific about making a film or making a television show, it's so hard to get to that outlet. It's so hard to get to the point where any of your ideas can actually be seen by people. You have the torque of it being, making the art that you want versus it being commercial products and we'll itself, well not only that, actually getting it to that point, like if you want to be a director, Jesus Christ, good fucking luck.

Speaker 3:          00:28:07       Good luck in getting to direct a major motion picture. Like that's a long ass road. Look, you've got to figure out, you got to prove yourself to a lot of people along the way. It's very difficult, especially if they're gonna Trust, you know, 50 a hundred $200 million. Now when you add in marketing costs, I mean the thing about the gaming industry right now matter and it's like it's fundamentally broken for the consoles because what you have is a disk based game that then can only come out at $60 and then people traded in or they just rent it and then the marketing budgets are trying to out weigh each other. So you know, a hundred million dollar marketing budgets so you can get on, you know, NBA commercials or football commercials or Superbowl ads, Jesus. And then he said so much money and they annualize it, right?

Speaker 3:          00:28:43       And then, you know, I'm walking around to e three this year and there's some fantastic looking games where I'm like, that's probably not going to make money. That'll barely break even. They'll make money on the SQL with to finally start making money when the annualized. Whereas A, I'm a fan of the other way, just like developing your, your community while you develop your game. You know, you have new concept. I put it up in sub reddit and see what people say, you know, when you had, and you need, you know, release a Beta release in Alpha, you know, let people let people buy items before you can even play the game. You heard about that. Uh, Chris Roberts, a star citizen game, no. Guided a Kickstarter raise 2.5 million. And then he has the ability to essentially buy space ships for your, it's like a dog fighting Sim.

Speaker 3:          00:29:19       Like got Luke Skywalker Shit. Right. And you can basically buy your shifts in your fleet and walk around in your hangar and sit in your ship. You can't even fly it yet. And they've raised $30 million so far. And crowdfunding of course they have. Yeah. And it's like, it's also the whole thing's genius and he's the guy made wing commander. And I think that, you know, my whole 10 year rule is like, you know, the space sims where your dog fighting everything like spaces cooler than ever right now. And one of the cool things about, um, uh, about quake

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       when I was playing quake online all the time. So they always put demos out. There was always like a new game that was coming out in the demos would be released first and everyone downloaded them for free and everyone got online. And then once the game came out it was like that may more people wanted to buy the game. What they've done. Well the problem is just getting a game out takes so much work that like right now, uh, you know, I was talking to a, I believe that's not public knowledge. I can admit that. Um, basically if you're releasing it, it's friends. I don't want to betray, you don't want to betray their competence, but let's call him Santa Claus. In Rudolph, you want to have a Beta Santa Claus. Tell Rudolph, uh, an upcoming online shooter, you want to have a Beta before the game comes out. Cause if your game's fucked it launch, it takes you two months to fix that.

Speaker 2:          00:30:19       Going through Sony or Microsoft. And by that time everybody's treated your gaming and they're onto the next call of duty. Like you have to get it right the first time. I think we're going to get to a time in our lifetime where someone's going to be able to make a game like this at home on their PC by themselves. Well, they, uh, at the spike VG x that they announced the game called a no man's sky, which I'm like, that's kind of a cool name, but I'm going to totally mispronounce it as no man's guy. Shitty double o seven movie. Oh yeah. Like a led Zeppelin song or something.

Speaker 2:          00:30:49       It's a space theme that's procedurally generated and, uh, four guys. What does it mean? It means basically every world is different. It's all just done by code. Uh, yeah. Here we go. Look at this shit. Every hour dudes doing this and they gotta be working. The Guy said for his previous game, he mortgaged his house for it. That's how much they care. I Bet I could sell them at a raw. So basically you, you do is you go from, you use exploring this planet. He's underwater. He comes out of the water, it goes into the forest, hops in his spaceship. It goes, flies all the way back out of the atmosphere into space. Dog fights with people through asteroids. Wow. And four guys made this. Yeah. I don't know if it's all guys, but for people. For humans. Yeah, let's call them. Hey guys, like you would say that even if it was girls, right.

Speaker 2:          00:31:29       Be Allowed to do that still it's, so this is all just taking that from us. Cliffy being shitty to say guys in a room of mixed company. Well, I had tweeted a no man's sky wins the title for most misogynistic game title sarcastically. No Man's sky of it's funny. And people like, actually wouldn't it be feminists because there's no men. I'm like, retweet what? Then there's, there's people Uber on the way over here and people tweeting me like your fucking duty too. I'm like, sarcasm does not translate well on the Internet with these kids sometimes. Well with some of them, the problem is it's just so many of them out there dealing with millions of people bound to hit a few retards going now to 15 now you're at a million plus now, right? Yeah. Do you see even read your ad still? Yeah, I read them.

Speaker 2:          00:32:09       Yeah. I mean I can't read all of them. It's not possible. It can't respond. I don't have enough time, but they just want to know you're reading or replying to some of them. I try to retweet interesting stuff and then that way I think it's been a really positive exchange for me too for, I've gotten a lot out of being connected to people on Twitter because they're always sending me interesting articles and ideas and knowing that I'll retweet them. You've trained them well. It's, it's like it's a cool thing to do. You know people like being retweeted, it helps them get more followers and if you're a guy that he regularly posts cool shit, you can become like a portal to information.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Yeah, it has a bunch of guys that have follow on Twitter that are just regular folks would regular jobs. They just like cool shit and they find your articles and they tweet them and then you retweet them. And so we go back and forth like all the time, especially with technological advancements and essay stuff, all that stuff going on right now. It's like, I don't want to put my tin foil hat on, but, um, the more I hear and the more comes out, I'm like, fuck, really? Then Nsa Shit, I'm, I'm just trying to dwell on that as little as possible because it's so negative and it feels so helpless and it's just such a weird thing. The idea that we're like about to relinquish all of our privacy to other individuals that are no different than you or I, they're, they're just fucking people and just because they're in some form of government and they're trying to, you know, keep quote unquote us safe.

Speaker 1:          00:33:21       How about we examine all your actions that you're doing, that you are doing to keep us safe before we let you access our email? Oh, you've been accessing our email for a decade. I was working on a uh, uh, a game in epic that was canceled, but I was a, I don't want to, I'm still under NDA with them but I don't want to get it too much. That's a nondisclosure agreement. Some of the things we were googling I know is sitting off a light in the NSA cause you know like as far as far as like a revolution and terrorism and things like that. And it's just, you know, like some sort of red flag was going off and it's a post Patriot Act man. Yeah. It's pumping a bunch of fucking paranoid people for sure. I mean if you really stop and think about how few actual terrorist activity you see in America and how many fucking people are in America, they've done a great job in that respect.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       Well that's the difference also between a perception fear like you know, people, people tell me fly safe. I'm like fuck off, drive safe. But it isn't when you stop and think about it. I mean, and I'm not advocating in any way, shape or form that anybody should have access to any of your emails. Cause I think that's a really ineffective, shitty bullshit way of trying to protect people because by removing all of their privacy, I think that's a bullshit way to handle it. But if you look at what the job they have done, if the really is a bunch of terrorist activity all over the world, they've done an amazing job of keeping shit from happen in America. I think it's not a black or white case. I think there's good and bad on both sides. The problem is just a fucking human nature problem and she can't have ultimate power.

Speaker 1:          00:34:45       You can't have it. Whoever. Yeah. There was an article I believe where they're talking about easing people's pornographic habits to shame them for political reasons. If they need and they were spying on world of Warcraft players, come on, you fucks. Unbelievable. This just came out today. Well, the other problem is people are willing to give up so much of it. They're doing it because they're being tricked. I mean that's like saying someone's, you know, willing to suck your Dick for cocaine and they don't even know it's aspirin. I mean, it's like you're thinking you're getting some cocaine and you're getting an aspirin. You're like, God, what the fuck happened? You're not really getting anybody to save you and I really good. You're going to die anyway. We're all gonna die. We're gonna die in car accidents. We're going to die of cancer. We're going to die of being old.

Speaker 1:          00:35:24       It's just, it's going to happen. You're getting on dialysis on me. It's going to fucking happen. What's the point? The idea that you know you're going to protect all these people from dying because you're going to stop terrorist activity, and the way to do that is to remove all freedom. You start, you'll okay is happy about this life. If this life is living scared and living where you're being watched every step by random people who's going to profit with everything, follow the chain of the profit by that, that all should be illegal. You shouldn't be able to profit by any protections like private prisons and all that to keeping people alive and healthy shouldn't be able to profit over that. Policing every, everything should be nonprofit. The idea that they have a giant budget and these people get to make big salaries, make donations to charities, like do your homework with, with how much of the money actually goes to the cause versus quote raising awareness versus, and what the CEO of the nonprofit makes all of that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:15       Like the reddit listed out of list of a bunch of them at one point like the, that goodwill is basically like just selling all your clothes for money and things like that. Just like crazy. This is a bunch of shit that gets done in this country that should get done by paypal. Like paypal donations. Like that's what the presidency, that's what the government should get. Like paypal donations. We think a good job. We'll give you a nice tip and then that's how you keep the society running. And the only way you ever get paid is if people like what you're doing and they choose to donate and they donate what they can and we make it like, you know, everybody's proud. Just like people are proud to serve in the military. People were proud to donate to the, to the government. Yup. Donates not steal all my money at Fox and I say support the troops because if you get my assets and getting shot at, but yes, absolutely.

Speaker 1:          00:36:59       But if you think about like the idea of donating to the government, it's actually probably a pretty good idea because you would only want to donate to things that you believed in. You would only want to donate to things that you've felt actually fit for the good of the people. So the people in the community would decide like what's good and what's bad and that's how things would get voted on at Kickstarter like right. Yeah. It's just, I think this is probably a stupid idea because it's too much shit. I did, I mention to people will say like the 1% we control everything cause they donate the most money for their field. Whatever their interests are of course is, which is basically what it, what's going on right now. We'd have to keep corporations from doing it. Only make individuals do it. You know, the problem is it's like, it's almost like a game where you start off and it's already a thousand to zero.

Speaker 1:          00:37:40       You're never going to catch up. The game is five minutes long, you're never going to catch up. You started off with this massive deficit. Yep. And if you grow up in the United States and you're trying to do anything where you're, you're trying to govern people or control wealth or you know, the amount of fucking momentum that's already been put in the other direction is so crazy. [inaudible] my own personal success. Back to the fact that my family was middle class, my dad bad dad worked for Polaroid and the fact that they had an extra like two grand to buy an apple too, like that was the jump off point right there. And I took to that thing like a fish to water. It was originally supposed to be for my brother and uh, I just steal it. No, I just started using it and he wasn't using it. He was too busy. He's too busy chasing pussy at the time. Pouch Kabob bow. I actually found it. SB nation.com and like a polygon and all that, you know, he's uh, he's done well in his own right. But anyway, that's not the point. So you got into that just from one purchase that your parents were able to like I to take my brother's eight

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       track and pretend it was a computer because I want her computer so fucking bad listening into like fucking hall and Oates and all that. She used to pretend it was a computer. Yeah. That's hilarious. Yeah. You like eve had a pull towards computers. I've, I've had a technology boner since I was a kid. I love technology. What did, do you have a background in any educational background? I went to cal poly Pomona for six months and I dropped out cause I dropped out. I hated it. I dropped out. Uh, when Jazz Jack Rabbit started making enough money, that's the first successful game I did. It got me my first car, which was a 99 red Saturn. Uh, I got my first apartment over outside Pomona and uh, basically also also my mum wouldn't run the air conditioning. We were over in Laverne and it'd be like summer, like 120 degree.

Speaker 3:          00:39:15       She's like, she'd be like open and went out cliff. And I'm like, it's like opening a fucking oven. Like it's not doing anything. God, that's hot as fuck. Yeah. Now when you, when you get into it as a video game designer, right? Do you, what account type technological knowledge do you have to have? Do you just have id? And they said like, this is how I'd like to gain to play. This was what I would like to happen. You start off with verbs. Like what, what are the verbs that you're doing this game? Are you kicking, punching, fighting, exploring, right? Like figure out what type of thing you're going to make. And for me, uh, you know, I've always, guns are easy and that's why everything I've ever made pretty much has a gun in it. You know, if I get back to making games, I'm not gonna make like a polar bear fighting simulator.

Speaker 3:          00:39:49       It's a very boring, when you have a video game, you can't shoot somebody else. It's our way of interacting. It's, it's touching, right? And as much as the baddies are coming, shooting people in the face at 60 frames a second through iron sights will always be fun at the end of, and especially when it's somebody like who's like your friend or you know, online, a random person. Right. Yeah. But it was, I was just attracted to it, man. I just, I made my first game and a little adventure game when I was 11 and, uh, just, you know, started cranking. All the kids were partying in high school. I was sitting at home and working on games. Yeah. Yeah. 20th high school reunion recently, by the way. Wow. What was that like? It was, you know, I didn't know what to expect going into it, but everyone was really fucking cool.

Speaker 3:          00:40:26       Oh, that's nice. You know, and like, I'm not mark Zuckerberg, but some of them were making little comments and jokes like, and I'm like, look guys, I mean, I did okay, but I didn't fly her in a fucking private jet. Calm down. Did you get a involved? But you need to get marijuana in your life. I was in Boston. I remember I'm from Boston. Yeah, that's a harsh place. I was a sub the suburbs. It's north Andover. It's super cute up there. What were you saying? Did you get an Oculus rift? Yeah, I'm actually an investor in it. Oh really? Yeah. I'm going out there and Wednesday to see the, apparently they have some really good breakthroughs they've gotten, did you see the jerk off breakthrough? No. They have oculus rift attached to a jerk off machines with the guys. Like the Japanese guy was like, he's in it right there.

Speaker 3:          00:41:03       Yeah, they don't, they don't want to talk too much about the whole porn thing. How dare they, how dare they not know the truth. Horn drives technology is, you know, that's really gonna drive technology because everybody sees the writing on the wall. We were talking about it a little bit before we got online here was, uh, did you see Don John, Don John? Yeah. It's the, um, what's so what's his name from uh, Joseph Gordon leave it wrote and directed it. Scarlet Johannson. It's about the, oh no I didn't. I know it's a great movie and it's really fun. Well, his whole thing is like, he's basically addicted to online porn and like he finally beds the character scar Johanson who's gorgeous and immediately goes out to his laptop to run one out and it starts off like his laptop booting up sound. He's like, just the sound of that makes my cock rock hard.

Speaker 3:          00:41:44       And he's going on about all the people he likes and everything. And I read, there was a story I read online, it was talking about real life, dawn John's guys who've become so addicted to like how good modern pornography is that they get ed and they can't get it up. And so what happens is there's the younger generation of young dudes, because apparently the each we start looking forward is 10. That's when you start looking at the average, the average young dude right now in, but girls, and I don't know actually they didn't mention girls too much. Um, they, maybe they start reading 50 shades of gray to get an early age or flowers in the attic. 50 shades of grey is more for a gal who's been working for 10 years and has kind of given up on excitement. Yeah. My wife read it.

Speaker 3:          00:42:16       She said it was just kind of dumb. It's supposed to be pretty stupid. Yeah. And I'm just talking shit. I don't know. Well so back to the whole, the porn thing is that a, and so they found that like the older generation guys from their thirties who have that problem with, with Ed from too much porn, like they can, they can bounce back in a couple of months, but the kids take so long. And the reason why is like when we were young, we'd have to find our brothers hustler underneath their bed or whatever. Right. We, we had like, you know, analog porn right now on your phone. You could just watch like super slow Mo, whatever, the most filthy shit imaginable pursuing my phone. Look at that screen. You sexy bitch. Fucking huge. It's either a really small Joe Rogan, a really big phone. It's a note three.

Speaker 3:          00:42:53       Nice. I mean I, I'm a droid guy guy cause he has the s three is fucking terrible. Like I, the s four apparently fixes all the problems as far as nice. I've played with that. I almost got that I got this instead because I was, I'm just greedy. Everyone's like, why aren't you get an iPhone on? Like I just, I don't refuse to fully drink the apple koolaid. It's good to stay away a little bit. Just in case the apple falls apart. You still have options. My wife and my wife has the iPhone. I have the droid. I can see the best of both worlds in nine times out of 10 the APP, like if there's an app that's on the iPhone, that's an app that's on the droid. Droid one just barely works. Barely was fucking focus problem. Instagram's terrible. Yeah. So it's so clunky.

Speaker 3:          00:43:29       I used a god, I um, I got the shit at my house. I'm addicted to have apps in my house. I got the hue it. Have you seen that basically it replaces your light bulbs with these LEDs? Yeah, we have, I'll give you an antibiotic. We have it here, we just never installed it. And so a fucking, then I have the, uh, what's the, the nest, which is to controls or Hvac from your phone. So I'll wake up, I'm a little warm in the morning, go to my phone, lower the air conditioning temperature, and then it learns throughout the week. And then nest just is introducing a thermostat that I got also where you can basically a, if it's a smoke detector actually, and instead of just going like right off the bat, it just goes when it gets a slight puff of smoke, it's like, oh, small, small digita detected.

Speaker 3:          00:44:05       Right. And then if it says it, yeah. And then you can just wave it away as opposed to scaring the shit out of your dog. Right. And then, uh, if there's more smoke then it eventually builds to full alarm. So what the, what these guys are doing over there is essentially taking all these, like, I wouldn't say Apps, these utilities that people just didn't think about improving them and their apple buying them there. They're making them work and they're just brilliant. Yeah, they're great. It also has carbon dioxide or whatever, the oxide oxide, carbon dioxide. Just slow

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       down. Think about what you're saying right before you say it and you can get through it. But yeah, man, it's a I technology. I just like, we have a three d printer at the house. We've got the rift, I got the idea of a three d printer. Would he printed it? I got it. That's how I was saying I'm gonna print custom butt plugs for all my buddies for Christmas. That's sweet. Um, yeah, my wife, my wife printed with three d halo pistol and like she basically had had a print every single part like the and just assemble the whole damn thing and it's like life size and it's just, it's just, it heats the plastic and then it just basically does it bit by bit and you can download things from thingiverse.com and they're also going to be able to do with the metal, right?

Speaker 2:          00:45:08       Like, yeah. This is just like plastic gun control will be a thing of the past. That's weird. There's a guy right now who could, who made up, we've made a plastic gun that could fire, uh, the first one round than several rounds and the data that you can't, once the data's out there, that the genie's out of the bottle. You know, it's like I say about about trying to delete a tweet. So I tried to suck a fart back in your ass. It just doesn't work that way. And so you'd be more successful, suck in a far back in your ass, you know, fair thing. If you worked on it for years, he had a good prolapse, you could probably, this is things that people can do that would shock you like pussy farts in a microphone. You can do man, people, some people have special gifts.

Speaker 2:          00:45:42       When I'm on a plane it seems like I fart and it sucks back in like it does it for like hours on end and not see your neighbor. You fuck dude sitting there going, [inaudible] spill it and you know your shit. Now, this guy, I made the mistake of going from American at Delta one time in American has these seats that absorbed the farts. It's like cloth, but in Delta it's like this kind of rubbery thing. And so the far just tits, it goes fucking straight up. Who'd be a very smart move to develop some sort of a fart free airplane. Well there's somebody made made underwear that has some special filter that had carbon filter. Yeah, exactly. I'm not going to work on Joey Diaz. I got news for you. I wrote a blog once about a fart that he took on a plane. I was next to him and I was writing and he was lying there with his hands on his stomach and, and uh, I saw him like lift up, like he adjusted his weight and before it was too late, I, I, it hit me like a Zombie Barak, like a truck. And I had headphones on. I was listening to music and over the music I heard the woman behind me go, oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:46:42       It was so, she goes, oh my God, dude. Fuck her farts are always, always fucking funny, but it was so bad. I had to put my shirt over my face. I had to duck down. I was on a plane once and a dude farted on Melanie Griffin's head. This is how it works. I was on a plane and I was flying from New York to London and it's a long flight. And when we were on the Ohs, actually la to London, and when we're on the plane, Melanie Griffin lied down. She went to sleep or her, her thing extends and this guy lied down and he went to sleep and he was a fat guy. And if there's a fact, if there's a fart on a plane, you always look to the fact that it's it just, just the way it is, you know? Fair enough. Everybody does got fucking crop dusted.

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       It's sleep no more in New York City recently. You ever hear about that show? So Melanie Griffiths, head, Melanie Griffith, head in this guy's ass. We're three feet away from each other. He was turned sideways with his ass facing her or she was turned sideways with her face facing his ass in perfect alignment, just a few feet apart. Like how was that even happen? Like if you ever thought in the universe when you were watching a movie with Melanie Griffith then and that one day I'm going to get to Fart in her face. Her face going to be three feet away and I'm just going to open up on her face. Little curly hair, kind of like moves in the breeze. It was weird to see because I was awake or wake up or did she? She moved, she did something. It's like inception where she'd go trenching and like a sewage bin or something.

Speaker 2:          00:48:13       It was a horrible fart. I kissed her. I opened it on her. I can't stay the proximity. So strange. Its power. I mean what, how much would it cost to say like Melanie Griffith, there's a guy, he's weird, you know he's a nice guy, but he wants a fart in your face. He's willing to give you $5 million. He's the problem. He's Brazilian. How much, how much would you have to pay or to partner face me. Monster took one for nothing. Right? And the mug three feet away. And the guy, he's the guy opened on her. You think he knew he farted hard dude. There's no way like pushing the, he wasn't asleep ed either cause he had been moving around a lot before he cut that Fart, you know, would probably had upset stomach. Oh Hey. You know something about the pressure change to just pop people just like the Fart.

Speaker 2:          00:48:56       I think if you're around people that just fart, most of the time people hold it in until no one's around. But when you get in a plane, it's 11 hours. You're like, fuck it. Melanie's got us off. And I fucking love Fart and elevators. Do you, I'm, that guy is terrible. I'll live in a condo right now. My niece and my neighbors don't like me. And so, and just like walking the dog and just why don't you neighbors like you? Um, I installed a, okay, so here's the deal. Living in the condo right now and I bought the condo next door and I cut a hole in the wall. And so then in that Condo I put in like a theater room and then I put it in a 450 gallon hot tub. You can see where this is going in the condo. So you haven't parties.

Speaker 2:          00:49:33       Yeah, well, so I was building basically the ultimate Pussy Palace right when the love of my life showed up. Like whenever they finish the final bit of tile. And I was going to be like, I'm going to be a bachelor. This is going to be great. Boom. My dream girl appears. And I'm like, Oh, well that was fun. And so then, uh, when I had the tub installed, I didn't have an overflow valve installed. Oh, Jesus. And this is during like crunch time, I think I'm like year three, a few years ago and I left the water on. Oh, Jesus. Now, yeah, I went to dinner and the three condos beneath me flooded. Oh my God. Oh my God. One lawsuit later with my Hoa, which is still pending. It's, uh, it's been an interesting journey. Needless to say, they had a star ceiling. It's still pending. Yeah. Where's we're working on coming to terms for it. It's, I don't want to get into the details, but I had a star ceiling at it. The, the tub filled from the ceiling and see match how the guy below me felt like it's just like a fucking freight train. Dude. That's so

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       crazy. How much was the total damage? 80 grand. That seems cheap. Yeah. It sounds like it'd be a lot more than that. Yeah. If it was la would have been, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's probably what it is, right? Yeah, I'm right. 1 million couple, man. I was thinking millions. Yeah, that seems like a lot of money. But yeah, it's a, so, I mean, we bought a house when we're here to renovating and we're gonna be moving up there. So Carolina is pretty fucking awesome. 80 ground dude. Yeah. I mean go move. Really just to get out of here. It really is the move. The only thing that would suffer it would be the podcast guest. You wouldn't get as many cool guests. We have a direct flight finally. Yeah. But I'm not flying back and forth from fucking North Carolina. All I know. If you live there, you live there.

Speaker 3:          00:51:05       And the other thing would be flying to gigs. Yeah. But it's a better move, man. I, I've Nvu it's a better move because it's not a backwoods town. Raleigh's a great town. Great restaurants. Bioshock infinite in Quincy, Massachusetts. You know, I mean, come on man. What is that one restaurant that you guys have that fucking insane barbecue place. The pit. Yeah. Holy Shit is, that's where all the celebs go. Yeah. All the celebs. How dare you just, we're just talking about food here man. And why did you have to go there? I don't know. All the celebs go there. That's what Joe Rogan goes. It's delicious food man. There's like how many restaurants did they and they are like, it's fucking exploded. Yeah. There's a lot of restaurants there and we noticed that when we're back there. But then pit places, a lot of great walkable spots now.

Speaker 3:          00:51:47       Like we just, you know, take our bikes around and shit and it's just fun. You know? So it's not too many people. That's what it is. You spent $400,000 for a house out there. Forget it. You're good. You're good. Like it's, it's great. You can even might can get great house in apex for 200 wow. Just unreal. And like my protector, my brother lives in orange where you can get a starter house for 800 grand, you know, and it's just fucking California man. You know, we can, we briefly consider moving out here. And I looked at the real estate. I'm like, I cannot justify to us if you're gonna live in La. It's like, you know, we, we poked around in hidden hills, which was beautiful, but it's like, you still can't go to like, you know, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills for dinner. You just can't, you can't, you just got to go over the hill, go over to Panga, get a fucking chopper depending candy's not bad.

Speaker 3:          00:52:29       Yeah. Everybody wants get silly and tried to go over the four or five. That's the four or five. It could be two o'clock in the afternoon, two o'clock in the morning. It doesn't matter. It's a fucking hard, yeah, you always run into packed. They were doing construction on it the other day. It was really late at night. Somebody that's my driver is saying over here was saying Obama came through and just like, right, right when he got into town was right when everyone going to work and right when he left was when everyone was leaving work and it just, everything's shut down. Really? Yeah. Well when I was there it wasn't that, it was just, they were doing construction and they had narrowed it down and it fucking two o'clock in the morning and it was just bumper to bumper traffic. No get, that's why you get ways did I think there were false, they were acquired by Google for like a billion.

Speaker 3:          00:53:08       It's just brilliant app. Let's a, he eases pain profits and that's that simple. I want to, I don't want to let it slip. Joe, did you ever hear about sleep? No more. What is sleep? No more. It's if next time you're in New York fucking go. It is this interactive theater. Bear with me. It's got this like 1930s kind of speakeasy vibe about it and it's essentially a retelling of Macbeth in the setting of this old hotel. And the actors all act around you. Everyone has to wear a mask who's not an actor and you're not allowed to talk the whole time. And they're like, we find lady Macbeth the after like this dinner scene and she was like losing her shit and she likes strips down and starts trying to wash the blood off of her hands in a tub right in front of you.

Speaker 3:          00:53:47       And one of my buddies like actually Mondo interacting in sponge bathing the girl like, it's fucking, there's like the, you know, there's a a bellhop there who's like hooking up with everybody. Um, they don't, they're not guys sat, find a lot of images or videos of the experience because it's very low key there. I think they're actually bringing it to La is what, uh, what am I for? My friends told me other day, just just go. We went twice. The second time was an entirely different experience and you're just, you know, there's like a candy shop there. You can just dig in and eat the candy. There's little like letters, notes that are part of the fiction that you can solve yourself. It's almost like a video game that sounds incredible. It's not like one of those crazy ass scary haunted house type things. It's not scary.

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       It's just cool. And you feel like, like our first experience, we came into this room, it looks like a World War One type of uh, uh, hospitals set up. There's like a, a nun nurse who's looking very despondent and she goes up to the window where there's like this fake forest they made, which was convincing enough to hear crickets and everything and she just jumps out the window and starts running through the forest. I look over, my wife grabbed her hand, we just like jumped out the window and she started following her is fine, where she goes and like a whole tab low played out in front of us. Fucking phenomenal. And it's not like, not a lot of people know about it for some reason, but tickets aren't that expensive. You know, you go there, it opens at a speakeasy. There's people who were actors and in character playing their parts, you know, that's how it's fun.

Speaker 3:          00:54:58       It's fucking cool man. And that was really nice. There's like secret passages and shit. We were, there's one actress who was uh, sitting there, he's playing out a Tablo on a sofa and there's one lady who stood in front of her with a mask on and she grabbed a lady's hand and pulled her into this like closet and I went to follow in. The door's locked and they were, had this some sort of one on one encounter with the actress. Like one during the dinner scene they were all dancing and one of the actresses grabbing, there's one of the guys with the mask on who was a participant, just started ballroom dancing with them. Just like, cool shit man. Wow, that's pretty bad ass. Everyone respects it. People aren't with you learnt Dicks, you know, like nobody talks. It's just cool. It's over in Chelsea.

Speaker 3:          00:55:31       I can't recommend it enough. That sounds really cool. How long do you think it's going to be before someone creates some really bad ass artificial environment for like the rift? So we're really incredible world of Warcraft tidewell places. The thing is is the biggest mistake with the rift was putting doom three and team fortress on it. Why is that? Because their games are not made for Vr. The pacing of the Vr game and like the the screen Bob and they mount the gun moves and everything that can contribute to nausea, you need to make like a, a scuba diving sim or space dog fighting Sim, that kind of thing. Like you know, or missed flight game where you're exploring the island and mimicking the pain. The pacing has got to be a lot slower. It's like when Bungee put first person shooters on consoles eco, you couldn't have the quake three ut pacing.

Speaker 3:          00:56:14       They had this, you know, master chief jumped very, very slowly. You know, he didn't run incredibly fast. Right. And people like took a, you know, half a clip to take down. That's how they designed the game for the console controller. Right. It's the same thing for the rift. And I think, you know, I'll porn jokes aside man, like that I, you know, and that one simulator where I sat there and looked down and saw my little virtual legs and I could see that I was in a space ship and I looked around, I was like boom. And I, even when I saw the early version of this, I'm like, I want it under this, someone invest on it. Cause uh, the thought, if you probably haven't seen the High Rez have, you know, if you ever want to, you make it out to Orange County, I can make an intro and you can check out the latest stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:56:45       I've got the low rise a development unit and it's fun just sitting there playing with butterflies and stuff like that. But I could see where I got sick just walking around and that, you know, and like I had to sit down. But yeah, they believe right now that, you know, the seat of Vr experience is the ideal one. Right. And you know, just they made this, somebody made this one demo and they're crowd sourcing the killer app. Essentially. They're just having developed the developers who like help solve all the problems, which is fucking brilliant. Just one APP. We have to keep your hands on your keyboard and not move your hands. And first the fly comes out and cause you're sitting at a desk and it starts bugging you and then all of a sudden like thousands of fly start like going around and the three d audio is fantastic.

Speaker 3:          00:57:21       And so, you know, the whole idea is like you want to itch yourself cause that little thing goes off in your head about the bugs, right? Then a velociraptor comes into the room and just start screaming in your face. And then, uh, something, I think, oh that a spider starts crawling up your little virtual arm and like, see, then you can hear it like chewing on your ear and shit. You could probably find it on youtube. I don't remember what the fucking thing was called, but that's kind of cool stuff that they're doing. Right. Wow. But yeah, that's uh, you know, they, they solved a lot of the VR issues with just field of view and they keep cracking that problem by peeling with at that onion of what VR is. And, uh, sooner or later they gonna fully crack it. And when you see the unreal engine four demo on that shit and that like, there's like this hell night that's like eight feet tall and stands in front of you.

Speaker 3:          00:57:57       I mean, your ass puckers you can't help it, you know, when the snowflakes are falling, you stick out your tongue, you want to like catch them. It's pretty damn convincing. That's why I'm more excited for things like the rift than I am about next gen consoles. It's like, yeah, it's new consoles and they're cool and they're better. That can hopefully finally just, you only have one input, but at the same time they know is not a lot of great games right now. And uh, I'm on Linkedin. It, it'd be possible to do like unreal, like to port unreal over to, uh, to that, well, my last words when I left epic and then when I, cause it gave the whole like speech was to a, I told him that he shot fees for closers. Yeah, yeah. ABC Great. I watched that speak to you about once every six months.

Speaker 3:          00:58:33       And then, um, when he pulls up the fucking brass balls, I told him a reboot, unreal or unreal tournament, especially on the first unreal and unreal engine four. Cause the idea for that game was fucking golden. It's like, oh, it's the Bermuda triangle of the galaxy. So you could do whatever the hell you want. And the thing that we lost a bet that game was, it was just as much about exploration and like a sense of wonder as it was about the combat. You know, it felt, it felt mysterious. You know, he had the giant hubs and everything and had a little bit of, like I told him, if they redo it, it would be essentially [inaudible], you know, Skyrim that game to introduce that, but PSI Phi. Right. It'd be fucking to crush it. Unreal is a fun game, man. It's really, really exciting. When it came out the first time you had to do battle with that crazy dreadlock thing was fucking that was, yeah, that was my whole sequence.

Speaker 3:          00:59:16       I designed that one. Um, the uh, that was held developing that game was that, yeah, we were in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, which is like a college town, but it didn't have a fun college town benefits of like cool, shitty bar that I saw and I didn't even, I didn't drink back then. Anyway, insert drinking. I was like 25 and uh, basically to spend a year on and off up there from southern California in like, we've just all just up at digital extremes working on that game actually. Um, you know, talking to all of the people who worked on it, it's like, it was like, it was our nam or something. It was like such a to lose, we're 16 plus hours a day, man. Like eating the local fast food. It was fucking horrible. This is before Internet porn too. So I'd actually go to the quickie Martin.

Speaker 3:          00:59:53       I'd like pick up those like, you know, swank and all those like Raunchy Hazmat at times. Dude, good time. When I left the apartment complex, they had rented for us. There is a pile of porno magazines that must've been like that limit. They're like a thousand of them and I just left him there for like the land to deal. Yeah, they used to, they used to be the only way you could get porn either to buy it and he had to step up like a man and never sound like that and never found my dad's stash. Never ever. I found mine after, after he died, my mom confirmed it and now he's had those pulling on Max and I'm like, fuck. Where were they just had like some porno dungeon probably at a locker. Yeah. Probably kept them somewhere. Yeah. Wait from prying eyes. He didn't have a spanky wary.

Speaker 3:          01:00:32       Maybe had like a special hollowed out logs kept in the woods, in the woods jail the night look around. But did you ever find, I found support in the woods. It was France and in the way I did as something awful thread about that a while back that like everybody, every young men in America, you, you flip them growing up here, you found it. And I always said it was, it was always swank or Rhonchi ass ones. It was never like playboy. Yeah, it was always Sherry. Yeah, Dude. It's somehow like the subject of blondish came up the other day. I was chatting with a lawn edge Wantage do you remember, do you mean Janine Lindemulder the porn star? She, she did this whole stripping act with Juliane where it's just like a much is in the nineties you know too much. Listen to what you're saying. You're saying. It's like, well, my point is, have you seen Jeannine lately? No. Brian can Google that. Why? I'm trying to get this computer because she was in the cover of the blink when any two album. Remember she had the nurse thing, she looked for eight and she was gorgeous and she baked yet she's just, I mean, it's rough, man. I don't want to say it. I don't want to make fun of the girl. No, I just, it's, it's sad, man.

Speaker 3:          01:01:33       Sorry, I'll start off business. It's hard out there for porn actresses. Here's that oculus rift thing that you're talking about with the spider crabs here. This is wild, man. Hey Brian. What is this thing that this computer's do one at the bottom. What? It was like this little bubble that's telling me everything and macro SX. It's like voiceover or something like that. I don't know what it is. What's that? It's accessibility. It's probably in your general settings. He probably hit it. When you find out what it's setting us for that it's that wheelchair or something in the settings. Really. That's your Mac imploding after you spilled your drink on. It can't be that. That doesn't happen. I don't see that. Wheelchair settings. What does that accessibility, where the fuck is that? It's probably probably the top.

Speaker 4:          01:02:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:23       No to, there's a hot key for it. Yeah. This is probably a hot key on your keyboard. Also. I do not see accessibility in any of these options. Users, parental controls? No. Find out where it is. Man. This is ridiculous. I'm still on PC. Do you really? Yeah. Well, so we got those a an I'm going to no way fucking affiliated, but we got the razor blade laptops and like normally when you get a PC, the amount of like OEM bullshit on accessibility. Like you buy the thing and there's like 8 million like Hewlett Packard desktop manager and all sorts of Shit in the computer just runs terribly and you just reformat the damn thing. But this thing at three icons on the desktop, like none of that bullshit. Uh, here's the, the flies flying around that does look, oh, you see fucking crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:03:10       And uh, the, the five one is what sells it. The velociraptors are not the most convincing philosophy. What do you find when you're talking about like a good PC build for a laptop? Like what, what is a, a company that you go to that has like the same kind of quality that apple has? Well, with we'd said I buy power.com and you had, you had bad luck with it. Yeah, I'm honestly, well the, when we get around to like building it, I'm going to just use the wisdom of the crowd and see what, like the Twitter verse says, so you got to build your own laptop so when you buy I'm going to, I'm going to go to the place where I can customize and then they ship it to my house. I'm not going to like write like a Falcon northwest type of deal or like a real like hardcore desktop PC.

Speaker 3:          01:03:46       Right. I'm laying am my eventually going to go, I mean just on the laptop right now, but when you want to do some serious gaming, like I can play League of legends on it, but you know when it comes down to first person shooters, I play the bioshock infinite DLC on my PT, on my razor blade laptop. And it's just like the keys are too small for the good wasd movement. Right, right. I mean, you know, my big, my fucking big fat fingers, I'm like accidentally hitting the wrong buttons. The wrong time. You make me want to play games, man, I want to do it. You've seen that league of legends and the fact that they had their championship and they filled the staple center, like that game is so big that they basically had a sporting event. Wait a minute, they, how long has this game been out? It's been out a few years. Um, and they filled the fucking, yeah, basically this top down strategy game and a, with all these unique characters and like saying there's not even an investor much of a single player component to the game. It's more of a multiplayer of strategy game and people cosplay for it. They dress up as all the crazy awesome characters. Yeah. There it is at the staple center.

Speaker 5:          01:04:40       How many of you guys seen some of the hype videos for the performance? How many of you guys know that? Where's,

Speaker 3:          01:04:46       I think it was a couple of Korean kids wound up winning. This is insane. Look at the size of that fucking crowd free there to watch people play games free to play game. How much did they pay to get in there? To Watch people play a game? Uh, I don't know how much it was for tickets for that, but I'm guess everyone's cheering and shit, dude. It's, it's, wow, we're in a movie, right? We're in a movie. And so that game was pitched at ea years ago and, and ea basically laughed him out of the room and now just crushing it.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       They're hiring like everybody, all the developers in La and like, they make these awesome cinematics also to support their, uh, kind of what the Ip is and what the universe is. And then crazy characters like I'm playing as this like little girl who has like, um, she can pirate telekinesis or whatever, you know, firestarter shit. And um, she has this like little bear with her little stuffed bear and like through magic, the bear becomes giant flaming and a tax people. And I mean, it's a, it's an incredibly deep game. Wow. Every, everybody has a giant stiffy feed the concept of e sports. Now they want to make an esport game. And it's like, dude, you have to make a great air tight game first before you could ever consider even doing that. But I mean it's beautiful graphics. Oh, it's, it's got that it just beautiful art style.

Speaker 2:          01:05:58       Right. And, um, I think they're about to move into a new facility that got to be up to like four or 500 people. Easy. God dammit. It's old John that they call it. The mobile is like, uh, what was it? Online battle arena and um, that whole genre is just huge these days. I just could still shoot her guy if they can. Yeah, I am as well. I can tell you if I, if I'm able to get a studio going, uh, want to make a PC shooter, like that's like let's Sony and Microsoft fight it off for the next few years and you know, the, the Pc, you know, you know as well as I do Joe Communities, everything, right? Like it's so much of it is like creating your own, you know, religion, your own brand and the pcs where the community gathers for Reddit, for youtube videos, for everything.

Speaker 2:          01:06:40       And you can have some of that. They were working on it with consoles, but you know, the PC is not going anywhere. Well, you know what, you can't fuck with the accuracy of the mouse. You just can't. They tried. I've seen all those other things fucked with them. They can't mess with a really good mouse. And keyboard is just the such for CISE movement, the way he can move around. You get that muscle memory and people are just popping off head shots. I mean it's, I mean, especially getting a little older, it gets a little harder. Um, but it's uh, it's fucking awesome and like that type of thing. Translating to pro is just compelling to me. Yeah. People like, I've had conversations with people that I can't believe you were addicted to. Games are so stupid. I mean, you could, you know, it's just a story that somebody wrote.

Speaker 2:          01:07:18       I don't think you get it. Like when you're playing multiplayer, what you're doing is you're engaged in this fast twitch, very realistic, hyper sensate sensation filled experience. It's good for you. And in the back of your head, your brain's compiling the code of the day. This is good for you. Sounds like a crack dealer. The first one's free. You're a dealer. Klutzy beats is that one of their awesome cinematics they put up for the game and it's just like where you got kind of get to know that gambit looking guy and then there's, it's bad ass fucking awesome graphics. Yeah. That's west Borland. He's in the game. Right. Cause it looks like, it looks like one of the outfits that he wears West Portland, the guy from um, a limp Bizkit that bad ass bass player, guitar player, whatever it is wouldn't things. But yeah, so a lot of people right now are, they are trying to get into that whole thing with that genre and they're just like, dude at that point like blizzard's coming out with a game and the genre and blizzard I think is going to have a shot at doing well.

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       But everybody else initially, dude. Wow. Yeah. If you're the fifth one in then you know you're gonna wind up being like the is cola to Pepsi and coke and all that. If you could figure out a way to use an Omni directional, like one of those circular treadmills and a really good accurate gun that you actually hold and carry with a strap that you put over your shoulder. They have that dude, did they really have something really good though? Like a game? They haven't made a game for you. It's called the Omni. Um, I got to use it at comicon. And what it does is essentially you're strapped into your waist and you don't go anywhere and it's a super slippery floor that's kind of a bowl and you put on these special shoes that are super slick and if you didn't, if you weren't strapped in, you fall, fall right over.

Speaker 2:          01:08:56       But because you're strapped in, you have the illusion of walking again. I was full and running on the thing playing halflife two. Um, again, the problem with that was the pacing of halflife two is done for a person who just holds WASD and whips their mouse around. And if you just try and dump it on the rift with the Omni, it's just, it's an exhausting experience where you're lucky to get three kills there. It sounds like someone's a pussy. Fucking get in shape and chief hat, this is awesome. This is what I needed in my life. This would change me, this kind of shit. We'll fucking change me. So they, that's a workout man. Yeah, we're getting some wicked shape do. We did a Kickstarter for that and they raised a bunch of money and I Amandla where do you, where do I put away my credit card information?

Speaker 2:          01:09:35       That's fucking bad ass man. I love it. Yeah. So, and it totally takes up a small footprint in like your room, right? Ah. So it's a, it's, it's cool man. It's just, it, it right now for the time being, I think seated VR is the way to go until they solve all the problems. Like it's like walk before you run. Like let's, let's figure it out. Just regular Vr Dad, I want to run, I want to run with a gun. Let's do this. What are you saying? I'm not falling over bitch, you might follower. I'm not going to fall over. No, no. When you have that, those God was on, I mean I was just trying to like grab a butterfly at one point and like, whoa. You like lose yourself cause it's kind of like a, it's, it tricks your mind into thinking you're actually disorienting and the low rise makes sense.

Speaker 2:          01:10:10       The low Rez, when it has a screen door type look on it. The High Rez one, it's like, it's great. And I mean, you know, the, the tech technology only gonna get lighter. It's gonna get better faster, the whole nine yards. So it's just that it would like at this stage of the game that they would come up with something like that. It's like, well VR was supposed to be the big thing in the 90s right? Man, lawnmower man, his lawnmower man. I thought the graphics in that movie was so awesome and they don't hold up at all. But one more man is another one of those Stephen King books that became like, ah, an okay movie. But God damn, that book was bad. I never actually read the book. It's fucking great. I mean, cause this is the whole William Gibson Cyber punk thing and it's like, dude, do you know how many years it's been since the Matrix?

Speaker 2:          01:10:50       Like it's, I think it was 98, 99 and the SQL never happened. Well the sequels that did happen are terrible. Yeah. What is, uh, who is this Doug Benson? That's right. Yeah, it was stone and he was like getting sick on it. Dude. You saw the viral video of the little old lady who, uh, put it on and she's just like, am like wow. Meet CNN and everything. Like she's like, did you go to Tuscany to make this and all this stuff because they have a demo where you're kind of, you're in, you're in Tuscany. Right? It's just virtual reality stuff. But she was so convincing to her. It's like, think about just, you know, the non gaming applications of the shit. Like imagine, you know, if, you know, you have a travel app where you can just go and experience like, you know, Venice or Tuscany or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:11:29       Right? That kind of thing. For virtual tourism, right? Well, that's going to be what movies are not going to go to a movie and sit in front of a screen like a dummy. Not Everybody can afford to have a theater room or a big TV. So imagine if you're like a college kid and you want to watch a movie in Imax, you know, you put this on and it's, they have actually have a theater demo where you're like, you can look around and see the seats next to you and it's, there's a big screen in front of you and it's, you feel like you're at an imax. I could totally see that and I could see you being in a virtual reality where you're in a movie theater watching a movie and everything goes horribly wrong. And you look around the theater and you see zombies Werewolf's and shit.

Speaker 2:          01:12:03       I could imagine they could make a pretty God damn immersive experience. I knew a guy who is making a game for the rift and uh, his demo was basically that you're playing a, you're, you're sitting on a sofa playing a video game on your TV, in the virtual environment and then weird shit in your inner ear and your, your, your fake living room. And then it's like a dark and stormy night and then weird shit starts happening all around you. That would be dope as fuck if they had a theater where you're sitting there in your seat and in the theater, your seat goes down into the floor and out pops an Omni directional track like that thing, whatever the fuck all on mill Omni treadmill and then you, you pick up a gun that's on the treadmill and everybody gets locked in and you all like Eh, are interactive in the movie together, stormed the beach, you know, fucking wild.

Speaker 2:          01:12:50       That would be mad if they, I mean it would be a completely different kind of entertainment. And one of the problems, the a movie where you go and sit down or games are too fucking scary on it. Oh I bet. Right. Cause when you turn and like, you know, monsters right there. Did you guys ever play slender man? You'd have a heart attack. What is slender man? Uh, it's PC, first person, little mini games. So there's this whole, you know, they'll all the internet memes and things like that. A few years ago this became like a thing where like the Internet created this mythos of the slick, creepy, skinny, scary dude. And whenever he'd show up, the kids would vanish, right? And someone made this little game called slender man that you can download and it's essentially you have to go find ate scraps of paper that are, and it's, you know, they're random where they're going to be and it's a dark night and you have a flashlight in your, in a forest.

Speaker 2:          01:13:31       And if you basically see slender man and you look at them from too long, you die. And so what happens is nothing, nothing happens at first. It's real quiet. And you'll get, you'll get the first piece and all a sudden you start hearing this like factory, like pounding starts. It's very ominous. And then he, you know, you turn around and, and at the end of the, he first shows up, like at the end of the road, he's like any, you just can barely see this really skinny, creepy guy. And then they'll, they'll deliberately like put them around corners and like there's, there's a part we have to go in like a little warehouse to get a piece of paper. And the pacing of it is so wild on this entire youtube videos of people's reactions to slender man, like falling off their chair and the graphics are simple. His shifts. I was worried about really skinny people. I guess it's cause they're fucking hungry as

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       shit and they're willing to get desperate. What's that? That, that that goes back to the, the grays, the alien thing, right? Like that's skinny, slender ice thing, right? Yeah. I can some things, but this is a person, right? Yeah. The quality of this video, it looks like sound like a commodore 64 right? Now. Remember that video that somebody made where it was like Johnny or something like that? It was a, uh, like a little alien rubber thing. Rubber Johnny. Yeah. What was that? That was a, it was a viral promotion for something. It's like an la based artist. Really stirring it up. Pull that up. That was rubber John. It was pretty upsetting. It's weird man. It was one of the weirdest things I think I've ever seen on I got under your skin. Yeah, right. It's like that kind of, that's why I like insidious is one of my favorite horror movies.

Speaker 1:          01:14:50       Cause the, a lot of the heart har references in it. Subtle here. See that one? Yes. James wan and the scene where um, the, ah, the mother, they think they're free of the haunting and they're at the new house and then the tiptoe through the tulips starts playing. Yeah. This is, if this was like on Fox News and past as like some alien film, people would remember when alien autopsy was out of the box. Totally dating. Like, wait a minute, wait a minute. What did you just really make me watch 35 minutes a TV to show me a rubber suit. They're not going to fucking find big foot. Quit looking. See My tweets from last night. No. Oh my God. I was going crazy. I was watching big finding big foot and uh, I was, I was getting mad, you know, cause they were talking crazy shit. And uh, they had this woman on and they were like, she's a pull up this picture of Brian, if you can see, it's like the woman says Kelly, they talking about how they found big for the, like Kelly's very artistic. So she decided to sketch what we saw that day and she unveiled this fucking picked click on the picture though, so you could really see it. She unveils this picture. Wow. And you know, she's Kelly's very artistic. This is what she decided to. So the fucking guy, the big foot expert, he sees that picture. He goes, wow,

Speaker 2:          01:16:01       that's anything other than the worst piece of shit, big foot drawing and it history. It looks like the man and the wing from the twilight zone, it's worse. The man on the wing was more realistic and he looked like a furry. That is one of the worst drawings of all time. You know, they should have said like, oh, that's interesting. But instead they're like, wow, dude. I had a friend send me a photo years ago, uh, to the characters that jazz jackrabbit game I made that w happened to be, she was staying at a hotel that happened to be happening. A having a furry convention was, that was her story. Anyway, and uh, there were two people dressed as these characters as furries that I had created. I'm like, that's hilarious. What if I done,

Speaker 1:          01:16:37       we were in Pittsburgh once accidentally and it was a coincided with a furry convention. We were there for the UFC and the, all the hotels were taken up and they had a hard time finding hotel rooms for fighters and people because they were all taken up by furries. And when we were at this one hotel, the guy told us that the people that were there that were staying asked him to put a litter box in the lobby so they could shit in the lobby. Wow. That's, that's, that's some dedication. He said that they were like, they're basically the guys, our argument was, look for this whole weekend, it's all fairies. And he tried to say, look, it's not all furries. We have regular guests here too. And they're like, we'll put it in the corner and it only be for like, they wanted to be able to shit in a letter box. I mean maybe the guy was trolling, but I don't think so. I mean, I'm not saying the guy who told me this, I'm saying the guard,

Speaker 3:          01:17:20       I mean because they have little lake holes that they could fuck through in their suits. But so then what it yet that's the tattoo. I um, I remember who got that. It was at that goes, uh, that's this jazz. That's the thing. That's what, you know, dude, that's what I miss. What people getting tattoos of stuff I came up with that was the biggest like gas like and you know I, I met this summer, I was at a Pax East conference in Boston and it's like really normal looking hipster girl comes up to me and pulls up beside of her shirt and she had written the oath that the gears took or like tattooed on her side and I just, I I came up that shit on like a Tuesday like Ah, rod needs this for the okay cool. And like the in the in like the the key or stamp and it's like if you Google gears, tattoos,

Speaker 1:          01:18:00       Brian, it may maybe a very strange nerd gas them when you come on that that thing, she has that thing written on the side of her body. You shoot a load on that. If you're like a real super nerd and you're banging a chick hot check has got that tattooed on our side. Like wow, must be pretty intense orgasm the whole generation of girls now that just grew up playing games and it's no big deal now. Yeah. What were we talking about right before that there was something we were talking about where I was going to the litter box and the forest. So the guy told me that not only did they do that is these are all gears tattoos were showing on the eastern versus raising. Not only did the guy say that they wanted that, but they also wanted to be fed and bowls. They wanted them to bring bowls up to uh, the room, like their food so they can eat on the ground like a dog. So I've seen the furry outfits haven't tried, went on, but how do you like there's gotta be a mouth hole and, and for the whole back thing, like you have to a trap door, like the old school minor underwear, right?

Speaker 1:          01:19:01       Oh yeah, yeah. But then you can't shit in the litter box and you have to take off the, depends. Take off your furry off it and then drop the shit in the letterbox. It's a matter of sure. Defend the pens like a last ditch effort. If you can't figure out how to get the suit off and imagine like did have this clean very often like the, the stench of the sweat and every ladies you could get will usable it's west best way a fair enough. The um, the people that were staying there, which we're working there, whether it was interesting because it wasn't just one person that was telling us his stories, it was like one guy came over and told us about the litter box and another guy came over and told us about bowls and they want to be served in bowls and they were all living might be legit then it was just one dude or isn't enough legit. I think there's something no one's telling you not to be a fairy. I just want to get that out there right now. I don't have any judgment on furries. Whatever works for you. If you enjoy doing it, who cares? But I would imagine that a lot of people that like to be anonymous like that also have some other peculiar quirks. I, has anybody ever done a study? I've always wondered like where does that fascination start? There's oof fucking know, right? Like your humping her teddy bear as kid

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       could be. Don't like people. People been mean to you and you wish you lived in a world of cartoons, some playful, childish world where you just don't even see people's face. He just pull on the hatch and bang them. That's brownies are the creepiest ones. These grown men that love like my little pony. You know, I didn't even know about that until that show we did the other night. Some guy pulled it out. I have it. I had a my little pony doll in my pocket because I have a three year old. Yeah. He just told me to hold up. You still have it. I gave it to her and give her back to her. But um, um, someone said that there's a bunch of men who were into my little pony and they call him bronies. I mean, I can't believe I didn't know about maybe I did know and I just refused.

Speaker 2:          01:20:44       There's so much stuff there's ever hit her about the utility kilt. Utila kilt. Yeah. It's like a kilts that has all these pockets and shit. And they sell them at comicon. It's like a thing there's like dudes are wearing around. Yeah. So underneath nothing, just balls assuming nothing. That's like the greatest, like what do you think's what's under there? What do you think's under there? Yeah, they uh, they have been doing that for years. You see this shit. So how the conventions, I think it's so they can collect swag. If you're a guy walking around in a skirt with no underwear on, that's so hack. Huh? Cause girls had been doing that forever. It's like you're stealing their thunder. Fair enough. I'll tell it to them. My Scottish friends, yeah, they were actually probably doing it before skirts, right? Yeah. I've had Scottish friends who told me they wear the kilt out and they get more attention from girls to grabbing their balls all night.

Speaker 2:          01:21:24       Really? How they're hanging around with dirty bitches. Watch a ball grabbing wenches. That's what I say. Where are they? This is taking place. Band named the ball. Having the winches should and if it's not, please make it so you could still make it. So they were all touch tunes out at some of the bars around here. What does that, it's basically looks like a giant iPhone in the wall and then you can play music through your phone for free for a fee, but you can pay to like twice the feed of plate. Make your song playing next. It's fucking awesome. Really genius. Every song. That's fascinating. We will go to like a redneck bars and like play the most non southern music. We were at one and we put on a electric six this gay bar. Oh Man. Like the locals didn't know about the APP and they were trying to figure out why isn't it playing like my music. I will not take it to a gay bar.

Speaker 2:          01:22:09       And then we put them Brittany and why does it work? Who controls it? The person who there's basically a song queue and then you can interrupt it. Yeah. Yeah. Basically if you pay extra to make your song next, then you're next. Yeah. It's a total dick move. It's, it's great cause there's that guy named gamble. Highly loved this guy who I'd recommend looking at Mommy's on spot. It sounds like a big black porn star with a cowboy hat. He has names gambling. He has this song about gambling and fuck and you and your mouth boy is a song called balls in your butthole. Anything play that song really loud it. Most bars you can just sit there and just love life. Look there. It's called dogs in a bathtub. Ball's in your book. I'm saying, but the act of doing that is called Doggie in the bathtub because it's hard to keep the dog in the bathtub. Doggie in the bathtub. I might, my buddy of vo that one time. Um, I don't understand that Doggie in the bathtub because it's hard to keep a dog in the bathroom, but it's not hard to use that APP and turn the music on while I was talking about putting your balls and someone's ass. Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       okay. He's the shit out of me. There's videos up that if you look at the Google guys videos of guys putting balls in someone's arrows buttholes while fucking him. Yeah. Yeah. Putting them in. I still have friends that don't know Google it. You'll eat the pickle jar. I don't pick a job routine. We're not the guy's ass. And then it broke. Oh yeah. One guy. One girl. It's rough. Whatever it is. One guy. One Cup. Yeah. That's one of the roughest I ways to deal with that guy. The chunks and interview. He survived it. Yeah. I heard it was a breakaway glass that they use. I would like the fake stuff for the movies. Really interesting. Are you sure? That's what it's really heard. Yeah, but candy glass, right? This, this, I heard shit. It's not good enough. In 2013 Mr Reichel BME is fake. No, some of it wasn't fake.

Speaker 1:          01:23:50       That video was, no. Some of it all. It was all BME. Paint. Olympics was was a series of images that people had gathered up online and taken and put it into a video. As far as was it a real pain Olympics like people were like practicing to see who could cut off the mostly wind? Definitely not. It was just, they called it the BME paint Olympics because BME was a website that was around for Shannon Lariat. The guy who ran it was a friend of mine online. We interact, I think he died without all the categories of crazy buddy modification, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm pretty sure he died. Um, but he was very friendly online and he sent me a free membership wants when I wrote a blog about, um, I forget what it was. Something about, you know, me being curious about body modification, like all these different weird things that people do like, you know, like put plates in their lips and different tribal shit.

Speaker 1:          01:24:39       So he sent me all the really extreme shit that he has on his website, which just like dudes Cox split down the middle, this is all like way before you'd get this from a Google search, like you had to know like not style projects project. This was exactly what I was going to say. I found out about him from style project and uh, I find the older, right. Again, I can't live like when I hit my thirties I can't look at that shit anymore. Well you know what it is, man. You've seen it and you know what it does to you and if you're stupid you keep looking, keep wanting to feel like shit. I still have never seen two girls. One Cup. I have no desire. It's not bad. If you're, if you're a person who's seen, you know the murder videos and all this stuff that you've, I'm sure you've seen two girls, one companies, shit is that pain Olympics video reel, so he would look at whether you're doing this, what does it mean?

Speaker 1:          01:25:26       Where are you getting this answer for it? It's like crowd source creator of the Bma Payment Olympics. I did an interview with him a long time ago for a parody of the BME pain Olympics. Yeah, that was the one we cut up the video of the BME paint Olympics. Final round was a parody of the BME pain Olympics where people form and same body modifications in front of a live audience. This video though was a video just making fun of it. Like where the guy is actually a chopping off his dick. It was actually right, but no, some of them are real dude. I'm pretty sure on some of the different things that were in that video that was compiled. We're actually actually really happened. Like people did actually cut themselves. This isn't, I mean there's not like a shortage of those videos out there of guys doing it and they just compiled a bunch of them together.

Speaker 2:          01:26:10       Yeah. Um, when we were in like late twenties, we'd look at that shit at epic all the time and then like eventually we got an HR department and we had to like shut. They tell you to stop.

Speaker 1:          01:26:18       Yeah. Did they really? How dare they, you created such amazing pieces of work while you were doing all that. They think they know better. They can tell you what the fucking thing doesn't matter. His legal issues, dude, you know the legal issues. Here's what's legal. It should be legal to watch that stuff and it should be legal to fire anybody who complains. That's what I say. If you're working in an office and someone's like, you have quite a few bees over there, watch and goes get their heads chopped off. Oh, I don't want to see it. Like then you don't fit in. Yeah, get out. Well company culture starts from the top of the food, the very top. Yeah. But when you have to create as a very specific work environment, God that's gotta suck. Like if you work like you sell insurance, you have to have like very specific code of conduct and ethics. No Fun. The thing I, the thing, I don't like his fucking politics now. Like the the ladder climbing off bullshit. Disgusting. And it also like you're seeing like, like those, um, when people get together at like have like a corporate retreat here and they all sit around the dinner table and like we were next to him the other night at a restaurant and one guy was talking and toasting and everybody was like, oh Christ him again. And they just this weird culture, you know what valve valve a, the video games.

Speaker 2:          01:27:22       Yeah. They fly their entire company and the entire company's families to Hawaii for like two weeks every year. Wow. That's bad ass. I'm like, fuck. Really? Like out like you know. As much as I would like to think I got along with my coworkers, you know when I go on vacation to Hawaii, they're kind of the last people I want to see my movie. They're all just banging each other and Hawaiians to drink an APP. Swingers, swingers, subcultures. Fucking the shit out of each other all over the beach and who gives it? They used to do that for too. Do you want to fuck the fuck my wife, I have two weeks out of the year. Everything's cool. It's like that movie, the purge. It was the worst fucking [inaudible] of the year. They all go to the big guy, let it just fuck on lava rocks. Just like wild animals shredding their ass to whatever they can until they can't do it anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:28:05       And then they go to the fucking hospital and covered in black sand. They come back home and they blog about it. Jesus started talking shit about each other. Valve doesn't give a fuck. They can do whatever the hell they want now. They made a lot of money, right? Well what they did was they made steam, which is essentially a publisher and like they just raking in money from that and they can do whatever they want game wise. There's just some next level shit up there, man. What have they created? A mood. Video Games have Valve Korea. They did a Dota too. Um, which is one of those mobile type games like League of legends. Halflife of core stand for multiple Liam multiplayer online battle arena. How's that kind of strategy? I would know that dare you lose in the New York crane. Firefly. Now this, how dare you?

Speaker 2:          01:28:44       There's a lot of people out there. Cliffy big dude. I could never live in fucking Seattle. No, it's just the gray man. You can never live in Seattle. Brian. I put a good enough up there. It is beautiful. I love it up there. Yeah. We, we, we jokingly look at like the whole weather app on my wife's phone. It's like, you know, San Diego, Sunny Raleigh, pretty good. Seattle, Gregg, Gregg, Gregg. Beautiful though. It's so God damn green cause it's so easy to grow shit up there. God damn the forests are immense. That's so incredible when you driving around up there. If he makes gray with green, you're still gonna get shit. I think people that,

Speaker 1:          01:29:16       I think people that go up there though, Brian, I think what they do is they just take vacations every year. Yeah. They go somewhere like really funny. Nice and sunny like Hawaii.

Speaker 2:          01:29:24       When you live in Ohio though, it's pretty known that it's the one in the gray skies I think. And then like percentage wise and it's Ohio. Yeah. And because it's just always cloudy, always rainy and I think it's maybe the number one. I hate to getting dark early. Shit. That's the worst.

Speaker 1:          01:29:38       Yeah. That doesn't bother me that much. I think it's important to have a mixture and I agree with you that I would way rather have California's weather where it's always sunny and pretty nice all the time. Then going back to Boston and deal with those fucking gray winters. Cause those winters were horrible.

Speaker 2:          01:29:52       Dude. What's up? Pressing? That was up there visiting a a while back and I was a, what's wasn't Quincy. We went to some other town, I can remember to visit. My buddy drew, who's a writer on bioshock and we're at an Irish pub and having a pint in some random girls talking to him and she was, and it was a really cute street right there. And she's like, ah, why do you think of a town? And I'm like, that's lovely. And she's like, why do you have Quia? I'm like, as I said, the town

Speaker 1:          01:30:13       shit is fucked her just to prove a point. Then she's thinking even want to query on show you Joe clear married dude. Well you should use a rubber dick. Then other respect. Then she carry rubber deck just to just to put women in their place. Yeah. There you go. Days of clouds. Seattle, Washington, 226 days of heavy clouds per year. Wow. That's 62% of the time. Portland, Oregon, slightly last Buffalo, New York. Slightly less. It's birds. Wow. Yeah, a lot of Ohio's. Yeah, it's rough. But you know what I was going to say is that I do think that California has the better set of weather, but I think there's some benefit to experiencing whether, I think there's a benefit to being in the rain. I think it's nice, it makes the environment better, it's healthier, cleans out the,

Speaker 2:          01:30:56       I like having seasons in North Carolina, if you have seasons of the year is fucking fly right by seasons are nice. It makes you appreciate the warm weather. And then, you know, in the middle of January we'll go to like the Caribbean for a week or two and just fucking in getting them, I'm a beach guy, dude. However, I was in Edmonton like couple of weeks ago and it was fucking zero. Yeah. And I came back to La and it was eight. I got a buddy of Louise's working at WB Games in Montreal. He, I did the, the new Batman game and he would tell me, he's like, get off his bus or get out of the subway or whatever, go into work and like the 10 minute walk to the actually get to the officer's beer would freeze. Yeah, that's totally hear such good things about Montreal. But like if I go up there to visit, it's gonna be in the summer cause I just, I'm done with winter. Right. It's just rough ice. Two gigs in Montreal in the winter. They should do while the comedy works. Montreal when I was living in New York would fly up there and it was, you know, minus 10 minus 15 did you ever have to adjust your ax depending on where you are? Do you like depending on like, you know, in French Canadian crowd for example, I should have and that's why I failed many times in those environments. Yeah, no. Yeah, it depends. You know, there's two of thought. One School

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       of thought is do something that everybody's going to like. That's the Jay Leno School of thought. Like, Hey, you know my contract, I could do my act anyway. Yeah, I can do it in the little kids. Then man, I have to take Samson. Jada guys didn't want to do the act that Jaylen Leno actually said to me. I asked him once about Bill Hicks Cause Bill Hicks road. So I'm like really mean shit about him and he's like, ah, I don't know. You know, a bill didn't want to do what everybody wanted to hear. They wanted to do what he wanted to do. And I think there's only one way to really get your audience and you have to like continue to do what you want to do. And there's going to be nights where the people don't want to hear that shit. It's going to be if they don't know who you are, especially if you have a dirty act. It's tricky situations. It's tricky to do. So a lot of guys would ride a lot of material that maybe necessarily it was more utilitarian, it served a purpose then it would be like their, their actual expressions throw that in there if it felt like it was going on.

Speaker 3:          01:32:50       I love video games, I love movies, but I so fucking love comedy. It's fun. Like I saw, um, Colin Cane Gilson him at all. No, I don't know Ellie based guy. He said he's up and coming and he sees like just imagine Dane Cook. If he was completely just filthy and massage, you just hurt my feelings. I'm going to pee. And why don't you? No, I'm just kidding. I like Jane. I'm friends with Tina. I started out with doing really, but I do have to pay. We talked to him. Yeah. Here's something interesting is that the tie the top 10 unhappiest cities, uh, which is crazy cause it's almost the exact same list that we saw that cloudy. Like the first one is Portland, Oregon. Second one is St Louis, third New Orleans, New Orleans, Detroit, Cleveland, Jacksonville, Florida, Vegas, Nashville. Again, Cincinnati to Ohio's Atlanta. It looked Raleigh's not anywhere on there.

Speaker 3:          01:33:38       Yeah. It keeps being voted. One of the top 10 cities, man. I was thinking if I could go anywhere I'd probably go Texas for the same reason why it's not as expensive as Austin, La Austin. Austin is one of my, my on my shortlist of other places. I'd love to live. Elijah Woods said Fuck La and decided to just move to Austin city. Really? Yeah. I was up there for south by southwest dude. That's my, one of my favorite cities. And that's why I call Raleigh Mini Austin cause it's like this little kind of like mini sea of cool in the middle of this GOP rolled state. And uh, you know, I'm fucking doubling down there. You know, it's like the coasts are great. You know, it's like if we go two hours away to the beach man and like you could just like the beach real estate in Carolina beach is like, you get a condo in the water for 300 grand.

Speaker 3:          01:34:16       Like it's, and then cause you, cause you got to Wilmington Wrightsville which is a little bit old money. Right. And like the same condo would be like 1 million bucks, but it's like, you know, you and you, did we go to the yacht club today or that kind of vibe? Right. I'd rather be hanging out with all the fucking rednecks is they're awesome. Why was just say rednecks are awesome. Well I come back in and cliff has been a totally different person. It's a strange why. Why was gears of war number two and number three never reported by the, uh, to the pcs but yet gears of war one and was, you know, a myriad of reasons. It's a, the only way to really succeed in that space at the time was to put something on steam and, uh, it was just man hours at the time. So it wasn't an easy conversion from the ECZEMA.

Speaker 3:          01:34:53       The controls also were, it didn't translate that well, you know, with the whole cover and everything like that. Has anybody ever figured out how to do a keyboard and mouse for console? Uh, know what they do is they just make it the twin stick thing. And what they do is they, they, they assist your aim without you really realizing it. And so it's called friction adhesion. So if I'm moving across her over you and halo, if you ever play it, it's slightly slows your cross here a little bit so it helps you and you're like, damn, I'm good. Cause it's actually pretty dope. If that was like real technology and actual war, you know, fight the cursory like found people, oh that bullet bullets that go around corners and everything if the the future and you know at least he saw that Darpa robot that carries or was Boston dynamics that can carry like 300 pounds for him.

Speaker 3:          01:35:31       Right. Exosuits and yeah. How about those fucking robot dogs that you can kick? Yeah and it won't fall down. They have a button motorcycle like that too. Yeah, I've seen that. Fucking impressive. We've got some wild shit coming out. My biggest problem right now is just data everywhere. Like a medic. We're all addicted. Did the feed. We're addicted to data, news, news stories like everything breaks. Things go viral and be like that whole instance that the executive producer for like the bachelor who was on the plane around Thanksgiving with the lady who was claiming that she was being a bitch and he sent her some drinks and told her to eat his dick and it turns out with the whole thing is fake. He just made it all up and it was too late. It had gone viral. There it is. Look, yeah, that's incredible.

Speaker 3:          01:36:07       It's crazy. Looks like a bunch of broken legs and Bambi. That's like some metal gear, solid shit right there. That looks like two men like facing each other to packages like the fake donkey. So weird like uh, like a couple of drunk college kids trying to move their futon or something. When those things are acting on their own, that's when we know that's going to be a weird thing. When you see those coming over the mountains of Pakistan with fucking machine guns on top of them or Amazon in the drones. We never really talked about that. The Amazon, that was more PR thing for them though. Yeah, because the amount of hurdles they'd have to get through for that to happen. Why don't you explain what you're talking about? Amazon was talking about using actual drones to deliver packages, which is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard in my life.

Speaker 3:          01:36:47       That would mean you would have to like a drone would fly a package to your house and drop off in front of House. And a lot of people thought that maybe that can happen in a hundred years from now or 20 years from now. But Amazon's kind of front and talking about how they're going to deliver dude with that. Only a person who has a gun is not going to try and shoot those fucking things down 30 to insure them. Right. All right. Well I'll get mad too. Flies over their property. Yup. Also just think about if this did start catching on, we would have to say goodbye to sunsets. We would not see the clouds or the sky anymore. We just have thousands of these little fucking robots flying around to dropping off tampons. But at the same time, dude, I haven't gotten into a target in a year. Right. True. It every, everything online. But yeah, here's the, uh, the packages come to this thing I guess. And then that gets picked up by a drone. Uh, so supposedly this is real because it seemed like a practical joke for the longest time, unless they're just planning an April fool's now. Maybe if it's not important shit, you could just fly it around like that. But it seems like, man, that's not really what shirt I and want to get my new espresso maker. Yeah. 30 minute delivery though is what you, they're trying to would

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       be even in Raleigh with Amazon prime. We ordered some shit in the afternoon. The next day, boom. Done. So this is real. Wow. This is fucking strange dude. I think it's them projecting like remember that old video, um, where it's like, have you ever, you know, second night to your kid or on a video phone you will write. That becoming became strangely true. I think they're kind of projecting a little bit further forward. People are going to shoot those fucking things. Even like kids with BB guns, dude. Yeah. I just want Amazon platinum where if I'm home, the take the shit out of the box and then they take the box and the wrapping away. Well you could actually just shoot the package. What you could do is like as the guys flying, if you had a high powered rifle and you're looking out the window, you can just take the package out from the sky. Yeah. Boom. And he delivers a package with a big bullet hole in it. Yeah. People are gonna get mad too if you're flying over their fucking house. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:38:44       Eh.

Speaker 2:          01:38:46       Well they, they're probably planning on urban areas originally, right. Where it's already normal black people urban. How did urban become black people done? What the fuck happened there? That's weird, right? It's very weird. Like the only like black people I live in cities or something like a euphemism for even just want to say is it's an urban crowd. They want to, they want to say black people if they don't want to get in trouble. So they say it's an urban crowd, but yet you go to urban outfitters and stuff is whitest place you've ever been. Urban outfitters is the opposite of urban. Right. That's the dumbest name for that place ever. It's a hot topic. It's a hot topic. Suburban outfitters. Yup. Yeah. How was that urban outfit? And we have to make a fucking agreement. I don't know what urban actually means. I mean I was scared to go in the store for the first five years.

Speaker 2:          01:39:31       It was open. That's racist. You thought you were going to get ganged? Yeah. For you. Horny free chains. Dude, I fucking hate the mall. I don't know if I'm just a grumpy old man. I just can't stand going there. Yeah, it's a good place to find stores. What do you hate about the mall? It's not forced to you and goes. Yeah, yeah, it's definitely inefficient. So don't go. I'm all about efficiency. Yeah, but it's cool. You could try clothes on, you know, buy things, clothes, clothes and food are the two things you buy in person. Right. Everything else. One click that in your phone. So we got off track, but I wanted to ask you like if you were going to buy, you said you would build your own laptop PC, but like when you buy one now, like what company do you [inaudible] we got the razor blade for the laptop.

Speaker 2:          01:40:10       What does that mean? It's just, it's a razor used to make like the Oh, the Razer mice. Yeah, same company. The laptop. And then they just crushed it with this one. It's a fantastic laptop. I met that dude, the guy who calls himself, raise your guy. Me and Lou Morton who, who's one of the writers on news radio and a couple other guys went to, uh, he had a bunch of prototype mice. That was back when they had that weird mouse. Remember how they had one leg? Yeah. You remember that thing or that is super accurate. They had like a 2000 DPI sensor long before anybody else did they, I mean it was a really sensitive mountain. Super, super play to the core. Yeah. But it was also, it would like, it was kinda getting old school because it was a ball. It was still a right and you'll get, wasn't laser y'all me shit up and get all the dog hair and boogers. And the problem was

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       they were trying to pretend that that shape wasn't retarded. Yeah. I remember they had that ridiculous, totally unergonomic shape. It was like a duck's foot. Yeah. Yeah. It was flat. It was weird. I used it though cause it was so god damn accurate put up with it. But I went back to, uh, do you remember the, um, that a gaming mouse, that logic tech gaming mouse. That was the shit. Is that the white one? No, the, the um, logic has, it was a gray one. It was like a mouse that was invented just for gaming and it had like this real small, almost like deer hook size, like, or cow hooves. So sort of this is the optic was an optical or, no, it wasn't. Not initially, but it was so good. It wasn't as fast as far as like picking up, but it felt so good in your hand that it made up for the fact that it wasn't as fast.

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       John Ramiro just went to like a 20th anniversary. I think it was at least 20 or 25 for a dune did. He's doing well, man. That was the guy. He was one of the, it was him and Carmeg and he was like the guy who went on to do that crazy game. Um, what was the fucking game it took back? What the Fuck Ramiro Ramiro to doom quake. Right. But after he left like a ton, I was fucking fun man. The game did not get enough respect. He was one of the first people to be progressively bullied by the forming internet. Oh. Like the other one wanted to hate him is too sexy. Beautiful. Drove around in Ferrari's and shit. [inaudible] pull up video of Dika Tauna dude, what does dyke aton I had like some really fun multiplayer, like the one on one and [inaudible] was really fun. The rocket, it was a little bit imbalanced.

Speaker 3:          01:42:23       Little rocket launcher. I'll go to Dallas and I stayed in my hotel downtown and I look at that building and it just, I see it as a cautionary tale for if I started a studio. Like be careful, you know, like, well you gotta explain to people that don't know what the fuck we're doing. Sorry. Sorry. So John Romero was one of the key creatives behind doom and quake, which are basically invented the first person shooters genre. John Carmack went to Oculus, by the way. That's another side note. I knew about that months in advance. They had to keep my mouth shut anyway, dropping information. He was like video games, first fucking rock star, right? He's the guy I wanted to be growing up. Right. And uh, then he started his own company with idas money that was made from tomb raider and he started in the heart of Dallas, got the biggest, most expensive penthouse suite he could find insane real estate.

Speaker 3:          01:43:03       And he did the whole Gary Oldman get me every one like hired way too many people, wait too many fast and basically overshot and his first game then it became so much money though PR disaster for him. Um, but deus ex came out of that, which is a fantastic series a, an Akron oxys just underrated little role playing game. I know so many people who work there and we're there firsthand and a lot of them still work at epic. What was the name of the company again? Ion Storm Ion storm. And they became infamous because an ad agency had made an ad, uh, that said John Ramirez in. But to make you his bitch. What is this bro? Yeah, I remember it down. What does this bride dyke, Katana, this is, it will, you'll be surprised how many old games the graphics don't hold up man. Oh yeah, but your memory of them, right? Yeah. I can't hardly remember, but I want him to see the multiplayer. If you could find it. It was really good. Multiplayer was fun. It was like old school. Um, quake one. Yeah. Remember how quake one was like really

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       fast and you would, you know, when you were running you were really running fast then quick to, they slowed it way down. I'm just, you know, there may be a market for a new one of those soon, if you know what I'm saying. He's winking at me folks and he's clearly heterosexual. He, he can't say, but he's working right now on something just like that. I think. Sure. You're going to tell me any more. It's a fucking materials, dude. I don't care. Okay. That's why I'm getting it. But it's how do you think you know people that these kids who play call of duty know what the proper like there's dot Qatada PC shooter is, I think a lot of kids don't these at these events. They're still playing counter strike and team fortress two look how bad ass this is. This is fucking, he had like a pretty good but a four barrel, like an 18 barrel shotgun called the shuts cycler.

Speaker 2:          01:44:37       Yeah, that was cool. You had, you started out with like a thing, you have your punch people and then you had to run around and I enjoyed those games too. We had to like collect the items, the time when the rocket launcher would reappear. That's the, and they'll look at the f like just flowing through the level. Right and anticipating the sound cues and knowing where they're coming from and the one on one battles and everything. Yeah. Well people who've never played these things, they really are never going to understand how much like thinking is going on simultaneously and movement of your hands and fingers. Like it's incredibly intoxicating. It is. It's not like people think of it as like, Oh, you're playing games. Like what are you doing? Pretending some fucking shit's going on. We'll, we'll go kill the werewolf. No, it's your, you're online in real time with someone, you know, that could be fucking anywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:45:21       And with the technology that we have today and you're playing this incredibly quick gain and get all your senses are firing and everyone's on mountain dew to that now. I bet they're all on Adderall. Right? I bet these kids are Adderall at the fuck up or I scoured energy drinks times three. Did they say that? Like a amphetamines and Fed Amines? Uh, we're like one of the best things that, uh, you could ever take if you were playing a first person shooter. Really? Yeah. Because you can get locked into like a really intense battle for a long time and you wouldn't lose concentration. I'm like taking him Pheta means to play fucking video games. Well, so what would happen? Imagine like with the, you know, if some of these twitch first person shooters become big in the east sports scene is they'll have to start screening for it.

Speaker 2:          01:46:04       Just like blood doping probably. Yeah. I would imagine you have millions of dollars at stake, you know? And if that guy has that extra edge yeah. You know, it's, it's the whole La Lance Armstrong thing, right? Yeah. I would think that there's probably some, I mean maybe it makes shitty judgements though. Yeah. You know, maybe that's too much. Maybe your, your two fit, but I know muscle memory, it's strategy, right? It's all there. But it's not just that there's also like, it takes away nerves in a weird way, you know? And part of competition has nerves, part of comedy. That's like a big thing in the, in the pool world and a professional pool guys used to take amphetamines, he's take pills and they would be able to play for 10 12 hours and they didn't have nerves. Like their nerves would go away because they were like, one of the things that crystal meth people do, they make terrible fucking decisions because whacked out of their mind, they don't even know that they're there.

Speaker 2:          01:46:51       Like they're barely aware of what the fuck is happening in front of them. They have a completely distorted perception of reality. Well along with that allegedly and apparently comes like an ease and competition because for things that don't require cardiovascular, like you would obviously had a heart attack if you tried smoking meth and playing basketball. Apparently for some people smoking meth or taking math and playing pool like works really well. Let's let's, you know, watching football and watching the kicker, it's like, you know you have one job. No pressure. Right? Don't fuck it up. That's a terrifying job though. You got a bunch of fucking gigantic super athletes running at you, dude for four forties I grew up like in New England as he know and sports were forced on my fucking throat by my brothers and I hated them and I was like, Hi Shane. I'm going around.

Speaker 2:          01:47:35       I'm like video games and a only like a few years ago, it's, it's just really started enjoying the NFL. You allowed yourself. I fucking love it. It's chest with 280 pound dudes. I would definitely like it. I just can't watch. It's too much. I have any time. Yeah, fair enough. It's like I spent too much time obsessing about a million other things if I wanted to get involved in football too. Yeah. Like I, I've tuned into those like Fox shows when they started having these conversations. Well Denver's got to get off the backend. What, what's going on with it and bowls. Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh doesn't fix this. I gotta get out of the, for me it's a whole, it's a whole new game to learn that I've ignored my whole life and I'm willing to admit that I don't know a lot about it and it's just, you know, I'm rooting for the saints because my wife's from New Orleans and they just did it.

Speaker 2:          01:48:12       Team has a lot of heart. Drew Brees is a fucking stud and it's sick excuse to drink beer on a Sunday and it's just fucking fun to watch, man. It seems like it's fun. I mean it's kind of like a gladiator type thing, you know, you're watching like some sort of an organized war. It's just, they don't actually kill each other. Just need steel balls to make it out to another, a couple of UFC events. That one that you and Charlotte, that was fucking amazing. That was a good one. That was a long time ago, man. That was a totally different experience than the UFC today. Somebody on Twitter was like, oh, you're going to, you know, show Joe Your Med knowledge of MMA. I'm like, I don't know shit. I'm like, I'm not going to try and fake it. Like I went there, I'd appreciated it. It was fucking fantastic.

Speaker 2:          01:48:44       And I felt like a savage cause like at the beginning I'm like, oh, this is so violent. By the end I'm like, fucking kill him. Get on. How dare you cliffy being someone's playing too many video games. Yeah. It shouldn't say kill him. That seems rude. The, um, the, the level of athlete, those very, very high. Now back then, I mean we were talking about what is it like 2005 or four or something like that. It was in Charlotte. It was a long time ago. I forget the exact year, but the level of athlete has gone up considerably since then. It's, it's right. Look at the old school videos of football players and how big they were and how fast they move versus these guys now, how much changes there have been though in the last decade? I don't know. Honestly it's a streaming. Is his strength training gotten better? I mean did the MMA is, it was, it's still a relatively new sport compared to the other ones and you're just starting to also, you're just starting to get like the real top end athletes to come over to MMA. Whereas before you were getting guys, you know, who may be like wrestled in college but they didn't have a professional outlet and in the UFC came along and some of them reluctantly went into the UFC. Now you're getting these guys that grew up wanting to be a UFC fighter.

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       That's cool. And they saw it from the beginning and never forget to what, why I like hearing the crowd, like get all crazy and cause somebody was coming through and realizing it was Dana White and like how they just, they just worshiped him and how fucking cool that was and how he turned that thing around and it's cool.

Speaker 1:          01:50:01       Yeah. Well there's a lot of factors involved, but without Dana it wouldn't have happened. And he's, he's a nut. He's obsessed with it and it loves it. I talked, we talked about fights last night for about two and a half hours. Wow. I called him last time we talked about the Mark Hunt fight and all this crazy shit that's going on right now. And next weekend

Speaker 3:          01:50:16       I, my buddies who were bar owners will deliberately not have the UFC fight on why? Because they, some of them believe that it attracts the type of guy who like wants to get in a fight that night. So two to three hours, you know, he's going to show up having some drinks and he's going to happen to a lot more than you think. I know a lot of bars in Ohio that does the same thing. They stopped having the fights. What bars do you know in Ohio? My friend owns a bar on that, that it's like a pool bar. I think they used to play there, but then they always had fights there so he's like,

Speaker 1:          01:50:44       wow. Yeah. Well man, you add alcohol, alcohol and a bunch of people watching people kick people's asses and getting their ass kicking. Boners yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:50:53       dude. Even in Raleigh at 2:00 AM at some outside some of the bars, man. And you see and get to fucking get you. Imagine if there was a club,

Speaker 1:          01:50:58       uh, men, women club were men and women went there where they just showed porn all over the place. They showed like big widescreen videos of people having sex. Did you imagine how, I mean, that would like turn rapey really fucking quick. Like very much like how the UFC, like if you have the UFC and a bar, people want to beat ass. If you had I think first of all peoples, it would be really interesting like as a study if he gets some scientist involved and seeing what me, you couldn't really manipulate people like that unless they volunteered. But how many more people who watch the porn wound up hooking up that night versus how many people who didn't watch porn and went to a regular bar? Yeah, I dunno actually that'd be fascinating, but I mean what kind of porn are we talking about? Hardcore like fucking gagging, Mascara, spit everything. There's a Martinez

Speaker 3:          01:51:46       that in Los Angeles, I think me and Duncan went there once and in the back that just showed a woman's gaping asshole in this day and it was just on a projection on the wall. And you're just sitting out there looking at this girl getting like, like wasn't like silver lake or something like that. Yeah, of course there's a bar called like a cozy car or something in San Francisco where like he just does he car. That's my nickname for him. Uh, but the cozy, cause they have like all the old playboy like, uh, issues and pictorials like laminated and the tables and everything that's kind of mesmerized.

Speaker 1:          01:52:17       Well that's Kinda interesting. The old ones especially because it's like you're watching a piece of history isn't even porn anymore when you know that that lady is like 80 now you are not beating off to that. I don't care how hot she looked back then. You know, there's very few people that beat off to pictures of naked and Marilyn Monroe is pretty issue was it says, hmm, that's ancient.

Speaker 3:          01:52:35       I had a friend of mine who just was in Delhi in India and she's speaking of like Raby and she just like, you know, she, she wore the full, very little makeup just full on, like showing no skin and everything. Shit. She said, how many times did she get her ass grabbed?

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       Didn't leave. Like one of them was like an official, like a guard at the Taj Mahal and uh, that was, um, Kimra Verde. But it's just a, my other friend who happens to be Indian was taught, we were talking about the Indian rave culture and she says it's same. It's fucking rough. How did it happen? How did it India become a place where all these gang rapes keep occurring? I mean, is it being over sensationalized in the media or is it really that fucking thing? What I gather it's, it's pretty, yeah, she felt very uncomfortable to share her. Her Facebook posts is like, you know, India, you were amazing to visit, but the, you know, some of the vibe I got was really a little unsettling. Wow. She just, she did like this world tour guys. Damn, that's weird. What is that? And it's, it's, it's very weird when you see it and it also coincides with a population of a billion people because I always assume, and this is just based on what I've seen in regards to money and how people treat each other, and when you have too many people, when you have like too many people, 20 million people, whatever, a billion people, you lose the value.

Speaker 2:          01:53:42       It's like, it's like there's no value in people. There's too many of them. They become invalue. They become, uh, they become a problem to be around. Epic had a, Ah, there's weird cultural things to epic. Had a partnered with 10 set before I left. As I said, I sold a bunch of stock and everything and we got this like, you know, what would you like to know if you're gonna release a game in China and here are things that are culturally allowed and things that are kind of you should avoid. And one of the things that was a big no, no, you couldn't have in your game was any exposed bone like ain't no skulls. If you had a Somby, like he couldn't see any of the bone in it. It's just, it was considered really like you can't do it for some reason. And the other thing was that if there is a certain type of fear, I remember what it's called, where you're afraid of, of densely packed holes like coral, like in to avoid those kinds of patterns in your game because a bunch of people get freaked out by that.

Speaker 2:          01:54:27       Apparently densely packed holes like coral, freakout, Chinese people. That was what the pad, the whole pamphlet said there's a name for it, something of phobia. Right. It's a coral, a phobia. It's not cause it's not just coral, it's like you know, any sort of surface that it's very porous, like that spongy type thing. Right. And that's a cultural thing. Yeah, it's cultural. I don't know of it existing in other places, but I think apparently when they have a billion people and you have, you know, 5% of the people affected with it. While you may want to, you know, keep that in mind. It is weird when you see how far people go off the track when it comes to like what their culture accepts and expects of each other. Like how bout Muslims where you're not even allowed to draw Mohamad if you draw him.

Speaker 2:          01:55:03       Yeah. You know, like little kids, Christian kids, they can draw a picture of God with a beard and the clouds do it as a part of their, you know, first grade there's a Dutch cartoon is to actually did it and like drew him with like a bomb turban at one point and he had like Fatois just issued for him at the park. Yeah, yeah. Cause you're talking about them earlier. Let's go. They got in trouble for it. Book of Mormon committed to, it's amazing that you could get that far though, that a culture can get me, you can call it a religion if you want, but it's basically a pattern and behavior, a pattern of behavior that a bunch of people are willing to follow. The get so far that if you write down or draw your guy that you believe in just drawn up.

Speaker 2:          01:55:37       I'm an atheist, but I have friends who are very religious and it's like whatever gets you through the fucking day, if you, you know, the thing is if you're not hurting anybody else, whatever it fucking works for you. You're like a Beatles Song, man. You know, you wanna, you wanna lead people fucking tell him, uh, you know what happens when you die. Yeah, that would definitely help you ever see the movie. Tell them that you found some magic shit. Yeah. You found some magic shit that I'm telling you. I'm going to sending me information. I, Hey, I'm just a conduit. I'm not, you're God. Yeah, but you're God's talking through me. I want you to suck my Dick. I don't know why people, people want something. They want to be a part of something. It's that tribal nature. Fuck those guys over there. Why? Because we're us in there.

Speaker 2:          01:56:13       Them. There's definitely that. Right. And did you even see it with a nerd culture where it's like, you know, are you a, are you nerdy enough? Are you a real quick, you're really using a Mac. Yeah. And it's Mac or PC. Same reason I'll tell my friends like what kind of hardware I have. Like in anything cause it's like, oh, you should get a so and so. It's too much. Or you're using the empty God. Yeah Dude. God to this. So yesterday like you know, getting like a TV for the gaming room. Oh, that one's too laggy. You shoot this guy and there's always a better one coming out. They should wait for it. Just not ever have anything fucking Neri cons. You have the both x-box nps for the new one. You can just start shit right now. So we're trying to get no, I'm just saying it did.

Speaker 2:          01:56:46       Do you prefer one over the other one? I'm all about Nintendo right now. Yeah, the new Mario is fucking fantastic. That new Zelda is great. I tried the Xbox with your TV though. Oh you don't have cable? Yeah, no, we just use like Netflix and Hulu and all that shit and we use Chromecast all studies in the future, isn't it dude? I just seems like it right at time one are made their own bed man. And you know, more and more people are cutting that fucking cable. Netflix works so well. Yeah, it's so well, I want everything streaming on demand right now. Hulu plus works so well. All of them work so well. I love, uh, I love iTunes. I don't, I watched the walking dead recently on TV. Oh my God. I wanted to fucking kill some parsley. It was every fucking 10 minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:57:24       It was a commercial. I was like, this is such a bad way to watch a, a gripping show. All of the sudden it's dancing potato chips and it's like, it's like from the fifties and sixties right. It's like a stay over. Well you know what it is, man. It's like television in the current form where you have to watch it. When it plays, you have to watch it live. It's like silent movies, man. It just doesn't work anymore. Yeah, it's stupid. Yeah. Well, so do you driving around La proper? Like the amount of signs I've seen for Netflix and Hulu original series, like it's totally taking over and they can take, they can take more risks in those areas. And same thing with the youtube explosion, right? Like you know, it's so many places are just getting like little warehouses out and like whatever, you know, city at to out here and they're just making gold like Freddy Wong's videos.

Speaker 2:          01:58:06       Man. Well, there's so many pizza huts. They're doing these weird videos too where they just stand in front of a camera and they start talking about something and then they have all these quick edits. It's like, you know, I grew up in this click edit and then into the well, and when I was a kid we like, there's almost like no room for air and, and they, they, they've edited like every breath or pause in between every word and they have this weird fast editing style. It's like the draw my life stuff also. Right. But it's really prevalent. Like what, how did that fast editing weird style of Youtube video becomes so mimic? Well, let me ask you a question. Like

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       for me, when I watch a youtube video, if like it doesn't get interesting. And then the third was the first 30 seconds I'm out. I'm like, I'm done. Just like Geeky let, let's get going. Yeah. I'm onto the next video. Yeah, I guess, do you know what I'd like to believe the number one youtube subscribe person is this kid. He's like, like finish or something as names like Pubi die. And he just streams videos of him playing games and talking about them all the time. He just gets insane views. That's weird on the dean. You suck. You can't predict it knows you're good bone structure. Rebecca, who's got finally released a sequel to Friday,

Speaker 1:          01:59:10       did she really? Cause I saw that online. Was that bullshit at Saturday? She really did make a song called Saturday. Come on man. And she put it online. Yup. Okay. Million views and later I didn't know that. Terrible. How bad is it?

Speaker 3:          01:59:23       Well she's kind of acting like she's a little hung over and she partied too hard. She's trying to get street credit. Yeah. Talking about getting, I'm thinking she needs the next one should be Sunday fun day where she's like drinking bloody Mary's getting all fucked up or their friends too and coke trying to stay up the side. Leading the cycle continues

Speaker 1:          01:59:38       blood under sox doesn't where it came from. I did not know about this. Oh hell yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:59:50       You're not in bed. Oh my God. Oh my God. This is real. So that sin too crazy. Oh, she's got like a Miley parody girl in here at some point, twerking and shit. You know what? Here's the deal though. This could have worked if it wasn't her.

Speaker 1:          02:00:13       Yeah. If they had no one in this video was singing and they didn't show anybody singing. There's enough people out there that are almost retarded that they would buy that.

Speaker 7:          02:00:25       It's the postmodern, Rebecca Black.

Speaker 1:          02:00:26       It's all like me and my friends from the Palisades. We're going to sit around and pretend that this is what we do. Well, we push each other on skateboards. We do when we're high on Ahcccs. Yeah, right. Like a cousin of mine, but my mom's clothes were all in the water. It looks like we're having fun, but actually Billy just drown and we're trying to find him or four who fell off the dock and we can't tell his mom because we have his car and he's fucking key doesn't work because it's underwater. Dude, fucking Internet, man. This is weird. He's like, dude, dude, dude, like couldn't find his pants. I mean, it's crazy. They're nutty. You know, she got up at two o'clock she told you it's two o'clock in the afternoon. Right. Going to bed at like five which didn't give a fuck. She went to bed at noon. She went to bed at noon and got up at two ready to fuck again. She's crazy. She's doing blow. She's fucking balloons full of helium up around music factory

Speaker 3:          02:01:15       dude. When we were in a that's like the, yeah, they're the ones who do all those meetings. Those vanity music videos for like the Bridge Orange County girls. What are those? It's like the Friday at all.

Speaker 1:          02:01:24       The company that it's called art music factory. They'll come to you though. So they, they, they basically your Bat Mitzvah, you get a music video or whatever. Right? Oh my goodness. Don't even play that Jamie. You fucked. Scare the shit out of me right now. I've had too much already. I'm starting to shake. It's like, like not drinking coffee and drinking cops all at once. I can't handle it. It's too much girl band. Yeah, there you go. Somebody tried to, somebody tried to tell me like I walked into a bookstore and the co why is, why are they playing one direction? I go, Eh, wrong question. The real question is, who the fuck do you know that this is one direction? Yeah, totally. God Damn grown adult. It's a cycle dude. Every 10 years, a couple years ago I'm like, oh boy. Bands about set to come back and Yep.

Speaker 1:          02:02:02       Just that trains on time. I, yeah, I just felt that and I saw it in Vegas for the first time in the elevator. I go, what is this? I had to ask my friends, what is this? Oh that's the new one. It's a new boy van Mike. How come I didn't see them coming here? And they're huge already. Like instantly. It's such a weird psychology for young girls. They like those very like androgynous dudes who were very nonthreatening of course, cause they're dabbling in the world of sexuality. You know, if you had a bunch of fucking Andre Arlovski lemonade fire open chess playing guitar, sticking their tongue out with giant rolled sock cock in their pants, like in leather, you know, tight pants, big giant thighs, custom made thighs, you know, it has to bother giant legs and is big snake like cock pressed up against this upper hip.

Speaker 1:          02:02:47       You know, that's too much for a little girl. It was just starting to learn our ways. Just starting to figure out what our friend means the end of every month and Japanese boy bands or even worse. I don't know if you've ever seen those. Oh yeah, I have. And K pop. There's a lot of weird and druggies shit going on with Japanese people. They, they're into a lot of weird androgynous shit. There was a guy who was an Androgynous, a kickboxer. He's actually very good. He was a, he was in the Mangia I guess that is some, some character or Manga. Manga. Yeah, that's how you say it. Yeah. Character Jessop but he was a bad ass. Kickboxer let me find out. Let me say like, give me shit. I'll kick your ass. Yeah. No, he was legit. And he was fighting in a k one max.

Speaker 1:          02:03:28       Dude, I saw a video. Did you know Seattle has this a law where if two people agree to fight there you, they can just fight in the street and then somebody falls and they have to stop. Say that again. What? So Phoenix Jones is that real life superhero? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's called willful combat or something like that. You combat and there's a viral video of him in the suit. Dude. He just would not leave him alone. Who's hammered in Phoenix? Just dropped him. Yeah. That's guys are fucking hilarious. Is that guy dresses up like a superhero and he's an MMA fighter. He's a really bad ass fighter. Yeah. Yeah. This is a woo shinny shin. This is the androgynous Japanese boy band. There's a whole thing. It's Korean. Are They Korean? I think this one is, yeah. Right. The same thing I like with they move. I'm going to tell you right now, I'm not ashamed to admit it.

Speaker 8:          02:04:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:04:14       Pretty good. Production values.

Speaker 8:          02:04:19       Yeah. That's K-pop.

Speaker 1:          02:04:26       Gotcha. Hero. Uh, Nakashima. That's a the dude's name pro. Pull up a video. Him, Brian, you, y. U. I. C. H. I. R. O. Nagashima k. One kickboxing is videos of him looking like a girl. He comes out with a dress on a skirt and a crazy wig on and he's dancing fucks people up. It's even cooler that he goes. Yeah, he's bad ass man. I've seen the dude fight a bunch of times and apparently when he first started he actually wasn't that good and got, you know, people were like teasing him because of his, uh, his outfit and all those shitty then two and then he got really good dude. That's fucked up. You play counterstrike with people who are better than you and you get better. Cliffy beats dropping knowledge, I think had to be the best you you can be. That's the PSA. The more you know, I think I went to his last a UFC fight. He hasn't fought since then. He was like, oh, this is against Kraus. He's probably gonna get fucked up below. Krause's a bad dude. Push it ahead though. Yeah, but look at this dance is like this. This is, he has this whole like choreographed thing that he comes out to. Holy Shit, he's the best he's fighting now but cross though. Who's a multiple time champion from Holland? I don't know who won the fight but I would imagine cross it have an advantage.

Speaker 1:          02:05:47       This is must be in Japan. They use the k one max was like a big kickboxing organization to deal with the fact that there was a lot of like really talented guys that were at a lighter weight cause Japa Japan put really high level boxing worldwide on the map with k one and then the k one was all heavyweight guys. So they went from that to a k one max, which is all guys. I think the weight limit was like, I think it was 160 pounds. I'm not sure, but like go, go ahead. So you could see him fighting this dude. He was bad ass man. Even though he, oh he got k the fuck out. I said, man, he's fighting Albert Cross. He's going to get fucked up. And I was correct. Look at this. Boom, Bang. There's your wig, here's your concussion. There's your skirt pull ahead, pulled way before that so you could see like some of the fight.

Speaker 1:          02:06:37       He's actually a good fighter. Just the guy he's fighting is like super, super high level. You really should never be in against this guy doing. He's like some blow out but he's, yeah, he's like a step below. But what they would do in Japan, they didn't give a fuck man. That's the first round two, that's 50 minutes and 50 seconds in the first round. Put it up to the beginning when Japan would have a lot of freak shows. That was one of the things that they had a real problem with with pride and uh, some of the matches they would do in k one they would put too many people that didn't have any chance at all together and they would have guys just get slaughtered. Just guys fight guys that they had no business fighting these dudes. And this is one of those instances. I is a beast. Crouse has been around a long fucking time too. I think he's probably got a hundred fights. He's fought like the best of the past to like high level competition and like this of like Holland

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       kickboxer and he kind of embodies that style. I think John Cusack's character and say anything had it right when he said it's the sport of the future. John Cusack was ahead of his time, Bro. John Cusak is great on Twitter by the way. Say that. Yeah, I've got John Cusak speaks his mind. He's a very intelligent and Rob Delaney of uh, Nona I think so maybe online, maybe on Twitter. My favorite thing was, uh, he tweeted a shrinking, uh, drinking come makes pineapple juice tastes delicious. And then I retweeted that and I got close to be right. I've got victory. It's the, he's flipped the joke though, cause it's supposed to say drink. I get it. I get it. Which was fucking everything. Everything he tweets. It's just amazing. Uh, it's fucking one of the best Twitter's out there. Why are you saying that Brian it disagreeing. Let my stomach hurts.

Speaker 2:          02:08:21       Don't, don't disagree Bryan, the shits rude dude. I fucking love him on Twitter. Okay. You guys are going to fight. I'm going to leave the room because I don't like to be here for this shit. Whatever you do, do not put your name and the word Kimmel and the same thing. All right. Do you won't find it anywhere? No, don't put his name in the word Kimmel. You're holding your tongue, Brian. You tell me this after the podcast then. Huh? Wait like there's something you're withholding. Nothing. Nothing. I don't follow them on Twitter. I don't follow him on Twitter, but I saw him on camel once and it was one of those performances. I guess he probably wasn't happy with it either, but it was so like, who is this guy? How did he get on Campbell? And then I looked him up and was like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 2:          02:09:01       He's huge on Twitter and everything and they had never seen his life. Comedy, twitters, you know, he got in early too. And I think Twitter is one of those things where you literally can go viral and just be a regular person who says something funny and one person sees it and they sent it to other people in. The next thing you know you've got a million followers. Poppins, a lot also is when Twitter first came out they, I guess they added to the people you should follow lists. Yeah. And there's so many people. Like I met a comic the other day that has like almost a million. I'm like, I've never heard of this guy. And he told me it was because that Twitter put him on some list once and then every time you signed up for Twitter you automatically just added him. So that's a good list to get on.

Speaker 2:          02:09:37       Yeah. But I mean the thing is is you, you guys know as well as I do like the risk of having a lot of followers. It's not necessarily mean there's a lot of engaged followers. Like I'll, I'll just click on, some people have like 2 million followers and I'll tweet something relatively funny and like it'd be like three retweets. Right? And then you get like somebody who has like, you know, 100,000 and then they tweet something really funny and next thing you know, 5,000 retweets. It's not a precise science, but it's fun. Yeah. There's a lot of people buy and Twitter followers and they don't really even get Twitter followers. They get like robots. Yeah. It just makes your number look good. Yeah. Bullshit. There's a website, you can look up people's Twitter names and see how many are real fake Bot. Oh really? They know how many got in trouble because he was buying a whole bunch of followers and they during the election. Yeah. But it's not bad. Is it bad to do? Like if someone does that, it makes them look less legit. That's what it makes it look correct. But yeah, because then, you know, you have a comedy club or somebody goes, wow, this guy has 2 million hits. That's a lot of people that we can get into this comedy. Take those numbers very seriously. It's what if you were funny guy,

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       say if you're funny guy and uh, people don't really know yet, but you're pretty good. And you find out that you could do that and then all of a sudden you can get work. I could see people justifying that would only work so much. You're funny already. I mean it's like, let's take a guy like a that people don't know, like, okay. Like perfect example, a Joey Diaz five years ago, five years ago, nobody knew who Joey Diaz was. If you could get Joey d as 250,000 Twitter followers and then like let a club know like, Hey, this guy, 200,000 Twitter followers, people love him. Okay. That seems like a lot. Okay, well let's try them and then boom. Yeah, but none of this, that's what we're saying is this, Twitter flowers aren't real. So they wouldn't come to this show. Uh, yeah. But they would get, he would get hired, he would get, it wouldn't work.

Speaker 1:          02:11:16       It would only work a couple of times until the clubs go, wait a second, you know, bringing in in the ass. Yeah. Maybe he had an offer to tweet about some sort of new Doritos for like money. Like how much I was like, how much free grand a tweet. Oh three granted, tweet for real. I could buy some dirty, no, wait a minute. Hold on. They pay you to tweet about Doritos. The offer. I couldn't do it. I was employed at epic at the time. Oh, that's interesting. How many people are getting paid to tweet and what is the most I need to start doing it. I want to make sure I'm not going to do it, but I'm going to make sure that everybody knows right now. I've never been paid to tweet ever. I've been accused of it before, but when I tweet about something, if I like it, it's just because it's cool.

Speaker 1:          02:11:53       That's, that's, that's the key ran and it's like you can start taking that money, but then you're Craig starts going down. You can't, I tell him, I don't think you can't. I can't. I was saying, unless it was something we could, but if you did then nobody would believe anything. If you're like, I like this thing. They were like, do you like it? Are you being paid for? Okay, well let's, let's have a, but how about a, for instance, what if you're a known enthusiasts of certain things like you like Nice cars? What if Ferrari says, hey, we want to pay you to tweet about the four, five, eight Italia. All right, it's fucking awesome car. You want me to just let people know that I think it's awesome. It's indisputable. It's awesome. I would do that. But you know, if someone stainless, so it's four five beats a little girly looking actually, how dare you?

Speaker 1:          02:12:31       How dare you? Are you an [inaudible] guy? Put that next to the event authority. That's a B. That's a bitch car. That's for guys. You need way too much tension. It's not good for you to an event to door. That's like silly. What are you Batman? What are you doing with that? Stupid. If it's blacked out to, you should see it in Raleigh. Dude, it's a funny, you have one of those, an event to door. How dare you? How dare you drive the Aventador and she drives the Giardo Llp. Five 60 to Bojangles. See the Giardo is much more realistic vehicle to be driving around event doors. That's a fucking Batmobile. It looks like. If you would ask an eight year old what his dream car would be, how fast is it? It's pretty fucking fast. It's was six to 16 2.8 is it scary to drive?

Speaker 1:          02:13:08       It's not as scary as the older Lamborghini's. They've refined it a lot. Traction, control and all that. Yeah. Yeah, they are. Conditioning works. Right? So if Aventador came to you and said, hey, we want to pay you, you would do it now they should pay me retroactively because I tweeted out of the damn thing all the time. They should pay you. Listen to how arrogant coffee be is. He wants money from Lamborghini. This motherfucker, he believe this shit. He thinks Lamborghini owes him money. Unbelievable. No. [inaudible] it's a niche business. You should be happy to support them because if it wasn't for Lamborghini making Lamborghinis, nobody would be making Lamborghinis and you'd be left out in the car with no Batmobile. Fair enough. What would you get if you didn't have that? Would you go Ferrari or do you think it's too girly? Mclaren. Mclaren, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:13:46       Mclaren is don't sound good. Yeah, that's a problem. These are, there's something missing. You know that new car. I've got up thing up Mclaren's new car. I've gotten this unbelievably classic poner too lately. Like the Shelby Cobra. Yes. And then I, there was one at a car show and I've learned at that the real ones go for like a million. Oh yeah. Like I had no idea. Yeah, but you can get a replicant. It's just fun to drive. Exactly. You know, probably better. You can get a bit better brakes and shit. Everything as well. Those guys would get those old muscle cars and they have them stocked. Like I get it. You're driving like a little time machine. I like, you know, you like the fact that it has like shitty steering and shitty breaks. Safety man. Safety is fine. Yeah. It's like a rhino on rollerskates and those fucking, I'm fucking like a, I lost my fucking nephew a couple of years ago in a car accident.

Speaker 1:          02:14:28       I'm just like fucking safety. Safety, safety man. Well, people have asked me about this recently, I think I've talked about on the podcast, but I got rid of this Barracuda that I had because I was driving on the highway and I got home, I pulled into my driveway and I was, I was making a turn. All the sudden the suspension came detached from the frame and the front wheel went sideways and stuck up into the fender like at a nowhere. I was just turning, I mean I was in my driveway, there wasn't, there was nothing crazy I was doing and I was on the highway just minutes before that going like 70 miles an hour. And if that flew off, I easily could be dead right now. And so I got it all fixed. Look at that fucking thing that it's sexy as shit, right with yellow and black like that fucking Bumblebee from hell.

Speaker 1:          02:15:10       That's awesome. So I got it fixed perfectly. I brought it to a place that it was too low. It was bottoming out and the bottom of the bolt was hitting pavement on a regular basis. We broke off actually. So I had to have the, I have the whole thing reconstructed, done correctly, and then got rid of the fucking, the Lambo is, have the button to raise the front up by like four inches. There's a company that's doing, um, um, a VX challenger and it's fucking bad ass man. They've figured out a way. Is that an Vieques XV XV challenger? Hold on. They take these old cars like old muscle cars like barracudas. Yeah, that's it. Pull this thing up. Xv Challenger, they take these old muscle cars, but they put a modern suspension in it. It's completely designed just for this car. So they figured out how to take these old, like really heavy cars and just completely redesigned the suspension to her. Drives like a corvette, but it looks like an old muscle car. Oh look how wicked. That's awesome dude. Have you seen the other then? He's sting rays gorgeous. Oh yeah. It's incredible. Like for just American muscle mass sport, the uh, the guy who does the smoking, tire.com, the, uh, he does a bunch of videos for drive as well. And drive tuned. He, he sent me a tweet about it immediately. He's like, he, you got to

Speaker 2:          02:16:29       find out how you can get in one of these things is the most incredible car that corvette has ever built. It's insane. It's just gorgeous. Like nailed it everywhere. They nailed the interior. They nailed the exterior, they nailed the specs. They nailed the performance. They nailed the build quality like people are driving and going, this is like a fucking masterpiece. This is those. Those Audi sedans lately are just gorgeous too. Well, GM has been knocking it out of the fucking park lately because they also have the new Camaro and then the Camaro z 28 which they just released, which goes around the Nurburgring as fast as a Porsche nine 11 turbo for like less than half the price. It's the scariest, fastest car I've ever been. It was a benign 11 turbo, one of my older coworkers. That thing was just fucking terrifying. Yeah. I had one of those at one point in time.

Speaker 2:          02:17:12       I had a m nine nine six nine 11 turbo, which was the first water cooled one broke down like crazy. Fun fact is a, they used my event doors sound for some of the reference for the new Forza game. Well that was one thing that Lamborghini got right is the sound Lamborghini and for Ron shoot out the back of it. When I, when I get past 80,000 rpm. Yeah, there's a video where you uh, guys cooking a sausage using the back of an invented door cause so many flames were shooting out of it. My wife's like, honey, you may not want to read that at the gas station. That's bad ass. I would done it. And what is the, um, the actual horsepower? God, it's like six something, six 98 or something like that. Apparently there's a game where, and I haven't done it yet, where you, you put a hundred dollar bill on the passenger, like dash and tell them if you can grab that in the next four seconds, he can keep it because the, the forest is so strong. Really? Wow. Well it's a honestly, man, it's way too much. It's orange. It's just driving an orange car. You silly bitch. I do. How dare you to actually be matte black. Maybe. Dude, I've caused the accidents but people gawking I bet that's it right there. Right? Here we go. He's going to cook the sausage.

Speaker 9:          02:18:22       Oh, that's a cool dad. It's all digital. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:18:26       there we go. Wow. That's insane.

Speaker 9:          02:18:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:18:34       I changed my mind. That's probably the dopest thing I've ever seen. I'm a child. If you show me flames coming out of the car, you when dude the doors, like it's like you roll up somewhere and it's just like opening that thing and get, now it's just like the, you know, kill bill music plays down. Do you like driving it though? Is it a fun car to drive? It's not as fun as the guy. A LP five 60 cause you got a nice like 75 degree Raleigh Day. Put the top down in that thing and it was just golden. And the thing is, you know, you can I speed just in short bursts very carefully. You know, like, because knock on wood, never had a ticket to any of my sports cars ever. Well they're fun. That's what people don't realize. Like they're fun to just drive around and necessarily even have to drive fast.

Speaker 2:          02:19:12       Just take it a corner of 35 miles an hour in a car like that. It was really fun. The best thing to do in a car like, oh, what is that Brian? It's one of those cars. Yeah, but why is it all fucking get weirded out now? It's just [inaudible]. Oh, they tried it out. It looks, she's like, she's fucking terrible. It's, Oh my God. It was a Chris Brown or white or men. I think it looks pretty dope. That out at me. That looks like a Batmobile car. If that was all the sudden matte black, it's Phoenix Dillon's car. Yeah. If I was a girl, I'd fuck you if you had that car. All the, uh, the charcoal matte gray ones. Yeah, they're fucking gorgeous. The charcoal mask gray is a dope. That makes a lot of shapes look pretty bad in America. You were raised, you know like women are raised with the sooner you're going to be a princess and get married some day program with that as a guy, you know the Italian sports cars, you know the, the posters on the wall, right?

Speaker 2:          02:19:59       Like it was always the, the Lambo and the Ferrari and the Giardo getting, when I first got that, it was wonderful and I was fucking so appreciative. But when I got the event door, like it's the first night I just kind of sat in there like when I, you know, at the end of the night I just went down and just sat in it. My wife sitting there looking at me and she's like, are you gonna fucking cry? And I'm like, we ready to cry. I was a little bit, if a glimpse into the sensitive part of cliffy Alma giant pussy, you were about to cry cause you achieve dreams. Yeah. Did you cry in her arms and just say babies maybe holding be even worth anything? I tell you what, dude, in the grand scheme of things, my Australian shepherd costs how much lesson has given me so much more joy.

Speaker 2:          02:20:34       So then your car? Yeah. Okay. Not then your wife. Okay. We were in the middle of that. Yeah. I was like, how dare you sir. How dare you. Oh God, no. That's a fucking expensive Goddamn Carson. That's like a half $1 million and that's supposed to be just driving around and a half a million dollar house. It only has two seats. It goes zero to 60 in three seconds. See though, you should see the, the trunk. Oh, is he actually find the boot? It's hilarious. Can you put your Dick in there? It was a big trunks. I put my bike in it. Whoa. Well, no, I've easy. Clearly a big bike. Do you have a big car like that? You obviously have to have a small cock, so no, that's, that's the people who don't have that car wanted even want to think. They want to think that there's gotta be some way that not having that car is better than having that car.

Speaker 2:          02:21:22       I knew a dude in Raleigh, he had this gorgeous Red Maserati and a, and he would always take it out to the clubs and real and a EA. One time dude had a Sunday fun day and cops tail them. He wrapped it around tree fighting died and his wife, his fiance was pregnant at the time. Oh Jesus guys. Fucking, that's my thing. That kind of, those, that kind of thing, man. It's my silver reminder. Like first off, don't fucking take the car out to the club and second off, uh, just be careful man. Yeah. Don't drive like an asshole. You can enjoy your car and not drive like an asshole thing to do those cars do. Did you go underneath an overpass is to downshift. Yeah. It's like a make fucking fighter. Roll the window down and listen to the noise and any car with a nice engine. Yeah. That's my fear about the future, man. I just, you got connected, you have touch screens, you have electronic cars, the Teslas. Gorgeous. Right. But it's laying noise. You want that feedback, that room, you know? Yeah. Well, that's the thing about the Mclaren, like we were looking at the car. It's absolutely beautiful but the sound it makes is very uninspiring cause it's turbocharged. It's like turbo charged cars. They just don't have that same sound. You Watch after Paul Walker died, the uh, the, the top gear of the Porsche Carrera, I

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       saw the top gear a long time ago where I took the stig all morning to get around the fucking track once and that was a gorgeous car to well it's a very scary car. Yes. It's not a car that's easy to handle that, that mid engine design. Extremely high horsepower, very low weight. There's a lot of room for the tires to break loose. Like one of the things that like about a Porsche or a BMW is one of the things that are really good about is they're really good about engineering their cars so that the, the car doesn't overwhelm the suspension. Like even when these incredible cars they have today, like the new nine 11 turbo, the turbo ass go zero to 60 in 2.7 seconds. Yeah, it's insane. Yeah. Dual clutch. That's all they make. They don't, they don't make you a manual and the turbo anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:23:11       And they're saying zero to 60 time honestly instantaneously. But they, they don't let you even buy a manual anymore. Yeah. And the, the suspension is fucking staggering. The back wheel steer now they have steering back wheels and the Porsche nine 11 turbo in on the gt three and the braking power and you get to a super car like that. So it's, for me, it's like as a guy who knows nothing about technology other than what I've read, like I have zero skill or knowledge or education in technology. So when, when I see stuff like this, to me it's just like a totally new world, a world of, of fascination and accomplishment. And what we're looking at it right now is, is the roadster for the Aventador. And here's again, the problem is taking these into the fucking panels off and, and you've got to put them somewhere.

Speaker 1:          02:24:00       The actually the, they actually will fit in the boot of the car. Uh, but this guy's not doing it. This guy looks like he's about to die too. And that's what you look like when you can afford an event a door, either cliffy B or some dude who's been working some slave job for Lehman brothers your whole life and you're ready to die and that's when you finally say to your wife, fuck you bitch, I'm buying this fucking car and she's has think about guys who have to have a man cave. I'm like, really? You get one room in the house? Wow. It's okay. I can ask for sometimes cliffy be not everybody can be like you. I'm cries. A lot of people that they, they have to settle for what they got or maybe they, they're fucking over their head. That's also possible. Like a guy who's like a not very good looking guy has a really good look and girlfriend, who knows?

Speaker 1:          02:24:41       She's really good looking. So this poor bastard, he can't go. I'll cliffy be style and drive around in the event a door. He's got to play things real close to the chest to try to keep this fucking, it's like he wants to make sure that she hasn't run fair enough. What she's gotta do and didn't call up the uh, the roadster Aventador roadster and pay him like a pale baby blue. That's the wonderful car man. Yeah. Aventador roadster. Roadster. But look up uh, like blue cause there's this like metallic kind of almost Carolina blue that just looks like it belongs it like in Miami. Just crushing it. Just gorgeous. That's my next target. Aventador roadster. Yeah. Now do you ever drive a cars with a manual transmission? My Viper was, that's my favorite there to drive. Stick on. I learned to drive. Stick on Tim Sweeney's a Lamborghini.

Speaker 1:          02:25:28       Even if you're not driving fast, it's just more fun. And the, the thing about the Lamborghinis and the Ferrari's is that gated shifter boy that's going to be, that's going to be like, people are going to miss that. It's a click, click, click, click thought a lot about die hard gear heads doing. But I'm not going to front and say like, I know a lot about the car. Like I'm not like that. I just didn't know it goes right. I just love it cause it's just gorgeous. Jon Lovitz let me drive his car way back in the day when we're on news radio together and he had a Ferrari three, five, five and it was, uh, the gated shifter and I, it was a convertible too. And I was driving, I was like, this might be the coolest fucking car I've ever been in in my life because the sound was incredible.

Speaker 1:          02:26:06       I was like, this sound like makes me feel better. It's like, it's intoxicating. It really is. Click, click, click, click. It wasn't even about driving. It's super fast. That's a McLaren roadster. That's fucking dead. That's the, that's the Aventador is it? Really? Yeah, but uh, it's all shaky video. Why is it so shaky? I know, right? State still bitch get a better phone. But the start button on the event door has a little like red cap over it. Like a fighter jet. You have to lift it up and press the fucking button. I love it. Everything's in Italian as far as like, but you don't have, it doesn't say gas or fields has been Zena. Ooh. And it's just that. And when I bring friends in the car, I'm like, would you like to do the honors of pressing the fighter jet button and it just, you have to start, you have to start it like once a week or the bad or the battery doesn't charge or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:26:52       It's the alternator I think so. Like if you don't have a plug in your garage and you go wait, start at once a week. If you don't run it on an average once a week, it happens. All supercars dude. Really? Yeah, like for ours as well. They'll just bricked and you've got to kind of get a jump. That sounds ridiculous. Yeah. Biggie was right. More money. More problems. Yeah. Well you could always put a trickle charger on. I can't yet. He could. Yeah. That's just probably your electronic system is draining because it's made by Italians. Silly pitches. If you've got to fucking one of those Lexus LFA supercars those a half a million dollar Lexuses. Have you seen those? Oh, that's their attempt to make the first supercar right. Did an amazing cars. It's not that good looking. Yeah, exactly. The look is just not feeling it. Well, it's kind of ironic because it, it's similar performance wise to the Nissan Gtr and like, it's like you look at the numbers, they're very commensurate.

Speaker 1:          02:27:38       Yeah. And then it's like the, if you look at the, looks like it's not much better looking than Nissan Gtr, but then you look at the price and it's like, it's a half a million. The Nissan Gtrs I still have to import the gtrs cause those were only making them here. Now I got a couple of buddies, they swear by them. They're just great cars. They're amazing cars. Nissan GTR is one of the greatest cars that people have ever designed and created for some friends whose logic people love the NSX also. I had one, I had two of those actually. Yeah, I uh, I had one, I got rid of it, I got the Porsche, the Porsche broke down like five times. And then I've got another NSX and that put a supercharger on it. When I had the Aventador delivered, it was the first one in North Carolina and they only had the trailers for the other types of cars and it got stuck in the trailer and they couldn't get it out.

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       And so the drivers didn't know what to do. So I called my buddies a couple of big boys and they basically got some dish soap and were able to kind of pry the car out by putting dish soap underneath the tires after it pulled up and pulled back cheese because it came from Greensboro and it had like kind of wedged itself in the trailer and that you could, you couldn't do the Austin Powers 15 point turn. Wow. They, yeah. And actually won it with a couple of little minor scratches on it, which the dealers, of course, it's served me that when I have it serviced I can put it on a truck and ship it to Greensboro. I had both of them even need them surfaced. The GTR is actually made at one factory in Japan and they make them by hand. And uh, apparently they lose money on the car.

Speaker 2:          02:28:57       Wow. Really? Yeah. Well, there's a how it's made for a Lamborghini or dateline went behind the scenes and how it was all made and it's all dudes handmaking it the factory. And for some reason all women doing this dish of work and he just did the tour of the factory. That's how it should be. They should be making sandwiches to cliff. You'd be Joe that's misogynistic by amine and he said by a blackbird instead like a Yak. Blackbird. Yeah. Cause I mean that's probably the same amount. Like what are you talking about? Those customers? Billion Dollars. You knucklehead. Those are like $1 billion at the SR 71 yup. Yup. Deconditioned. Yeah. Yeah, but you'd probably get a used one transformers three I think a Nissan GTR black edition. $109,000 and it probably feels just as fast as I fucking think. Not really, but it's pretty goddamn fast.

Speaker 2:          02:29:41       Those cars are insanely fast. I love sending my wife around town in the white top down and people just lose their shit. You love sending her out there. She had cock holding. So what's happening? What are you saying? He likes sending her out there, she's running errands. Just get all that attention. He'll calm down. You need to BRCA her up man. Keep her up locked up in a castle somewhere. Whatever. What are the MMA fighters grabbed her ass after the eyes when you were in Charlotte. That's shocking. A cage fighter because I don't even understand what you're saying and make it sense man. Yeah, we're willing to that bowling alley. Lucky strike down there at the Charlotte. Charlotte's a good towel man. But it feels about his hip as the bankers that built it really doesn't have a lot of hard cause they built, they've fucking destroyed it.

Speaker 2:          02:30:22       All the old buildings and just rebuilt new shit. So you feel like you're in the matrix. So what is Raleigh as opposed to Charlotte? Raleigh's more down home or Ali's uh, it's just, you know, a lot of the developers have embraced the history and a lot of the restaurants, you know, they leave the old brick. They don't knock the whole thing down. You know, we were talking about the, uh, there's a bar right next to Charlie. Good Nights, I guess. It's actually downstairs from Charlie goodnight's Rodeo bar. They have like the fucking mechanical bull and shaking, uh, city limits and me and Ari and Brian, were you there too? I think in Eddie Bravo two we were there doing standup and we went downstairs and they were all singing along to this song and we were all looking at each other like, like, like redneck woman or something.

Speaker 2:          02:31:02       It's like the scene in the dawn of the dead where, um, you know, like the guys in the car and the zombies all, all around and like he's the original dawn of the dead and he's like, Holy Shit. Like there's zombies everywhere and they're just starting to realize that that's what it felt like when we're in this bar. I guess we're, we're by ourselves and then we hear the song coming on and they don't know the words at all, but everybody starts singing along and they haven't got my pickup. Why do you drink? Get Drunk? No, no, no. It was, it was not something that was popular. I mean, it was popular for them, but it was, these are people that I had no idea who the fuck these people where they never, we used to do bikini bull riding there. They knew the summons though, man.

Speaker 2:          02:31:43       It was like, like top 10 country type shit that they knew. And I was like, well, this is like, this is where the country audiences are. A lot of the main countries. It's a lot more rock than anything these days. Like rascal Flatts, Keith urban and it's, it's a little country, but it's a lot of arena rock. Whereas I'm saying just like Keith urban and uh, and rascal Flatts and those kinds of bands. Durban is like arena rock. Dude. I went to a couple of his shows is fucking fantastic. Yeah, look at that. Brian Ebay. Oh, it's only a billion dollars. That's just the tail rudder. Oh my God. It's a tail rudder. Yeah. That's all it is. And it's sold for 1 million. Oh, did it? Like was it from a plane that crashed? Uh, let me get some historic, yeah, it looks like a warehouse in San Diego. I said the pride, they didn't that day.

Speaker 2:          02:32:23       Oh my God. Is some like Saudi prince is going to buy that from making his coffee table. He's going to jerk off on it every day. That's what America, Jesus, that's a weird thing to buy for 1 million bucks. I feel like you could do better right by an oil platform. Decommissioned one to start your own country. That's not a bad move. How much is an oil platform? It doesn't work anymore. Um, expensive but not as expensive as you think. I've read articles on it were really, yeah. People like you don't take the deep mission and wanting to come to have their own currency and make their own country. There was an article on vice, uh, it was a video. Yeah. Everything cool is, there was a video on advice about, um, this woman who goes by the name of neuro soup. Um, she was a, she was a stripper and then she got involved.

Speaker 2:          02:33:08       This guy who was an ecstasy dealer and it's, it's a really crazy fucked up, twisted tale involving murder and all kinds of nutty shit and FBI and um, she was living with this guy in a fucking bomb shelter, not a bomb shelter, but like a, a missile silo. They had converted a missile silo silo into this like really beautiful high end luxury house seats with it. Cause it's multi tiered, right? Yeah. Yeah. Something all underground. Yep. Missile Silo here. I'll Google it. But um, she uh, you know, she has this incredible story like the got kidnapped her and like he was going to kill them. It's like the guy was just gacked out on fucking drugs and he was selling drugs and he was also like in cahoots with the DEA or the FBI or something like that. He was working under cover while he was selling drugs.

Speaker 2:          02:33:54       Yeah. Dude, if I have, if I ever want to get anything done, I don't go on a device like the Liberia documentary they did about general buck naked. Yeah. Cause you remember he, that he made the, the chemical sector and you pick a Mormon. But he was a real fucking guy. Yeah, he was. Yeah. That guy's a scary fucking guy, man. Now he's like a reformed and he's like a preacher or something now. Well, not only that, he's killed thousands of people and they absolve them of all of his murders because he found Christ and he

Speaker 1:          02:34:17       was talking openly on vice about eating babies. Yeah. And eating hearts to cutting the hearts of the innocent children and drinking their blood to make them victorious in battle and their strength and shit. Like whoa. And then they went into North Korea at one point on vice, like it's just nonstop, like crazy shit. Yeah. This is a video. The vice video is available online. It's a Hamilton Morris is a Pharmacopia Hamilton who's been on the podcast before. He did a video about it, but there's an actual article that may have not been on vice. That's about it. So you've just do a little googling, you'll find it. But the story is absolutely incredible thing is you're, you're, you're crowd sourcing interesting stuff through your Twitter verse. Yeah. Well, they get you in touch with stuff that you probably wouldn't find on your own and in turn you get them in touch.

Speaker 1:          02:35:04       It's sorta like a relationship that you know, bees pollinate things and you know seeds eat a grapefruit, you take a shit, the seeds go into the ground and they grow grapefruit. Symbiotic. Yeah. This, this symbiotic relationship that we have with people on the Internet now, if you exploit it correctly or you utilize it correctly is a better way of using it. It's incredibly rewarding to tweet up anywhere a tweetup what's it? Yeah, we just tweet. You're going to be at the fucking mall on Thursday. Good way to get touched. Yeah. Fair enough. Net Buddy. I'm not into that kind of shit. I know what you're saying. I think you think, oh Hollywood people are like that. I see, right? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:35:35       What is it that girl said last night, she's like trying to get you to fix her hair. The wash. It's a good way to say it. And then she's like, oh yeah, I know. It's weird. Nobody does this la or something and like, okay, fix my hair. Like the California thing. Joe, go to the fucking salon. Seriously touching your fucking greasy hair. Weird pitch, but your lights, your head lice. My favorite California thing is whenever you know someone's come from California, because in the first 30 seconds they tell you something incredibly intimate, intimate about their life. Like, Oh yes, I used to be addicted to drugs or like I was molested and I'm like, that's why they're here. Dog Burden me with this shit. I don't want to know that

Speaker 1:          02:36:07       sad, but that's why they're here. Yeah. You know it's weird because this is also the, obviously people create all over the world, no doubt about that. But when you come to like creating things that get attention, this is like the hub of the universe, creating things that get attention. It's almost all in Hollywood. It's like a big chunk of it. Whether it's movies, TV shows, Blah, blah, blah, blah. Well who needs attention? People that didn't get enough or people that got too much of the wrong con. Yeah. And those are the ones that seek out and seek out validation. So they all come here. It's so weird. Mathematical process.

Speaker 3:          02:36:38       Oh, always loved Angelina, I believe. Uh, he always left her. Now the whole blonde bombshell just put up fucking billboards of herself and became famous just for that. I saw her the other day just picking her nose and eating it and then you posted something about, you saw somebody picking your nose and eating it like the day after. And I'm like, what the fuck? That's hilarious. I love that pink corvette veteran lady in

Speaker 1:          02:36:56       a wig. She was a on the PCH. The Topanga to the PCH on the merge were stopped at the light and I looked behind and I watched this old lady in a wig just dig, pull out, I'll whopper and just start chewing. I mean, she was openly chewing mouth open chewing and I was like, wow. And all I could think of course for the rest

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       of the day who that? She probably came over here in 1955 and she wanted it to be a star and she was hot and it just didn't work out. And now she's wearing a wig on the PCH chewing or burgers and her, her blue Saturn with fucking faded out paint. It was very weird. Watch it. I thought it was a touch. She always drove a vet. Now that's Angelina. She did. He saw Angelina. I saw some random crazy lady with light blue Saturn. I do that with people. I like try to piece together what their story was. What's, what's it. That fucking mind always goes down to drugs and blow jobs. The stories all of very unoriginal. They always, you know, somewhere along the line someone blew Burt Reynolds. That's always in my stories. What's that fucking water that they're advertising all over la one 38 or something.

Speaker 2:          02:37:59       They just like billboards. It's just like hot hot chicks and some bottled water. I didn't have enough. It's like a banks I think thing or something. Are you serious? I haven't seen it. And then the pop, the bubble head renders on the bus benches also with an la proper and it's bottled water. Sexy water is the best water. You don't even drink at Vons, bro. Terrible for the environment, but bottled water is, somebody showed me a photo of a place in La that just serves water like and like you pick your water and they described the spring that it's from. I'm like, oh, those guys are assholes. Elling so hard right now. That's not true. That's gotta be a parody. Tim and Eric Shit. Yeah. What's your color? [inaudible] water. Clairvoyants wait a minute. Cool. Blue Quill. Clairvoyants what? Why does it say clairvoyants you trying to tell me that I could read minds with your fucking, I think that's what it is.

Speaker 2:          02:38:45       It's the bottle is different colors. So you just, what does it say? That's the color of that. What does that one say? Fuck. Vitamin water. Well that one says clairvoyance to, they all say clairvoyants look everyone you click on and what does it say? Also sexy something. What? Sexy. What does it say in the middle? She's as you scroll and Freak. Hold it in place. Oh my God. Where are you going up? The actual thing, the logo itself, it's like he's in a connect, bossy black and what's below that? Clairvoyance. But it was say it said sexy. One of them was sexy. Something like, that's one of the colors. Placebo. Water. Come on, you're telling me your water sexy. You fuck that shit will drown you. Sexy Sunshine, yellow a waterboard you and find out what you terrorist information. The first fashion water, we'll find out which one is sexy so I can make sure I never fucking drink it ever again.

Speaker 2:          02:39:32       Sexy, sexy red. Fuck you. How about that one 38 water. Sexy read you. You silly bitches are giving them a plug. That's your name. You come for the water. Sexy red. Fuck you. How dare you. I dare you treat me like I'm not stupid plant man. I just wish I had some sex. Can't get any sex, dude. Nobody wants to give me no sex, but it didn't go by some sexy red water. Is She a part of this? She's drinking. It's like I take it back. She was very pretty. My Buddy's dating seems nice. She's a sweetheart and don't drop names on my podcast anymore. It's making me uncomfortable. Then your buddy. Okay. I was trying to be what? It's Dana. Really? Yeah. She's just fucking cool. So have you seen them together? Yes. I'm sure he's not paying her because if I was a girl like Adrian Currie, what I would do is I would start a service to make people look cool.

Speaker 2:          02:40:21       I would just hang out with them. So I'd say I'm just dating dating this guy. Now that doesn't make any sense a fair enough. It doesn't make any sense. It's not fair enough. I'm just showing you. I mentioned that cause it's like if somebody had a problem with her and be like, well I knew her. Just don't be mean. Oh you were defending her without her being attacked. That's beautiful. I'm a white knight knighting. Get advanced fucking Internet. You're getting a white knight in advance. That is one of the grossest things about the internet. Is it not the White Knight? What's the White Knight? The white knight is a chest movie from the 80s it's the guy who's like, oh guys are being misogynistic to you. I'm going to come in and save you. Yeah. They always want to assure you that there are different to them. All the other men, there's other men out there are assholes.

Speaker 2:          02:41:01       So here's just a, an acquaintance of mine started a website called fat ugly or slutty.com and so the idea is if you're playing an online video game and you're actually a female, they assume you're either fat, ugly or slutty. Well, it's a weird thing where people like want to profess the fact that they don't hate women. Like they'll have it in their Twitter handle. Don't hate women, you know, I don't hate women like Duh, like how many people do like is it, isn't it like more likely less people hate women than more people hit women? The fact that you have to actually say that, it seems like what are, what are, what numbers are we working with? Like, I mean is it what, what a percentage of people hate women? Is it even won? The thing about women in the video game industry is having personally known many of them.

Speaker 2:          02:41:43       The stories I fucking hear from them are fucking horrifying. Like what do you mean? Like, as far as like harass me, all that shit. Of course they're working with men, men, soc, but that's not my point. My random dude's living presence on their desk. Anonymous Lean Shit. Ooh, that's creepy. Especially you take that home and that presence got a remote control camera. Yeah, exactly. Oh, it's, hey, I need my little nanny bear. You have the GPS. Yeah. Well let's, that had that, the hacking of, uh, people's webcams and then demanding that they, you know, they find a couple of naked pictures and they demand that the girl gives them more. They recently posted a guy for that. Oh, of course. There's always going to be a guy that fucks everything up for everybody else. There's always going to be one douchey dude does shitty things. And if, especially if you could do it anonymously and an office like that and just creep her out.

Speaker 2:          02:42:22       Yup. But they could find that they could fight. They have cameras. They could figure out who the fuck's doing that. Yeah. It's, uh, I dunno. I haven't had my feet in those shoes. You have the same issue though. If you a twink like yourself, if you were a involved in a play, I'm actually a puff a man. I'm actually power bottom. But if you were involved in a company with a bunch of like really aggressive, large gay men, it's like a big bunch of linebackers who, you know, just also were gay and they started a company and they employed you. Yeah, that'd be even more threatened. I wouldn't fare well in prison. I'd have koolaid and my lips and the first spot. Great way of describing it. I wouldn't fair, well, I have a pretty mouth. I wouldn't fair, well that's not like pirate talk. I wouldn't fare well and that's scary to me. It would be acting up. He would get me with the cooks need to get to my citrus. What was that accent? Yeah. Being pursued is

Speaker 1:          02:43:11       not fun. Whether it's an unwanted, whether you're a man or a woman, but it's way creepier if you're a woman because men are physically larger, physically larger, usually, and more violent and creepier. Yeah. You know, like everybody wanted to get scared because of the movie, like, um, like fatal attraction. The bunny burner. You know, she's boiling bunnies and shit. He just wants to kill him. He has to kill her at the end. But for women that's like par for the course, you know, that's, it's way more common, but it just doesn't manifest itself in movies. It's fucking cat calls. That's the thing. It just like, is that ever worked? I saw that happen to my dad, my Stepdad when I was a kid in San Francisco, I saw some guy whistle at him while he's with me. Man, I was fucking seven and saw some guy who was walking, he's whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:43:57       How did that get universal to buy the right? That's like, okay, okay. Is Global. Yeah, you can eat right. Most random country and say, okay, okay, okay, okay. And everyone fucking knows it. Yeah. But it's like, you see videos is most third world nation and inevitably there's Coca Cola there. I wonder who came up with check about bow, uh, came from the original, like it used to be the classic porn style. Right. But that sound though is like all you have to do is go bounce when someone walks by. And that very specific, right? It's pretty much, that maybe varies a little bit like bowel wall mount, but you could say that, but you're a little bit more sophisticated to the average person. The average person has midi keyboard. The average person that saw like, you know, two people that are like holding hands, they start making out and you look at them, you go, I'll watch a compound bow automatically brown chicken cow.

Speaker 1:          02:44:53       Cow. Yeah. What is that and how did that one make it through? It's cultural. You can't map it, but it's fascinating. Everyone is saying literally amazing about everything now. I don't hang out with those people, man. All right, fair enough. Checking. You know what everybody is saying though, you know, and I do it too and a fucking hate it. I was listening for it the other day in an interview. I heard like a hundred, you know, in one conversation it's the new, uh, and I do it. I'm trying to avoid doing it. It's hard when you know you're trying to, you know, trying to, you know, figure out what the fuck you're going to say. Oh, he goes, I hate listening to myself. I hate fucking watching myself. The problem with it though is once you're aware of it, you can't not think of, you knows, it's like you, you know, it was just permeate your brain and you can't listen to a conversation cause he's like, you want to interrupt and say, don't say you know, again, don't do it.

Speaker 1:          02:45:38       But they're gonna say it again. I'll call people out on the literally thing. Oh, if your friends, you'd be like, I'm literally dying here. I'm like, really? You actually fit? Do I need to get to the fucking er? Like what's going on? Yeah. The misuse of the word literary, they actually changed. Literally they changed the definition of it. Yeah. Really? Yeah. So it basically means that the Oxford dictionary, whatever. So that essentially means figuratively. Sure. It's not the urban dictionary, Dude. I don't if Ahca did. They really? Dude, urban dictionary man. 90% that shit's made up. Well, if you want to keep a job, you will make up some urban expressions, son. We got books to, Yup. We got

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       people that outfit. Well that's like private prisons. Once there's money involved in it, it just goes, gets crazy. You just bow chicka wow. Wow. A verbal means referencing a sexual encounter, act or deed. Also used to identify someone or thing that is sexual. Hmm. I got this girl at the club and bounce your, wow. Wow. That guy. That guy has sort of dazzled shirt. Yeah. He's probably got one of those ones that has like Japanese writing in foil, you know those affliction ones with a tight v neck. Mike, Mike Posner, the guy that wrote that song. If I can write you a song like he has a song called Bow Chico. How well does he really? Yeah, it's clever bastard and I saw him alive. I like him recently. He was good. Yeah. He's actually from a, he was going to Duke when he started his music career. Thank right graduate. So he's having a call with a zero.

Speaker 10:         02:47:03       Yes.

Speaker 6:          02:47:10       Production values kind of art music factory. You got gas. Shut this off immediately

Speaker 2:          02:47:18       do to America. Do you hate America? Are you with the terrorists? I'm opposing her fan. Uh, he opened for what? Kesha, you can't really, you can't really judge the guy based on the 10 seconds. A very stressful spraying and nonsense to the air can match. He just asked you to rent. Yeah. Axe Body spray him buddy. Chuck car or used car just went away on its own. It's sort of like the plague. How are I'm bringing it back or are you bringing back? I used to bathe in that shit in high school. I bet you did. Oh you son of a bitch will do it. Staring at your poster of your Lamborghini.

Speaker 6:          02:47:49       Yeah. One day world. One of these days. Show you all shallow. Yeah. Going to

Speaker 2:          02:47:56       be a mega villain. Yeah. How did you guys wind up in North Carolina? Was that just where one of the main epic guys, uh, was working for IBM and he said, hey, come check it out. And if, if I was the person I am today and I moved to Raleigh in 1998, I'd be fucking miserable. Why is that? Because back then all I cared about was that there was a fucking mall and at Burger King and now you're more cultured, your different guy. Now I'm farm to table Joe Farm to table all you organic. I it, no, fuck no. We're not a free gluten free and organic. No, it's a no. Just, you know, I don't, I'm kind of over the big, big chains and shit. Yeah. I'm like, well this is nice when you go to places like Seattle where you don't see too many chains. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:48:32       Seattle's a cool town in that there's a lot of individual cities, a lot of places that you know, are you individual rather restaurants that are, you know, locally owned, locally operated like that pit place. Yeah. Well that's a change. You don't want to go, let's go, let's go to fucking this place and go to Chili's. Like what the fuck? Those places have personality, like places that are individually owned and operated. They have a certain personality that you never going to get at a TGI Friday's. Exactly. When the menus to let laminated and just a little too slick. You just think that there's anything wrong with the Fridays, you know, or Chili's. You want some baby back rings, wings, whatever. Those fucking commercials, baby back bad if you're on the road. I had a buddy my visit from la a couple months ago and I took him to my friends, a establishment. He says, dude, what do you think of Raleigh? And he goes, it's great. There's no chains. I told you is what the terrorists you here I was friends talk, he's going to do think of Raleigh. He's Raleigh. You know he's Moroccan and he uses the word dude. All it is this Tila Tequila converts and Nazi-ism Tila Tequila would suck Satan's Dick if it got her on TV.

Speaker 2:          02:49:33       Tila, Tequila, it converts. Hold on, pull down it down, read it, converts the Nazis. I'm calls herself, hit Dilla and antisemetic new song had Tila fucking retard. Come on. It's that real. She's trying so hard and she still runs her heart. Hey man, we're talking about her shit, right? The Kardashians factor, right. She trolled us. Lawrence, 19 year old sister was talking about watching that show and she had, she didn't know that Kim Kardashian had a sex tape. Oh, well did it make her feel better about the show or worse? She didn't really care. A sex tape. Sex. That's something like one of the best ones he liked. Big Black Cock gets it. Be Honest. She tunes into the beach, she tunes into the BBC. There will be a time when mark my words in the future where like, it's like you don't have a sex tape.

Speaker 2:          02:50:22       What's wrong with you? Check mine out cliff. He's saying this because he's about to release a sex tape. I'm going to leak it. You're going to accidentally leak at accidentally leaking. Yeah. She's one of the first that actually got hugely famous though from it. I mean Paris Hilton got sort of famous from that boring, but yeah, hers was annoying when she was blowing that guy and kept answering the phone. Fucking rude etiquette through terrible blow job advocate can all learn from that to your way of saying this, my phone and my phone calls are more important than your cock, but she's basically like the Floyd Mayweather reality stars. You're tuning because you hate her. You know? She figured out how to market in that way, become obnoxious in a way that people will tune in just to hate her, but they got tired of that after awhile.

Speaker 2:          02:51:01       She didn't fucking up big black guys that show with Nicole Richie. That was like, I just hate both of those girls now. Where's in the call? Richie? You don't really ever hear about her. She still is. She's got it. She's got millions of followers on fucking Twitter thinks she's got kids now. It's just out of the loop don with it all. Oh, you either stay in the party group and die or become a family person. That sounds like you should put that in the beginning of a new video party or die. This is a new video. You coop and does all the rockers, right? They're either die or they become family men. Yeah. Or they become like, I watched gene Simmons family jewels. It's now it's on access TV. It's not so crazy that miss fakers show ever. It's weird. You see the one where he, I think we talked about where he uh, got vibrators glued to his hands and he had to go out and he couldn't take these vibrators off cause somebody's super glued them to his hands somehow.

Speaker 2:          02:51:50       It's weird because I was a huge kiss fan, you know? And so now I'm watching him and he's just weird, you know, older guy on a fake show. It's like, but, but your gene Simmons, you're like, you know your Gene Simmons, what are you doing here? What's going on here? You're got a thunder. He probably sees it as this marketing. Yeah, I'm sure they came to town and they still did a fucking good show. Of course. Then I realized, fuck yeah, half the members are like new dudes. Two of them. Half of. Exactly. But my wife had no idea what she was enforced. She's like, what the fuck? Where the same thing. And we just went and saw guar. Oh my God. I told her nothing.

Speaker 2:          02:52:31       What's the main dude goes? Drink by bloody see made as his cuddle for sprays into the crowd. She's like, the fuck are you? That is rude. It's bloody Sieman's crew open for kiss. Really crude crude at crew wasn't doing so good, man. They were. Vince was like, he's the way that feeling. All right. I got Mick Mars like propped up. Oh Wow. Dude. That was like growing up and listening to all that music. The sunset strip was like this fucking mythical place. Right where giant girls hair fucking aquanet. You know comedians too, man. Yeah. There's sunsets. Trip has been a mythical place for a long ass time. Yeah. I still haven't seen that documentary on the sunset strip. It's supposed to be incredible. We're trying to get it mattes. Tags is trying to get a copy of it for the, can you get it on iTunes?

Speaker 2:          02:53:18       The documentary, not the showtime movie. Right? It's the same thing. They showtime movie movies. The documentary. Yup. Oh, I was confused. I thought the showtime movie was, had actors in it. It was a movie. No, it's a documentary. Oh, I'm an asshole. Okay. I was like, when is this thing going to get released and why is it I'm getting confused with this other showtime documentary? Right. Or show it to you. Just move it aired on showtime, but now they get, they have an, I watched it on Itunes, I believe. Okay. Cliffy be what's next for you? I'm basically looking to start a new studio looking, you start a new studio to make some ridiculous first person fast manly type shooter. Aventador of shooters. Yeah. Something that makes your Dick hard and chewed flames. Flames out your ass. When, when are you going to start doing this?

Speaker 2:          02:54:04       I'm talking to people about funding right now. This isn't bitches get on it. It's cliffy be you're talking to, it's not some rank amateur through the fucking cheese grinder since he was a child. You know, when you're asking for a certain amount of money, there's certain strings attached and there's due diligence and all that Shit and John Romero aside, you're a different person than him. Okay. You're not going to get their house. Fair enough. You're going to figure out how to keep it together. My thing, Joe is, um, I, I know my weaknesses and I joked that if like I'm gonna make my Avengers, I need my core like six leads, like a Ninja art director and into chief operating officer, like Ninja, just those kinds of people. And then like, you know, we're all on the same page and, and build the studio slowly and intelligently build the community while you build a company while they build the game. Do you have a timeline when you'd like to get off the ground? It depends on when the ink dries on deals that are being negotiated. The, my thing is I don't want to go with, I'm scared of the old guard cause you know, the last thing I need is some mid level executive going, well traditionally this kind of game doesn't do want,

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       therefore we're going to not market it and therefore it doesn't do well. So we told you so of a bitch. Yeah, I don't like that at all. How about that? I mean the thing of the problem in entertainment in general is the people who usually are responsible for the money or very rearward looking right. And it's like Gretzky says, go with a fucking puck's going, not where the puck is. You know like in the exact quote and Gretzky. I love it. Yeah. Executives go around e three and they're like, oh, that's a World War II shooter. We need one of that. It's like it doesn't fucking work. That wasn't that kind of the problem with everything. Now you get these mid level managers who are trying to play the safe numbers and trying to shoot things straight down the middle and then the creative types. So like why does it have to be the way it's always been?

Speaker 1:          02:55:43       Why can't we do something weird? Let's do something crazy and it's due Buffy the vampire slayer, but for fucking real shit. Yeah. Scary. She had a complex two. You got to fail early. Fail often. Dude, we're out of time. Come back again. Thanks for having me. And if people want to file, it's the real cliffy be on Twitter. There's a bunch of fake twitters for cliff. Hi. Say last name Bill Zinsky Zinsky you'd have known you for it. I know, but I'm bad at Polish. Bazinsky it's a hard one.

You've got to do it like your skin and you don't know how to stop and uh, but it was a really supportive crowd too, so thanks everybody that came out. It was a, it's easy to do those if the crowds are cool. If the crowds are shit heads, it's not that much fun. Right. Comedy is the only art form ever where we can't really create it on our own. We need you guys there. All right, thanks everybody. Wednesday night, uh, at the ice house a, I'll be there with Tony Hinchcliffe, uh, Mat fold Tron, Ian Edwards, uh, and more.
