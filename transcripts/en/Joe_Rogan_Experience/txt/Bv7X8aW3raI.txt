Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Couple of hours and yeah, we've got the gun. What's up gentlemen? How are you? Good, thanks for having people tune into this podcast. I got Brendan Burns and Jason Harrington who have run a company called [inaudible], which is the premiere. If, if, if you could look at your company like in comparison to a lot of other like sporting good companies and like if he, if people think about like a hunting company, you think about, oh well it's like some duck dynasty type shit. You guys, what I like about your company is there's not a lot of people that take what you guys do, like make clothing and gear and take it to the most technical and most intelligent. Like what is the best shit you can possibly make set and go do that. That's it. But because of that, this company has become this gigantic company I found out about you guys buy from my friend, I'm Martine to Patellas, uh, who, uh, works for meat eater.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       He was wearing these clothes. I go, what's, what's going on with that? What do you got there? And he's like, this is cool. This is a new company that's out there, this feel, this filled, that filled this, this is an ultra light is the best kind of fabric is. So he started telling me about your company and I just love when people go for it. I love when people like people wouldn't think that there's like this big market to create the most technical, most ridiculously engineered hunting clothes. You would say, well what the fuck? Who's doing that? Like where, who cares? Yeah, exactly. Who needs it. But then listening to you guys on a couple of podcasts, I'm like, these guys are fucking sharp dudes. Super Sharp, intelligent people who just happened to be in love with hunting. And so you've taken this mindset, this, this achievement oriented mindset and put it towards this company.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       And it's fascinating to me. Yeah. It's um, you know, I just got into it because I wanted to make stuff. I couldn't find, I wanted better performing products. It's what you know, we created the category was sick of back of the day is back in 2004 because I was wearing all mountain their anger and wondered why I was the only person that wanted that style, that type, that performance level of hunting. I didn't believe that I was alone and came up with a concept, introduced it and oh six to the hunting market and exploded credit, the entire technical total category. And it's just, it's now what everyone's chasing. It's with everyone wants to wear and makes a significant difference for our customers in the mountains. Well, there's a bit of this, a lot of, uh, hunting people are kind of fashion east does in a way.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       Totally. Like, Ooh, what do you got there? I was an underwriter who was at first light. Like they start like looking at your stuff, almost like girls look at shoes and purses and shit. It's, it's really kind of interesting that way. Well, no one likes to go to a hunting camp, be out geared. Right. Your buddy's got the coolest, latest step. They're like, what? Well, what is that? One of the reasons why I wanted to have you guys on is cause I've done the best job I can of trying to educate people as to what I see when I talk to people that are really intelligent, really ethical, very, very involved

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       people that are fanatics about hunting. Because I think there people have of distorted perception of what hunting really is. Totally do. It's like Yahoo's beer drinkers being Baba Baba banners is above a redneck striving and drinking beer, shooting stuff out of the truck. And it's so not that our customer base and what we do, I mean it's a true lifestyle as a heritage. It's been passed down in my family. It's where we live and breathe. It's why I'm I trained every day. Uh, it's what my focus is on my life and, and what I've done for a career in a business. And it's, there's a lot to it. And the places we go, we require that or you're going to pay a huge, huge price. And so it's a way for me to test myself as a, as a human being, as a man, as a hunter.

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       And a life. And it's something that, uh, you know, is a big, big part of me. It's been passed down from my father and I'm passing down to my kids and, uh, you know, we've been hunters for 2 million years and fricking proud of it. A lot of people shy away from it. And it's something that, uh, is really, really obviously very important part of my life. Well, there's not a lot of high performance, you know, super skilled things where you also have a lowest common denominator kind of guy that you're associated with. I mean, if mountaineers, you know, had a guy that was wearing a white tank top and was down at the climbing gym, fallen, operate in his head every week, people would perceive him slightly different. He runs, you know, the guys that are doing the most extreme stuff in the world and the purse, the perceived person that's down here.

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       So you know what people, you get lumped in with the lowest common denominator guy, which is not not the case at all. I mean, yes, that's a really good point. Yeah. And, uh, yeah. I mean it's, it's uh, it's certainly what we're doing and we'll, we're testing our products. I mean, we argue that it's, it's a different format than even outdoor gear. I mean were when the weather's bad and you're on a climb, you stay in your tent when the weather's bad and we're on a hunt, what do we do? Yeah. Especially if you're not bringing much food and you're counting on killing something and eating it up, they're totally, it's, it's an endeavor that's a very, very difficult and misunderstood endeavor. He really is and I think companies like yours and what you guys are doing in the videos that you release on youtube, especially when you're going over the extreme engineering involved in your packs and your gear and all the different thing.

Speaker 2:          00:05:17       To me that stuff's fascinating. It is because I love people that are just going for it, that are just engineering the shit out of things. You guys are chopping down toothbrushes to make them lighter and all this stuff you're doing. Like I was listening to one of the podcasts, we talk about your excel sheet that you make a spreadsheet that you made every, every hunt. You weigh everything out so you know exactly what everything, ways before you're going onto a mountain, you have to, for what we're doing. Yeah. I mean you look at any endurance sports and you look at, cycling is a great example. I mean ounces they've proven are huge. If you're climbing on a bike and the bike weight and the, and the bodyweight on all that leads to better performance. And we found the same to

Speaker 3:          00:05:57       be with with what we're doing on backpack cards. I mean every ounce over a 10 day hunt really adds up in calorie burn and calorie deficit, which then turns out to be performance and know well from training. Well it's also, you guys have engineered these clothing. The clothing line is incredibly quiet, which is also really important thing. And there's, there's so many different levels to getting it right when it comes to hunting gear, getting it right when it comes to, you know, I mean, it could be the difference between success and failure. And this is one of the things that I wanted to kind of highlight about this pursuit. Um, and I don't like to call hunting a sport or a discipline mean call whatever you want, but it's not, you know. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it is what it is. It's weird that you have to lump it into this other thing, but I think that people have a distorted perception of it because of what you said because of this lowest common denominator guide, the, the Bubba thing.

Speaker 3:          00:06:50       But the more I've gotten into it, the more I've met people like you guys or people like Cam Haynes or Steve Rinella, Remy Warren, and you get deep end. You realize like this is a really difficult discipline. Very, very difficult. That has many, many, many layers to, it really does. I mean, you look at the, some of the expeditions we were doing up north, you know, we'd go up to the Yukon or Alaska or northwest territory's and when we're going from point a to point b, like normal exposition with, but there were hunting, yeah. On top of that. Exactly. And then we've got to manage the game that we take out on top of that, the weight and the extremes and the conditions and the weather. I mean, it adds to, I mean, you have to be really well prepared. Really. Um, physically, mentally, and also with the right equipment and gear.

Speaker 3:          00:07:33       Yeah. I mean you had in the mountains on some of the stuff we're doing. I mean, it's not like it's comparable with mountaineering, but I mean, you don't have to, you know, it's not a to b. You just got to survive to ADB. I mean, you have to thrive in the mountains. You have to understand what's going on with the animals. You're up early or up late. I mean, it's, it's even more in depth. And then just getting from point a to point b. And a lot of these places were going, there is no reason to ever go there unless you were hunting. I mean, just some random mountain in the middle of the ice glacier that not particularly tall, not particularly, but like there's no reason to go there unless you had something to go there and look for. And that's the cool thing we were seeing stuff that nobody would ever go see.

Speaker 3:          00:08:10       Yeah. It's like a to B with a very complex biological puzzle. Totally. Yeah. It's, it's so, it's so different than, like I said, a lot of people think of it. And one of the things I like about your companies, you guys are represented by this big horn sheep. I mean, that is like a part of your logo, which is one of the most difficult animals to pursue sheep pennings at pinnacle, man. And it's, uh, it defines for Brennan and I and for people in the company and the people who associate with a brand. I mean, it is the ultimate dream. It's what we all dreamt about growing up. As someday I would be a sheep hunter. I'll earn the right to go sheep hunting because it's so difficult. It is. The opportunities are limited. The, and it's an animal that lives in places that we, you know, we can visit, but we can't live there.

Speaker 3:          00:08:52       I mean, they live in places that you just, you know, the, we, we only get to like a snippet into their, into their life. Cause it's places you can't, you just, you just can't live. I mean, you can't go there and you can die. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean a Cam Haines, good buddy Roy Roth died just this past season fell 700 feet to his death while she hunting. I was hunting. Uh, I had a tag in Alaska and that you gach um, couple a little ways over from there and we went 37 miles in, up, uh, up to, to two forks of a glacier. And I mean, we got to where you could physically a human being without climbing gear could not go any further. Where I killed my sheep is fall 15 year old ram living up in the rocks. And I mean it like that. That is some of the, that's some of the most, that's some of the toughest country in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:09:41       It means brushy and ice and nasty. And you know, again, it's not, it's not pleasurable to go in there like you have to, to really go into something like that. You Do, you have to have a goal or a reason to be in there. It's not like I'm going to go grind out this miserable brush and you know, poor, you know, shitty rainy weather home. He, yeah, he just like, why would you be there? Cause you go there because you want to see, you know, is this is going to test me and you want to see if you can match wits with this animal and you know, you, you want to go see if you're up for the challenge. I mean that's what we've been doing for, it's the world's oldest and greatest sport. I mean, if you're not, you know, you were either a hunter or a berry picker and the the level of intensity that's involved in that moment when you actually try to take that animal after that incredible hiking after 37 miles of risking your life to get to that point.

Speaker 3:          00:10:30       And then that moments there, just the extreme amount of pressure and intensity involved in that moment. That to me is what defines the real challenge, the ultimate challenge of hunting and this idea that it's a bunch of people that like killing animals or it's a bunch of fat Yahoos and sit around drinking beer. No, there's way, there's way more to this thing. This is more an insane, like really primal pursuit. It is. We always say you're either a hunter, you're like Brendon mentioned a berry picker. It's in our DNA if you're a hunter. And to be able to test that against the toughest conditions against the hardest animals, to hunt the most remote places is to me the ultimate test of being a human being and ultimate test of being a hunter. And that's what drives me and what we do. And why they train year round.

Speaker 3:          00:11:21       Why, I'm always thinking about gear, about food, about Wade, about uh, you know, what, what, how I could improve from what I learned on last year sent to this coming seasons. Um, and preparation of it is a, it's fun. Yeah, I love it. I live it and breathe it and uh, it's, it's challenging. It's really challenging. Well, it unfolded for me, uh, and it still continues to do so because I've only been doing it for four years. I mean, Rinella got me involved and he took me out to Montana in 2012. And uh, you know, I was like, oh, hey, this is kind of be interesting. Let's see what this is all about. Because I had watched shows and I read some stuff about it, but one of the things that he said, he's like, man, there's a steep learning curve to this. There's a steep lines. Then it goes long.

Speaker 3:          00:12:01       And I was like, well, how long can it go? He fucking find an animal. You shoot it and kill it. Need it seem so hard. But then as you get into it, you realize and then of course bow hunting, which is the most difficult of the most difficult pursuits. And as you get into it, you realize like, oh, this is like some crazy puzzle. It's like some crazy challenge that you have to figure that also involves a way to procure your food. It does. And it's a skill set you never quit learning on every time you go out. I learned something new. Yeah, there's a,

Speaker 4:          00:12:30       there's a natural progression you go through. I mean, it's like you're just excited to be there. Right. And then your, and then you see it with people you've take out through first time. They're just like, oh, kind of what's what's going on here. And you know, and then then all of a sudden they get a little click and it's like, I want to get one, you know? And then, you know, that's usually a couple of years. And then, and then, yeah, I want to get, I'm going to get a nicer one than one I got last time and I want, you want to do something a little more challenging. And it just keeps progressing until like, you know, until you get, you know, wherever it ends and it's, it's you, you're hunting the toughest animals, the biggest animals, the oldest animals and the toughest conditions and being successful and know a lot of people won't get there.

Speaker 4:          00:13:09       But it's, it's, it's always a challenge. It's something that never gets old. I mean it's, it's, you know, as comparable to any athletic event only you can do it for your whole life, you know, I mean there's lots of stuff you do athletic and then in growing up or whatever and it was like, but it doesn't really translate, you know, a college wrestler that doesn't translate that well to do the rest of your life. If you're that dude down there at the intermural wrestling like Ah, you've missed, you know, hunting is the one thing that is just throughout your entire life. Depending on where you're at. I mean, you can, it's, you can always continue to learn and pursue it. And you know, sometimes you, you know, you don't have a ton of time, you can do a short on sometimes, you know, things are going well, you can do something that's, you know, an epic adventure. But it's always a challenge. It never gets easy though. I mean, the, the, the animal you killed last time does not care. The new animal you're hunting does not care what you got last time. You have to go out, you gotta be sharp every single time, you know? Yeah. And

Speaker 3:          00:14:05       everything has to be done right every single time. Yep. Yeah. And what I like about guys like youtube is you take two dudes like yourselves who are both like real goal oriented savages. And you put together a company like this that pursues that one ultimate experience and says, what is the best shit that we can make? What is the best way we can pursue this? We do. Um, and that's why I built, could you, the way it did, having learned from Sitka selling to retailers, the limits of what we can produce. And I was super frustrated. The fact that I was walking away from the best materials and walking away from the best innovations. And when we sold that company to Gore Tex, I had the freedom to go start something new and to eliminate the retailers so I could go build a business platform specifically.

Speaker 3:          00:14:50       So I could go out, take these amazing materials, amazing designs to mark that I couldn't do before and get them to market through this brand Kuya which has made all the difference. Well isn't it interesting that this has all happened at the same time where the Internet has kind of exploded in this way that people are doing perfect time, massive amount of shopping online's yeah, I mean I have a one of those uh, mailboxes where they get your packages for the company and uh, you know, when I used him 10 years ago, I'd get like a package every couple days or something like that. Now every time I go there is stacks and boxes. Shit. Cause I do like all my shopping online. Everyone does now. It's a crazy thing how that's happened for you guys, like right as your company started was right at the same time.

Speaker 3:          00:15:32       It's like you caught that wave right at the crest. When I look back it's like we orchestrated it and timed it perfect and like we could see the future. I could see the downfall it he called it, I mean Brennan, I talked about it. I can see there's a problem with retail when you can't produce the best products possible for your customers because they can't sell it. They can't have the value any longer because all zur offering is price and selection. So price wins in a see a selection with no one there to explain why a new product so much better than the old product. There's a problem and I saw it coming and now you see it, you know, getting exacerbated everyday with new reports about retailers, failing malls going out of business. Retail is in big, big trouble. Amazons, you know, made that happen faster.

Speaker 3:          00:16:16       The Internet's made it happen and it's all looking back with [inaudible]. Timing was everything. I mean, as you know with business, you know a lot of it is timing luck and be in the right place at the right time with the right concepts and ideas. And we, we didn't totally nailed it and we kind of came in at the exact same time with on it that you guys did with [inaudible] and with the same exact model, selling directly to people getting the very best shit you can possibly get. What is the like forget about cost. What is the best most imp? Most nutrient dense foods? Most nutrient dense supplements. Let's figure out a way to get the best stuff. Find who's got the best protein powder? Who's got the best? Well it's cost prohibitive because of this and the retail gets marked down. Exactly. That's the issue, right?

Speaker 3:          00:16:57       Is like when you sell something to a retailer, like a Cabela's or something like that, they tack on a bunch of money on him a ton, right? Then make a lot more money than we did a hundred percent so we've made money then you guys, no, no. I mean they tack on a hundred percent or percent. So a jacket I had produced for a hundred I'd sell the Kybella is for 200 they sell to you for 400 bucks. Wow. For putting on a coat hanger and thrown it on a rack makes it convenient. You know, if you're like in a place and you need a jacket and you left your jacket at home, but it's, it's a faulty model. It doesn't make sense. If you're a guy like you that does research and knows exactly what he wants and you can put a tape measure on yourself and know how big you are. I mean, I'm roughly an xl and you could save yourself money and get a better product. It's a no brainer. We'll also, the amount of research that you can do, like if you go to a store and you talked to the guy that's behind the counter, what do you know? Times I've talked to people

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       like, do you go to a place that sells car parts or something like that and you ask, you got a question and he says something that's totally wrong. You're like, well, I know that's not right, but if you don't know that and how the fuck, do you know where this goes or, yeah. I mean you have to be someone who's like deeply, deeply involved in the product to be able to explain it to someone who becomes obsessed. Exactly. Like if someone has like, like your packs, the way you guys engineer the carbon frame your packs. Like I spent like fucking hour and a half the other night watching videos of how you guys make pacts and Nicole. Yeah. The first thing he said right off the bat is like, we're going to pull the curtain back. I'm going to tell everybody what everybody has been afraid to tell everybody. I'm, if, if you educate the person to know what they're looking at and you're building the best stuff, they'll end up back here and so he's just like, no one had ever said, here's what fabrics we're using. Here's where we're getting it. Here's where our factory, here's what we're doing. I mean like competitors, like are people going to seal it? I don't care. You build the best stuff and you sell it at a good value for what you have to and man.

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       Yeah. So the whole transparency thing has been incredible to watch and be in direct where you can communicate directly with your customers as you know, it's so fricking powerful and they love it and we're able to build so much trust. I mean, we started, I started blogging about Ku. You 18 months before ever launched. I talked about the fabrics and materials, a factories, the process of building a company. And I really did it just to keep my name associated with the next brand. As I left and transitioned out of the Sitka, I had no idea what it would create. And it created this massive following. People started engaging with me and asking me questions and I was, uh, listen to their suggestions on products and educated them on what great fabrics, what great design was, and they just ate it up and the consumer loves it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:35       The retailer wasn't given it to them any longer. You know what, back in the day, I used to, I grew up working at an archery shop in orange, California from Bob Fromm is really, really amazing archery shop owner. And he was the guy, right? I mean you walked in and said, Bob, what's the latest, greatest stuff? And he can tell you all about it. You go to Cabela's now, like you were saying, the guy on the floor has no clue. The customer knows more than the, than the retailer now. And you know, by taking with cu, you would go on directly that customer, giving them all that information, giving them the power to make the decision, they ate it up and then bail to be involved them through this process. You know, they uh, they just build a ton of trust with you. It's like they understand, they understand the brand, they understand you, they understand how you think and why you're making those decisions. And then they trust you. And once you have the consumers trust and you don't break it, you know, you can really build a brand off of that. Now.

Speaker 1:          00:20:25       Well, a guy like me who loves to geek out on shit too, totally obsessed with things. That's what I love, that I can go and watch all these videos and read all this stuff about all the different engineering that's involved in creating a product. And when I do that, it gets people more excited. That's why I think it's a brilliant move to blog about it in between the time of building the company,

Speaker 2:          00:20:43       it was, I mean I look back now and it's like ahead of blueprint on how to a company today. When we did that, I look back and read the blog posts and I looked and I just go, wow, I can't believe I actually did that without really knowing I was doing. Cause it seems like an execute it so perfectly. And I was just following my gut and interacting with, with the customers. And it was, it was so, so powerful and such a big thing because as I built this business model, which is the first of its kind in this industry, and even the outdoor market people told me, cool idea, but how are they going to find you? How are they trust you to buy your product to begin with? How are you going to get customers before soon enough before so you don't go a business and run out of money?

Speaker 2:          00:21:22       Because so many companies will go create a website launch and no one knows about it, right? Well how do you, how do you create that interest in advance? Um, and create the demand? We can spend a ton of money. You look at like a warby parker or a hairy shave or dollar shave club, will they spend more money than they're bringing in and they're burning cash? Like it's going out of style to create demand through high levels of marketing that's very, very expensive. Or you can do it like we didn't educate the customer and, and be transparent, build trust in advance and then launch. And then you've got your best sales force in the world, which is your customer base because they don't understand everything about your brand. You guys have this advantage in that hunting w because it's such a difficult pursuit because it's sort of gets in your DNA, you become obsessed with it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       And when you become obsessed with it and you find a company that's also obsessed with making the very best shape possible, and then you guys geek out to such a high level on the videos and on the these descriptions of what you're making, then then these obsessed people become obsessed with what you're doing. And they go, oh, well if I'm going to do this right, I got to do this this way. They do. And uh, it, and it's great. I mean, people we meet and hunters we meet in or, or a hunting camp or traveling. I mean they, it's amazing to me how much they know about a product and how much to know about the brand. I mean they are, like you said, they geek out on it and eat all the little details up and which I love because that's what I geek out on when I'm searching for these amazing fabrics and learning about new technologies and they share it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       These people eat it up, they love it. Well it's really a, a sort of a master class in how to do things the right way to foul passion and being obsessed with something but doing it to the utmost. Because if you do that then the word gets out, the word gets out, people talk about it. And like I said, I found out about you guys through word of mouth completely. Well if you're actually doing it too, I mean like the customers really see that, you know, like you know, no one else that's running a company. This, I mean, you know, multiple haunts every year. Big study like believes in what he, what, what we're building and takes it to the places that the are at. Worst place our customers could ever go and use it and people respect that they love, they don't like that. Not only that, that's what I wanna do, but I know that, you know, he's already, he's done it to we, you know, we've, we've used that stuff in those places.

Speaker 2:          00:23:34       What was it your blog that I read, which, which blog was it where you guys were sucking water out of the top of a rock? It was one of the blogs for your company. One of the early on blogs you guys went on a hunt and uh, you, you were just talking in depth about all the different, I don't know who, who was a wrote it, but it was all cool. You stuff. We were talking in depth about testing out the products on these like really remote back country hunts. Yup. Yeah. I mean that's how we figured out the shortcomings of our product. You can look at all the laboratory data, you can look at all the test results of, of what that's getting back to you, but you really don't know until you put it in the conditions that we put it in. And we've like Toray who is my main fabric supplier.

Speaker 2:          00:24:13       This is the most innovative jap. I mean they are the, the bomb as far as technical fabrics go and it's, is Japanese the Japanese by culture build the best fabrics in the world? What do they, what are they putting in them? Cause like you guys use a lot of synthetics, right? They do. I mean they're, so their quality standards in Japan are much higher than anywhere else in the world and they have a really high quality standard of the raw material. Then they have a really high quality standard of the actual yarn and then they've figured out how to make their yard stretch and recover with no elastic. It's why our stuff so light. But because of that process and because of their high quality standards are incredibly expensive. Um, but the Japanese just by their, their, their nature and their culture, they don't do things that cut corners.

Speaker 2:          00:24:59       You look at the building of a Samurai sword is a great example. There is a lot easier ways to build a sword that a Samurai does. The Samurai sword is built. I mean it takes a lot of time. A lot of patients and it's perfect. I got one over there from 15, 11. So you know it right? Yeah, that one sitting on the jam. Real one. It's the way the Japanese do things and it's the same way of why they produce such amazing fabrics and materials and they're continuously pushing the bar as far as innovation, reducing weight. And it's a partner for us. That's just amazing. I found Toray well before I started q you I couldn't, I tried to build a Tory product line with Sitka and it was just price prohibitive. I took it to a couple of buyers at Cabela's, um, when at shields sports and they said beautiful way too expensive.

Speaker 2:          00:25:39       So what are they doing to make this stuff so light? And like it stretches a little bit in it and it snaps back, but it's very light. And so they have a patent on how they make the yard is called Pram flex yarn. And if you look under a microscope, it looks like a spring. Right? And so it can stretch out and then recover without any elastic. Everybody else has to put spandex or elastic or Lycra in their fabrics and lastic super heavy. It holds moisture and it's also, you know, with stretches and doesn't really recover until you wash it. Again. If you were a PA, a stretch pair of pants with a lot of lasted, they can kind of saggy after a period of time. You notice with ours they'll fit the exact same way on day 10 as they did on day one because of their fabric, because of how they make the year on the stretches recover that last.

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       So why are they making this fabric too? This is like who are these crazy people that are out there like super engineering fabric, so Japanese and they'll sell it into Japanese market. They'll pay for performance, their pricing on their performance. Apparel is much higher in Japan, the European market as well for their climbing industry. And some of the ski brands run their, their uh, fabrics as well. Um, but it's, nobody's really introduced their product line like we have the United States cause it's been cost prohibitive to up and Teleco, you business model came out. So they just decided to essentially the same thing that you guys are doing. Just figure out what is the best way to do this. It's how they do it. Yeah. And there I am, Tory has ended or as a company, as a Japanese conglomerate, which is pretty typical of Japanese companies and their, their base, there's the start of their company was chemistry.

Speaker 2:          00:27:12       So there are chemistry based company that makes chemicals and make carbon fiber, but it's chemistry that starts of with everything they do and understanding how everything is produced and made and it's that foundation allows them to, to put out these amazing innovations to figure out nanotechnology and how to waterproof a down feather, how to make membranes that brief two and a half times that of Gortex and still stretch and recover in a more durable, it's that foundation of who Tory is, is a chemistry company that allows them to push these innovations out and then you add in the Japanese culture of perfection and making things correct and having processes that continue to produce high quality products and materials over time. And that's why Toray is so fricking amazing. I dork out over shit like, oh it's so cool. I just love when someone's trying to figure out a way to engineer something to the very finest edge they do.

Speaker 2:          00:28:05       And then what's great about them is always pushing. And so they're coming to us with new fabric innovations, new technologies and innovation and we're able to find their limits because of our customers and what they use it for. And I'm able to go back to their engineers now cause I've developed a really big relationship with them where they are now their largest customer in the world and worked directly with their team and say, hey guys, your membrane works great except for these certain situations. For instance, they go and they try to figure out how to run it by that and they will. Yeah, I mean they'll commit themselves to fixing issues that we'll find. The laboratory tests say they shouldn't ever fail and we'll find the limits of it. I mean, not necessarily Brendan, I, but our guides, they're spending 200 250 days of their life every year in the mountains.

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       They'll come back and say, hey, guess what, this happened in this situation as rare but lets us go back to the, their, their development team and say, hey, we found limits on this thing. And there they listen and they go back and try to re engineer it to figure out how to push the bar further. So those, those failures don't have, I was listening to on a podcast recently, we were talking about this new engineering that you're doing on your packs and how you're testing them. So like when you, when you have a new product, we'll say if you create a new pack or something like that and you, before you bring it to market, do you get it to guides? Do you have them tested? Do you test it yourself exclusively? Yeah, so it starts as a process in house and we'll put it through a certain tests depending on the product.

Speaker 2:          00:29:31       Like the pack new pack frame we just introduced today earlier. It could you live, I don't know if he just happened to see my live presentation for now. Flight down here. Um, so you, you do a live presentation like a product and you did that today. Yeah. Kind of like a keynote thing like jobs does. That's hilarious. I was doing that with hunting. Nobody, you guys are savages not doing them. I'm excited about this. Not It, not doing it well. So you, you, you have this product launch and um, so what did you, what did you launch? What is it? Well, we introduced a new carbon fiber technology that just came out on the market a couple of years ago. Introduced as far as ability to start developing product with a new fiber technology called spread tow carbon fiber. You'll love this because you keep you out and stuff like this.

Speaker 2:          00:30:13       So carbon fiber, traditionally the fibers are putting the yarn, right? So they take each individual carbon fiber, group them together and make a yarn. Those yarns are then woven into fabric. It's what you see of typical carbon fiber look, right? The woven, uh, the web and look you see on carbon fiber what spread toe is instead of round fibers. They've figured out that if you flatten the fibers out, so instead of being round, they're flat and instead of weaving them, they lay them next to each other and then so they run so lines across it, which you can see in our new frame. And by doing so when you mold it into a product, because that fiber is now completely flat and it's running the length of the, of the product, it's much stiffer and stronger than if you weave it in a has the fiber has to go up and over other fibers is not as stiff, not as strong in the performance level.

Speaker 2:          00:31:03       You give up quite a bit compared to spread to spread toes, all directional fibers. And then what we've done in our frame is we now can determine exactly how many fibers run from the top of the frame to the bottom of the frame. And then we, the fibers of course, and then lay in on a 45 how much stiffness we want and flex we want on the horizontal axis. So do you want our packs? You'll, you'll notice that it carries a load really well because the vertical stiffness, but it's also comfortable like an internal pack because of how much fiber we have running on the horizontal access that controls that flex. So you want to have a certain amount of flex? Yes. Have to. But you got to figure out what that amount is. And the way to figure that out is by testing. We went through 18 versions of our frame to get to where the formula is that we now and re reintroduce today.

Speaker 2:          00:31:54       That's fucking hilarious. Who does that? I do work fiber engineers and with our development team, Sean and in our office does, is there any other companies is going through 18 different versions of a carbon fiber frame in order to figure the only one in the world that produces one. So it's probably just us. I've got a patent on our frame design. I know what carbon fiber is, but I don't know what carbon fiber is. You know what I'm saying? Like my car has, oh look at this Jamie. Yeah. On the ball to killing it. Jamie's always on the ball. Um, so it's a cloth. I mean it's soft, it's pliable. Um, how does it, because I have a porsche nine 11 gt, three Rs that has a carbon fiber rear wing. And I'm also like, it looks bad ass, but what the fuck is that?

Speaker 2:          00:32:35       Stay down as a fiber and then you put it to clock in it. And that's what connects. So the epoxy, so it starts out as a co, a carbon cloth. It is pure cloth. You could feel it, flexes moves just like the cloth and okay, here it is. This is what it looks as at fabric. So that spread toe there in a bi-directional format. And then from there you turn that somehow or another into this really hard stuff with a heat activated resin. So you saw, if you go back to the mold with a frame where lane in there, um, right there. So we're laying that into a, into a mold. So we have a bottom molds, aluminum cut and a top mold. And we laid that fiber in and the way he's doing is applying the resin. And then we'll put the top mold on top.

Speaker 2:          00:33:19       And then we add a ton of pressure for you. How many thousands of pounds of pressure gets put on top of it and add heat and time and over. I think it takes in that little over an hour, we will cure that mold or that that resin into a actual part. And that becomes our frame. And one is the advantage of that over like say any other very stiff or durable material. It's half the weight of aluminum. It's twice as strong as steel and then by twice as strongest deal. It is amazing. It's amazing material and one and then also how we engineer the mold. And a big part of the engineering process of this is understanding how far apart you separate the fibers create stiffness. So we have foam in between the carbon fibers and them center portion of the frame that that full uh, that phone crates and what what they called modulates, which is a separation of the fibers.

Speaker 2:          00:34:14       And that modulates, creates the overall stiffness within the center portion of our frame. And then how much of that we have within the frame determines how much flex stiffness. And then also where we're putting the fibers and how many, so there's a lot to it. The weak point of carbon is the epoxy, the carbons, the strongest part. And so the new spread toe, what it does is it, it makes it tighter. Smaller, yeah. Less. Less epoxy. Yep. And so when we got out spread toe, which who does introduced for no weight penalty, we now have a frame that's five times different, stronger than what we had previous, which is still a really good performing product and we just got five times better. That's insane, isn't it? And so when, when you say five times different, stronger, how do you know, is there a too stiff or is it not a stiffness issue?

Speaker 2:          00:35:00       It's a flex issue. Is there, there, is there a difference here? I mean there is and it's a challenge, right? It's finding that perfect balance and you can do that with carbon. You can't do that with a steel or aluminum frame pack and you really can't do that with any other pack frame design, which is usually some sort of plastic sheeting with aluminum stays put in. The flex is kind of there, you can add more lumens stays, but then still is an aluminum stay. It's the people who listen to this and understand what's aluminum bar essentially. And you can kind of mold in a curve or whatever and it's sewn to a piece of plastic, shoved down the back part of it. Like an internal frame backpack

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       has some sort of support, stiffness, stiffness, rigidity. It's what will pull the weight off somebody's shoulders that it will help carry that load versus just a Duffel bag strapped to your back, which is uncomfortable as you know. Well that's where the, the, the interesting aspect of the engineering comes in when it comes to packs because, uh, the same weight with a different pack feels different. Totally different. And that's something that I think a lot of people are not aware of. Like you think, oh, she carrying a hundred pounds on your back. You're carrying a hundred pounds on your back. No, no, no. It's, it's depended entirely upon the ergonomics, how it sets on your body. It does. And geometry of how that loads transferred onto your back and the frame. And, and balancing it. There's a lot to it. And you know, in the past, before our frame came to market, you either had really stiff frames with external frame packs and metal or aluminum.

Speaker 3:          00:36:24       And then you have this internal frame which was really comfortable until you had put weight in it and then it would wouldn't be stiff Neth and it would end up putting a lot of pressure and weight on your shoulders and your hips. So how, how do you engineer that? Do you have to try it out? Do you have to like take one of these packs and, and wear it on a long back country hunt and they say, okay, here's some, I got a little bit too much weight on my shoulder, a little bit too much weight on my hip or how do you, how do you discern? That's essentially that I do a lot of workouts with weight on my back and a pack on a treadmill. Um, so I'm able, I'd spend a ton of time in our packs with various weights and we do that.

Speaker 3:          00:37:01       Um, a lot of guys in our office do as well as, as well as my uh, my pack developer, Shawn and Brendan. And then we, once we feel like we're really close, we then ship them out to Brendan's guys a bunch of guides and say test it for us. But through your world and what you're using it for, I mean one of the challenges we have with our, with our industry and backpacks is this huge as you know, this huge swing of weight. Yeah. Cause once we get something down we've got to get all that out. So we're going to go from maybe packing them with 50 or 60 pound back to all sudden now you've got 100 plus pound load and need to manage that. So how do you get a pack that can do both, be comfortable with lighter weights and still have the ability to carry heavy weights?

Speaker 3:          00:37:41       It's an engineering problem and it's also an engineering problem that's handled to a bunch of different ways. Like some people pack it inside the bag, some people the, the pack separates from the frame. You pack the meat to your body. And then put the pack, the rest of the pack, strap that down on top of the frame. How do you decide how to handle that? Just trial and error as well. You want the weight closest to your back, you can get the better it is and it is the closest you can get it like flatter to your back as well. Like you don't, you don't want it like bulging out, right? Like if you have a large, yeah. If you have a hundred pounds and it's sitting in a two foot square, the lower part of your back that's not nearly as good as like flattened out to six inches and going over the entire section, you're going to spread that out, up and down the frame as close to the frame of your back as possible. And how, where do you, where do you make it sit on your shoulders? How are you strapping it in to make sure that it's in the right place or you want to carry the majority of the route with your hips? So, I mean you

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       start at the waist to put it all in and then shoulder straps, all that kind of stuff and stand up and then your, your load lifters and all the way up. But I mean you want it, I mean it's individual thing, how how it fits. But you want to start with, I mean your hips or your strongest, your center of gravity, that's, that's where you want the majority of the weight to be carried as close as you can. And this is all trial and error stuff that's been done through mountaineering. Throw these different guys that are going on these long backpack hikes. Yeah it is. And then it's, it's fit. And also, I mean it's critical that you have the pack that fits correctly. Most people have a pack that isn't set up correct. And we found that with our pacs are really easy to adjust shoulder straps so we can get a perfect fit for each customer.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       And we put an instructional video out there of making sure the geometry from your load lifters, which are the straps that come off the top of the pack down to your shoulder straps that geometry has to, is critical that it's perfect and it has to be at a 45 degree angle that will help take that load off your shoulders and transfer to your hips and help you manage that weight comfortably over a long period of time. So you need like geometry, you need like you need like a triangle set up to make sure it's where this is where the whole bubble thing doesn't come in real life. Exactly. That's why there's a lot, I mean it starts at mathematics with the frame and designs and cad and CNC machines and all that and the math and all through it. And then it goes all the way through and you build it and then all of a sudden, you know, it's, and then it requires testing and, and, and taking it, you know, in real life settings and, and, and people vary on what they like.

Speaker 2:          00:40:01       I mean there's some guys like to carry see things a certain way. Some people like fit, you know, some guys like their pack way up high. I've, I've fitted guys that like him. I mean you can only know by, by, by testing it, by doing it, by carrying some weight and how many different products are you individually overseeing and c. Dot. Is that, that's the most daunting aspect of it because you've got all this different shit going on at the same time. And on top of that you're doing a dozen hunts a year plus and you're, you're, you're out there in the field. Like how the fuck do you find the time to do all this? Well, you know, it's interesting when you, when you do something you love and you have a huge passion for it. I never stopped working. I mean I work second, I get up in the morning until the time I go to bed.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       If I'm not sitting in front of my computer working on stuff specific for q you, I'm thinking about it and that's, it doesn't feel like it's a lot of work. Although I look back now and go, fuck, it has a lot of work. We found some amazing products. Um, and you know, it's just, it's a process and it's solving problems through finding materials and technologies and the designs it solve those problems. There's a lot to be solved and hunting. Fortunately it was a big gap from afar. Brendan pull that sucker up, close a big gap from, you know, some of the other industries are out there before Sitka and could use come along. So there was a lot of work to do and we've done a lot to take from where hunting apparel and gear was back in 2004 to where it is today in 2016 is a massive change. And not everything's as in depth as the pack all the way from start to finish. I mean, sometimes you have great fit on something and you have a new fabric. Well, you know, I mean how it, it's got to get tested. You got to

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       see how you like it. But it's not like 18 models of, you know, when you get a superior breathing, you know, some, you know, it's not all as in depth as added to. It's a lot of it's plugging in the right product to the right fit and then you have, you have a winner right off the bat. Well I think, uh, what you were saying about the amount of work, this is also like how we were saying that hunting isn't really a sport. Like it gets called a sport. It's sort of its own thing. Work is sort of its own thing too because you can call it, you can call it work, but if you love something, it's not really work. Like showing up at the garbage depo and, or the garbage dump and picking up cans, garbage. I guess you could love garbage. There's some, yeah, some guy out there screaming kill it and garbage.

Speaker 3:          00:42:22       Yeah. Yeah. When you find something that you become obsessed with, that becomes a passion. It's like it's a puzzle. It's, it's, it's just like you're doing it again, a game all day, almost there. And it's also in a lot of ways in art forum did I tell you what brand building to be as fascinating and it is an art form and there's no science, there's no blueprint. This is how you build this brand and I think it's the most fascinating work I've ever done. It's truly figuring out a craft brand building is a craft well and never stops. You never stop learning from it every day. I mean you live it and breathe it every day. Yeah, it reflects you guys. I mean that's one of the things that I've found interesting about this. It's like you can kind of see when there's someone like you that's at the head of something like this and you're this driven focus guy, you kind of see that when you, when you see the, the, the actual brand itself, it reflects you.

Speaker 3:          00:43:14       So this idea of like it being work, it's really like a passion project. It is. It truly is. Everything from the product to the brand building to the videos, to the imagery. I mean, I've got my hands in everything and I'm super particular about the way our image is presented to the marketplace. It's got to have it. I can feel, I always tell people I can, I can feel it, I can taste it, I can smell it. Everything was cool. Well that's a one of the beautiful things about having a very small center of operation. Like you guys deciding how this goes down. You don't have to meet with a giant board of, you know, a bunch of different people. You're not a public company. You don't, you don't have to, there's nobody there to water down the cheerios. Does that mean that it's not a democracy down the cheerios?

Speaker 3:          00:43:58       I always say everyday it's a dictatorship. Yeah. You know, it Kinda is and it works well that way. And you know, it's interesting cause we get, you know, we've, because of our growth and because of our business model, we have, we approached all the time by private equity of estimate groups throwing huge valuations of money at me. And I'm just, uh, just when I look at the opportunity, yeah, it's a lot of money. But I don't want to change what we've got. Right. You know, as soon as I bring in outside capital or profession professionals and look in the business, they're like, well, you need to professionalize. Like for who? Right? What does that mean? What does professional my

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       team, right, exactly. Well, you need a CFO. You need a cmo. You need to see, oh, I'm like for, for what? Right? So we can slow down our process so we can change the culture. That's built a really special, unique company. Some bunch of other people give pieces of the pie away. It's just such a broken traditional model as far as growing a business and we're doing it just the opposite to, same thing with podcasting. There's a broken model that's, there's a lot of podcasters today that are joining in with these gigantic networks and they think that being a part of a network is like being on NBC or being on CBS, which it used to be a big deal back in the day. Like if you were running, doing a play and NBC came along and said, we want to turn that play into a sitcom.

Speaker 1:          00:45:13       He be like, we fucking made it. Yeah. But now if you have a successful podcast and someone comes along and says, Hey, we would love you to be a part of our gigantic corporation. Like get the fuck Outta here. We gotta run. We got to run away from these guys. They're going to ruin everything. They can. They will. They will. They'll come in, they'll tell you what to do. They'll tell you what you can't do. No more cussing, no more cussing for short. You can't bounce around and you got to pick your, you gotta pick your topics, your you're way too spaced out. What is, what is water down? The cheerio is even fucking mean it. You certainly can't cover hunting. Yeah, exactly. That's was way too excited about twice a week. I mean, I cam hangs on a Monday and you guys on this way, it's, I just don't, I don't think you should do anything other than what you want to do.

Speaker 1:          00:45:53       I think if you could live the best life, it's like what? What actually interests you? What do you actually enjoy doing? We'll do that. Is it possible all the time? No, you're going to, there's some obligations you're going to have to have. There's a such family stuff, work stuff, business stuff. There's stuff, stuff you have to deal with, but do what you want to do the most that you can do it. Absolutely. I always say, if you can be an expert in something you love, you can find a way to make a living in. I mean, Brendan's a perfect example. He freaking loves hunting and he lives and breathes it. Studies it. Look where he is now. Well, when I met Brendan, I met him this past weekend in Bozeman, and one of the things that struck me is when you and I were talking, you have this fucking crazy fire in your eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:46:31       You're like, I want it to be the guy that kills the biggest bowl every year. And when I killed one big bowl, I didn't want it to just be like, oh, it was just a fluke. When now you gotta be consistent. And I was like, all right, this crazy motherfucker. I see where he's at. And then when you told me that you had this gigantic bull down in sneeze, which is a store on main street in Bozeman, I went to the store just to see that bowl. I was like, we've got to stop it. And I gotta, I gotta take a look at this thing. And this is elk that looks like something out of the Lord of the rings that doesn't even look like a real animal. It's breathtaking. It's fucking mass, isn't it? I mean, as you walk up to that thing and you look at it and you literally stopped shooting attracts explained the weight of the antlers on that thing. So I mean, that's obviously an unusually big, I mean, most delk, given their whole lifespan, we'll never achieve that. It's a truly special al can like, and people like it. Not just a number, but I mean it is a Shaquille o'neal of elk. That's what it is. It's that rare and a, yeah, the horn. When when the skull plates sought off, we'd 54 pounds.

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       She's a, so it, which is to answer, I mean it's, it's heavy and John like unusually big. They're just, it just mass, you know, it was the biggest sell killed in 30 years and stay state Montana. So it was neon. Would it look like when it was alive? Right away on the huffy thing, uh, you know, a big bull elk will be six to 700 pounds. Mean they get thrown a thousand pounds a lot. But have, you know, to wait, I'm like, there are a few great big bowls at a way. 1,000. It was a thousand pounder. He was 12 years old, you know, he was a, you're just a monster, you know. So the, the Roosevelt elk, so the ones that have the biggest bodies, right. The Roosevelt elk have the, by far the biggest bodies. Yeah. But not, not the biggest, not the biggest, not the biggest antlers.

Speaker 4:          00:48:11       Like how big of their bodies get 1200. It's a really big bulls. I mean, you can see in photos of them, they're just enormous. I mean, they are unusually giant. I mean, especially the really big bull, you know, and a con, you know, like not every elk is huge. I mean, right. An old bowl who's had good feed and lived a long time and was genetically big to begin with, we'll be really big. I mean they're not, they don't all end up huge, you know, they're just the ones he hunts. You have, what's a fascinating pursuit, you know, pursuing the, the, the apex of the genetics, you know, finding the animal. And it's also one of the things that's important about this, like the pursuit of hunting is that this animal that you shot was probably like me. How old do you think he was?

Speaker 4:          00:48:56       He was 12 years old and that is an old, old l that is, that's old age in the world of wild beasts. It's the ultimate, I mean like when you get to the level where you're consistently killing stuff and, and, and you're, you know, you've gotten to the point that the ultimate level is to kill the biggest, oldest, most mature, you know, historically significant. Went on that on a chain of events, in history of like, all the guys I've ever killed elk mean, not ll card design are going to be huge. But with any animals like when you kill something is super old, super big, super smart. That is the pinnacle of where your skills have gotten in, in a lot of people never get there, you know, based on, you know, they don't have time. I mean the biggest, the biggest factor in kill in doing that and getting to that point is having the time, you know, just just having the time to, you know, I spent a decade of my life putting a blue track everywhere.

Speaker 4:          00:49:46       You could put one finding where every alk was in my state and looking for the biggest ones. I mean it is like, like the work, it's consuming you. You have to love to do it. It's not fun. You would just have to be driven to do it, to, to want to want to be able to do it. But the result is fun. I mean that the photo that you sent and he sent me some text messages, photos of that thing on the ground. You see the size of the antlers? No, that's another one. That's another one he shot. Do you? That's a pretty big one too. But that's not nearly as big as the one you want me to send a t? Jamie, I'll send it to you, Jamie. Um, should I email it to you? Either way. Okay. Um, the, and that was, you know, at the, at that point in time, actually when I killed that elk, I wasn't at the skill set I am now.

Speaker 4:          00:50:29       I mean, I got pretty lucky that was a third El cobre killed right place the right time, did the right thing and you know, just lit a fire in me. Like I want to do that more. Yeah, that's ridiculous that that was the third first started talking to Brenda about hunting elk. He would hunt elk and that was so different for me. I mean, I was just trying to find a boulder hunt, any bull, and I would try to get a good one, but Brendan would hunt and find Anelka and spend the entire season trying to kill that single up, which I thought, at least my experience, they'll kind of was fine. Hard to find that same aisle twice that I'd maybe see in the morning and I would never see it again. Britain had the ability to hunt it down and kill it. Well, it's also the best thing from a conservation standpoint, you're talking about an animal that has spread its genes for at least 10 years.

Speaker 4:          00:51:15       Right. For 10 years, that thing has been spreading those superior genetics and it's probably been forced in a lot of other males to get the fuck off the mountain. I mean, when would me, yeah, that one did. I never saw, I watched him for three days morning and night before I killed them and he knew another bull never came near that thing. You have to beat Brock Lesner of elk or Alistair overeem. Yeah, exactly. When you're going to a old like ubering old allister. Yeah, allister still on the Mexican supplements. Yeah. Yeah. The new house, there might be a better fighter. Actually. It's interesting, uh, when you see an animal like that and you, you, you, you realize how difficult it is to reach 12 years of age in the wild with mountain lions, wolves. I mean, Montana, it's like he's just got everything after I'm grizzlies, everything's after him.

Speaker 4:          00:52:04       And to be able to be that smart, to get to this position in life and for you to solve that puzzle and to get in and shoot that elk, that's, that's one of the things that sort of embodies the, the divide, really intense difficulty in hunting. It's, it's one of those things where, I mean, it, it's the ultimate challenge. I mean, once you've, you know, killed a bunch of elk and you know, I mean, it gets to where it is the ultimate challenge and you're not always going to win. I don't always get them. I mean, that's, that's the beauty of it. I mean, like you never get to the point where you're so good. Well, I haven't got to the point where I'm so good where every great big one I get. I mean, I, it's getting there, I'm getting closer. But they do, you know, like you're learning stuff all the time and it's one of those things nobody can tell you about you.

Speaker 4:          00:52:52       You can't, you know, I'm, I'm basically self taught. My Dad taught, taught me how to read maps and until you figure out, you know, why isn't elk here? What, what's he doing? You know, and not just wandering around like, oh, there's some elk over there, but like, why is he here? Why would he be here this time of year? What is he doing? Where's he going? What's his next move? Like, I mean, I've had bulls where I've hunted where I know what they're going to do before they do a little worry. I know what that, that bowl was down here. He was doing this and I was like, I think I know what he's gonna do. And I go the other direction, come around the other way. And that's what he did. I knew before he was going to do it. Um, it just, it just comes from watching them spending thousands of hours and tis data chunking.

Speaker 4:          00:53:31       Yeah. And I mean, you, you, you, you see the picture of the great big bowls and it's, that's, that's great. But there is worth the time, the time that goes into that you'd like nobody ever sees and they don't see hundreds and hundreds of days in between. Um, yeah, I was a young guy there, man. 2022 years old there. It's amazing. Yeah, it is. It is amazing. And when you eat that animal, I mean the amount of satisfaction that comes from sitting down to a meal that you procured and the most difficult way humanly possible. I mean, shot the thing with a bow and Arrow in the mountains and now here you are eating it. 12 yards snuck right upon. Yeah. Yeah. It's cool. I mean the, the, the thing about trophy hunting that's not understood. It's like, it's the ultimate, it's the pinnacle of combining, you know, what you love to do and then this incredible skill set that you're developing to be better than, you know, I'm not saying better than anybody else, but it takes a lot of work, like better than you used to be.

Speaker 4:          00:54:27       Better than you used to eat to get better and better. Yeah. And, and you know, the funny thing to me is always like the, the thing trophy hunting has got this weird stigma with it or whatever. And it's like, man, I mean, I eat the whole elk. I love doing it. I love the challenge of it. I don't, you know, I don't shy away from saying I love to kill animals. I mean like, I love to hunt them. I love the challenge of, you know, take, you know, of getting the biggest one. I find it the most challenging thing I've ever done, but, um, you don't, I always eat it. I eat everything and you know, and, and I take the hide and the head, I mean, I'm using more than most people are, you know, people like I just trophy hunting and where be like, hmm, that's, it's, it, it's, it's the challenge.

Speaker 4:          00:55:06       I was, I mean, the term needs to be changed. It's the challenge of it. Well, the term is kind of screwed up because it's applied to things that people shoot where they don't need it. And which seems to be like a cruelty, like a, a pursuit, a vain pursuit of going out and shooting lions and shooting things. You're not going to eat. The weird thing about that is I was, I was talking to a guy was doing an article for the New York Times and he's, he said, I don't have a problem with people with hunting, you know, as long as you eat it. And I just said, you don't have a problem with hunting. I mean, it's, it's, you legally have to take the meat. Um, I mean, the amount of people that would shoot something and not take the meat is, is the same as people that are thieves out on the street.

Speaker 4:          00:55:46       I mean, it's so uncommon. So like the perception of, you know, guys just shooting it and you know, just because 10 years down the road, all I have in my garage as the head doesn't mean that I didn't use it. And so the perception, again, against the lowest common denominator guy, you hear about one horrible thing going on or somebody that doesn't take the meat and all of a sudden it's everybody's lumped into it. I mean, I grew up in rural Montana. I never had a beef steak at a restaurant until I was on a recruiting trip in college. I mean, I grew up eating wild game my entire life. I never had my parents never bought meat ever. That's probably why he's such a good wrestler. Yeah, I guess, right. Get that fucking tear protein kicked that wild

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       DNA in your system. Free Range. Organic. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's the real food. But it's like a disconnect. They don't understand like, oh man that you, you know, like you don't need to do that. It's like I'm not saying we didn't need to do it. That's just what we did. I mean, I grew up in an area where that's, that's what we, that's what I ate. I don't, like I said, I never, my parents never bought meat. Yeah. The math section of hunting today, so screwed up. It is, but it's also because of cities. I mean, one of the things that's made us be able to be so comfortable and have air conditioning is technology and advancement, but it's also allowed us to be completely disconnected from where food comes from. And that's what allows people to stand up on these pedestals and point down at people that they think are doing something wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       When they're responsible for just as much death. They're responsible for more suffering. More suffer. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. More suffering than hunters for sure. Absolutely. But just as much death too. And even people that are vegetarians, even people that are, they think that by eating vegetables and plants that they're doing no harm. The amount of wildlife habitat displacement that takes place in just growing Kale is ridiculous. And all the pesticides and everything else that goes into it, it's my knees and the fucking rodents and all the different death that is associated with combines and widescale a grain, uh, when you're, when you're a growing and harvesting grain, he does so much death and vulnerable and there's no getting around that. I mean, we are consumers in some sort of a weird way, but to me the purest pursuit of it is what you're talking about. Archery hunting in the backwoods in the most difficult environments. I mean, it is unbelievably difficult pursuit that somehow or another it gets lumped into this idea that it's a bunch of dumb people in their cruel. If you're dumb, you're not going to be successful doing that. And if you're lazy, you're not going to be successful.

Speaker 2:          00:58:15       You just not. Yeah, the, I mean I've been, uh, because a coup, you had been in New York during a bunch of media tours over the last year and to be interviewed by these people that live in a big city that have no idea of what hunting is like or what it's about is really mind blowing to me because it's been such a big part of my life and everyone I'm associated with and friends with typically Hans or understands hunting, their perception of it is so amazing to me that we would just kill an animal, cut its head off and leave everything. I don't know anybody that's ever done it. It's completely illegal. And, but that's what mainstream media is made out, hunting, hunting to be. And it's like a mission of mine now to change that perception. And mine as well. It's, it's a lazy, it's a lazy perception of it. It's not real. It doesn't happen. Not, not for real hunting. No. It absolutely does. Never happens. Yeah. I mean like this New York Times. Yeah. I was just like, yeah, it's it, you know, I took them through like the wanton waste laws and all that and he was just like, he's like, wow, that, I mean you, you legally have to take it. Like it's not, it's not something that's new,

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       you know, like it's, it's always been that way. And then there is this cool meet movement that's been going on. But you know, one thing it's like, don't get it lost that, you know, guys in the 60s, seventies all, you know, since, you know, aside from market hunting back in the day, which isn't real hunting, it was just extermination for, but I mean, it's, you know, people hunt and they consume what they eat. Like anything else, just like eating bread or any, anything else? I mean, you have, you know, it's like, you know, you've got studs in your house. They came from a tree. It's where they came from. Yeah, exactly. Um, I always say if you want to fix the health problems, the United States make everybody hunt. The problem is none of the animals, there's too many people. And then to find those, but it's like obesity, overweight, you know, poor diet, make them all hunters.

Speaker 4:          01:00:06       That all goes away. It does all go away cause they have to live a lifestyle to actually harvest an animal. Yeah. To change everything in hunting. You know, I mean, God, it's been our DNA for 2 million years and just the last hundred that people had an issue with it. Not actually the last 50. Yeah, it's, well it's when you see things like the cecil the lion thing, and then everybody gets up at arms about hunting and it just becomes this, this really distorted version of what it actually is. Yeah. But this stuff with Cecil, that's not even true. I mean, it wasn't, you know, he wasn't living full time in the park. There's a new thing that just came out in the hunt report about the, I mean the whole background of it. I mean it's, there's a lot more to it than that and it's all how you, hey, how it said too, it's like, you know, all the guy killed cecil line who was just super old male who had been kicked out of the pride apparently, you know, and, and it's, you know, that whole thing with his brothers and the family and all that.

Speaker 4:          01:00:54       It's hilarious. And at the end of the day it's like, ah, you know, it was shot him and beheaded them. It's like, well, Hey, that burger you got at Mcdonald's, guess what? It died and got beheaded. It's all how you would word it. You could also say it was processed. I mean like it just beheaded. This is a horrible thing. And it's like, yeah, everything that gets killed and process gets beheaded. But don't you think that part of the reason why people get upset about lions, because people generally don't eat lions. So when someone says that someone goes and shoots a line, like why would you shoot this beautiful, rare, majestic animal? Just he could stick it on your wall and, and just think you're a bad ass because you've got this thing that could kill you if you didn't have a weapon and you've got it on your wall now.

Speaker 4:          01:01:32       Well, I mean, it, it comes down to like predators need to be controlled. I mean, it's, it's not one of those things that's pretty, and people really love to hear that. But at the end of the day, it is true. I mean, like, you know, you were just down where I grew up. I grew up in just north of the, uh, of the greater yellowstone elk herd, you know, between gardener and Livingston. That's where I grew up. And when I was in high school, there was 19,000 elk in that hurt. You go down there and wintertime is he 1500 bulls. I mean, it was, it was amazing. And they're down to two to 3000 now because of, you know, the reintroduction of the wolf, you know, like you have to control predators, um, anywhere, wherever they're at. I mean it's, it's, it's insane to think that we don't exist and these houses and fences and highways and stuff are not there and that you can just turn something loose and just let it run its course. And you know what you mean? People or even appalled by the natural core. I mean, when you see

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       a young lion take over the pride and Cecil gets chumped and destroyed by two other younger lines that came in and got, when people don't even like seeing that. Right. That's just how it happened. It's just attachment. Just detachment from the actual cycle of life. It is. Yeah. And the other thing that's going on is that people love to, they, they, they love to broadcast how horrible the people are that hunt these things and how these lions are new. They need to be preserved. And it's so important. Like Leonardo Dicaprio had something on his instagram page the other day where it was like an anniversary of the death of Cecil, and he was talking about how, you know, a few of these animals that are left, they have to be protected. What he see, Rick conveniently ignores the fact that Zimbabwe is going to kill 200 lions now because no one's going over there to hunt those lines.

Speaker 1:          01:03:08       It's just going to talk about, there's more of them. So they're decimating the undulate population, so now they're going to kill them and make no money. So they're gonna lose out on millions of dollars in revenue. What would you expect from a guy that had got attacked by a CGI bear? I mean, he doesn't live in reality anyway, I CGI, but you probably didn't even ride. He's probably doing coke and banging hookers. Call assists that. Hey man, put something eco on my page. CCS anniversary. Yeah. Now they're now they can't. Now. That's a ton of money they could generate to shoot those. And I know guy, I mean, I know booking, yeah, talk to him all the time. There's guy that nobody will touch that with a 10 foot pole. Yeah, it's a great hunt. It's a cool thing to go see. They do need to be managed.

Speaker 1:          01:03:45       I mean, you know, like a lot of things like it just is what it is very, it's very inconvenient when you look at the actual facts of, of hunting over there, even hunting, you know, just quote unquote for trophies. That is where they get a massive amount of their revenue. It feeds a lot of the people that are over there. It makes a huge impact on their economy and a lot of people don't like that. But I urge people to watch the Louis Theroux documentary about his trip to Africa where he spent, he spent several weeks in this African hunting camp and you know, it was the same thing was it was like a high fence operation where they had lions and they were throwing like calves over the fence to feed these lines. It was like two fences separating him from the lions and he got to see like in depth what's going on.

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       He's essentially saying that these animals, the only reason why they're here at all, like massive amounts of them is because they're worth something because they have to come over. And if it wasn't that like this place is so poor and so crazy that these animals would have been wiped out. They, and they were on the verge just a couple of decades ago before the introduced hunting. So it's such a catch 22 because they have more animals than they've ever had before. But the reason for that is because they're worth something to hunt. Exactly their economic resource. And because of that they have value. So they're protected and there's money to protect him and people get put off by the fact that people enjoy that pursuit. Yeah. And it's, you know, it's one of those things like I have a hard time explaining it to people that, you know, I mean what makes a little kid who when you're in the yard and there's a bird right there, like some kids, you know, just look at it and some want to chase that thing

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       down and it's like 10,000 years where the genetics at say 2 million actually. Yeah. You want to do it like this is something that is built in, you want to do, I mean you felt that you didn't draw up hunting then all of a sudden now you, you, you, you can't, I mean you think about it every day. That's all you want to do, I'm sure. And so to explain that to somebody that doesn't have that, it's really hard. I mean, you know, especially whether eating a hamburger on from their pedestal telling you how you know, you shouldn't kill anything. Yeah. Well I almost think, I mean I don't think anybody should be forced to do anything, but I almost think that it would be good for everybody to have to kill something and eat it. If you do eat meat just to experience it and I mean that's just killing something, but to actually go out and hunt something down and kill it and eat it, I think would would open up a lot of of doors inside your, your your mind open up a lot of areas of perception and give you this real understanding of what it means to consume life.

Speaker 3:          01:06:15       It's, it's, it's, there's a, there's a lot to it. It's a very complex thing that's going on when you're eating an animal a lot to it. It's like you talked about that disconnect me and there is a massive disconnect. Yeah, it's weird. It's people think just because it's in a package at a grocery store in the cellophane with a styrofoam thing underneath that is not, didn't come from an animal or something. Yeah, but you should almost have to watch. Even if you're not going to go, you should almost have to be there whether they kill the cow and then string it up and then cut it on people. How many people would become vegetarians at? Right? Remember that whole cow thing that went on a couple of years ago, I think it was in a slaughter house down in southern California. And those cows are sick and they're falling over and they've got video of it and it got out there about the processing of meat and all these people up in arms about it.

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       And like that's always been that way. Yeah. And it just got public. People were appalled by it. But that's the reality of beef and industrial food complex versus the animals that we hunt. I forget. I have a great life. You know, most of them, like the one Brendan, the animal is Brendan. I hunt, which of the older ones, they've had a full life and they've had the opportunity to experience things in nature and um, reproduce and have, you know, what an animal's life should be like. We're a cattle or you know, any type of industrial type of a food animal like chickens or cows or pigs. I mean, that's that. I mean, it's like living in a concentration camp. It depends on the situation too. I mean, like my, my wife's, my wife's father has a big ranch in eastern Montana and they raise and process all their own stuff and you know, like people talking about, you know, like all the beef and meets horrible and stuff, not, weren't know where I come from.

Speaker 3:          01:07:49       I mean, they take really good care of those animals and it's very important and they don't go to the, you know, the giant stock yards and all, it just, it just depends. It's all relative. You've got to look at everything as it is. You know, what, you know, where did that come from? At least you know where it's more connected. Yeah. When people hear about grass fed beef, one of the big complaints ago, God, it's so expensive, but yeah, it's not supposed to be that cheap deet life, you know? Exactly. You know what I mean? I mean like, state can be so cheap. It's ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       You think about the amount of effort that has to go for you to get this $5 steak, the amount of effort that the animal has to grow, it has to be fed and has to be taken care of. It then has to be slaughtered, cut up, package processed, send to stores, put on the shelves and then you go and buy like what are the prices like, oh my God, no shit of yours could try doing it yourself and you would value it. You would realize like, wow, this is actually a pretty good deal and all and all the, all the process, but it's not all the same either. Like I said, I mean there's lots of great ranchers that, that care about what they're doing and and, and do it right and all that stuff. And you know, again, you lowest common denominator. You get, you know, a place that's got 70 cows packed into one shoot and people are like, oh my God, we're up in arms about it.

Speaker 1:          01:08:55       It's like, well that's not, that's not the norm. Everything either. I think it's good though. The people were being aware of this. And I think it's good that people are up in arms because I think there is something really disgusting about factory farming. Undeniably disgusting. And I think the education of people and getting to understand like, yeah, this is a system that you're a part of. Even like the really hardcore radical animal activists that you know, risk their, um, their, their lives and make these crazy fucking videos and get inside slaughter houses and you know, violate those ag gag laws. I salute them. I saw I it too out there. I do too. I mean it shows the other side of it. Yeah. That, you know, the bad side of it. Yeah. We don't get to see it. We shouldn't be shielded from the truth in any way, shape or form.

Speaker 1:          01:09:35       And that's one of the things that's allowed this factory farm system to get so disgusting. It's the fact that people haven't been able to have their input. They haven't been able to see it and protest against it and say like, Hey, you, you, you, you shouldn't be treating living things like this. Totally agree. I mean that's, that story doesn't get told enough. And I think the reasonable people who love animals and maybe they don't have any desire whatsoever to eat them, that those are the people that I think respect the pursuit of hunting and respect. The idea that you look a person, it's not something for everybody, but neither is marathon running. Neither is weightlifting, neither is so true. Football, Jujitsu, anything difficult wrestling these, this is not for everybody. You know, everybody's not going to do a lot of things that are hard to do, but if you want to procure meat, that's the best way to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:22       Couldn't agree more and everything that goes into it. Yeah, that's what I love about it. Well I think it's important to spread that. I think that's sort of getting out there as well as the, there's this anti meat movement and anti, you know, animal cruelty movement and I respect that. I understand where they're coming from. I also thought, unless you're driving the lexus with the leather seats, I mean honestly it's like, it's like, you know, you see it all the time guy wearing leather shoes and a leather belt, you know, talking about, you know, his impact and how little, you know, being Vegan or whatever. It's like, man, that's just the hypocrisy is insane of people. You know, like living in a house, like how much is animal biproduct from from everything you use. And it's like, well yeah, but I just had a salad today.

Speaker 1:          01:11:06       It's like that's, I mean 50 rabbits when the harvest is, it made you feel good, but in reality you're just bullshitting yourself. Yeah. But they don't even know they're bullshitting themselves. If they, if their perception of what they're doing was accurate, then they would have a good point. But it's a, it's an ignorance to what was actually involved. You know, don't, I don't believe in killing anything. It's like every time you get in your car, man. I mean the most animal, the most life I've ever taken it. Every time we take a 500 mile road trip and I got to wipe those things off my window. I mean like, I mean people, people are like, oh, you can kill the shit out of bugs, you know, fish or cool or whatever. It's like, Ooh, we got eyelids involved now. It's getting weird. It's like, wow, where does it work?

Speaker 1:          01:11:46       Where is it? Yeah, exactly. I used to live in boulder and uh, I live next to an osh rom and the lady that ran the Ashram, that's a Buddhist Ashram, she's to poison the aunt and I said, do I go, what are you doing? I go, you poisoned the aunts. She was like, well, it's inconvenient. We really don't like to do it. But they get in our kitchen and like, oh shit. Yeah. That's where you draw the line. You, you guys are, this is some weird gray area. You've mentioned you're a murderer later mass where you've killed fucking thousands of beans just today, but in the ant a weird one because like I've seen people like they'll see an ant on them, they'll squish it and then they flick it on the ground in your house. Totally. So little. They don't care that it hits your kitchen floor.

Speaker 1:          01:12:29       Yeah, exactly. But if it was a mouse, if like someone in your house stopped a mouse in the middle of your kitchen and be like, what the fuck dude? Like Jesus Christ, this is it. Cause it makes more of a mess and now you have to consider what's actually going on in there until totally people fucking weird. They're weird. Yeah. It's weird. I mean, but that's not really what I wanted to bring you guys in and out. That's like a beaten to death subject on this point. Talk about ants. No, Da began fan. Yeah, they're cool. We wouldn't be amazing to be able to pick shit up that was that much bigger than you and walk around within your mouth. Yeah. Oh yeah. Well impressive. When it turns to, when you start talking about what they're capable of. Yeah. And while it's also, this isn't like an ant, the size of a cat could be able to pick up a house.

Speaker 1:          01:13:08       Oh yeah. Yeah. And they no freewill whatsoever. There's no decision making. They just do, have you ever seen those ant death spirals? No. Got to check it out. You put pull something like that up. The ants follow. The firm owns of the queen and when [inaudible] when something goes, yeah, I get it too. When something goes wrong, when something goes wrong, like they're sent gets screwed up or the queen dies or the queen gets removed. But the sense still there, the ants will circle, they'll circle each other and spires. Yup. Like a hurricane until they all die. And you talking about thousands of really? Yep. And they'll keep circling. No one knows what the fuck's going on. That's the True Power of pee right there. Yeah. I mean look at this amazing. And a few of them are going the wrong way. Like there's a few rebels that looks like that looks, it looks like the freeways is southern California.

Speaker 1:          01:14:00       It looks like a hurricane. It does. I mean, he really does. That's the eye of the storm in the center there. And they're, they're circling around and they don't know what the fuck is. Dead Queen. Yeah. Well it's either a dead queen. I'm not exactly Jamie. See if he could find out the actual exact, they can't release any for it. Now. They don't know they're following you and some sort of a way. But when they're doing this, um, I mean this is, this is just shows that this, this being these a aunts have no, you don't have to just find an actual explanation for it. Not a video. But when these, um, these animals are doing this, like they don't, they don't have any free will they have this, does this, this sort of directive. This is what they do. You know, they, they make the nest, they build a beehive, they do this, they change.

Speaker 1:          01:14:41       Like a friend of mine was a Ben O'brian. He has no band on Brian from a used to be worked for Peterson's a fucking 19 he was telling me about one of his friends had a queen bee somehow or they get stuck in their car and this hive of bees followed them for 20 miles. They followed the car for 20 miles because the baby was in the car like they, they don't have any like, man, she's gone. Maybe we've got to let her go. We got to push on because none of that, like there's no free will. It's just what they do. Yeah. There's no decision making. It's just what they do. The cuisine that we follow her, they never give up. It's a bizarre form of life and they have these really weird things that they do. If you've seen like, like videos on different ant species where the females will chop the males legs off I think is that leaf cutter ants to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:15:32       I forget which one, but they chop, they take the mail when they're going to breed with them and they essentially cut his legs off so that he can't move and then they carry him to wherever they want. They want to fuck him and then they take him and breed with them. I've met a couple of girls like that in a bad way to go about it. Like yeah, like the lion there, a stub. All the [inaudible] will come out of here, but and again, no thought process. There is no meeting. They don't have a board where they sit down and decide how to do this with the mail. They just go about the way they've always done it. Yeah. What a trip, Huh? Yeah. Here we go. How to make ants commit suicide going to happen. You can make it happen to a potted plant and they'll just start following each other and next thing you know, see what we should bring all down on the show.

Speaker 1:          01:16:22       We could put one right here, it'd be rude and people would be angry. Did protest. That's cruel. But that's the thing, like certain amount of death is okay. I mean every time you wash your body, you're killing flora, you're killing the living, living organisms that are on the surface of your skin. There's no getting around it. And there's no way to live a life where you're not killing other life. It's, there's this constant cycle that's going on in some sort of a weird way that most of us are detached from way. It's always been bizarre not to be in touch with it and or just to deny it. I mean like, oh I'm not, I'm not doing that. Amen. I mean, and there are like, there are a few people that, you know, try as hard as they can and all that. But most people like they don't give up though.

Speaker 1:          01:17:04       They love the idea. Yeah. But you know, implementation is where it complicated I think is also a problem with entertainment, like the anthropomorphizing of animals and Disney movies and things along those lines. So like when you think of an animal, you think of this big ferry lovable thing. You don't think of this, you know like with an alk is essentially a warrior. It's this living warrior that has a weapons grown out of its head and they run around the kill each other. When I was at the home ranch, you, you've been to that place, they found this huge like three 90 class bowl dead that had been stabbed by another bowl. It just random through and he was lying there dead on the side of the mountain with holes in his body from the other bowl. Just fucking headbutted him to death. I'm going through it right now.

Speaker 1:          01:17:48       I've got a four year old son and he watched this little show called the lion guard, which is like in all these animals get together and they're all friends. And we started watching, he would ask questions and stuff and, and now I'm like, we watch, you know, if you want to watch the lion guard, that's fine. But I've explained to them like the Cheetah and the lion and the hippo, they don't get along. They're not buddies. And we watch discovery channel and he watched it. You know, like the other day we just watched the willdabeast couple of days ago we pitched the willdabeast getting eaten by the crocodile and he was just like, Whoa, you know, it's like, and now like when it comes up, he's like, well that's just pretend but I want to watch that. And it's like, that's fine. As long as we know, you know, that's not really how it goes.

Speaker 1:          01:18:27       You know, we'll go discovery channel and watch you know, killers on the savannah and you know, it's like wow, you know, the line doesn't get along with anybody. He eats everybody and you know, I don't want my kid to to think that you know, oh it's just big peaceful thing and they're all symbiotic relationship and they all love each other now. Man, that ain't what's going on. It's weird the way we've chosen to distort these animals. And like polar bears, like there was a picture that was going on in instagram. A lot of people were posting up of this enormous polar bear walking around with a cubs head and its mouth. You've got everyday occurrence, they're cannibals. 100% of the males are cannibals and most people have no idea this. So they think of a polar Baylor Klondike bar. Cocacola salesperson. Yeah. Yeah. There's the photo that's been going on and this is just food for them.

Speaker 1:          01:19:13       Absolutely. I mean, in a polar bear, he's not an omnivore. No. 100% people. He's whatever he can get ahold of. Yeah. I mean, that's all they eat is meat. They're not like a black bear or any other bear that can eat anything. All they need is flesh. That's that bear at the zoo is eaten meat. Yeah. You know, they don't let you see it, but the, the polar bear at the zoo just hammering away at it. I mean, they all, that's one of the darker things about the zoo too, is we take them away from their actual purpose. I think if you're going to have a zoo, which he'd be like, you should have animals that if you ever see that zoo in Iraq that they had before we invaded Iraq, they um, they had zoos where they used to just let like a goat loose and then they would open up the gate and let the lions come out and Jack the goat and these soldiers took videos of these things and people were like aghast.

Speaker 1:          01:20:02       Like I don't understand why you think you should be able to keep a lion but don't let ally and to be lion like you're going to do all the killing. Has you giving him some fake meat? No. You giving them real meat. Okay, so something had to die in order to get, but you don't want him to do it. Why don't you want him to do it? Like what the fuck are you doing? Yeah, exactly. What, what is the zoo? Trust me, the line wants to hear. Yeah, that's what they live for. The, here, here's the video. So they have these goats and these goats are just wandering around. They have no idea. They let them lose and then they open up the gate and when they open up the gate, the lions, apparently they do this all the time. So they're hip to what's going to go. They're stretched out and ready to go. Oh yeah, tape it to it spreads. They don't want to pull a Hammy when they get the goat. So they open up the gate and as soon as they open up the gate is just on like donkey Kong. I bet they got walk out music and everything. They were just ready. Yeah, totally. This queen is playing. We will, we will rock you. Yeah, it goes boom. They open up the gate.

Speaker 1:          01:21:10       I like that too. It's not that weird to be fascinated by that. And for those guys to look at that and go, wow, that's, you know, that's, that's lions being lions like that's pretty well, I mean they're going to eat today one way or the other. And here's another interesting thing. It's interesting for us to watch. If we're watching and we're going Whoa, and were laughing, oh my God. But if we were there and we were laughing, then people get upset. Like there's an instinct to like, listen to those guys laughing while it's happening because they're filming it right through the fence and go, wow, a bunch of assholes laughing at death. But meanwhile, it's okay to laugh at if it's on a youtube video, it's totally their kid to throw a bug in a, in a, in a tank and, and watch a fish eat it.

Speaker 1:          01:21:47       It's like, oh, cool. Right. But it's like a goat and a lion. It's like, well, that's good. Well, it's like watching a fight. Yeah. I mean, we want to see the guy get knocked out. Right. Next step is death. Right? It don't take it as close as possible. Oh yeah. I mean, we find thrilling that, well, the guy chokes the guy out and he stops off of him and he's totally unconscious. The only difference between that and death is time. The amount of time really has a chunk. That's it. That's it. Keep that choke on for another minute. That guy's dead. Yup. You know, or not even a minute. And we get millions of people that want to watch it. Yeah. But at least that's, they make a decision. They both make a decision. They're both going to enter into this and it's an extreme form of a competition with dire physical consequences.

Speaker 1:          01:22:24       And that's why it's so exciting to watch. I mean, I think the parallels when you're watching something like that, it was a little different. A little different, but it's still sad. It's a detachment thing. It is. Yeah. It's, well, you know, we watch a movie, you can watch a movie where 10 people get shot and they get punched and kicked. Everybody gets their ass kicked. But if they fuck, if they're naked and they start to go, what are you showing me? What is this like? People are weird. We're real weird. I like to draw the line on certain things for whatever reasons. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever. No, it doesn't. It doesn't. That's why we're the Huntington. You can't win it all. No, I mean, you, you do, you do as good a job as you can and putting forward at an educated, you know, opinion of why we do, and, and,

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       and, and at the same time being, you know, where I'm unapologetic about it too. It's not like so many. So there's not a conversation that could convince me that what I'm doing isn't what I was meant to do, you know? No. When it comes to hunting, I mean, you, you, you don't, you put forward, you know, we try and tell people about it and educate people as to what it is and people are gonna feel how they're gonna feel. But at the end of the day, I mean, nothing's going to change with us either. How did you go from being a guy who is obsessed with being the best hunter you could possibly be and wanting to be the best hunter in the world? How'd you go from that to working for a Sitka and apparel company, a hunting company, and then going to kill you? Well, I, uh, so after I killed a big elk, I was in, I started writing some stories and like, like I told you, I mean, I, I, I really, you know, there's a lot of guys that get something, have a great stroke of luck in life and all of a sudden they killed one big thing or they win one small lottery or whatever and, and, and the, you never hear from again.

Speaker 4:          01:24:00       And that was like the, you know, growing up in a hunter like to kill this huge elk was yeah, it was the right place at the right time and amazing thing for me. But I was, I think time super conscious that I don't want to be a one hit wonder. I mean, I want to do it more. I want to be really good at what I'm doing. I mean, like I grew up reading, hunting books and like the, the best hunters in the world. I wanna I wanna, I wanna I wanna get you then this title. Yeah, exactly right. I want to keep the strap after every year. Right on. So, um, I just, you know, put the work in and then it's doing some writing. I was at a trade show when I met him and I, I didn't work at sick. I was a first, uh, they had an athlete team and one of the first for first year, not really an athlete team.

Speaker 4:          01:24:38       Yeah, whatever, whatever, whatever pro staff we were talking about them, the phone and it's, it's a weird term today because of this sort of buy a hat that says like pro staff. The franchise is completely dead. I mean like I said, pro staff with everything. It's like when you can buy a hat that says that it's, it's dead. I mean it means, it means nothing. It's, it's been, but back in the day it was, I mean went back when print media and like at one point in time it meant you were vouching for our product because you used it and isn't the right to vouch for it. Yeah. You had a can have the photos, you have the accomplishments, you've earned the right, not so much today, you have, you have the credibility to say this is, this is good stuff or not. And not because you did social media reps, but because you actually had been out there using it and you don't have big stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:25:26       Yeah. And had the, had the track record. So I met him at a trade show and uh, you know, like I said, every now and again in life you have something that's just right place at the right time. And I had killed that big elk and it kind of was getting known and, and I met him in the booth and he's like, you're that kid that killed that big elk and exactly the same. It's still does. Yeah. And so we hit it off and I started helping them test and gear and shot a commercial for him down and stuff. And we just became really good friends. And then, um, when the whole deal went down in Sitka, um, he, you know, it's like when your, when your guy, your guy is, you know, they're in, in, in, is leaving, you know, you have a choice.

Speaker 4:          01:26:02       You can either go with your guy or you can, you know, stay with, you know, what's the best thing you think is to do. And, and I was like, man, whatever you got going on next, let me know. I'm, I'm down. What did you think about this pursuit that he's on to create the most finely engineered, like to the extreme products? Like what he's doing? It's, it's fine. I mean, he's, he's hit everything on the head that he told me. I mean, we, we flew down, we went to, uh, I flew down like, I don't want to say it was like in November or something, a year before he's, could you start at Ku? He was already started, but beforehand, and he, he basically is like nostradamus in hindsight. I mean, it was like, listen, he breaks out this, I remember I'll never forget this briefcase. And he pulled this thing out and it was a carbon fiber frame and he's like, this is, this is the backpack we're coming out with and the whole business model, all of that.

Speaker 4:          01:26:50       And it's like, I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but when I meet a really smart dude that's got a really good idea, you know, I'm not that dumb. You smart enough to recognize smart people. Yeah. I was like, and I was like, man, I don't, I don't, yeah, I mean you, when you see something and you go to, I want to know more about that and that seems like it's going to fix a problem. And uh, and just, you know, the knowledge of what he, what he knew about everything and you know, we were buddies and it's like, dude, why wouldn't you want to go, you know, work at a company? Where are you going to be able to hunt as much as you want? You're testing gear and, and I mean, truly live in the dream and not just saying it like living the dream.

Speaker 4:          01:27:26       Like, you don't wake up every day and you like what you're doing and you know, it's, it's, it's been awesome. I mean, that's, and so, so yeah, he said he's been basically, I'm looking for somebody to run this part of it and um, and it's like, he's like, you'd be perfect. I'm like, well, perfect. Well I think people like you were attracted to the pursuit of excellence. Yeah. And when you see the pursuit of excellence in, in another form, you go, well, there it is. Like, well, that's how it is with me. When I started seeing your company and I see a company that's trying to like deeply and seriously engineer something, I Geek out on shit that I'm not even interested in buying. Like if someone's making the craziest grandfather clock in the world and I see this guy that's engineering these things, so it's accurate to like one 18th of one second over 20 years, I'm like, ah, I want to, I want to know what's going on this dude's brain that makes them want to make this unbelievable grandfather clock.

Speaker 4:          01:28:19       Huh? Like, I'm fascinated by pursuit. You know, when someone's trying to do something better than the people that had done before it. I'm fascinated by that. So he must've seen that for a guy like you and I know what I know what I like and I know what I see a good idea. Um, the one thing is like, I'm not, I wouldn't say I'm necessarily the best at doing like super intricate things are knowing exactly how to get there, but when you see somebody that knows how to get there and like it'd be a good combination and you can, you know, assist in that in somebody that when they're headed on the, on the, on the right direction and it's like, yeah, I'm down with that. And, and, and then, you know, I have my input on what we do, but you know, at the end of the day it's, you know, a lot of it is, you know, him, how he, how he goes

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       about stuff. It's cool to watch. I mean, it's like, it, it's, I, I always tell people like at, at what we do is it is, it's exactly what you think it is. Like there's not like a, you step in the room and it's like, oh yeah, this is some other guy's stuff. We're going to knock this out. That's not going on. But that does happen in some companies. And you, you were posting all this, that's disturbing to me. When, when you look at the future of this, what, how far can you keep pushing this? I mean this is a fairly new thing that people have been like ridiculously engineering, hunting and outdoor equipment and obviously exists in the mountaineering world and the Rei wise and you know, they, they try every year trying to come up with better and better stuff, but how, how far can that go? Like is there a point where you're going to have it done? Like this is the best backpack anybody could ever possibly make. These are the best clothes. I mean, is there a, is there a point where that ends?

Speaker 2:          01:29:55       You know, today innovation is happening faster than ever has and with those business model we can implement those innovations quickly and we're always looking for the next greatest thing. I always am. I mean, I searched the globe on a continuous basis for what's new, what's next, aligned myself with the innovation leaders for every single category, whether it's marina wool, whether it's leathers or whether it's for our gloves or whether it's carbon fiber for our bat, our packs. Um, we had our designer down at Stanford, the carbon fiber scientists down there that's working on some leading edge technologies around carbon fiber that won't even get to market for a few years. Were that interested in seeing what's next because we can implement it because we have no price restrictions. When we take it away, it's for us, it's, it's a never ending pursuit and there's always new ways to make things and it's why I tagged, tagged the line for the business of ultra light.

Speaker 2:          01:30:48       Because if I can find a way to shave an ounce or a gram, there's a reason to redo that product. There's reason to reinvent that product because that makes a difference. And that was my focus with this is that, you know, Tory's technology and how they make the yarn carbon fiber, it all led to ultra light. Ultra light means performance in the mountains. And so my goal is to get our weights continuously to come down as far as our product without giving up performance. And that's through using really innovative technologies and designs that are all focused around that. And I mean from where we started to where we are now, I mean we've taken pounds and pounds of weight out of people's kits and packs and seeing the results. And it's been amazing to watch people that normally would walk into the mounds with the 70 pound back now leaving with a 40 pound pack and come back and sand made all the difference in the world. I can hunt now and I thought I was done because of pack weight.

Speaker 1:          01:31:41       Now have you guys thought about implementing any sort of a workout routines or um, or diet routines or things like that on your website and it's sort of shaping people's ideas about getting your body prepared? I would like to do more of that,

Speaker 2:          01:31:55       really would. Um, we'd started developing our mountain fit line come out next year. So

Speaker 4:          01:31:59       using all of our fabric innovations into performance fitness line for our customer because they're all training for hunts and I have wanted to step in and help people get fit, nutrition supplements and bring that to our customers as well. We just haven't gotten there yet, but I think it's absolutely something, I know I want to do it cause I live and breathe it everyday. Just haven't done it yet. Don't you think that's also another aspect that people don't realize, like how much physical requirement is necessary in order to to hunt. Like especially in mountain hunting, elk hunting, you're going in the mountains of Montana, you're at fucking 9,000 plus elevation. It's unbelievably difficult on the body. And I think most people don't realize how much physical preparation is involved. Especially you two guys, you wrestler, you are former football player, you guys have athletic backgrounds.

Speaker 4:          01:32:43       You know how physically demanding this is the hardest things I've ever done. I've been hunting without a doubt. And I mean like, it's hard to say. There's tough, that's stuff that's tougher than college wrestling practices. Um, I've definitely, you know, I mean you, you got, you push it to limit, especially on some of these long expedition consonant. I spent 24 days backpacking in the Bob Marshall last year to find a sheet to find one ram. And it's like, until you've actually done that, and I'm talking like it's not just, you know, how far or how long, but it's sustained. Um, it's at a sustained high level of focus also, which you don't like. You can, you can grind away at stuff and you can just go and go and go. But I mean, again, when we get them, we don't just go from a to b. We have to be, you know, you have to be on, on point in the mountains too.

Speaker 4:          01:33:28       I mean, you have to be sharp. You gotta be ready to execute. The moment comes, you can't be just sort of trotting along like a Zombie. Yeah. I mean, when you get up early in the morning, if you're not glass and every single time with, with the same enthusiasm and the same or that your grid system or whatever, you have to be as intense on day one as you do on the last day because you could miss what you're looking for and you can't, you can't let up. That's the beauty of it. And I mean, yeah, I mean physically fit. I mean, there's lots of different stuff. I mean, I've, you know, he's got his whole training regimen and you know, everybody's different, but, uh, you know, like whether it's yoga or you know, cardio and you know, how much you're eating. And I mean, it's, it's, it's, it never ends you, you, there is no magic bullet.

Speaker 4:          01:34:08       The, the puzzle, you're always putting it, you're always breaking it down and doing a new puzzle. Yeah, I do every year. Yeah. And, and everyone has different physical requirements is some people that are older and you just trying to kind of maintain the best possible shape they get in. There's some guys that are younger. We tried to get them into the ultimate fitness. When you're training and you're doing all these backpack things, what you see you carrying weight it using weight plates. Like what do you, what are you carrying around in a backpack? So I use, we have these sand bags that are set up for putting over like the booms and our video root cause now what I use, you can buy them in 20 pounds, 25 pounds, 30 pound increments. And that's what I put in my packet train with. And so like right now as we're rolling, we're about 45 days away from are a sheep hunt in the Yukon. I'm really stepping up my weight. So I'm training with a 90 pound pack now and I'll do a two or three hour hike, 1500 2000 vertical

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       feet and on. Now I'm doing it in the middle of the day with the heat we're having because it adds another mental toughness factor to it. Plus, as you know, it adds a whole nother level of fitness to when you're trained in the heat. So my goal is to try to train in situations with weight and conditions that are harder than what I'll experience in the hunt. Just for the mental strength as much as it as the physical part of it. Because you get beat down on day three or day four and you just, I've seen a lot of guys just fold in the towel and say I've had it more go home just physically they don't have anything left, nothing left. Right. So there's a mental side of it too. That's a big part of it that gives me confidence when I'm going on these trips because it's, I mean, they're fricking grinders.

Speaker 2:          01:35:35       I mean I've had hunts where we walked for three freaking straight days with 70 pound packs before you even start hunting. That's just to get into the area from the time you wake up until the time you go to bed. And that can, you know, most people can make the phone sat, phone call and get picked up and taken out. And we hear about it all the time from clients and customers. So we try to help them get prepared lower that way. So that doesn't happen to them. When you're doing something like that and you're preparing for something like that, do you start off with like 20 pounds and like how do you, how do you do then? How would you advise someone? Like say if there's someone listening right now, it says, Hey, uh, I'm, you know, I'm going to go on a hunt this this winter or this, uh, this fall rather, and I need to really get physically prepared but I don't want to blow it all out in one shot.

Speaker 2:          01:36:17       Yeah, you definitely want to build up to it. And because I don't stop training, I come out of a hat on and go right back at my training. But for a lot of guys are just getting to ease into it. Right? I mean, you want us, like you said, start with 20 pounds and build yourself up over time because lastly we want to do is go into hunt hurt, right? I've done that before. I've overtrained or done too much going into hunt and you have to be careful, especially as you age I get sent tend to get tendinitis and joint pain more than I ever have. And so it's, it's managing your body through that process and having something left when you leave and, but being fit enough and having your feet and in good enough shape and your boots broken. I mean there's a lot to it besides just the cardio part of it that goes into the hunt.

Speaker 2:          01:36:58       Yeah, I think people would benefit from seeing what, like if you could make like a blog on how you do it or get outline, totally outline how you start off and how someone would build into it and maybe consult with someone who's a, an expert trainer and figure out what's the best way to uh, get people prepared to develop an actual workout for like for pack hunting or for even hiking. Any, any, any sort of thing where you're walking uphill in the mountains with weight on your back. It's like, boy, that is an unbelievably difficult thing to do all day, every day for several days. At a time. It's just a different biomechanical movement. I used to trail run a ton beforehand and that was enough and I've gotten older. I've realized that I need to train more specifically for hunts and that's carrying a pack with weight and it hits different muscle groups as you've felt. It gets more up in your hips and your glutes and it hits a whole different muscle group. Then trail riding does or that weight training does or training on an elliptical stairmaster or whatever that is. There's no substitute

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       for spending time in the pack with weight. There's just isn't. No, there's no sub. It's so different than anything else. It just, it's so exhausting. It is and it hits a whole different muscle group and your heart and lungs may be in shape, but those muscles aren't and it, it taxes you. Yeah. As much as I lift weights and workout and kettlebells and all this stuff, I packed hundred pounds for like three quarters of a mile in the fall and I was fucking dead. I know when it was over I was like, oh my God, I can imagine 70 pounds on my back for three days at a time. Walking all day just to start hunting. Yeah. I'm not in good enough shape for that. So if someone listening to this, is there a resource, is there any like sort of a website they can go to that give them some good workouts for, for something to get prepared for something like this?

Speaker 3:          01:38:39       There isn't one specific to what we're doing and I think it's a great idea that you have is really laying that out and we tee, I mean we talk about all the time, we take all this for fricking granted. Yeah, we've grown up doing it right? These spreadsheets, people are like, oh my God, that's so amazing. You do that. And like I've always done it right on the house. You knew what your pack's going away when that you're not over packing and then you have exactly what you need and how much you need of it. And we break it down to like calories per ounce and ounces per day. As far as our food. We bring, I mean, I'd go on a sheet and I don't rely on the outfit or to the pack for me. I bring all my own food and it's all laid out.

Speaker 3:          01:39:09       It's all, it's all calculate out to the exact calorie per day I'm going to eat. What kind of food do you bring? A lot of whole foods now. I used to bring, you know, lots of bars and clif bars and power bars. Now it's real food and, and I both gotten to that. Yeah. Nuts and whole grains and, and um, getting away from the edge. I did meal so much at the have, you know, high sodium, not a lot of nutritional value and really trying to focus on, you know, bring in breads and peanut butters and cheeses and things that will stick with you versus high sugars and you know, quick burns, right? When you have dehydrated food, how nutritious is that stuff? I don't just scouring the Trisha, I think his calories and then if you really look at their calories are not that many calories per ounce.

Speaker 3:          01:39:49       They're light and some of them have higher calories per ounces than others. But I, Brendan's come up with a really good recipe with your, with peanut butter and some noodles and like Stephanie on, you're really creative with it. I've been, I've been kind of building my own, like my stuff wasn't my id exactly. If I've modified it a bit and a couple of things, ramen and peanut butter and fats and jerky and stuff, all that, the heart weighs about the same and has double the calories and, and you don't want, the one thing I, this is what I do a lot is advising people that are going on a big hunt, you know, and it's like start today, don't put it off. Don't get a plan. Like get a pack on, go for a hike, start working out right now. You know, it's going to and, and, uh, get all your gear in order.

Speaker 3:          01:40:29       And at the end of the day it's going to be a grind. You're, you're not gonna, you're not going to be full the whole time. You're not going to have all the energy and neat. Like, that's the beauty of it. It's like you can train all you want to do at the end of the day, you're going to be working on the deficit. You need to be sharp and you're just going to have to grind through it and you have to be tough. You know? That's the beauty of it. You can't be a wimp and do this. So how do you figure out how much peanut butter to bring? How does

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       you can't bring enough, right? So you gotta burn what? I mean, 1,002 thousand calories an hour when you can heavyweight to altitude. Is it really that much? 2000 calories an hour. You'll do a thousand calories on a treadmill an hour. But is that, is that even possible? 2000 calories an hour if you're hiking for 12 hours at altitude with weight as possible, done it. It's why you lose a pound a day, two pounds a day on these hunts. If you, if you're not in total shape going in, which is your body's just burning off one more than you're taking in, you're going to be a calorie deficit no matter what. And that also puts you at a mental deficit, makes you mentally exhausted when your body starts using all its resources to part of it. The same feeling. You get cutting weight, you get on a huge trip when you're running out of food, you're way back in there.

Speaker 2:          01:41:37       It's just like you just got to dig deep. Like how do you show up for practice when you're cutting weight? You just got to do it and you just got to dig deep and your body will, your body responds. I mean, the cool thing is your body responding will eat what it needs to eat and you just keep going. You know what I mean? It's, it's going to be the, the, the beauty of it. It's never easy. I mean, it's going to be, it's going to be tough. Well, that's one of the things that's so exciting about this is it is unbelievably difficult. Pursues test man. Now if you're going like, explain to me a hunt, like say if you're going to go on a like a, a mountain goat haunt or a sheep hunt where you know you're going to go into very difficult terrain and you have x amount of days, how do you pack for that?

Speaker 2:          01:42:14       Like as far as food? Yeah, two pounds a day, two per day. And then you want to be range ranging between 100 to 120 calories per ounce on your food choices. So I break it down. Do you concentrate on, um, vitamins? Do you think about like I do, yeah, I'll bring, I'll bring supplements. Um, I'll bring, uh, you know, uh, whether it's um, you know, electrolyte replacement tax or vitamins and that type of stuff. And then the other part of it's just whole foods, making sure we max out that Kelly's frowns high fat content. And then the other thing I tell you to tell people is try it when you're not hunting. Totally. You have to, if you don't like it, you're going to hate it on the mountain. Like one year about these new pro bars. If you tried to pro bar. Yeah, I got those to kind of nasty after awhile.

Speaker 2:          01:43:01       I mean there's a lot to it. There's nuts and grains. Yeah, they're very filling and they're very big and dense, but triton one for 10 days or three of them a day for 10 days. At the end of it, you don't even want to eat it. And so I've, I believe now for me at least, and what I recommend to our customers is bring food you like now that you love and focus on that stuff versus trying to get crazy on something new that you haven't tried and thinking, okay, I'll go to rei and by all these different types of exotic bars and that'll be my food source. Dude, before I was on a ketogenic diet, I was eating like 10 of those pro bars a day. So I don't know what you're talking about. Well, the peanut butter and chocolate ones. I fucking love those days when Jamie, all the time I lived on him for 14 days in the mountains, I couldn't, I, if I ate another one, I'd throw, you know that that expression find me the best looking woman somewhere. There's a guy is tired of fucking a lot of it with the food is a you, you, you got to try it out

Speaker 4:          01:43:51       early. You got to try it beforehand. I mean, I tell people like if you, if you've never eaten mountain house, I mean it's, it is, it's like second nature to us. I mean, so much of that shit that it's like I got, I mean I got tell people mountain houses, dehydrated, freeze dried or freeze dried. Yeah. Whether it's mountain house or, I mean there's a million kinds of it, but I've gotten to where like I can only eat a certain, some of them function better for me. Like I don't like any of the red sauce. I don't like don't ever eat Chili Mac, by the way. Why just try? It goes right through you. Yeah. Your buddy when you're hunting was going to be bummed you ate it. But if you, if you've got somebody you're hunt with, you don't like feed him Chili Mac. But if you've never had a hang time, if you've never done it before and, and you know, you all of a sudden you go on this great big trip and you're stressed, you know, and you're traveling and all this stuff and all of a sudden, you know, it's like throwing diesel into an unleaded car.

Speaker 4:          01:44:37       I mean if you've never ran on that before, you don't really know how you're going to run on it. He, that's what he got to do it, do it right. You know, and, and a lot of people, you know in freaks him out. You know what's the thing leaving the outfit? It was cause you on a sheep hunt, they'll provide the food. Right. But you don't know what they're going to give you. They don't know what you are going to like the always over pack. You mean the food bags? We'll hand, you'll be 40 pounds for 10 days when you really need 20 pounds because they don't know. The last thing we want is a client that doesn't like what they have to eat or runs out of food and so this is all part of it. And then part of it you may not like what they provide you thing is super interesting and I'm messing around with that actually as we as we speak, because the thought of being able to go for 10 days with sustained energy while you're burning your own fat.

Speaker 4:          01:45:20       I mean that is, that is like, I would say that's cutting it. I'm messing around with that right now. That's why I got that mct oil and all that stuff. I'm going to, I'm going to try that this fall to see because I've been in places, you know, and, and it's kind of funny like I've had times where you run out of food or you have so little food that I think your body has switched over to where it's just strictly absolutely. And then you feel fine. Like it's like it just goes away. So we'll hunger goes away in some sort of a weird way, and there's, there's also a bunch of different people that are involved in this now that are coming up with snacks and different foods that you could take with you when you're a, that's one of the reasons why I wanted to ask you guys what you're carrying around, but once your body's into Ketosis, you know, then you just need high fat, high fat content foods, and you've got to figure out how to keep them.

Speaker 4:          01:46:00       Okay. All right. Keep them from going bad while you were out there in the mountain, but almond butter, things along those lines and bringing a lot more of that than powerbars. Yeah, and peanut butter, the probably peanut butters, most peanut butter you're going to get is going to be loaded up with sugar and just you can even get the insulin spikes are going to get the crashes when, when you talking about 20 pounds of food, that doesn't seem like a lot. If you tell me 20 pounds of food for how many days for 10 to two pounds of food today I talking to is our antiquing already. I'm panicking, I'm starving, I'm going to start off. You've got to ration it out. You got to ration it out. Yeah. And I mean, it's not like you're sitting around like, Oh man, I'm ready to get something to eat. I mean, you're right. You're doing stuff. You're glassing it. Like, I mean, it's just like, here's the line as you're hungry to go, it's like going on a diet. It's, it's, it's, it's basically you're in the mountains, but your meal prepped.

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       Like there's your little meal, you know, it's like these guys that are slimming down and be on these competent, you know what it's like, that's all you get. And do you have them broken down into packets? We have, I have broken down per day, so I have a Ziploc bag with my day. And how big is, it was a law clerk and it's about this big, maybe it's not very big. That's so crazy. Like, and then you know, every day is broken down. Exactly that way. So what's nice about it as you get back at night, you're exhausted. You take your empty bag out that you ate all day, that goes in the garbage, and then you pull your new one out of your food bag and dump in your pack. So there's no guesswork. None can't be. And Are you eating this stuff like we were talking about before you go out there or are you trying to live off that for a few days?

Speaker 3:          01:47:27       I try everything year round, so if the new, something new comes out or we learn about something new, I'm trying to, during my training, I'm trying, trying to in the off season to make sure I'm going to like it. Have you ever, uh, there's, or a new product that's out of this, a friend of mine has put out, it's called phat fudge. Have you heard of this? Nope. It's a see pull up. Um, I think it's p h a t fudge.com I think is her, uh, the website, which she sells it, but she's a, or it might be Paleo chef.com, but she's a created this, um, it's like a snack. It's very nutrient date dance. It's up to fudge that has mct oil in it. Very low sugar. I think it's got like a little bit of honey in it. Um, but they're, they come in these small individual packets.

Speaker 3:          01:48:08       Dude, I fucking live on, I got to try that. It's fantastic. But that's the type of stuff that is so powerful in the mountains. Yeah. Because it's small packet. You, you know, just rip the top off it and shove it in your mouth and chew it down. And uh, you know, you can see, you see all the ingredients are, it's key to genic and uh, it's called got cow, it's got Tumeric, cinnamon, sea salt, Maka honey grass fed butter. It's all like super, super good stuff. But it's, you know, a lot of calories for like a little tiny thing, but very nutrient dense. And for someone who's trying to burn off nothing but fats, it's a good way to go. It is. Yeah. The whole, the, the concept of burning fat versus using sugars was introduced to me. We're doing some vo, two Max testing and weight with our packs on at a UC Davis performance lab.

Speaker 3:          01:48:55       And that guy trained, uh, worked with us cycling team and they were talking about this movement into burning fat versus using gel shots and sugars. Yeah. And I've started to, in our diets and what we bring, that's been our focus and this made a really big difference. It's made a big difference with me. Uh, it's made a big difference with a lot of UFC fighters. Misha tate switched over to a Kesha, Jen tita genic die before she won the title. Brian Caraway, her boyfriend, he's on it too. He said weight cutting is way easier as performance levels are higher. And one of the things that I'm finding with myself and with a lot of my friends have gone on as your testosterone goes up noticeably, and some guys, it's going up by double real. It's because the precursors for testosterone, it's all about, it's all about fats.

Speaker 3:          01:49:36       It's all about your body turns, fats, saturated fats and cholesterol, all that stuff that you were eating from healthy fats turns that into hormones. That's like what it, and it's one of the, the, the big problems with going on high carb, low fat diets is that your body has a difficult time creating hormones through that. I didn't know that. Really interesting and new stuff that's coming out is if these guys that are taking it, they're finding that when they're doing their blood tests that their testosterone levels are higher, their growth hormone levels are higher. It's really interesting stuff. Like I think your body is designed to eat that natural food like plants and vegetables and meats. It is, you watch a bear. What eats first? All the fat fish. Oh yeah. He needs to meet. Yup. I mean that's the number one food source, energy sources, fat first.

Speaker 3:          01:50:26       I mean it's a wonderful thing. It's just for, for whatever reason, our society society, that's what makes people fat is really the sugars. Yeah. It's a sugar. It's 100% of the sugars. This stuff changes all the time. And if you go back five years ago and you read some of the studies that are done and what people recommend like for as far as diet now today it's totally contrary to that. It is, it's interesting how this, the, the edge is always moving. It's a cutting edge of this stuff is always, it's always changing. And people were always coming up with a new studies that show better ways to eat. And that's the fun thing about what we're doing is we're, you know, we're always there. There is no magic bullet. I got guys call all the time like, Hey, what, what jacket do I need?

Speaker 3:          01:51:06       It's like dude, it doesn't look like that. Clear small, what is the name? What does this mean? Island in southeast Alaska ties density of black bears in the world. And I've handed it and it wasn't dot comed and I just liked the way the name lays out. I like the way the balance, the look and when I was hunting it, and this is when I had Sitka is hunting there with my ex business partner and actually gortex before they had licensed us and invested in us and woke up the morning before everybody else is sitting on the back of the button and I like thinking about Kuya the name and I was like, that's one of the name of the next company. And I don't know why that even came to my mind because we're in the midst of buildings that could, but I just liked the name for whatever reason, just my gut told me that was it.

Speaker 3:          01:51:50       Go with the gut. Totally. Always. Every time. Every time. Yeah. Isn't amazing when you follow it, how powerful it is. It's my whole life I've always gone with my gut. Totally. Yeah. It's, there's no, there's no other way. You know, so many people are, are driven or, or the, her entire life is about fear and it dictates everything they do versus following your gut and putting the fear of side. And once you do it makes all the difference in life. If fear is good, it is a motivating factor. Yeah. Well it's also the lack of fear can be very dangerous. Absolutely. One of the, one of the things that I would say like people that are not scared when they're fighting, like those two people are in trouble. You're in trouble, man. You should be fine. It nobody likes to be scared. But when I was competing, the worst tournament's that I ever fought in, I was not nervous. It was too confident and I've, I just perform poorly. But when I was fucking terrified and like completely on edge, then your body's just, it's just primal. It's

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       just like you get down to that, that the bare minimum amount of understanding of what, what you have to do of the thinking, the, the rest of the world fades away. And all you're thinking about is that task. Do you cutting out everything else? There's no thought about bills. There's no thought about the future. There's just what's going on in front of you right now. And when, if you can get down to that, that's when you perform at your best. But it's fucking terrifying. So nobody likes it. Nobody likes to be like, when you see guys that are in like the UFC that are like, like, here's a good example now I'm a big fan of Luke rockhold. I think he's an awesome guy. Just talking about on the way down, he was way too relaxed the time he was going to kill Michael Bisping. Michael bisping fought that fight like he was going in against a fucking silver back gorilla.

Speaker 1:          01:53:30       He was terrified or not terrified, but you know, jacked up with nerves and like you're always on the line for him and that's how you walked. Knocked him out. Such a great sport because first knock out too in the UFC, it's this first Kale like that. That's how I sell them on the way to like Jorge Rivera in Manchester and kind of get beat down mayhem. Miller as a Tko. But the, the Tkos. Yeah, I mean he's also sitting down and his punches better. Jason Parillo, his boxing coach has really been working with him and d done a fantastic job with him and with Cris Cyborg and a bunch of other people that you build up to. That reminded me of Keith Jardine talking about Houston Alexander. It was like, I kept thinking like, man, he's really dismissive. Like even in my league and all that stuff and all of a sudden you're done.

Speaker 1:          01:54:17       You can't, when a guy's a professional fighter, if you just stood there and let him punch you in the face, would it knock you out? Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so that it can fucking happen. They kind of, yeah, and the last thing you want to be is the guy that says, this guy can't beat me. I'm going to go in there and fuck them up. And then you wake up with a flashlight and your eyes like, what? What's going on? The Dr. Santiago, we don't move. You're like, oh shit. What happened motherfucker? And then you have to deal with that. That ego that allow the ego tells you that it's going to protect you from all this, you know, do the baddest motherfucker have, you don't have to worry about shit. Ooh, I don't even have to worry. And then blam and you're like, God dammit. Ego.

Speaker 1:          01:54:54       Ego leaves you alone. Like, where are you now bitch? He goes, it's okay to say it. Just don't believe it. Yeah. Yeah. And even if you say it, he's got to be real fun. Yeah. You gotta be looking at her saying it too. These guys are killers. I mean, I just, man, that sports awesome. It's a crazy sport is Brendan's got me into it and I never missed a fight. Now have you come live yet? I have. Where have you been? To live and to the Thompson Hendrix. I've been at like 25 of them that he was at Thompson Hendrix. Nice. Lorenzo Fertitta. His nephew owns go hunt. Yeah. Yeah. So the runs in our buddy. So he took me, we got full access. Oh, that was beautiful. That's beautiful. Yeah. The big ones coming up next weekend you'll see 200 is alive. Oh yeah. Man on TV.

Speaker 1:          01:55:35       Oh yeah. Yeah. I was like, wait, I need a bill to hear Rogan so I know what's going on. Well, they have these little things, these little radios that you can get at the concession stand. Can you really? Yeah. Most of that. Most arenas have them now. And you take these little radios and you, you turn them on and it actually has a frequency that picks up the commentary. Really? Yeah. It's excellent. It's really cool. I missed that part. Yeah. Well there's sometimes something's going on. You don't know what happened. Yeah. And like, like they stopped the fight. Like, why'd they stop the fight? You don't realize, oh, he's fucking legs broken or, yeah, exactly. You can takes a while. Yeah. Yeah. Commentary. And it also, uh, I believe you can get, I'm not sure about that. There might just be fight pass. One of the cool things about UFC fight passes, you can listen into the corners.

Speaker 1:          01:56:14       Oh, you can? Yes. The corner guys are miked up, so you can, you can hear like someone saying, Oh, you know, his hands broke, or Oh, you know, uh, this is what you gotta do. Yeah, yeah. You just get, you get insight and you also get a sense of a building up anticipation. Like if you know that a guy's got an injury and then he's trying to gut it out, it makes it even more exciting to watch. You know? I mean, yeah, it's an awesome sport. Like I said, I only have a couple of hobbies watching mma, hunting. That's it. And then they're, they're very, it's very, they're very comparable, like, you know, from going from being a wrestler. I mean, he, I mean, it's just, it's exciting. It's slow portions of nothing in this training and grinding and all of a sudden, and then every now and again you get to step in and, and, and, and see where you're at.

Speaker 1:          01:56:56       I mean, it's, it's, it's, you know, like you always say like two guys. I mean, that's, that's a stripped down to the gets. You either win or lose at 50 50. I'm either going to win or I'm not. And same with hunting. I mean at at certain point in time in that hunt, you either you either get them or you don't like the percentages work out like that. I mean it's, that's, that's the cool thing about it. Well I think also like hunting, it's very, it's not perceived correctly by a lot of people. It was very misunderstood and a lot of people think of it as this barbaric, awful thing involving bullies and assholes when really they're incredibly intelligent, difficult people were pursuing one of the most, one of the most difficult things to do with dire physical consequences. If you fail those bullies and assholes, they don't have the dedication to get there.

Speaker 1:          01:57:37       Those aren't the real guys. Well they don't have the understanding of who they actually are. The two do in order to face your own fears, like a lot of the bullies in the assholes, like you can get a certain distance with that, with physical power and genetic attributes. I mean some guys just hit fucking hard and they're just good at taking a shot. And if you stand in front of them, whale with them, they might catch you and knock you out and beat your ass and you just got beat by a bully. But the reality is when those guys get to a steep emile chick or Cain Velasquez or you know, the best of the best, they're going to get fucked up. Yeah. Because those guys are just as just as physically strong just as kate, but also have their mental shit in order. They have their ego in order, they have their understanding in order. And those guys are some of the nicest, most down to earth people you ever going to meet because they get their ego checked on a daily basis. Every one of my met, we have some guys that are customers of ours. Um, Tj and Mendez and I mean they're really sharp guys. Very Sharp and very nice, very polite, not assholes. Very thoughtful. I mean just great people to be around.

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       And they also recognize that same thing in hunting. They do. You know, Tj and Chad are gigantic hunt in chat libs for it. He wants to do that. Like now on most really good athletes that you would come across that are hot. I mean like that's, that's like their second passion. I love doing tons of baseball players and football players and I mean cause like man, what the intensity. The same, you get the same drug out of it. Yeah. This DNA, right? I mean those guys, same guys were the hunters of the tribe, right? Are the athletes. Yeah. And it just, it's a natural natural deal. We had a, Carson Palmer is a customer of ours and he had never, it's Kinda like you never been hunting before. Carson Palmer is a quarterback for the cards. I literally don't follow any other sports. That's awesome. I can tell you everything you want to know about mma or kickboxing or, I love a narrow focus now I'm all about narrow folk apparently.

Speaker 3:          01:59:31       Yeah. So Carson won a thing called the heisman trophy. I heard about that. Jamie told me about that. It's this metal trophy thing that you get for playing football in college. And then he's the quarterback for the now of the cardinals. But then he was Cincinnati and he had a guy on the team that took them hunting during a off during one of their by weeks, put it up in a tree stand. He never been hunting before. He grew up in Orange County like I did and he said the first time the deer walked under a stand, a buck, he, the adrenaline and the DNA of that process took over and he is just a die hard hunter now. And it's all he wants to do. When he, when he's done playing football, he, he only wants a honey, he wants to invest in Ku use so it can be involved with hunting.

Speaker 3:          02:00:07       I mean, it's just that happened for him like it happened for you see, it happens so much with athletes. We have Brent Burns plays for the game called hockey hockey that's on the thing on ice with ice skates. He actually, well it is water. If they freeze it, these water. Right. Yeah. And, and he's the same way. He just got into hunting and he is just like, this is the most amazing thing. Yeah, just DNA. It's intense. It's, it's, it's unbelievably intense and again, incredibly rewarding. I mean, like when I go to the store and buy a steak, there's no reward. It's like, oh, this is delicious. I can't wait to eat it. That's not like, you know, cooking up a deer backstrap that, you know, you had to get out of the mountains. Yeah. I love your instagram posts of your elk steaks with the Jalapenos.

Speaker 3:          02:00:47       Yeah. He'll be the next day. Yeah. The next day I went and cooked it up just like you did. Oh, do I sweat like a pig? I got sweat pouring out of the top of my head. Everybody's laughing at me, but Mike, it's so good. Isn't amazing. Oh Man. With Jalapenos, man, if you tried it that way every way possible, you can't. I've had it raw to burn. Anything you can put on it. Love it all. Yeah. Yeah. It's the best meat you can ever eat and my kids have been eating it for four years now. I have a six year old. It's been eaten bear since she was three. So awesome. Yeah, it's, it's the healthiest food. It's, it feels better. It feels better when you eat it. It really does. Well. It's flat out better for you too. Yeah, I'm, and I'm really into pursuing the art of cooking it in a bunch of different ways too.

Speaker 3:          02:01:31       And that's another thing that I learned from Rinella. I'm uh, getting Hank Shaw who I think lives up your way too. And he's a wild game famous chef who's turned to becoming a hunter because he was interested in trying to prepare this food and be more connected with food. So then he started hunting and then using, yes. He uses a lot of local ingredients to a lot of like ingredients from the area where the animal actually lives. It's really interesting too. Yeah. Do you cook? I barbecue. That's it man. Style fire in me. That's all I do. If I, if I can't barbecue, I don't wanna Cook it. Well that's the best way anyway. It is. You know, especially now, it really is. Um, but yeah, talking about chefs, like Guy Fieri, he's like a client of ours. You know who he is. Yeah, sure. Yeah. And so he's, he's actually become buddies with, with Brendan because he likes to smoke meat and cook me like you didn't and we've got to shave his head.

Speaker 3:          02:02:25       Yeah. Right. Cause it's not the eighties buddy. He loves us. Frosted tips. Got To go down holding down a hack that stuff off. We got a three yeah. Three haircuts for one this morning. By the way, if you haven't noticed, we got damn your haircut looks good. Thank you very much. Locks of love. No hope here. Yeah. Cause it gotta have to shave their head too. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Um, like chefs, like Anthony Bourdain, he took me hunting in Montana recently. We went on a pheasant hunt and uh, you know, he, he's a big fan of doing that as well as cooking the animals. You know, that he, he hunts himself and showing you how to prepare it properly and he's done that a bunch of times on his show and involved in it. Yeah. Yeah. It's fun. It's actually fun to put different Marinades, put different recipes together.

Speaker 3:          02:03:12       I mean, I throw it on the barbecue, but there's a lot that goes into it. And then also you know, something that people don't do. I think enough of with wild game, they wonder why it doesn't taste right. It's proper aging. Your meat. I don't know if you'd do that with yours. I do sometimes, but most of the time I just cook it. Yeah, I mean it's better if you're agent, you can do a quick age of your fridge. We put up like on a rack, like a in like a pan or a plate with like a wire rack that gets it off the bottom of it and then put foil over the top and let that blood drain out. And how long do you age it for? I'll age backstrap for 10 days in my fridge. Really? And it is so much better. What does it smell like?

Speaker 3:          02:03:46       It doesn't smell like anything really. Nothing. How come it doesn't stink after 10 days. And your friends not rotting, it's just aging. They do that with beef. Right. But then the outside of it is all black. But that's what you're supposed to do. You're, you're cut off the outside edges and that's what you do. It'll trap as well. What you'd do with any me. Yeah, but that outside doesn't stink. Nope. It just gets dry and it actually builds a crust. You Trim off the crust and cook the middle million times better. What is the temperature that it has to be at when you're doing that? You can cook it medium to cook a medium rare. I mean when you're the giants, if you're going to quick age, it goes on your fridge. Just the normal frigerator temperature, which is what, I don't know, 36 38 degrees.

Speaker 3:          02:04:23       But when they like dry age meat, when you go to a like one of those shops, similar temperatures, my brother went to culinary school. He's the one that taught me that real. It was like you need to age your meat cause you'll get all the blood out of it. The blood is what causes a Gamey or flavor and also it also tend to rise as your meat when you agent try it right? Because you take a piece of back strap, put it in the fridge with little bit of soy sauce and some brown sugar or something on it. I mean, you're not eating sugar anymore, but if you do that, it'll, I mean it's phenomenal. I don't know if it would go bad. It's never, I've never left it long enough where you couldn't eat it. But, uh, I mean I've, I've left a backstop for weeks, weeks, weeks.

Speaker 3:          02:05:00       It doesn't rot. That's interesting, isn't it? Does more sustainable because it doesn't have all that fat on it. Like a beef steak, the age beef. Right. But do you do that? And it just seems weird because people don't do it, but it's like, like a guy I know that big African Ph, he'll take a whole hind quarter. Um, the guy's name is Steve Colbert and he told me this, he'll take a whole hindquarter and put his fridge in a fridge at his house for 30 days. And then it's the best. It is. So a Ph for people don't know as a professional hunter, which in Africa is like a guide. It is. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Do you know Steve Cabrini? No. So he's a bow hunter. Really cool guy. Big Guy. Um, he's basically killed everything in Africa with a bow. I don't know that anybody else has ever done it.

Speaker 3:          02:05:43       Like this guy's the real deal. It goes into the gnarliest places, but he takes, takes people hunting over there and stuff, but almost, almost entirely a bow hunter himself like stud and you know, I'll, I'll introduce you to, it's really cool. Like everything and out. No one's killed more animals in Africa than him. Everything. He's been everywhere to everything. You know what? Just think of the sink, thinking of his meat, sit in the frigerator for 30 days. It doesn't go bad. It's crazy. Yeah. I mean it's a cover it in foil, put a rack so the blood can drain out and they can sit there for, it'll be a man. You'll be amazed at how long you can age it and how good it is when you do. Is that the key? Because I've had me sit in like a, like a bought a steak at a store and let sit in my refrigerator for too long.

Speaker 3:          02:06:25       Then you open up the meeting like, oh, it smells terrible. That's already been age two and sitting on itself. Right, right. And that is that the key that it has to drain out of its blood. And so you don't wrap it up. Don't put it, don't, don't contain it right underneath. And then you can, the other way, if you don't have a rack, you can take, I do as a bowl, right? Or a pan. I'll put foil over it and punch holes in it so it's suspended in that blood and go through those holes in the flow that you put foil over the top, slide it in your fridge. Did they sell like a rack for aging in your refrigerator? Nurses by little, they make little cooking racks that are just like screens with that are designed to go on a pan and get stuff off the off of a pan.

Speaker 3:          02:07:01       Know. That's interesting. I'm going to, I'm going to try that. You've got to try it. Yeah. I haven't been doing that. I just don't make a huge difference. I marinate sometimes. You know what I like to do? I have to take Newman's own Balsama yeah, just put it in that for a, you know, five or six hours. He was a great man. Yeah. Yeah. That's excellent. And then pull it out. Someone, um, served a sheep. I was at a, um, uh, a camp. It was absolutely at to hone. We were, it was a pig hunting and someone, um, brought by, uh, some sheep back straps and they had it marinated in a Italian address. God's right there. There's nothing better than dall sheep or stone sheep back shops. Yeah. It's amazing how good they taste so good. Civitas is that the best meat of all the meats is the same as then horn, big horns, not near it.

Speaker 3:          02:07:47       It's, it's good. And like the harder you work for it, the better it is. But like a sheep tinder line pulled right out one minute each side as hot as you can get it. And I mean, it's just, that's it. Yeah. Right. You just want to see her at, no one will ever know how good it is because they never make it out. No critical ever get a bite of that. Right. Because they never get it out of the mountain. Nope. Never comes out. Most of the time you cook it while you're up there, right? Yeah. A lot of times. Yeah, I do. We have a thing called man Kebabs, which is you got to hunt down the animal. You got to kill it. You got to bring it, you got to pack it back to camp. You got to start a fire that you create.

Speaker 3:          02:08:23       You got to harvest the willow stick that you're gonna put the meat on and you chop it up. You slide on the meat and at the time we only had top ramen seasoning, so we sprinkle the top Rosin Rom [inaudible], put it over the fire. That's a man Kebab top vegetables. It's kind of kind of funny though. The top Ramen is the CS, but top Ramen sees you. It's fucking good. It's fucking, when I used to eat that stuff and I get some of it, I'll just a little bit on the table, put it on my finger. It's delicious too. Good season, good seasoning. You get really creative. You don't have much. It's probably a good idea to like to bring like in camp, it's a small package. It's already sealed up. It's like a good size for, it's crazy and you do it as like a rub and the bobs on that thing.

Speaker 3:          02:09:02       Granted you're starving to death by the time you kill this animal and put out the fire. But it is off the hook. Well, when we, uh, when I hunted with Rinella the very first time and shot a mule deer and then we ate the liver that night, we hung up most of the meat and tree because it was like pretty close to dark and we went back the next day to pack it out. But when, uh, we went back to camp and ate liver and onions, like from an animal that died two hours ago, it was like the most insanely delicious food I've ever had in my life. You couldn't, I couldn't believe how good it tastes. Yeah. You were hunting. Did you guys, you guys handed down from the ferry up on the Missouri up there? Yeah. Yeah. On a cheap in there a bunch. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:09:36       That's it. Cool. I saw a lot of sheep up there. It's probably pretty hard to get a tag though, right? Hardest place in the world. Is that the brakes? Yeah. Yeah. Hardest place in the world. Get a tag. Yep. That's interesting. They're just doing a really good job of making sure the populations go up. Biggest sheep in the world and a, yeah, they had giant balls. We spent a whole segment of the show concentrating on the balls of the sheep, like Rinella. Made a video. Put as few as you can find this cause it's pretty funny. Um, we were, we were there and Rinella like is obsessed with these big horn sheep and their balls. And he's like, the moment I kill one of these things, I'm going to, I'm going to kill it and I'm gonna take one of those balls and I'm just going to eat it.

Speaker 3:          02:10:15       I've eaten an eat like an apple eating them. They're great. They're here. They're, they're the, they're the biggest of anything that I'm like, Oh yeah, that you killed. Yup. What does she bought this? I'm not doing that for Steve. Just make good like everything else. You're like Cameron Hanes. Cameron Hayes won't need heart. He won't eat liver. We want to do anything. I'm like, you're crazy. When we shot an elk house cutting the heart, I was like, you're going to eat that? I'm like, fuck yeah, I'm eat this around the hole I put in it. Oh yeah, yeah. You've got to cut around the hall. Yeah. Depending on what's a bow and Arrow, you don't have to do that. You know you get that weird funky led in your mouth. Yeah, exactly. So, uh, this is a, him and I up there and he started, he started

Speaker 5:          02:10:55       obsessing about the balls

Speaker 3:          02:11:01       exactly where you guys are. I mean exactly where you're at

Speaker 5:          02:11:05       when you go home and tell people what a bad spot I took you to. And you say, well, we did see a lot of big orange zone. What they're going to say is something like, what kind of dumb ass once mule deer in big horn county. You've never seen a scrolling. I'd love to show you if you turn right or house on diapers. No, it's perfect. It's like a, it's like a church bell. This is like a church bell hanging down translate or they also eat crazy animal. No, this isn't one of the real do at church bell. Yeah. That's impressive. Here it goes. The first thing I'm going to do when I kill him one and then punch my tag and I'm going to eat the contents of that sac just straight out. Just raw apples. Why? Why? I don't know. I feel a calling to do it.

Speaker 3:          02:12:19       He's another really important factor in educating people by Connie cause he's a very well read, very intelligent guy, very educated and really very, very ethical. I mean is it ethical and as driven as you can be. Do you read this book? American Buffalo? Yeah. Well I didn't read that one. I read the other one in the mediator one. Oh, did you read the American Buffalo? I heard it, yeah. He's got to this to the Max Buffaloes. Tragic. Yeah, it is. He spells it out so well. Well he had this guy on his podcast, Dan Flores, who is a wildlife biologist who a wild f. His story and I should say it's an amazing podcast where he details the history of animals and European settlers coming over here and the wiping out of the various animals and what's being done to try to restore that. They're primed. They're trying to do something called the American Serengeti where they're trying to put together like a, an area like a protected area, like as big as yellowstone, but that's actually good involve hunting. Really. You're buying property right now in Montana that's going on. What's it going to be? I don't know that much about it. I only just bought a property that's not very far from where you guys were there that um, that, that there, it's in block management, you're allowed to hunt it, but it's, you know, they're, I think they're pulling

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       the cattle off it and um, but you know, that's, that's a huge success story right there. I mean, those, those sheep were planted back in there in 1970s. It's probably the biggest herd and in Montana and certainly the best sheep hunting in the world. And they were planted in there in the 70s and started hunting in about 1990. They restarted hunting again. And I mean they were totally brought back from money from an auction tag, but a transplant in there and they've exploded onto the landscape. They were shot out by mark and hunting and, and domestic sheep interaction, you know, years ago and then brought back and now it's the best place in the world, you know, and that wouldn't happen. A lot of hunters and is an amazing success story. And that's, that's an also an interesting thing. These auction tags, which is really weird, where you let someone, you give them this opportunity to hunt.

Speaker 4:          02:14:17       And a lot of times these guys are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars. I got it. The most expensive tag in history, $485,000 right there. Missouri breaks. Yeah. What, 2013. Yeah. He wanted those balls, guy paid. So I mean, there was a huge ram that, uh, a couple of hours, three of us that, that guy did it. And, uh, there was, um, yeah, like I paid $485 and the, the money thing about that is really weird. It's this perception of some rich dude like you're paying for an opportunity to bypass the system to do something that you would normally have to draw. It's as simple as that. It's not like I'm going to spend this huge amount of money and you know, it's this huge head hunt in this ego thing and he got guys live here. I mean like there's so many misconceptions about what goes on with that type of thing that it's not even funny.

Speaker 4:          02:15:02       It's a tax write off. It's a donation of wildlife if you really care about wildlife and it gives the guy an opportunity to take, you know, and again, if you're a billionaire, if you've made a ton of money and you care about wildlife and you love to hunt, why would you not do that? It's not that weird. I mean, I mean it's all relative. It's money and said donation. And yes, we had, we had this big sheep, he spent 18 days hunting and it's the biggest one ever been killed with an auction tag in the United States and it was a phenomenal hunt and the guy you know was glad to donate the money and it's, you know it's, it's provided new sheep transplants money for wildlife that would not exist if they didn't do it. It's one tag and raise a half a million dollars. Well that's the big contradiction when people talk about hunting and hunting being for conservation, how it helps conservation that.

Speaker 4:          02:15:45       That is one of the biggest examples of it is how much money goes into helping these animals and habitat preservation and reintroducing them to areas like with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has done with reintroducing elk to a bunch of different places is the biggest success in North America. I mean they were shot basically into a few places and they've, they brought them back through and it's strongly been through money by guys that are fortunate enough to be able to do it. And it is, it's a total misconception. I mean you are paying, the guy is paying money as a tax donation and he's giving money to something he truly cares about that he loves and has probably grown up doing is, you know, this guy was self made, started painting boards and West Virginia and started a bank and made $1 billion. You know, like he loves hunting. That's what loves.

Speaker 4:          02:16:29       He was not, it's not some rich guy panda. You don't put a head on his wall and he, and, and he was glad to do it. And you're paying for the opportunity. I mean, the thing that's always lost in it is, is the dead animal or whatever the guy's paying for the opportunity. We had no advantage over anybody else was the same season everybody else did. And the guy, we ended up killing him, you know, a great big Ram, which was, you know, obviously the goal, but I mean, one sheep raised a half a million dollars and does incredible and, and a guy, he was banned for the opportunity. He's not paying for it, you know, you know, it'd be a hell of lot easier to buy a great big head to put on your wall. Then it would to be to spend that much money and then go out there and maybe not get them.

Speaker 4:          02:17:05       But the, the pursuit is, is what drives and how does that work? Look, there's three guides. So do you, did you guys scout in advance and find those unique? Those are unique situation. We had a son in, in it's, it's a basically a three year story of following one ram Ram me called [inaudible] 52 and in 2010, a friend of ours was with a guy who killed around, um, up in the breaks, same deal, exact same area you ran. And there was a big ram standing with it. There was two big rams together, killed one of them. And, and uh, the next year when we were up there scouting, we came across this ram. I'm like, that's the same ram in the photo. They took a photo right before they killed it. And then we tried to hunt them in 2012. Didn't get him. And in 2013 it was like this, this ram.

Speaker 4:          02:17:48       He was really big. And then he slipped through two years. Nobody got him smart old, smart old sheet. I mean, really smart. And it was all of a sudden, you know, we let a few guys know that, hey, there's not an unusually big ram up here, and if, if you want a chance to hunt it, and it's unique in the timeframe and the fact that there's not always big sheep around. I mean, this is, this is one year. This ram is alive right now. And we told a few guys and five guys went, you know, there was five guys that are willing to pay half a million dollars. I went to, I mean, there was five guys bid in over $460,000 for the opportunity to hunt this area.

Speaker 4:          02:18:25       Look at the size of that thing. Oh my God. There you go. The horns on that thing are insane. Yeah. Will he edinger Al Mckinney and myself and, uh, I mean, we spent 18 days like rattlesnakes out there and it was a, it was an awesome hunt. I mean it's, uh, it's, it was a smart old ram. It was, uh, it was just a, just a really cool deal and the guy and we ended up getting it. Um, how far do you take it from? He almost killed it with a bow. We, I snuck him into 12 yards, came over the top on it and a resident hunter, uh, being a dick came down the ridge and spooked the sheet that spotted us, knew we were hunting as sheep and came down and spooked the ram. But he should have killed it with a bowl. We, I mean a hunter with a sheep tag where the sheep tag. Yeah. They do it on purpose. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I mean if you saw three guys and you knew that they had a guy with him that had paid $485,000 to be there, new, all this, you would probably think I'm probably in the right area. Right. All these guys. Yeah. No Shit. But that's where

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       it gets weird with public land, right? Yes. Does that Ram bugged out? We killed him 10 days later. Nine miles from where there and how far was the, the shot when he killed him, he shot him at four 60 that's a different, oh wow. That's another, that's a different realm. God Damn, that thing's massing. Tazy so I was fortunate to be on both of those. That's two of the top five sheep ever killed Montana and 10 days. They are just majestic beasts. When you look at the, what nature has given them in their head, like what a crazy animal that develop these gigantic battering rams out of the top of their skull and the photos really don't do those things. Just know you put your hands on those horns. I mean, it's impressive. Both 11 and a half years old. I mean that's, that's the end of his life.

Speaker 3:          02:20:09       I mean he's, you know, he's, he's running his full course that Ram actually did not run at all, that Ram had a broken shoulder and we had seen him for a couple of years. He had a really small body and he was actually a nondominant sheep and it was, it was just kind of floating around out there. He wasn't really, he was, he was just physically, physically past his prime. Yeah. So did you like fall or something or hunting accident? Hard to say. It's hard to say. Yeah. I mean they have a tough life. Yeah. That it's for an animal like that to live that long. It's nature is so incredible and it's diversity that this is something that we have here in North America, this incredible animal. Just a strange looking. I mean almost [inaudible] we're so used to them. We know they exist, so I don't think we kind of appreciate them as much as if it were just introduced to them as an adult.

Speaker 3:          02:20:51       If you'd never heard of or seen it before, probably blow you away. Totally. But a crazy animal. It's kind of a battering ram on its head. It does. I always say like with desert sheep, you know they had this tiny little neck and it's like when you see one out in the desert, a desert sheep, a big Ram, it's like they wouldn't look any stranger if they were green. Like if they landed on Mars, if they landed on Mars and all of a sudden there was a desert, she popped his head up. You'd be like, it's about what I thought it'd be here. It's rocky and dry and his next this big and he's got a 50 pound head. Like that's about what I thought. Have you ever seen the video with the ram and the cow? Buttheads I haven't. Gerrymandering does a video, crazy video where this ram starts moving towards this cow and the cows calf and the cow decides it's going to Headbutt this ram. Watch this go full screen. Check this out, watch the ram comes in in division and the cows like, fuck this so it sees it. Watch this.

Speaker 3:          02:21:48       The callout Chiodo and he gets up. I can't tell if that's a bull. Is it a bull or a cow? I can't tell them. That's hard to tell. It's a blurry ass picture or blurry video, but it's just this tiny little thing that weighs about 150 pounds. The cows, not much more than a thousand and chaos, he said, but I've seen him. I mean, I've seen rams that had their skulls broken entire horn torn off like that, that amount of power. I mean they, they get up and when they hit and then just like this state of right after gag know where after you take a huge upper cut and they just stand there and kind of go, oh, and then they kind of come back and I'm like, all right, let's do that again. I didn't get enough of that. They've got, they've got cte. Yeah. Oh for sure.

Speaker 3:          02:22:29       Yeah. I don't do a football study on them. Yeah, exactly. You got to wonder like what? What did, what crazy design that nature has figured out a way to have all these various different does it, here we go, boom. And they just sit, stand there. Look at this collision. That's when to make your stock right. Then. Well, one of these dummies needs to figure out how to dive under and get an uppercut going. Get some leverage. Yeah. Just like don't head bottom to come. You got to Juco and then slide under. You're talking about, you're talking about the balls. Big Horn sheep have two moves. So it's this move right here. And then when they're posturing and kicking each other around their other movies, they get behind each other and smash each other in the balls. Oh, the front kick to the is a big horn sheep.

Speaker 3:          02:23:10       Look at the balls, look at the balls in these things. Watch this. Boom. Look at these nuts. Look at these nuts. Look at there's nothing. And if I had nuts like that, I'd never wear pants. I'd be like, everybody's just deal with what I've got here. That you wouldn't be doing a podcast, maybe doing videos. That'd be in the poem business son. And that echoes for like the sheep I hinted last fall. That's how I actually found him. Oh, you hear here in the middle of the night, boom. It sounds like gunshots going off real and you'd get up. I got up and yeah, it's, it took me four hours to figure it out where they were because it echos all over. But you can get about every 25 minutes you'd hear boom. And it just sounds just like a gunshot and it's like, okay, they're there and you start honing it in and boom, there they were.

Speaker 3:          02:23:48       Wow. 10 Rams and they were butting heads. Yup. It's pretty, pretty cool. Like little things like that. It's like he just so cool. Well, being out there in the wild, you get to experience firsthand the diversity of all these wild. They're like mule deer with their incredible racks or elk or or big horn sheep and there's so many bizarre creations and there's so much diversity. Are they hitting each other in the balls? Oh yeah. How rude. Look at it. He's just kicking him out balls. He's like, fuck you. I'm going to get behind you and kick you in the ball. I was like, no, no, no, no, no. I already know that move every time he's kicking the other sheep in the balls. Get five minutes. See if you get kicked in the balls. Oh yeah. They've got no time. No time. It's hilarious. They know that they have balls, so they go to attack them.

Speaker 3:          02:24:35       You know, what the fuck did they figure that out? How do they know that? Balls or I guess they know that they have balls. You have balls that big, you're going to figure that out. Something's going to hit those things. But what a bunch of dickheads or magic, they're fascinating to. They're like, I mean, when they're in the Rut, they're, they're a totally different animal than when they're, when the early, you know, when they're, when they, when they get late in the year and start chasing like there's nothing, they just go insane. Isn't that also bizarre that they have a season where they have to have sex where you lose your mind? Yeah. Once we got that too. Yeah. But we get to do it all at all at college and we can jerk off. Yeah. You can alleviate it yourself. So he could think clearly.

Speaker 3:          02:25:12       But these poor bastards, you know, all the wait all year, all year, no one, they go nuts. Just getting ready. No wonder they're balls are so big and dearborn with weapons. Yup. Yup. You know, and, and as they get older, the more dominant ones of the bigger weapons, which is this what a strange system that nature's figured out. It is, isn't it? And it's also strange to me like how you see when it's all over, they bachelor up like when the ruts over, like we, we went moose hunting and BC last year and when the Rut was over we found these like bachelor groups of Moose there probably were trying to kill each other just a couple of weeks. We know how it is though. He beat up somebody. Your best friends after, right? I guess. Right? You don't bang his girlfriend either. Yeah. I don't think anybody has a claim on any of them.

Speaker 3:          02:25:51       They're all just running around trying to try to score. But I think when it's all over there, they're probably like, what the fuck was, what were we doing just a couple of weeks ago? Yeah. What came over us. I think they knew. I know, but it's just strange that it comes over them so strong here and it's so strong and the rest of the time, like a big Ram wants nothing. Like if you were, if your sheep hunting the rest of the year and you see in use, you're in the wrong spot. They want nothing to do with them really. I don't blame him. Yeah. Same, same with big, same a big bull elk and serve their purpose. Same. Yeah. Same with bullets. I mean, aside from the Rut and a few times or they interact the rest of the time. Like if you're seeing tons of counts, you're in the wrong spot.

Speaker 3:          02:26:32       Well, that's what I told you about, uh, when I was in Montana and we saw a hundred elk together. All cats this time. Yeah. No, no. All cows. Yeah. We're little spikes or something. Yeah, exactly. I saw like one spike. It's just, it's so fascinating that diversity that, that nature's created so many different animals. Like that one hunting gives us the opportunity to truly see it as it is. Oh yeah. There's like a national park or yellowstone. Yeah. To see it as it is up close in its natural habitat when it's quiet and you get the sales thing the way it's been for so long, does it, don't you feel like when, when you sneak up on an animal too and you, you, you lock eyes with that thing, it almost, you almost feel like you're in, it almost feels like a different dimension. There's all like that.

Speaker 3:          02:27:15       He gets your, you're in this world that they exist in and there's, there's no cell phone service. There's no people anywhere near you. It's a very strange environment. It is. It is. And it's like everything else gets tuned out too. It's like this laser focus of, of what's happening right then all your senses go way up. I mean, at least for me as far as smell and like you can feel the slightest breeze in your face and uh, you know, you can see that at, I'm gonna move really, really close like you'd never would notice before because of that laser focus intensity just kind of takes over your whole system and there's some of us stock on something. There's something about tricking an animal that's whole focus in life is to not get caught. That is a great sense of feeling like you do everything right in the right place and this thing walks by and like, oh and an Arrow was already on the way.

Speaker 3:          02:28:00       It's done deal. It's like you did it. I mean you, you, you outsmarted something that's 10 million years where the genetics and you, you got to fear, especially with bow hunting, like you got it in that close and got them. You not only that, we're clumsy. Our noses sock, we can't see very good things. Dog Shit. They have ears like satellite dishes. They're spinning around left and right. Looking all over the place. Trying to find you a mule deer in particular. Yeah, those giant ears. Well and their nose. Yeah. Oh yeah. The power sent this crazy. Yeah. I've seen the craziest stuff at the farthest distances. Hundreds of yards. Fuck this done. What do you think the wind's blowing at your back or on your face? It's actually going around the mountain and ends up right back at it. It's just amazing what happens. People are like, Oh, you're out there hunting, chasing the poor, defenseless animal eating defenseless.

Speaker 3:          02:28:48       And it was the offensive side. Have a way more big ones. Right. I always get them if they were defenseless, I mean there, there, there is smart. I mean there man, I've, I've seen him, you know I've, I've, I've hunted animals where they got one with you are gone. Yeah. Well and like gone for days. No gone. Never saw him again. Gone. He figured me out. Gone. They're round wolves. Totally. You know bears mountain lions. I've seen, yeah, I've seen deer do some crazy things like lay down on the ground and like hide from hunters. Hunters walk right by him like within yards and just do some really cool stuff. Sneak away from people and you go, those guys never knew their five yards away from a giant buck and that they just totally out smarter than him. It's the coolest thing. Yeah. There doesn't Denmat dumb humans walking by.

Speaker 3:          02:29:33       He's like, no problem. I was laid down. They'll never see me. Just imagine if you were a 300 pound animal that had escaped some them killing you all the time. That's your every day is try to get some grass and your system and get the fuck away from everything that wants to try and get laid once a year. Polygamist yeah, definitely not. You know, you're sleeping outside in Montana in the winter. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's amazing and we're so lucky in this country that the people like Teddy Roosevelt and the people that founded these, these areas for public land, they set them aside and I'll allow these places to, to be established with these animals can live and we never have to worry about them being taken over and they built malls there. I mean, it's, it's a really beautiful part of America. Even if you don't have any desire whatsoever to hunt.

Speaker 3:          02:30:22       The fact that you can go up there and backpack and camp and be in that natural environment, it's a really beautiful thing about America. Totally. Yeah. I mean, the perception of hunters, we're just out there to kill something. That's, for me, it's a small part of the whole thing. It's a good part though. It is. But it's be an outfit too and it is definitely good experience all that. I mean obviously I wouldn't be there without a tag. I get invited to go hiking or go to a park all the time or you know, National Party man, I'm not interested. But I mean it's uh, I mean being out in the mountains and the wilderness and seeing all this stuff is just awesome. Yeah. It's not like if you go hunting and it's unsuccessful, it's a zero. It's like a sentence that's like a six out of 10. If you, if you get a big elk, it's a 10 but if you, if you go out there and nothing happens like us hiking's a four so it's two points above a hike. Hiking, we call it. Especially if you actually see the animals. If you don't see the animals, it's like a five. If you don't see anything, you're like, what the fuck were we doing in this box? If you don't see anything, you need new friends. Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       Somebody somebodies been lying to you or he just, something happened, you know, you never know. Now these big horn sheep, they're very difficult to get a tag for right in Montana. Like there's so many of them now though. Um, yeah, it's, but I mean there's still not enough to go around. It's, it's the most, it's the most exclusive tag in the world. How many do they give out in Montana to get about 150 a year? I drew one last year. Oh Wow. I mean the odds in the best place at like one in 500 it's a lottery system. And then the lodge, like in the roughest areas that have better odds are like one in 101 and 500 that's incredible. So Brennan drew a sheep tag or Montana to hunt one sheep. Yup. You had one unit? Yeah, he showed me the picture of it when he drew the tag goes, I'm going to kill the sheep.

Speaker 4:          02:32:05       How did you know that? About the show? That he killed it. The sheeps dead? Yeah. You're a savage. Oh, was like the, I'm so glad I'm not that cheap right now. When you do that tag, when they, when they lose their mind once a year, they come out to the winter range and a buddy of mine, Robbie doctor had found this ram on the winter range and she sent me a picture of it and said, dude, you know, this is a huge ram in an unusual area. And uh, we applied for it. I mean, it's happened before like, oh, there's a big sheep. Nobody knows that. We didn't tell anybody. And then he showed up again the next year. It didn't draw the tag. And then last year I drew it and it was like I drew the tag and I was like, he's on the outer edge of the life expectancy of a sheep.

Speaker 4:          02:32:42       You know, it's a 500 square mile area. I'm going in there. As long as it takes 500 square miles, the Hud one sheet mindblowing. That's pretty great. Think about that. Well, that is the ultimate pursuit, right? While talking about the most difficult challenge of hunting with a bow. Yeah. How many are you getting from, uh, just outside my effective range? Long shot. Like I snuck in, I snuck in at 15 yards for 20 minutes. It took me 24 days to find him. I, I passed up 33 eight year old or better rams. Two days you spent scouting to, oh, I mean I lost track of time. I mean I put, I put on, I mean, I'm a crazy amount of job. Do you have, we all need one of those. He said, he said he's like, when, when, when I was like, dude, I, I drew the tag and like I was emotional.

Speaker 4:          02:33:28       I drew it like, I mean people don't understand like, oh, you got to tag the hunt. This thing, it's like 25 years in a row of knows how many people put in for the tag. And there's 150 tags available. So we just 150 tags in the whole state, the whole state. And how many people in this area? Two tags. So you got one of two to 220 people applied for two tags. And I drew one. Wow. It was like amazing. And you know, and I, I had a picture of this ram and like he had showed up on the winter range and then disappeared into this abyss called the Bob Marshall Wilderness. And it's like, I'm going to go in there and find them. And how many total days we hunting? Oh, I mean, 24 days, honey. I 124 days. I kind of scouting days you had was like ridiculous. Yeah. So you're going back and getting food and going back to him soon. Four or five days at a time. And like all good things, you know, like all the most amazing things. You know, timing is kind of a bitch. We had a baby due in the middle of my wife. We're fucking kill him right out there chasing one if did you see any of the rams? Yeah, but there wasn't quite big enough. Third, a third 33 I passed up 33 rounds before I push. Hold on a solid. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:34:40       Yeah. So, yeah, I mean it was after this one cheap and I thought, and you know, like when you talk about really getting to know animals, he had showed up on the winter range and twice we had pictures of him two years around on the winter range. And it's just like, okay, we got a picture of this big ramp. Well, what I started looking at the pictures and comparing them and all of a sudden I noticed that in in one picture from 2013 or from 2012 and one in 2013 he had the same two young rams with them a year apart, 10 miles apart in distance, and he had the same two sheep with them. So all of a sudden I'm like, you know, most people would be like, oh, it's just a sheep. And it was a little half curl. And then there's a young kind of unique look and ran with them and I'm like, it's the same room.

Speaker 4:          02:35:21       So all of a sudden I got a Ram band that I'm looking for there. You know, it's kind of a symbiotic relationship. Young rams allow old rams or old rams allow young rams to follow them around. They show him kind of the hills and they kind of tolerate them. It's not like, Hey, you're my buddy or anything. They just kind of like when when the census start to slip, you'll see old rams with young rams and they're keeping an eye on their back for him. And I see. So I figured out this Ram who was 13 years old, which is the oldest, so I end up killing him obviously. And he was 13 years old, which is the oldest ram killed the whole state of 150 by two years. So he's beyond, he's off the charts old. So he had these two young rams with him.

Speaker 4:          02:35:59       So I, I I, you know, basically you have known enough about she behavior. I was like, okay, I'm looking for this old ram and this massive area, but I'm actually looking for three sheet because if I see either of those two young rams without him, I'll know he's dead and it makes a big difference in 500 square miles. Look for three sheet versus one. Apparently. Huh. So I still retain. So I went in there and I was like, I'm going to go find every sheep and the entire unit. And I went in there and I found, I thoroughly believe that I found every single sheep in there. I counted almost 50 more sheep than the biologist thought was alive in there. And do you take photos of these? Oh yeah. The bottle to the biologists. Yeah. Yeah. It's, he's kind of changed his management plan in the area a little bit.

Speaker 4:          02:36:40       Like he knows more about it. I mean it's, it's like I went in there because, you know, for, since I was a little kid, it was like, man, that's something I always wanted to do and then you're going to get this opportunity. It was like, I'm not going to go do the easiest thing. I mean, I passed big rams, a big rams of my bowl, but I wanted this ram. I wanted to have like an epic con and just to see if I could do it, see if I could find it. And uh, and I hadn't found those young rams. And on the 23rd day, I said it, heard him pop and heads started glass and cutting the timber apart and all of a sudden, you know, another key to the puzzle. All of a sudden there's that little young ram that was with

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       him standing in the timber. Boom. I got him go down there, there's 10 rams in there and my ram walks out. That's him. You know, it took me two days to kill him, but I found them. And you doing all this by yourself? Um, I had a, I had my buddy that originally found the sheep when I found the rams, I called him. He's, he had a regular job and uh, it was about a 10 mile, uh, is about a 10 hour hike and he hiked in to help me hand signal and kill it. That's a good friend, right? Who Hiking 10 fucking hours for you. My friends be like, dude, uh, my wife just told me I gotta go on hiking. I call impact it out for you. But yeah, it's a good friend. He found the ram originally and then, yeah, and I, I called him and he disappeared, you know, he, he jumped off of work like, like his wife was in labor, you know, Jesus Christ like I to go, you guys don't like the same breeding cycle like rambling or his wife was like, he left like that.

Speaker 3:          02:38:09       Like it was like, Hey, my buddy found the ram, I got to go. And, and his word, you know, it's a Montana thing. He's like the guys that he works with her like, yeah. Oh Man. You got your wife was ready to pop and no, she had, we had had the baby. Oh, you'd already high left. Yeah, I left. We had the baby September 11. So I had left, uh, like seven days. Um, I, I went out and we had the baby. Everything was great. And then you left right after the baby was born. It's even worse. You sleep at all. You don't want my wife. I mean, she was just like a couple of days like, you know, we've got everything settled back in and she was, she was basically like, get the fuck Outta here. Wow. His wife's amazing. That's amazing. Yeah. She gets it. Well that's a good story to end this with because that sort of embodies what I appreciate about what you guys do, that you guys are really like the one 10th of the one percenters of the outliers of the crazy people that are pursuing this as a just an incredibly difficult biological puzzle.

Speaker 3:          02:39:06       It is, you know. Awesome. I appreciate what you guys, you're going to get to, we got to be challenge sheep hunting. You got to come. I'll do it. Come on man. Let's figure it out. Let's definitely figure it out. It's next level. But listen, thank you guys for just being you and thanks for doing what you're doing. I, like I said, I love when people are just fucking going for it. So this was a cool podcast for me life, man. It's cool to watch you guys geek out and see all your, your innovation and, uh, I'm a, I just appreciate it. Love the coverage. Love what you do as far as exposing the world to hunting. It's awesome, man. My pleasure. So, uh, people want to get ahold of you. Uh, Kay. You, I you on twitter, right? Is that what the twitter handle? I believe so, yeah. Then clips on instagram and then our website, [inaudible] dot com. All right. You can get it. There it is. Folks tonight

Speaker 5:          02:39:59       didn't seem like.
