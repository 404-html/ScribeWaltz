Speaker 1:          00:00:00       That good luck with the yellow brick road. Yeah. That's some good songs. Oh yeah. Dude. The bitches back. Oh, and but lively's gentlemen, shrimp raid. Powerful Duncan trussell's in the house. Come back. Dr Chris Ryan looking like you're fresh off of vacation. Like we just pulled you out of somewhat sale, but as on a fishing trip. Perfect, right? Yeah. The endless vacation. We were talking about Elton John, right before we start. I think there's some Elton John Songs that are just all time classics, you know? Yeah. What are your favorite top three? Boy, I'm man. Do you like Daniel? That's the best. That's a great song. Rocket Man is one of my favorites.

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       I don't know. I never, I never thought about that. Let me, let me go over the lyrics. You know, that's one of those songs. You just. The lyrics almost become inconsequential because the lyrics are, oh, this is the sound. That song makes that song. That song has this feeling like listen to a song in a different language. Right? It's just an instrument. It's weird when you find out what song is about and it's the opposite. Oh, what does it say what it is now? This is just the lyrics. It's a bad or an astronaut or a lyric. I don't think it is. I think it's about like snorting ketamine. Is that what it is? It's a space. I miss my wife. I missed the earth so much. You just guessing Dunkin. Well, I mean we all get to interpret music in our own way, but for sure that's out in.

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       Johnny's in some hotel room is laid out some blinds academy and he's about the baseline is here. It says, uh, during the Druggie or a, given that it was penn during the 19 seventies drug era, people can still see that it services an extended metaphor comparing fame to space travel. Wow. That makes. That makes a ton of sense. But it also. I bet it also was about rocket travel because Bernie top and wrote it. Yeah, he wrote it. He wrote them on what a great combination. The two of those guys like you and young Jamie, very similar. Nobody ever hears about young Jamie. Last time I was here, I tried to get them on my podcast. He's, he's alluding me really smart. Just want to be on your crazy podcasts out in the woods. Can come into the van. Jamie was on Saturday night. That's a great one. Alright, for fight. Yeah, that's a good one. That's a great workout. So it's a real kind of. Yeah, it's like a punk. British. Yeah. Saturday night Daniels. The first time I really thought about Spain. It's about Daniel, my brother. He's headed out on the plane. I can see the red tail lights head and for Spain friend dying. He's blind. No, it's about as blind brother interpreting all of your messaging. You must have a lot. I like him less. I like the. What his songs are about.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       You know what's interesting about this conversation is trying to interpret with songs are, is very actual thing that happened when people were trying to interpret the stories from the Bible, but it's basically the same thing. We're trying to figure out. No, he met this. No, he meant that these parables and some of the stories that are in the Bible, you know, if you go to the John Marco Allegro definition, was it say his song was written from his younger brother's perspective. Got a story about a guy who went back to a small town in Texas returning from the Vietnam War. Wow. Okay. That's Daniel. And he was blind. Right? Your eyes have died, but you see more than I. Oh wow. Huh? Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal? Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:03:41       Have you guys heard, you know that song? Summer of 69. Jamie, maybe you can bring this to Brian Adams one, and that's about like actually 68, 69. Oh really? Yeah, that's what I know. Again, like every single one of them, but look it up because I think the summer of 69, one interpretation is that's like a fuck summer. He had like $69 a month. Summer. Is that, is that true? Yes. Is it true? I

Speaker 1:          00:04:11       had my first real six string, a Bryan Adams fourth album, reckless. Some are 69 in many meetings, although one of them including life in 1969, while another includes making love with someone, hence using the number 69 as a reference boy. That's not accurate the way they said that. It's just like the Internet interpretation. Sorry. What I meant was it's like you would never say that. That wouldn't be how you convey your feelings. Like if you're writing that song like the summer of 69 and this say. Hold on, go back to that please. It says while another includes making love with someone that is just. That's not an accurate way. I'm talking about 69 ing. I mean, yeah, you're making love but you get crazy. It's like there's more to it than that. That was like the same thing as like trying to interpret stories from a Bible or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       Like you're boiling them down like you're trying to figure out what was this guy actually say? Yeah. You know, like literary interpretation. It's all poetry, right. My favorite example of a song that sort of mislead you. I mean, I really like songs were the covers better than the original because the person doing the cover gets what the song's about better than the original artists does. I mean all along the watchtower. Hendrix is way better than Dylan's. Right? Dillon actually said that, but my favorite example in recent music is. Hey Ya. By outkast. Oh, okay. You know, shake it like a polaroid picture. Hey. Yeah. My baby don't mess around because she loves me. So just I know for sure you know, it's real upbeat at it or listen to the words, but does she really want to but can't stand to see me walk out the door. Don't try to stop the feeling because the thought alone is killing me right now. Thank

Speaker 3:          00:05:57       God for Mom and dad for sticking to together because we don't know how. It's all about how we don't know how to love each other. Wow. Yeah. Hey fellas, what's cooler than being cool? Ice Cold. If what they say is nothing lasts forever, then what makes love the exception? Oh, why? Oh, why are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here. Wow. It's a really sad song. Super Sad. Yeah. There's a dude who did a cover of it. Oh, Obadiah Parker. See, the thing that I really like about, he gets it. He gets the sadness of it, play. Some of that

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       is seen me.

Speaker 4:          00:06:39       I can't see the feeling because the thought alone is, Holy Shit, dude. Again, because we don't know. Wow, this is fucking great. Hey, there's people right now screaming at their phone.

Speaker 5:          00:07:08       I don't know what grade it is, so fucking sick of your music taste so bad. Music tastes are so bad. I get to more tweets about how bad my bad

Speaker 3:          00:07:22       taste is in music and movies and television and blame it on me. Did that cut Chris Ryan? Yeah, I was. I was looking at something the other day, some something on some video years of comments or something and it occurred to me how you have your audience is first of all so large and also so mix because you've got your fingers in all these different worlds that you must get a lot more hostility than someone like Duncan or me because our audience is more sort of homogeneous. I would think I'm the bridge between the meatheads and the potheads exactly. So there's conflict and no matter which way you go, there's a little bit,

Speaker 6:          00:07:56       but the meatheads kind of get that look if you want to go to the far end of the extreme. It's like the UFC fans, but the UFC fans know, like I'm a, I'm a representative, like I'm doing my best. Like they know I'm 100 percent into this. This is not like I'm not like some actor that they hired to promote this so. But then you got all the way to the far left which is the psychedelic people and I got a ton of Vegan followers and people that are really into yoga. It's like all of them together. It's like the weirdest fucking house party

Speaker 2:          00:08:29       it seems sometimes. The comments, well no man, this is like, what is this? This Ram das retreat that I just went to, one of the, one of the people who run runs their treat wanted me to tell it to thank you because he's like, you know, your podcast brings a lot of people to these randazzo retreats, which is, to me it was such a strange thing to think man that you're magnetizing people and bringing them down a slippery where they

Speaker 7:          00:08:55       land in Maui, hanging out with like Buddhist and Hindu teachers. It's really crazy, man. It's a very odd thing. How many? Like how many tentacles you have fucking burning man. Jesus Christ. Burning man. Everybody wants you to go, man. You've got to go.

Speaker 8:          00:09:14       You got it. Go. When is it again? It's like it's all coming season. Late August there listening. He can't bring some elks to burning man. I can't interact with that. Many people do that anymore. Those days are done, but you know what? What has changed? Like a big. One of the biggest thing that's ever changed because of this podcast. The float industry. Yeah. Floating streets taken off. I get like residual gratitude from float places like I know you know Joe Rogan, you can float for free. Wow, that's amazing. Well, the thing is, it just didn't make any sense to me that before I was talking about it, no one was talking about that this was something that was invented by Lillian. What? Nineteen 60 something happened where you were vertical know he had one where you would wear a helmet and you had a harness and helmet with float you, you know, and then he figured out the salt thing and um, I mean the fact that this was not a popular thing was blown me away. Well it was, but then it died because of the age thing. Yeah. And you brought it back for this popular? No, no, but it was much. It was higher than it dropped a lot. They killed it because nobody knew, sort of brought it back in. Yeah. So with John Lilly,

Speaker 7:          00:10:23       you know what's interesting about him, people leave out about him a lot is he was talking to aliens and it's an interesting thing that people just kind of push all that shit aside. They know him as the flow guy, you've in a float tank, dolphin and the Dolphin Guy, but also they completely leave out that he was going into those tanks and claiming some kind of communication with something called the ECC or something eco, you know about that they're earth coincidence control office or something, you know about that. Then the center of the cyclone. Yeah, center the, but he was going way out talking about some kind of like invisible I guess network that produces coincidence is. I don't understand it at all, but people just completely leave that out. That the guy created float tanks was using them to communicate with entities

Speaker 8:          00:11:14       and he was using a lot of ketamine. A lot academy. Yeah. Or maybe they. They're leaving out that the guy who invented float tanks lost his shit there toward the end. Well, he may be, but I think that. I don't know what's happening when you're doing psychedelics, but there are certain psychedelics where it absolutely feels like you're experiencing another life form communicating with you. For sure. For sure. Right now, if that's the case with ketamine as well. Ketamine seems to be like me personally, my personal bias, I sort of dismiss it because I think of it as some sort of chemical compound things, some sort of a synthetic thing. That man's career, Ketamine, what? Something is more

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       reliable, but I think that's just my own ignorance. I think really we're just talking about chemicals. Right? And how chemicals that exist in nature. It's like when someone says it's an artificial chemical, well that's not real because everything is natural. Everything's here. Like it might've been concocted and put together and baked and cooked and synthesize by a person, but of course it's all natural. Everything that's exists. Antics though, because it isn't. It isn't in that these chemicals most likely have some sort of a corresponding receptor in the human brain. Right? Or something similar. Something similar molecule. Yeah. And it's a natural thing. Like that's the craziest thing about the most potent drugs, whether it's still assignment or whether it's dimethyltryptamine, they have like really similar composition did normal human neurochemistry keys. Like there are keys that fit a certain lock. That's how they put it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       Yeah. But I do think that there is a distinction between natural and unnatural in the sense that something, because I get this argument all the time, right? Oh, people created it, so it's natural, but there are things that exist in the natural system, like plastics don't exist in the natural ecosystem and therefore they don't break down. They don't become part of the food chain in a beneficial way. Whereas things that have existed in that system for a long time do they fit into it and I think in terms of drugs, there are drugs like ghb that exists naturally in the body that we metabolize absolutely cleanly because the liver knows exactly what it is. It's prepared to deal with it and it doesn't cause any organic toxicity, no neurotoxicity. But then there are other things like alcohol which are natural in a sense that fruits for meant and all that, but the body doesn't metabolize it cleanly.

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       So it damages us in. Particularly if you're from a very specific part of the world, right where it's a. If it's not a part of your customer, which is why it was such a giant issue when Europeans came here, they didn't. They didn't have any history with alcohol. Well, well, you know Hamilton Morris, a device guy. He tweeted this thing I thought was pretty smart. Probably a little controversial. Forgive me if I miss quote it, but it's something along the lines of it's drugs, it's drugs and that word is a controversial word. Somehow people like to use the term plant Madison, which is okay. You can call it plant medicine or you can call it whatever you want, but to create a hierarchy based on synthesis I think is to sort of miss the point which is that all of these things are tools and some of them we have more of a history with humanity and some of them we don't. The ones we don't, which is my God, there's so many. There's so many new drugs that are just popping up all the time. Different derivatives of Lsd, things you can like right now apparently you can order sheets of this stuff that is like Lsd, but it's in the gray area. It's still kind of legal, it's like a different version of, but we don't know

Speaker 9:          00:14:52       yet the effects it's going to have because it's not like anyone's really testing it out. So I say the name because Jeff sessions is listening at one hand as you're writing down little southern big scary of Jeff sessions at a giant Dick Table. Yeah. But anyway, I think this talking to a woman who had sex with a little person and she said he had a normal sized Dick [inaudible] that big heads. So Jeff sessions with a normal sized Dick would be interesting proportionally. Yeah. I don't know. I mean just scary to think about like that jeff sessions having like some kind of like. Because you know, he's such a, you know, he's just such a quintessential pig, you know, and it's like you want the quintessential pig to have some kind of like to be almost like a unit or something. But it's terrifying to imagine the jeff sessions when he takes his clothes off probably as like six nipples. It was just running right down the middle of his fucking chest.

Speaker 9:          00:15:58       They usually, it gets wet when he's like arresting people. They who's the little goat knobs that he has to fall file down. Go Nazi pro. Yeah. He's got file private prisons. He visits private prisons and just pulls out his massive throbbing cock in front of people who've been sentenced there for life. It's right on that screen that you put your hand on. Mr. Sessions. I was standing up for it. I just want you to know that going after medical marijuana, again, it's trying to. It's almost like he can't help himself. He knows what the laws are and it's almost like I just want to grab them. Let me just grab, just grab them. I know what science says, but I've got my personal opinions on the thing and that's what matters. Just anytime there's one person who has authority over another person and they've lived an entire life in that position.

Speaker 9:          00:16:47       That's their ecosystem. Their ecosystem is they have authority, they enforce laws, they lock people up. They put in this the game that gets the game they play and be successful. Yeah. Not just that. It's like there's an objective. It's literally like almost like a monopoly game, like you see what the thing is to arrest people. You're, you're the guy who arrest people, you arrest people and convict people. That's your game. That's what you do. You're plugged into the machine. Do you know an interesting thing about monopoly? It was invented by an anarchist who was invented it to teach kids the evils of capitalism. Wow. Really? That's incredible. Goofy. Anarchists are the exact opposite thing. It's like what they do to it. It wasn't supposed to be fun. It was supposed to demonstrate that when you accumulate capital, you ended up taking it. All right. Wait, what do you think? And Arkansas. Well, I think that anarchistic or people who want to diminish this system that we have have far less rules have far less government. Right? And usually they're kind of spastic and

Speaker 8:          00:17:50       their, their, their, the way they express themselves is always like very awkward

Speaker 2:          00:17:53       court like Libertarians. Well, but you know, you know, you know, like I've just been reading this book are a narco syndicate. Realism. It's like this, I cannot dance. It's really interesting to look at the history of anarchism like when it comes from versus what it gets interrupt because I remember when I was in high school or do you remember drawing the fucking anarchy symbol and you'd be like, yeah man didn't even know what it made. You're just assuming you know, but, but I think one part of it that's really beautiful is the idea that we don't need withered old prunes like jeff sessions telling us what we can put in our bodies. We don't need that. That's true. And, and, and, and that how many jeff sessions are there and the power structure and then where it gets really fucking cool man. Check out David Graber.

Speaker 2:          00:18:42       You should have him on the podcast. My God, he's fucking brilliant what you're doing. He's an author and he, I'm a philosopher, I guess you could say, but uh, he is incredible. And he wrote a book called, I think it's called the Utopia of rules that I've been reading, which is pretty fucking bad ass. And it's just sort of breaking down like the, um, the bureaucracy that we're in right now, bureaucracy, all the fucking forms you got to fill out to do just about anything these days, like all these fucking forums. It's insanity, right? Right. But then where it gets really interesting is he's right now. So like in like communists states the, the, the, the corporations in the state are kind of the same thing. So there's these like Ministry of Labor, the stores are all national stores, you know. And so we think that that's not what's happening right now.

Speaker 2:          00:19:33       But actually because the people were running, a lot of the corporations used to be in government and the people who are in government used to be running these big corporations. One of the cool points he makes and also because the government is making the rules that the corporations are working by, but the corporations are putting their own agents into the state. He saying the actually the line between the state and private companies is really blurry right now. They're kind of merging together together. But we like to pretend that there are separate, for example, what's happening right now with the fucking fcc trying to take away the internet with verizon having one of their fucking pig drones in a superposition of power right now is trying to take away the freedom of the Internet. The state can be like we. The corporations can blame it on the state. It's just clarifying by what

Speaker 8:          00:20:21       you mean by that, because they're not trying to take away the freedom of the Internet to try and to try and get rid of net neutrality. Exactly. Yeah. So what did it mean is that you will have to probably pay more. Yeah. To access things that require more bandwidth and it's going to be. It's not. It's going to be what it is now where every website has open access it you two versions, right? You get the capitalist version. I think it's a good idea, and then you get the tech version, which thinks is terrible idea. I almost

Speaker 9:          00:20:47       always go towards the tech for. Yeah, but that's the Anaconda. You know the way an Anaconda kills somebody, every time you exhale it squeezes in a little bit. That's all. Like right now, it's the squeeze in as, okay, this fucking Internet. It sucks. If you're somebody like jeff sessions, that's not. That's not where the money's coming from. I think you're misinterpreting the whole idea. It's all just a business thing. It's like being able to throttle the data and being able to decide like, like if Netflix wants you on there, if you want to have netflix on the network, they want to be able to work out some sort of a deal. They don't want to treat netflix like it's any other sort of streaming service. Like you look at it, the, the, the, the business transactions. So they're looking at in a business sense, they're not saying the internet sucks.

Speaker 9:          00:21:31       No one is trying to like squeeze the Internet, stop it with the trying to do is make more money. Well, okay, great. They're trying, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I do here. I do know what you're saying, but I think it's a slippery slope and it's that idea of the Internet being treated like, I don't know, water, the Internet being treated like just a thing that no corporation should have any kind of say that that to me it has to stay like that because the moment some corporation, whoever it may be, it gets to start deciding, yeah, you guys need to pay a little bit more and if we establish that corporations in the state aren't as separate as we like to think, then suddenly there's all kinds of back channels there. Suddenly there becomes a new way to begin to filter out content and you could say it's for money.

Speaker 9:          00:22:14       You start building financial walls around things and you start making things vanished into the background because they aren't in some big conglomerate that's paying off the corporations more or whatever. You just mess up the whole thing, which as far as I can tell, it's doing great. The Internet. Great. This fucking compound you're in right now, you know, a lot of it came from the Internet. This thing we're doing right now, it's the way the Internet's been working. Oh Dude. No one's a bigger proponent of the internet than I am. I just think when we're talking about these issues, you've got to be. You've got to be really like objective. What's trying to happen here. They're not trying to silence dissent. They're just trying to, trying to make as much money as possible and this is a weird tricky time when it comes to information and we do have to be very careful because it could wind up being like, Hey, you get your internet from comcast will.

Speaker 9:          00:23:02       Comcast is no longer allow, you know, Blah Blah Blah. The laugh app that has your podcast featured on it or you know, some new streaming service. It's yet to be discovered. That will be in the future. Challenging Youtube. So youtube gets together with Google, you know, they're owned by Google and they get together with verizon and they make it exclusive for the verizon network. If you want to get on youtube, you have to be on the verizon network. That's, that's. This is all inside the realm of possibility. Fuck. The deeper level though, anybody who thinks that government has not been totally captured by corporations isn't paying attention. I mean, that's not news in this country. You come from Europe where this is one of the things, the problems I have with anarchists and Libertarians. I think they're very naive about what the world would

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       look like if there were no government regulation. Yeah, I agree. Every poison, every river would be to poison, to swim in it. You know, the air would be fucking because corporations, it makes sense for them to dump their shit as near to the factory as possible and don't give a fuck about birth defects and dead people that it doesn't matter. That's true. But a lot of good things come from from that, from a lot of anarchistic a theorists and and, and some of those things. Well, I think a lot of it relates back to my shit with a hunter gatherers because hunter gathers are essentially anarchist functioning anarchists. The problem is when you scale up and you've got corporations that, you know, I've talked about this on this podcast before, what my idea that my belief that corporations are living things, institutions are living things and their agendas conflict with like super organisms are.

Speaker 3:          00:24:35       Sounds Spooky. I think that every time you get large groups of people together and they operate under one window or one umbrella, rather, they just tend to act like one organism. Just what countries do. I mean, listen, it's a natural thing that human beings do for some strange reason, not only human beings, right? Think about flocks of birds and fish and yeah, and hills. There are all sorts of examples and then you go the other direction are, are a microbiome, you know, I mean that's all functioning according to its own systems, you know? And then that's happening within us. So there's all sorts of scalable stuff going on. I think you'd be insane. Did not think there needs to be some kind of structure to help things function smoothly. But I think we all agree we don't need as much structure as we've got right now and a lot.

Speaker 3:          00:25:23       But the problem is. Sorry to interrupt, just to finish the point, I think what happens is a lot of people get in their heads and they start thinking that the state is responsible in some way or another for their wellbeing and that. And that's what happens is you start forgetting that if what's really important is communities. What's really important is finding a group of people that you love and deciding in this group of people loosely, it's not a commune. It's not like a cult, but just deciding what the group of people that you have making this really intense decision, which is none of us are ever going to be homeless. You could start there. That used to be what the family was, but a lot of people don't have that anymore. So groups of people agreeing very loosely to take care of each other and in a way that the state is currently functioning with welfare and all that shit.

Speaker 3:          00:26:12       That's to me is like, it's not anarchy, but it's a. it's a sense of soul, like shrugging off the idea that the state is really going to take care of you, but what if the state is an expression of that sense of community as it is in a country like Denmark for example, were Danish people and Dutch people and Swedish people and you know, lots of northern European countries said, you know, we're not gonna. Let anyone be homeless and suffering. We're not going to let any children be malnourished in this country. We're going to take care of each other. It depends on how

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       it. It's. If you're. If there was a pure expression, if for one, if the people are unified enough to create a pure expression of what they, what they're like central goals were, that would be pretty startling to me, but if we pay lip service to America all the time, you know, thanks for your service and we're all in this together. We're all Americans. You know, rally around the flag. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what we're doing. We're, we're trying to create this sense of community. We're all in it together, but when it comes to actually taking care of each other than we don't do it. Well, I mean that's to me. I mean the list. Let me say them as natively stupid thing. I was just thinking about this in the way ever. I mean this is so dumb, but I was really thinking this because you know, the prisoners are fighting the fires right now, you know, that is that prisoners.

Speaker 2:          00:27:27       They're getting paid $1 an hour to fight these fires were there. It's fucking insane. But I was just thinking to myself like dollar, no $1 an hour. But I was thinking to myself, man, what, what if like everybody in California was like, shit, there's fires and we all were going to help fight the fires would, would we all be able to put the fires out? Like if like as many just people just started flooding to actually go help or if like all these homes are burned down and I was just thinking like, shit man. If like everybody in California is like, all right, let's just go help them build their houses back. I mean, it's so insane, but also fall apart if you are building a house, trust will start building out. They'd be like, no, nothing's done. Nothing's the fuck did you do. I wouldn't be in charge of the.

Speaker 2:          00:28:18       I wouldn't be in charge of building the fucking houses. Like sandwiches. I make sandwiches, which is another cool thing that I like about. I'm not saying by the way, I'm not a fucking nras but one cool thing I like about the idea is like right now we have this hierarchy of uh, you know, of have like careers, right? So doctors are valued more than somebody who plumber, plumber, right? Or plumbers are plumbers are valued more than like, I dunno, a house cleaner or something. So like, you know, it's considered a low status thing if you're somebody who works in a fast food joint or something like that. But when you get together with a group of people who are fucking cool, some people are good at some things and some people are good at other things, but nobody is valued more than the other person because everybody loves each other.

Speaker 2:          00:29:04       And you've got this, like what, you know, the person who's the most, like somebody digging trenches to like put electrical wires down, a pretty unskilled job is super appreciated because who the fuck wants to dig the trenches managed when you add money to the equation, which is what we're doing right now. And I get it. I'm not saying get rid of money or whatever. When you add money to it, everything gets fucking weird. So what I'm saying is it's just a right now when we hear about the fires, we think, okay, I'll donate some money, I'll donate some money. That'll, that'll do it. I'll donate some money. But this is, like I said before, it's crazy naive. I just had this image

Speaker 9:          00:29:42       of like, fuck, what if just huge groups of people started going towards the fires in blood cells, contaminants that. Yeah. Because right now we're using prisoners will do you understand the terrain? Like this is not something that most people can traverse. You're talking about like extremely hilly areas that are also you. You'd have to be not just fit, but you'd have to understand which way the wind's blowing. You could get shoe horned in and surrounded by fire. There's a lot of like serious dangers with them. It's a beautiful idea on paper. We need trained. There'd have to be like. It would never. I know it never fucking happen. It's just clear. You would need a lot of stuff. Someone would have to organize. It was supposed to be bigger than this than the city of Washington DC. Now I know how big the fucking bad.

Speaker 9:          00:30:29       I mean it's insane how big it is. It's terrible. It's terrible. You'd have to get a lot of fucking people to circle that bit, but we're just so. We're so. We're so broken apart. We're so disconnected. Like whenever you hear about something going down, it's just a thing that's going down. If someone's house is burnt down, your that fucking house burnt down, that's it. You don't really think much more than that and we think the state is going to come in and like take care of everything and I think that's what the state wants. I love using the term this state. Does the state want that or is just how it's structured now at wants it, but the state wants to because in the same reason anyone who's in an abusive relationship wants to be in control. It's like if you think that I'm the one who's going to help you, then you're dependent on me.

Speaker 9:          00:31:14       And do you think if the. If there was a really effective, massive volunteer firefighter force, the state would resist that? No, I don't. That's what's beautiful about it is I don't know how the state would resist that. I mean we do see the state resisting things like groups of people getting together and trying to feed the homeless and stuff like that. Yeah. Rather they resist last popups and you can't feed them like that. There's a lot of licenses you need licenses to feed people. You got to fill out forms baby. But isn't that. Would that be a good idea to prevent people from poisoning people or people giving them bad food or. You know, but I mean, I don't know for sure man, but when was the last time you heard about like an organized group like food? Not Bombs poisoning. Homeless people wouldn't have to be that.

Speaker 9:          00:32:00       It would be Duncan's food delivery service, so you just started out. You might might have good intentions, but not really be qualified to prepare food. People are eating fucking hamburgers at a trashcan. Definitely better than what they're eating. For sure. I know the real issue with homeless people is not just an economic issue though. The one of the big ones needs to be addressed as mental health and when they changed the standards during the Reagan administration, they essentially just sent people out on the street and they were using Duncan. The argument you're making basically, which is that the state is providing for people. They should be. There should be private church communities, religious based families. That was the argument they made. I think it was disingenuous. I think it was just about taking money.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       Yeah. No. This is about giving it to the whole Reagan thing. What we're seeing now is the fruit, the bitter fruit of the Reagan Revolution. They're still using the same economic arguments that's trickled down. Shit. Yeah. That was started. I most listeners probably aren't old enough to remember this, but I remember in the eighties, David Stockman was the, the economic advisor did Ronald Reagan who came up with all this stuff. Four or five years later, he left the administration. He came out and said that was all bullshit. We knew it was bullshit. It was just a story we made up. It has makes no economic sense. It's ruining the country. I'm so sorry. Jesus Christ, you know, and but they're still using it because it's a narrative that's effective. The, I'm getting into this a lot recently, like how narratives are popular and powerful, not because they make sense, but because they create a story that justifies the power structure that's in control at the time.

Speaker 3:          00:33:36       Yeah. Well, I, this is, I, this is why I think it's like hyper important right now for people to find groups of people that they love and do more than just like play board games, like getting together with people and like make stuff like face the facts. Man. Fucking California is on fire right now. I mean everyone thinks this shit just stays the way it is. It's not just on fire, it's on fire in a way that you realized like, oh, it could be twice as bad as this and we would literally have to. Everyone would have to flee the state and it's December. Yeah, this is the rainy season and it easily could be twice as bad as it is now. We're just mean we're in a weird place and there's no rain in the rain is incoming. Yeah. And, and you know, like it sucks that people have to.

Speaker 3:          00:34:19       You have to create in your mind the reality of what's happening to my friend. You know, he was sending me pics, he was right by the fires and he's saying people just can't understand how bad this is. People just can't comprehend it to people because this is, this is, this is like, this is real life right now. Do you guys feel like this, for example, and other things that are happening, do you feel like this is the shit hitting the fan in a way that always seemed hypothetical? You know, like this is to me that we're living through a moment that's almost like aliens arriving in. Like something that you always thought, well that would be weird. Right? It's happening. It's happening right now. It's like there are things happening now that seemed inconceivable even five years ago, 10 years ago. I don't know. Like I remember what specific. Well, I mean like evacuate Santa Barbara on a few times that I've thought of. Trump president is the main thing of course. And like, oh no, these, these national monuments were selling them to those mining company that now you know, their lobbyists works for the heads of the Department of the interior and just like, it's over like this. We're reaching. This is an end stage, but you know, hold. I know what you mean. And like God

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       knows like depending on how much, how high I am, my brain will get really shrill about, fuck, this is it man. This is the end stage. This fucking apocalypse happened man. But man, but then then when you go and look, because I make some ketamine. Well, no, like I had on my podcast recently, he's said his story and the first question I asked him is this, is this the end of the world? And he's like, I don't think so. He's like, you know, they go into black plague, wiped out like what 30 percent of the people on Earth got white. Certainly Times that are filled with adversity and we're, there's a restructuring. Yeah, it's the, I don't mean it's the end of the world per se, but it's the end of the American empire. It's the end of America as a country that, um, other, other people around the world looked up to as a, as a model to be emulated.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       Well, we have a contest to see who controls the nukes and this is the first time that the popular guy fucked up what it is. And this is the first time a popular guy entered the popularity contest. So who knows how to be popular and there's a bunch of people out there that are pro wrestling fans and they bought right in Hook, line and sinker. And that's. And that's a very simplistic version of it. There's a lot of other people that wanted to throw a monkey wrench in the system because they thought Hillary Clinton was a crook and she probably is because they're all crooks. There's most, most of those people at the top, or at least in some way fucked up. Yes. We have an opportunity to rebound. Who Al Franken, and I know Al Franken's just a but grabber and all things considered. Did you read the last bit, like the straw that broke the camel's back?

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       The last one where the veil said enough is enough. It was in the Atlantic. This woman or he put that. She asked for a photo. He put his arm around. His hand was on her waist and schools are fat. He squeezed her. He. She said he grabbed a handful of flesh, which is a weird thing to say, but he squeezed her at least twice is her quote. At least twice. He had his hand on her waist and she said, I don't even let my husband touch me that way in public because it demeans me as a professional woman. Oh, you're fucking kidding me. Let's. I'd like to interview her husband like you're not allowed to put your arm around your wife in public. The squeezer my wife would love to be squeezed. The more, the more the merrier. The idea of it is, um, it's very strange because that, that one doesn't make sense to Leanne tweet and one was the only one that made sense.

Speaker 1:          00:37:59       He, there's a photo of me. She's unconscious. It's demeaning, I get the whole thing. He apologized for that and rightly so. And apparently he tried to kiss her but then the butt grab and it's like, well, he's definitely shouldn't be grabbing people's Butts. But I mean, how much of a big deal is it also do have we stopped? I mean, Chelsea handler was on Bill Maher the other night and she said, I have to believe these women because I'm a woman. And I thought, well, wait a minute, does that mean I have to believe all men? Because I'm a man the isn't there any discussion about whether these things are true or not? [inaudible] Mia said this, he said

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       he put it on twitter. He goes saying all women are liars is just as crazy as saying all women tell the truth.

Speaker 3:          00:38:42       Right? Well, yeah. I think a lot. Franklin, I don't know enough about Franklin, but a lot of these people, it's like, like Weinstein wasn't like 40 people or something like that, like 40. I think when it starts getting up in the and also what? He's accused of it. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:38:59       In different things. We're not talking about taking pictures with people. They were, they like you. They want to take a picture of you and you grabbed their waste. We're talking about. I mean he's been accused of rape by more than one woman, like actual rape, rape. Not just like getting someone drunk and having sex with them and be like holding them down type rape. There was a lot of, he's, there's a lot of crazy. See here's what's kind of fucked. Um, if prostitution was legal, would that exist or is it a power thing? Is it always a power thing? Like does he want to have sex with the star of his films?

Speaker 3:          00:39:36       Because that's. I think it's more a question of if, if there weren't so many teenage boys who never got laid what with the society look like, and by this I don't mean to excuse anyone and I don't mean to say teenage girls should be more promiscuous or anything. I'm just looking at objects. I'm saying that guys like Harvey Weinstein, that Dude didn't get laid in high school. Most of the, you look at these mass shootings, a lot of these guys in their, in their suicide notes say, I'm doing this because I can't get laid. I'm going to die a virgin. That's the one begins. Actually, uh, there's this a massive amount of frustration that builds up because biologically most boys are horny little monsters at 13 or 14. They're not getting laid.

Speaker 3:          00:40:24       And so it gets to the point. So there may be five, six years between when a boy is totally obsessed with not just sex, but with being acceptable to women being loved by women being touched, being caressed being, and they can't think about anything else and they're not getting it. And so I think a lot of boys grow up with extreme frustration that either curdles into misogyny, where you get these, like mass killers who, who did they kill hookers, right? Sexually Liberated Free Women in their perspective. And you get guys that just chase money their whole lives because they think the money and the power is going to get them, those women. And so when they get to that place and they're still fucking disgusting and they, they sense that the women don't even want to fuck them or they only fuck them because they're going to get something from them. Then there's all this self hatred and shame. I think that's what's being expressed here. So I think it is power and I do think that it has a, it's an, it's an expression or a manifestation of a deeply sex, negative pathological culture.

Speaker 6:          00:41:29       Conversely, how do you feel about like women that weren't attractive in high, how come they don't lash

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       out at the same way? They're not out there rape and did one becoming them down. Women are much better at accepting their sexual situation. You see women have accepted a lot of shit that men are unable to accept for Millennia. That's partly biological and probably partly cultural, but also because, I mean women can have sex. Even women who aren't particularly attractive because the, the, the whole market is so skewed in the other direction. Even women who aren't particularly attractive probably don't have much trouble getting laid in high school. I don't think it's just that. I think you're boiling it down to getting laid. That's a reductionist thing. I think it's way more, but an unattractive woman who has a hard time finding a boyfriend. You know, someone who loves her. Someone who wants to be emotionally connected to her. That probably is just as children full to a woman as a guy who can't find maybe more painful. Yeah. Then a guy who can't find sex partner in psychology, they say that men express their, their these feelings through anger and women through depression and sadness. Right? So you probably don't see women lashing out and killing a bunch of dudes. You see them being depressed and feeling like shit. And when you do, they have high testosterone. That's why

Speaker 2:          00:42:51       another point to be made here is, is that like, you know, people do say the thing, oh well, like people like Harvey Weinstein, they wanted all this money to get laid, but I don't, I do not think that's it. I think what people like Harvey Weinstein probably enjoy his power. It's not like, oh, I want to get fucking laid. I'm going to become this massive. It's like I like to dominate. I'm a dominating force. That's what I am. I'm going to. I enjoy like having people around me who worship me and as part of that I'm going to dominate my interns. I'm going to dominate my employees and when I'm around women, I'm going to use my. I'm going to fucking jerk off and house plants in front. I mean, it's like really fucking the ficus, but you know, you gotta you gotTa really think about that. It's like, I don't, I don't. I know what you're saying. Oh, poor Harvey Weinstein. When he was fucking in front of the God damned with the. He's saying, well, the thing of like he's not getting touched enough.

Speaker 1:          00:43:51       Well, no, no, no, but it's like this is the, there's a lot of frustration that's inherently connected to this suppressive sexual culture that we find ourselves embroiled in that we don't necessarily agree with these fucking little boys. Why are, you know? Because one, that's the only access they have to. They're less likely to tell on them. And three, there's self hatred. I just recidivism.

Speaker 2:          00:44:13       I like to do a little thought experiment, which is I like to imagine what, where my head's gotta be if I jerk off into a house plant in front of somebody. If you don't, if you have tried that, just just think about it. Like where would you, what's going on with you Christmas tree?

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       Yeah. It might be like you're just celebrating.

Speaker 8:          00:44:38       He doesn't mind if you jerk off in the plant, the plants can absorb it and he's just leaving as dna all over the place. It's really good for the planet. Bet It is. It's terrible for plants. Not My. Jim Weinstein is great for parents, Bro. Plants alive. It's running for Senate Alpha Alphacam coming soon from onnit. Joko you can really sell your com right? I don't want anybody, don't you think that all these things, uh, it's, I think it's certainly this sex is not just a power thing because he's not just exercising power. He's exercising power in a sexual way. Yeah. It's not just power. I think it's the game, like we were talking about like corporations and even police officers and guys like Jeff sessions who have the game to arrest people. That is the game they play. They get really good at it. That's what the game is the game with a guy like him is, I can't believe I get to fuck what's her name, know name, famous actress and that famous actress is on her stomach and your mouth fucking her.

Speaker 8:          00:45:43       Like, Whoa, really? Is this really happening? And it wasn't really happening. It's happening because you're going to let her be cat woman or whatever the fuck the movie is. Right? Yeah. There's some nuttiness to it. There was some craziness. There's some forbidden thing to it. There's some, there's a bunch of, a bunch of things in play powers. One of the dynamics, it's just the most foul one because they all the other ones like the sexual frustration and stuff doesn't seem so gross. It's like when you, when you, you're, you're imposing your will on someone. Then it's unquestionably an, an expression of power. Like once you were raping, once you're coercing, once you're imposing your will and you're saying, I'm going to take away your career. If you don't let me have sexual intercourse with you, well then it's 100 percent power thing. Like how did it get there?

Speaker 8:          00:46:27       There's a lot of things and I think you've got to get a lot of power. I mean, I, I guess I haven't exercised sufficient power in my life to know the answer to this question, but does, does dominance feel good directly or is it, is it something that comes to you indirectly. So in other words, does it feel good to dominate someone else or only because then you can get something that you want from them? I think it's something that you want from them and I think there's also, there's I think human beings are connected to each other in an undeniable way and I think that if you're exercising power over someone like say if you hate to paint the scenario but just save you rape someone, you were sexually attracted to someone you're loan with you and you raped them, and if you have any conscience at all, if you, you know, they're screaming no, and you're still having sex with them and you come and then after what you have to think about it like you would be horrified at yourself.

Speaker 8:          00:47:23       The level of self hatred would be almost unimaginable. Even posed yourself and your, you're, you're, you're twisted sickness. At the heart of that moment, you know, the, the, the, the, the power dynamic. Trying to impose the power. It can't possibly feel good. I think it's just a thing. I think it's just a, almost like a creepy leftover reptilian instinct that, that creatures have. Because if you look at rape in nature, and this is not to exonerate, rapist is not to normalize rape, but it's insanely common in the animal kingdom, right? It's all. It's common in ducks. It's in common in all sorts of different animals. Yeah. Orangutans are ruthless and it's tough because there are a lot of primatologist are women and they learned the hard way from what I've heard, that the always wear jeans. If you're working with Orangutans, oh Jesus Christ, rape a tanks.

Speaker 8:          00:48:23       That's awful, but this, that this thing, we're supposed to be evolved past that and for the most part, by far and above, we are right. If you think about all these sexual harassment interactions, now imagine if they were chimps, you know, I mean, imagine if they were a Rangataua was the rape is the common thing. You could never have a bunch of a tanks in some sort of a building and people would go, well, of course we're better than a rank tanks. We are. That's why we don't rape as much, but it is problematic to use the word rape when you're talking about animals because part of it is that the way you described it, that knowledge on some level that this female is totally not into what's happening right now. Whereas presumably Iranian, Tim doesn't have that knowledge and also there are animals where the female is triggered to ovulate by aggressive male behavior that we might call raping.

Speaker 8:          00:49:15       Right? Like rabbits. You bite the back of their neck and that's what makes the female ovulate. Well, that's. There's a lot of weird stuff when it comes to women's w, what, what is sexually attractive to certain women and what arouses them? Rape fantasies is the number one. A lot of women like to be choked, you know, like what's happening. They're like, why? Why do you like to be choked? Why do you like to get your arms pinned behind your back and why do you like to fight back? Like you actually like it. You want me to do that? You want me to hold both your wrists? Okay. You're sure, like there's a lot of tying up going on out there. There's really. Yeah, there's a lot of people are.

Speaker 2:          00:49:50       Yeah, like this is all very strange stuff in your apartment, but here's the thing. When it comes to like s and M or bondage at one, I think one of the big misconceptions when it comes to that is that if you're being tied up or if you're tying somebody up there, there's like anger happening in that situation. It's one of the most sweet, loving, trusting things that you can do for you. It's the. It's really like, I don't want to say full easily sell it it. It is. I've spent, I spent a lot of time in dungeons. Actually.

Speaker 9:          00:50:30       It's a healing sweet, beautiful thing. There's a difference between that and rough sex is very rich. I mean I personally find it not, not. It doesn't turn me on at all largely because it's so choreographed. All the outfits and the this and now we're going to do that and safe words and. Yeah, but I mean I have been in those environments and as Duncan says, it's, it's like the opposite of out of control. It's totally in control. Totally worked out the difference between a gun range and a war. So funny. Well the last time I was at a gun range, I ended up bleeding from the head. What happened? I was with my buddy justin and we were shooting, this is up in Washington state where I was shooting his uh, remember what a 30, 30 or something and sculpt he had. He had this big elk gun that he was trying to scope in and he was like, man, I'm not like, you're shooting really well, can you just take a shot at a few shots on this and see if you.

Speaker 9:          00:51:37       And I just grabbed it and didn't think that it was a totally different gun. Yeah. And I just went boom in the scope, went right into my forehead. All these macho dudes, you know, I'm, I'm exposed as the idiot range. We went to shoot at burnt down. Did you hear about that? No, I would imagine it did. I would imagine it now. Well, recently, yeah, there's definitely fires in that area. I mean the fires are so out of control, especially that out towards Santa Barbara and Ventura, Ventura, and that's the worst. You know what I keep thinking? What if the fucking big one hits like shit's gonna catch on fire on the big one heads and all the roads are going to be fucked up. The infrastructure is going to be messed up. That like this is like without a massive earthquake. What happens if the big one hit right now all the water lines are broken.

Speaker 9:          00:52:30       Trucks can't get there. Yeah, yeah. It could be a giant issue. Then you have toxic clouds and stuff too, because all these warehouses going. Not only that, if the big one hits, it's entirely likely. It's not just going to hit here, but it also hits in the ocean. Which case we get hit with a tsunami. Which case all that super expensive real estate in Malibu just gets wiped away. I'm good up in Topanga though. Yeah, you're probably, if you're not good up in Topanga. We're really. Yeah, we're fucked. Yeah. You're like a canary in a coal mine. Calculate the planet, leave it to me, dude. Get back to the topic you're talking about. It's the, what's the thing that's happening is people are realizing staff that nobody ever really wanted to talk. Shit's changing. Like if you, if you ever watched like porky's or if you watch any of the movies from the seventies, like the makeout scenes, like

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       the guys are like, come on baby, come in here. What are you doing? They're like throwing themselves on. They're doing things in movies that were just considered like, yeah, that's how, that's I guess that's how it's done. You're like, you are forcing themselves. There's like scenes I think with like Bill Murray maybe or scenes in the old movies with all so many of them. Uh, pepe Le Pew, you know what I mean? There's 100 percent right? See, when you, when you're seeing like this, like you're seeing much French. Yeah, it's crazy when you go back and look and you realize like, shit man, what's happening is moves from the fifties where the guy will just grab the woman and things are changing is what's happening. And, and, and, and, and as things change, like the two things we need to figure out, number one, we have to admit like, yeah, I get it man. Like, you know, for me, like hanging out with you doing the podcast with you. I know. Here's one thing I know man, I'm pretty sure at least you don't want to fuck me.

Speaker 2:          00:54:31       I'll tell he didn't look at me when he said it was just totally left out for the chapter and your next book, but you know, Research Duncan with, with, with, with what's happening with women is a. because a lot of dudes and I, I'm sorry if this is a shocking thing to say, a lot of dudes are in positions of power and what's happening with women is like who want to be actors. You're wanting whatever you want to like do it, do stuff when they're getting around. These guys, they don't have that assurance. They're not like, this guy doesn't want to. They're probably thinking this guy wants to fuck me for these are women who most guys want to fuck. Yes. So especially

Speaker 6:          00:55:11       if you're talking about Harvey Weinstein, these hot actresses, right? The, the real. The strange thing is you have that unquestionably. Yeah, and then you have women that want to have nothing to do with that part of the business. They don't. They're not trying to be seductive, they just want to work. They want to act, and then they have to deal with all this bullshit. That's it. But then you've got women who sneak into that mix and they're willing, not only they willing, they're manipulative and they're seductive and they. They're trying to make their way up the ladder. That way they exist there. It's a much smaller percentage, but they exist to make sure that their whole society is set up to make women think that the only thing they have to trade is their sexuality. I don't think there's anything wrong with these women agreeing to do a film with not even Harvey Weinstein. Anyone. And then he says, I'll give you more parts if you fucked me. And the girl wants to do it. And she does it. Like, I think it's gross, but it's not gross. It's not gross to her. Do you know what I'm saying? It's. It's a weird thing. It's only grows if it's gross. It's gross being around a guy like Harvey Weinstein. Right. If he's yelling at people and he's fat and sweating all over the place, it's. Yeah. Unless

Speaker 8:          00:56:24       it's not gross. Unless you like that kind of guy. Right? Like you might bears. Yeah. Because they're into bears. Might you might like that. Yeah. Right. So at what point are we. Are we taking away women's agency when we say that? That should never be. You shouldn't be able to give a guy a blow job and get a part in a movie. It's weird. Right? It's like you should be able to pay for things, but you shouldn't be able to pay for things with sex. Why not? That's George Carlin's things. You can buy things when you can have sex, but you can't buy sex. Like it's strange. It's strange because I don't think it's necessarily illegal in a barter sense. Like say it to you dinner, like say if you had some woman and she wanted to paint your house, but in it is a bad example or you wanted to paint her house, how about this? She wants you to pay it, they're going to pay you but I will suck your Dick and you're like, okay, that's a deal. Like that seems like a good deal. Like you want to do that? And she's like, yeah, I want to do I want to talk to your dad because I also want you to paint my house. I mean look at some girl. It depends on who it is. It's Angelina Jolie and she's 25 to be out there with the fucking roller.

Speaker 8:          00:57:38       You just be thinking. I was going to take a long time to finish though. I like if you're both into it and this is exempt. And again, again I have to be super clear about this, but I'm not exonerating rape or sexual harassment or predatory behavior. What I am saying is we have a weird. It's weird that we separate commerce from intimacy when it comes to sex and it's the only type of intimacy you can get massaged in your underwear. I do it all the time where women will be talking to me about, you know, well, my kids go into school at this place and he really likes wrestling, but the problem is they're discontinuing the program and while they're doing that, she's digging her elbow and my back and I'm in pain, but I'm, I'm in my underwear or alone in a room with this lady and I'm having a nice conversation with her while she's being intimate with me.

Speaker 8:          00:58:22       I mean, that's essentially what's going on. There's oil involved, they're massaging neck and it feels really good. It's don't shoot any fluid out of your body. We allow that to get a woody when you're getting a massage. Uh, it definitely moves. I'm trying to stay calm and zen though I put myself in, in a peaceful place. Fucking worse. When your deck starts getting harder and they're getting a platonic massage and you're like, what were like preparing your apology? But it's because being touched. We're also touched a starved. Yeah. You know, in this society that I think people have a hard time distinguishing between pleasant touch and eroticism or between good sex and love. You know, we mix it all together because we were so unfamiliar with it. There's also, there's would be levels to prostitution to right, like what would be a peek ahead buddy. You don't have to tell us what would be the problem with someone who say was a woman who just did not have

Speaker 6:          00:59:22       a desire to have a family like to freedom. Didn't want to work a regular job, but she likes having sex with men that she likes. So she picks a few men. Maybe she's got a small roster of like 10 guys who fucker and they rotate. No, you can do Tuesday. Mike's doing Tuesday. Okay. Wednesday. Yeah, Wednesday at work.

Speaker 3:          00:59:40       This is happening. There's a lot of this. I just was visiting with a friend of mine who does this real. Yeah, there's a website, I forget what it's called. It's not friends with benefits, but it's their websites and there's a whole name for these sugar daddies and sugar daddy sites where the guys now it's like, okay, look, we're gonna. And the way she described it was, there's no, it's no set price. It's not like a thousand bucks to fuck me or whatever. It's, it's like we get together if I like you have dinner, whatever. And Yeah. And then you want to get together again next weekend. Okay, you want to take me to Malibu? Okay, we'll go to Malibu and then his money showing up in my accounts or not. And if it's not then I'm deciding do we want to keep seeing this dude for nothing, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:00:24       Or it was 150 bucks, you know? And then it's like, and she's like different guys depending how much money they have, they give her more or less and so she can just decide at anytime. She wants to continue the relationship and she doesn't consider herself a prostitute. And you go to someplace like Thailand. It's, I met this dude in Nepal years ago who explained to me the whole do the whole deal because I've spent a lot of time in Thailand, but I've never been able to wrap my head around and I was Horny as hell, but I couldn't wrap my head around the thing and how it worked because, you know, getting back to your rape thing, to me the most demeaning experience in the world would be to find myself in a sexual situation and realize that the woman doesn't want to be there. You know?

Speaker 3:          01:01:09       It's like, oh my God, that's just like, I feel so ugly, you know, so to be with a Thai woman and there's all this confusion and she doesn't. She's acting like she wants to do this. Anyway, this guy explained to me, he goes to Thailand, there's a woman he knows there. If she's not around, she'll hook them up with a friend of hers, but basically he'll travel with her for a month or to take her all over Thailand. She translates, she gets them better deals on rooms and food and everything. She knows what to order, and Thailand is very cool about prostitution. It's Buddhist that doesn't have this anti sex thing that we have, so it's no big deal, right? As far as the Thai people are concerned. And um, and at some point on that trip, they'll go to the village where she grew up and they'll meet her family and he'll be like, hey, your mother's refrigerators looking kind of old. Is she needed a new refrigerator? Oh, that would be great. And they go buy a refrigerator and give it to the mother and the mother. Super happy. And that's the, that's it. There's no money changing hands. It's a gift. So it's very much like what you're describing. It's and sex. It's not for the sex. There's sex, there's friendship,

Speaker 8:          01:02:20       there's translation, there's saving me money and telling me the best places to go. That's like a guide. And sex is just part of that. It's a very, it's, it's, it's hard to conceive from our cultural perspective, uh, that it actually works that way. I don't think there would be anything wrong with a woman deciding to have sex with a bunch of men for money. I don't think there's anything wrong with it or I think the real is comes into having sex with somebody you don't know. Right. You know, if you're a street walker and some guy picks you up and wants to kill you, that's the real danger. The real danger is not in your clientele unless of course one of them is a fucking psycho, but I think can happen on a tinder date. Yeah, I think we are. We're operating under the echoes of the puritans and uh, I think as grown adults deep into our.

Speaker 8:          01:03:08       I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm 50 now. How old are you? Fifty five. The idea that we're still under and you're 43. Imagine being under this. The whims of some people who died, you know, hundreds of years ago, had a complete ignorance to human psychology, to physiology, to sexual urges to genetics. They did. What they knew then is literally flavoring the way we behave today. It's so insanely suppressive. It's good point. I also have a point about all this sexual harassment stuff that's uncomfortable and this is those environments become your world. If you're in an office eight hours a day, that is most of your day. Yeah. Most of your waking conscious day you're spending in this one area and people, they start behaving like that's the world and you start becoming sexually attracted to the people that are in your world and some people reciprocate and some do not.

Speaker 8:          01:04:08       Some people are frustrated and some are not and some people are gross and they're in a position of power in that weird world and I think maybe that guy wouldn't sexually harassed in the big world, but in this little world where everything's jammed in together and you have these clearly defined things like this guy has got a plaque on his desk that says the boss. Right, and you got to come in and he's got the desk. Come on and shut the door. Shut the door. Or if you like Matt Lauer, you've got a button where you lock the door, click fuck. Come on. Inside. We've got to discuss. We've got to review your progress. This click, this is the world, I mean, I'm not exonerating. Matt Lauer can't believe I'd say the scan, but if you're in that guy's world and I don't even know what he did, I didn't pay attention.

Speaker 8:          01:04:47       I met him once. He was quite a gentleman, but he's in this. He's got to be working 10, 12 hours a day. You're doing the today show. It's insanely competitive that morning TV thing. You have to be on the ball, you have meetings, you have fucking stuff to review. You have guests. Are you going to review your performance in your conversations with people and. Well, Matt, you know, whenever you start talking about sex, people drop off. Look, we've got the numbers. We have the chart in the direct relation to what you were saying earlier is what I read about Matt Lauer was, uh, he, he

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       couldn't have sex with a, just normal people because he's famous and he's, you know, he'd get in trouble and he's married. So he had to maintain the facade of that. He and he couldn't have sex with other famous people because that would come out into the press. So he had to have sex with people who weren't famous, they weren't just normal people. And that left the office. That was it. So imagine if we lived in a world where we said, who gives a shit if Matt Lauer's fucking someone other than his wife, that's between them. The sixties, again, this, I don't know that that was back when Dustin Hoffman was grabbing titties acute, and if you guys ever seen, by the way last, sorry the last word on this for me anyway, the people who are acting shocked and outraged around Matt Lauer and Charlie rose are full of shit. That's what. That's what kills me. The hypocrisy of the people who've been working with them for years and going, oh, I had no idea. I heard about Charlie rose being a fucking creep 15 years ago and I don't even work in media. You know, it's like the bill cosby thing. Open the bill cosby thing was an open.

Speaker 2:          01:06:20       Have you see? Have you guys seen this? Is one of the grossest things you can witness in a workplace is when the boss starts giving fucking neck rubs. You ever seen that? A neck rub and boss though it is, it is so fucking creepy to watch a big fat fucking boss saddling up behind some married secretary. Just so how are you doing the day carol rubbing her neck and she could see the look on her face frozen. She's got kids. She's. If she says to him, Hey, do you mind? I don't really want you to touch me right now. He's going to be, oh, I'm sorry, but then she doesn't know down the line, down the line when he's doing employee reviews and he's thinking, you know what? Ruin that fucking time. I just wanted to rub her back, man, but I'm not rubbing any of the dudes backs in the office. Now that man that is fucked up. That is one of the sleaziest slimy. His things and to imagine when you're the boss, to imagine that these bosses, they're oblivious, they just don't know. They just want to give them that corrupts. They're not aware like come on. They can feel that it is. He's rubbing their back. If you can't feel their fucking. Adam's trying to escape your sweaty God fucking male. Dominator.

Speaker 1:          01:07:42       How many guys become friends with women? Have Air tag friends just so they just creep and closer, almost like your stock and big game and you want to just move real close to flow and that's what they're doing. One of the classics. That's how I hunt elk. I walk real slow. Give it an echo now. Don't give it a try not to make my intentions known. That is what's happening in these environments. I think when people work in offices together, they get attracted to each other. Whitney. Cummings has a fucking hilarious bit about it. I won't. I won't do

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       it justice. I'm not going to say it, but she talks about working in an office because she's, you know, she works on Rosanne. She's on. She's on the staff, like she's in an office all the time. She's like, this is what people do that it's this weird environment and office romances are fucking. There's so calm and they're so common.

Speaker 9:          01:08:36       Plus together they're going to be attractive and if you're.

Speaker 6:          01:08:40       If you're married to some guy and he said he's the big boss and it says that on his breastplate, the big boss and the big pause as a secretary with the big ass and big tits and she's friendly and he's alone with her all day, all day, all day, every day, every week and she's calling it home because she's on top of the appointments and she's made. Is his playing. Oh, I have Mike's flight arrangements. I just wanted to call it and the wife has to listen. Listen to this bitch

Speaker 9:          01:09:09       hanging out there.

Speaker 6:          01:09:10       They slowly taking her power away, socking away her influence until one day can't take it anymore and he's like, you know, just fucking.

Speaker 9:          01:09:20       Is it home? If Carol was like you, Carol doesn't understand me. Carol is just such a bitch to me. Sometimes it's, it's crazy because you give her so much. She provide her so much. She, she doesn't know any woman who want to be in Carol's place. You know me. You work with Carol doesn't understand me. Next thing you know, you've got the sexual novelty kicking in when he's been banging carol for 15 years. They got kids, they got a mortgage, they've got a big ass. Yeah, to Nice. That nice with Ruby red lipstick and her long nails. Well it's fucking. The whole thing is just like I've office fucking and all that. Just like the whole thing is kind of unsavory. But like the and yeah, for sure. Office Romances, I hope they do happen. Hope everyone in the office is, is happily fucking all day long.

Speaker 9:          01:10:12       That's glory. But man, when you think about that much work done, when you think about fucking being denise and who's this dude's name? That Guy Mike. Mike, Mike, Tara. When you're fucking didn't hear denise and you got this job and there's Mike and Mike is a fucking asshole man. Mike is not. You're not as different story than my story. Yeah. No, I thought Mike just had a lot of responsibility, but I thought mix a big burly guy maybe eat a little too much and drank a little too much company or sanitation motto. Lot of work responsibility and Mike smells like fucking onions. It's far. It's or like his mind. It's farts are just fucking hell. A should see denise's ex husband, man. Denise has a kid, has a kid with a guy who was a real piece of shit. I'm saying what's happening right now, right now, what's happening is there's been a lot of fucking slimy massages that have been going on. I'm going to guess for about 5,000 years. There's been a lot

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       more than 20,000 years is slimy massages. It's been building up like the fucking yellow stone super called there and in the fucking like epigenetic Dna of women. There is probably somewhere in coded in there, just millennia of creepy fucking massages that don't stop with the fucking massage depending on what time period you're in. You know, and so I think that what we're feeling right now is the result of generations of creepy fucking massages and much, much worse happening. And women are like, fuck this, this fucking sucks. We're sick of it. We're fucking sick of your creepy massages and that's what it is. And some women, I mean, imagine man, I've. There's one time at a blockbuster video used to work at a blockbuster video. And My boss was this like, just a, a sleazy fucking like just a slimy fucking gay dude. I didn't like him.

Speaker 2:          01:12:12       He made his clean the video tapes when they didn't need to be cleaned. It's like, come on man, these tapes are clean spray and fucking videotapes down. I remember late at night, he, we, we, there's like the area where the cash register is, is this closed off cubicle place? I'm, I'm down. I'm down on my fucking knees, man. Having to get something from underneath there. And this dude like hops up on the fucking counter and he stretches his legs out in front of me. He's like, spread eagles is fucking legs out. So like blockbuster khaki pants on curling up. But you could see the outline of his fucking boss balls in there and, and like. And he's like, he's like, you got. I mean he's, he never. There was nothing more unappealing than boss balls accentuated by Khaki. And you're looking up there and he's looking down at you.

Speaker 2:          01:13:05       That power has been accentuated. He's looking down at you and he's just saying you did a good job today. He did a good job today, Duncan, and I'm like thinking like, this is fun. This is truly got to be one of the circles of fucking hell right now because like, this dude is hitting on me right now. I'm getting paid minimum. You for sure dude. His legs are spread. I don't know. Can I put it in just doing you? Can I prove it? Yeah, for right. I don't even think people were doing yoga in North Carolina at this time. If he was a woman, you would assume that those actions would indicate that she would want sexual intercourse. I'm saying there was a feeling now whether I could prove it or whether it was just me or whatever. Oh, what? Oh, twenties. I don't know, but there was a feeling that this sucks, man. There's more going on here. Right? This sucks. That's. Is it a legal. Is it like, could I. is it even sexual harassment? No, but it sucks and it's like it sucks dude. And that, that, that is the, is what a lot of fucking women had been dealing with for a long time and they're pissed and they're rightfully rightfully fucking pissed. It's like, who wants to be dominated like that? If I'm getting dominated, I want to be paying for it. You know what I mean? I don't want it.

Speaker 6:          01:14:24       No, no doubt man. Um, I really do think there's something to this idea that humans aren't meant to be in these small areas totally enclosed in together with each other all day. I don't think we're designed for it. No, I just don't think that's an intimate environment. As weird as that sounds. And this is not saying that men and women can't work together and be totally, you know, platonic. And they absolutely can. Yeah. But it's, it's a super unnatural behavior, unnatural environment to be in these cubicles. You small little boxed in offices working day in, day out with people, smelling them. And you know, I think we should outlaw offices. Yes. We have to get shit done. Working at home, a kiss for it

Speaker 2:          01:15:10       solutions, but definitely protected by the state. The state man who's going to fix the roads, we could fix the roads. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out.

Speaker 6:          01:15:25       We were talking about something earlier that I wrote down because I wanted to remember it. You were saying about Bob Dylan's version of all along the watchtower versus Jimi Hendrix. I think Jimi Hendrix was amazing, but Bob Dylan's was his and he wrote it and it was something cool about. Listen to those words. Even it wasn't like as pleasing orally, but there's a. If you go to cat power official, you know cat power is saying she has a video up today that she put on her instagram. She's got a great instagram and a video up today of Bob Dylan in the 19 sixties in Paris, getting all these really dumb questions thrown at him and he's doing like this press conference and he's sitting there smoking cigarettes. He looks like he's like 25 years old and they're yelling things at them and asking them questions like, what did you find it? Yeah, pull it. What? Listen to this. Listen. It's kind of crazy, man.

Speaker 10:         01:16:20       Do you agree that you should be the leader of singles with a message is don't you attend your first breakfast one that's better than the ones that you do now? You said that he's American American. Well, that's why you probably did better is because I feel like singing off on each particular special to express. When you're saying no folks

Speaker 1:          01:17:14       kind of weird, Huh? Yeah, I'll fucking weird French, but how weird is that? Like seeing this is essentially like the same dumb questions you'd get on twitter. Yeah. Twitter accounts would get those exact same student. Take your oldest dogs better than. You'll see that there's some performance art is to hired a security for himself and a cameraman and he walked through times square pretending to be super famous and they had other people like at the periphery studying the crowd reaction to this staged famous person walking through Times Square. Here, we're seeing this. No, I forget. I wouldn't. I don't know how to tell Jamie to look for it, but it's incredible. They interview people, right? Who have seen him in there. These two huge black dudes and a guy with a camera and he's like walking around like he's, you know, fucking superstar and they interview people around is this Damn Jamie, you are fast.

Speaker 1:          01:18:19       So this is him by himself. Normally I guess security with a suit on and security and I remember they asked people like, what do you think of whatever name it is a. and one of the dudes was like, well I really liked his early stuff and this was not one of the guys that was paid off. This is another person on the street. It's just making it a random idiot. Yeah. That's so hilarious. Well, I've had that happen to me before. Will someone come up and ask me for a picture? And then another guy will pull out his phone and go, who are you man? I'm like, I'm nobody picture. It's like getting a camera. I'm going to get a picture with you too if I know who you are. You don't know who I am. So why would you want a picture window? That's crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:19:00       Just don't grab his waist when if you. If you double pinch my fat, I will call it shit. Double Pinch my family. You've done tens of thousands of photos after your shows. You always stand out there and you take a photo of every morning. Oh really? Weird man. Shows got too big. Yeah, like the Belko theater. I just didn't tell you. You're doing really big. Yeah, it's too bad news. I'll do it still at the ice house and stuff like that. But sometimes people, they have an agenda and it's not just to say hi, you know, and they just want to monopolize. Not Monopolize your time. They don't care if people around you and you're run to those people and you don't know what. It's just too much work. Yeah, it's crazy. Did that, man. That was crazy. You did that. That was, that's crazy. I remember thinking, man, it's a lot of times shannon out there did it for 3,700 people. Add like an extra couple of hours to. You're there for two hours. Yeah. A second show. Literally. Did you have a fucking immune system on fire? Because when you think of all those, like when you think like if like we could take your hand after shaking three people's hands. So

Speaker 9:          01:20:08       there's never that many people with is 3,700 people in the theater. 100. It might've been a thousand. Take your hand and if we could put it under like a scanning microscope, you know. How much shit do you think is on your hand after one of those nights? Probably like a pretty lots of shit. Lots of stuff. Lots of com. Com pitfalls. What sweat shirt or sweater? I just like it. It's got to be some period blood on my hands. Some fight. And who knows man. Maybe like pizza, pizza, [inaudible]. A lot of weed. Some we'd never know. People try to slip it into your pocket or something handed to me. They put it in my hand. I was telling I can't. First of all I get too much weed. So anybody trying to get me, we'd please don't give me any weed. I get too much wheat.

Speaker 9:          01:20:54       And then second of all I can't. I don't know. You can just take your weed. Just can't. I can't, I wish I could. I wish I could. I'm sure you cool. You know. Sure you are. But I have kids. Somebody gave me. Somebody gave me Iowasca after a show. I'll just drag it right there on the spot. It was a, it was a tough. It's a tough with black. Oh Geez. It's IOWASCA. I remember taking it back to my towel, looking at it and for a second thinking like what? What would happen if I drink Iowasca and a fucking holiday inn. Like how bad would that trip be? Be fucking wonderful. The ceiling would open up to be propelled right through it. Yeah. It's the same stuff that William hurt drank in altered states, bro. This is the real shit. I got saved in a tupperware. Just shake it first dude.

Speaker 9:          01:21:41       Once, once, once I got it, I got home after the show I've flown and someone had given me this framed picture and I have this frame picture. I don't remember what the art was. It's like a skull or something. I wasn't somehow like I ended up pulling the thing open and inside the picture was a fucking joint. The guy had shoved a joint into the picture and I had flown with it. So if they had, if they had like seeing if they'd open that shit up, they would have seen a joint and I would've had to been like, Nah man, somebody gave that to me to show it was fucking hippie shit. Dumb ass trying to smuggle one joint. So it's dangerous. It's tricky, man. You can really get in trouble. Had An interesting experience recently at Heathrow. I don't know if. Did you want to talk about this in New York?

Speaker 9:          01:22:34       Anyway, I was flying through Heathrow and uh, I had a connecting flight, miss the connecting flight, but whatever. There's another one two hours later. So I'm going through security because you have to like go again through security at Heathrow when you're coming from outside Europe. And uh, I'm standing in their way and they take my bag for a secondary check and, and I see the woman talked to the boss and he says, we'll use the other one over there. So she takes my bag over to this other, a security line that's not functioning. And she runs it through the machine there. She comes back and they talk for

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       a minute and he comes over to me and he says, you and I have to have a conversation. I said, okay. He said, um, what do you do? Like writer, psychologist? And he's like, yeah, but what do you do? What hobbies do you have? Hobbies? And I literally, I said, dude, I'm 55. I jerk off and go to bed. I don't have any hobbies. He didn't smile and he's like, you have a garden. It was like, no, that you work with animals. No. Like, I don't know, like fertilizer or something. Fertilizer residue got on your brain. They use that for bombs. So he's a surgeon, right? He's like, well, you haven't told me a story that makes sense, so I have to call the police. I was like, what are you talking to me? He's like, well, night night, a nitrates set off the machines, shut off the other machine.

Speaker 1:          01:23:53       They're never wrong. You're going to have to sit down right there and wait. And he tells this other guy, watch him. Don't let him go anywhere. Like yeah, I'm gonna make a run for it, and he threw and these cops show up dude, and they were like nine cops and body armor like surrounded me and you know, it was like, wow, this is what it feels like to go down. But you are also a 55 year old white guy who's obviously well educated. You're not speaking with a weird accent. Exactly. That's what I'm thinking. So if it, if I were black or you're whatever, for me, I would've been terrified. Did you see the video that I posted to the guy that got gunned down? Watch it. I did. So horrific. Unbelievable. It's a murder. It was murdered. And also why do you have to crawl across the fucking floor?

Speaker 1:          01:24:38       How does they put your hands over your head and we come over and cuff you because they wanted to clear the room who's near the room. They didn't want them to be too close to the room. The room was slightly around the corner, but the way that guy escalated it was playing a game of Simon says with them and I will fucking shoot you. And then did shoot him for just reaching back to grab his pants. His pants were falling down. It was as he was crawling, I mean was. He was in no way, looked like he was doing something dangerous. But the most fucking disturbing thing was how many people in the comments after I posted that video on twitter, we're saying, you know, that he didn't comply. They were like saying clean kill. He didn't comply and clean, clean, clean, clean, kill. Come on, come on Joe.

Speaker 1:          01:25:23       That's a clean kill. And also one that the guy was drunk, he was young. He's, you know, it's an open carry state by the way was white. Yeah, he was white. He had. This is not an agency if the guy that killed him. Monster. Scary looking dude, man. Jamie can you. I'm fucked. Written on his Ar. He fucked your for your, for your friend. And then I should say I'm fucked. And then the other thing was they didn't let the jury look at the video. They thought it would take them like it would change their opinion. Like what are you talking about? Reality. To see that video, that video is, there's the guy, what the fuck Jesus Christ man, go a good beat up a lot in high school and there's that old expression. If you give someone a hammer, everything looks like a nail. That's the only tool you have is a hammer.

Speaker 1:          01:26:16       Everything looks like a nail and you're given this young guy who's obviously fucking psycho mean the way he gun that guy down. I mean that was insane. Just fucking insane. And the idea that this represents two human beings in an interaction and that one human being has that much power over the other one that he can yell at them screaming, I'm totally escalate the situation, not deescalate, you know, and that he's got this gun out by the way, which you're in an open carry state. So if the guy did have a toy gun or whatever the fuck they said he had, and he's holding this toy gun and someone calls the police, you're allowed to have a toy gun, you're allowed to have a gun gun in Arizona. I read that he was state, he was an exterminator and he had like 22 or something that he used for extermination in the room and somebody saw through the window him holding a rifle, but you know what man, those are legal thing, unless someone just got completely hysterical and called and said, hey, the guy's pointing the gun out the window at people and this is the message that got in.

Speaker 1:          01:27:21       The cops don't know when they show up, but when you see that guy and that woman and you just see their fucking body language as they're walking down the hallway, super casual, they're not walking like people that are about to kill people. They go, they comply immediately. The guys begging for his life, please don't shoot me. The whole thing was horrific. Yeah. Yeah, and so I mean this gets back to we were talking about with the women this moment in history where women are tired of the sleazy hand rubs. I think we're also at the moment were nonwhite. People are fucking tired of being done down. Everybody's. This is a white guy, so you know what I'm saying? This is everybody so imagined. Well, but it doesn't show. It's everyone. It shows it. It happens to white people sometimes. But imagine the black guy. I mean, you're right.

Speaker 1:          01:28:03       I got in Albuquerque, homeless dude, and they fucking throw grenades and he starts running. Oh yeah, there was, this happened like two years ago. There was a homeless guy. He's sleeping right out in the bush somewhere near Albuquerque. And the cops come out, they throw a flash. Flash grenade scares the fuck out of him. He jumps up, starts running away. They got him down from the back. They shoot them in the back as he's running away. And it's like. And they were acquitted. I mean, it's, it's nuts. That is. There's no accountability. And uh, so. But the thing that I, you know, the, what's the line that a thing it was Benjamin Franklin or, or one of the founding fathers said that the police, the revolution, the revolution occasionally has to be a, like a fed with the blood of their history of liberty must sometimes be watered with

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       the blood of Patriots.

Speaker 9:          01:29:04       Martyrs. What? A fucked up tree. Hey man, why you got that in your garden, man, that's fucking get that thing out of your. But don't you think there's like a cleansing revolution that has to happen every once in a while.

Speaker 6:          01:29:20       I think what we're experiencing now as people, well, what we're getting from information right and where we're getting from this use of the Internet is the ability to spread information instantaneously. This video could have existed decades ago and we've never seen it, you know, and there would be no need for potty cameras back then either they didn't have the technology. So now they do. Everyone has to have a body camera. This guy did this knowing he was filming it, which is even more insane. Like imagine this guy completely unfiltered, right? I mean, he might've just gone that guy down for the fuck of it as soon as he saw him. I mean, he might be just a guy looking to shoot people, which is real.

Speaker 7:          01:29:57       Well, no, this is the thing that we're, this is like you're saying, oh, what, you know, priests, molesting kids. Uh, and why? Well, a lot. I don't know why there are so many are doing it, but one thing's for sure sociopath's and people who are trying to do fucked up shit. Wait, what was the. You're saying about. What's her name? Kira. What was it you were saying that she liked DP. Oh yeah. What? What does he do?

Speaker 9:          01:30:25       So she said she. She was joking on this podcast I did with her. She was like, you know, I think I've gained the system because what I love the most in sex is DP and that's what they pay the most for now. What he being doubled penetration for some people aren't fucked up. Both of them. Brand new new listeners. What that shows. That's a person who

Speaker 7:          01:30:47       figured out truly you'd figured out how to make money doing what she loves. And so in the same way, when you have these fucking sociopath, these pedophiles who want to make a career, we want to figure out a way to do what they're doing while while like sustaining themselves. Well, they're like, oh, I'll just become a priest. If I become a priest I'm going to have. And it's all power. All talking power dynamics here because it's like it's not enough the you're an older man and you're helpless kid, but on top of that you're a representative of the creative force of the universe. You're like the fucking spokesperson for the universe. The power dynamic there is a is it's almost as skewed as it can fucking get it in the same way that guy, that guy. No, I mean, you think when that guy goes home, he's like listening to sounds of waterfalls and shit and taking baths with lavender candles.

Speaker 7:          01:31:40       That guy is. That guy goes fucking home and he just probably just fucking punches a brick wall. He just punches. Was He? He's uh, that guy is not a happy dude. I agree. And he likes to dominate people and he wants to be in control and he wants to have power. And he got himself into a job where he could be a get paid to be the worst kind of murderous bully there is. And that's what's really happening is that we have in our society monsters and the monsters are smart and they're figuring out ways to get in positions of power. And We, before the bloody revolution, we just need to come up with better ways to scan for these fucking assholes so that we can keep them out of these positions of power not scanned for them. We encouraged them. The system is built in such a way that they're encouraged.

Speaker 7:          01:32:29       I mean, it's no accident that we ended up with psychopaths as president. Who the fuck else would want to do that? Who seeks a psychopath? I don't either. I think Obama and Jimmy Carter, or to a real exceptions to that, we'll wait. Well, we have to. I don't think psychopath is the right word for it, but we do do. You do kind of have to come up with low maniac. Well you need to come up with a definition of terms, right? So it's like for example, like Obama, like you gonna have to come up with an inarguable. Things like Obama for sure ordered drone strikes that killed people. So if you order a drone strike and it kills people, are you a murderer or that's a question. Are you a murderer? If you order a drone strike and it kills people.

Speaker 8:          01:33:07       And the numbers are insane. The number of innocence is in the high eighties. Does that make you a murderer? Does that make you a murderer? 80,000 now percent. Oh percent. Like if you have a dentist before Jamie with the number of innocence killed by drone strikes, I think it's in somewhere in the 80 range. Eighty percent range

Speaker 7:          01:33:27       that that would. Would that make him a murderer? Like is it safe to say when you're using adjectives for him, you could say, well he has. Could you say he has murdered?

Speaker 8:          01:33:37       Cool. Could you say this? That we have an infant tile view of what the president is because there are so many tasks in so many human beings in so many things that are connected to him that the idea that he is the one giving all the orders for all these different things that are happening all over the world is kind of absurd. It's like a monotheistic God or the Daddy. We we really need to go to a, a more community based understanding of religion and politics of everything. There shouldn't be one person in charge of everything. That's ridiculous. One guy just thinking about two massive issues, geopolitics and a and finance. These are two things that the government is supposed to have their hands on, their source to be able to control the way we interact with world leaders, all sorts of weird military dictatorships and the Middle East and in North Korea. We have to interact with all of these countries, hundreds of countries. Then on top of that, he's responsible for job growth. Like what? Who is this fucking guy? Right. What else is he doing? He's ordering Jones trikes. He's ordering drone strikes to what else is doing? He's keeping pot illegal. That son of a bitch, he's appointing Supreme Court judges just drilling in Alaska. He's cutting a new road through the Salmon River like he they're doing. He's one guy, one guy

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       doing any one guy with a full time job. Doing any one of those. Being responsible for the decisions is crazy for any one of those things are the public face of the world. Do you notice a trump and I used to think that people were exaggerating, but he's losing his shit. He's micro strokes. I think he's. He's slurring his words now a lot and he drinks 12 cans of diet coke a day apparently, which made me maybe fake news. They might be fucking with this, I don't know, but he watches eight hours of television a day. So perfect. Representative of America. Look at this. Nearly 90 percent of the people killed in air strikes were not the intended targets during one, five month period of operation between January 2012 and February 2013.

Speaker 7:          01:35:43       Okay, well why do they hate us? But why do they hate? Well, let's talk about the psychopath. I do eat them. Let's talk about the psychopath idea. Like what is a psychopath? I mean this is a very special kind of, of of murder that's happening here. It's like, you know, okay, let's take the classic example. God, Rhett, may he rest in peace. Charles Manson, one of the things he always said is, I never killed anybody. Man. I never killed anybody. And it's true. I don't think he ever killed anybody. Tex Watson did all the killings. So in with Manson, it's like Jesus fucking Christ. That guy is truly. I mean, he really is one of the classics. He's amazing. He's like one of the most entertaining, entertaining psychopaths in America. Maybe ever. He's really great actor. He's a great musician, but he's. But the thing is like, okay, we know Manson.

Speaker 7:          01:36:28       That guy was out of his fucking Gore. We age your garbage man. Yeah, yeah. You call it garbage dump. I call it a gold mine, but like you take somebody like that and it's like, okay, clearly nuts. But then you take someone like Obama or any American president who was killed so many more people are ordered people to kill so many more people in many of those people or children and they're dressed in a suit and there are dapper and they're fucking charismatic. I mean, fuck. If Obama walked into the room right now, I do like, wow, Bama. Wow, great to meet you.

Speaker 6:          01:37:00       You know how you know how a drone strikes get approved now, lawyers, what from the Defense Department? Lawyers, lawyers ultimately make the call whether or not drone strikes get approved, but dude, they get together with lawyers. That's the. That's the day they have a target. Say of the targets and apartment building, they have a Geo locator on the target, like whatever it is, whether it's a metadata from someone's cell phone that indicates the cell phones in this particular area, how big of a target is this? How much of a risk is it? What's the benefits of. And they'll, they'll literally get together with lawyers. This is according to a guy that I know that used to be one of the big wigs, the CIA. He's like, this is what happens. Mike Baker told me that. Are they worried about getting sued or what they're worried about the legality of it, how it's going to be perceived, whether or not you can be tried as a war criminal for this.

Speaker 6:          01:37:50       Ah, yeah. Like it's not just the scary thing is not just that 90 are unintended targets. It's that they know going in that they're going to kill a bunch of unintended gun him down. Like you saw that collateral murder video, which is what put what wiki leaks on the map when they released that video that showed those guys gunning down and uh, there was a minivan and these kids in the van and let the guys literal reaction is, I shouldn't have brought the kids, shouldn't have brought the kids. We had a gun. You down. Oh, whoops. Turns out that wasn't a gun. It was a camera. My bad. I mean they're gunning you down with blurry images from the sky. And then when, when they killed kids or thought they'd killed kids, I think the kid survived. They were like, shouldn't have brought the kid.

Speaker 7:          01:38:37       Yeah. And that. And that's what's really wild about it, is that freedom. We don't yet freedom the tree of fucking liberty. We got to water. What do you want the thing to weather. But this is the, this is that, that to me, this is the most interesting thing about living in the United States is the way that you generally don't think about that stuff. Like you just don't think about it. It's not a thing that you really. What are you going to do? It's like, you know, it's happening, you know, we've been doing it, you know, we've done it over and over and over and over and over again, but really nobody. What can we do? You vote your low, low, be politically active and maybe you can get somebody in power who isn't going to kill a bunch of people, but inevitably they keep killing a bunch of people. They keep doing it and we keep ignoring it and that is one of the creepiest fucking things because it's the, it's like, alright, when here in the United States when a cop guns down somebody, thank God, most people freak out. Like that video that you tweeted. We all look at the video. We're like, my God, how did that guy get off the hook? We used to look at his picture. He's a monster, but w probably today, I don't know for sure, but this week, certainly this month some people got exploded by the United States. Right.

Speaker 6:          01:39:55       Does that happen? I mean this thing about drones is they don't really. They don't tell you we're launching drones

Speaker 3:          01:40:02       strikes and then like let's talk about Yemen where all the weapons that Saudi Arabia is using to starve and destroy the Yemeni population came from the United States, so. And the pilots are trained by us and so we've got our drones blowing people up, but also we've totally armed this country that's destroying this other country. And do you know, they know that it says USA on the bomb fragments. That's so fucked up. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:40:30       Yeah. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:40:32       Sorry to. I don't, I don't know if this will derail it, but you know, we're talking about Sam Harris earlier and the Bfi have a. it's not a beef, but the disagreement that I have with him around his Islam thing is that he totally discounts the role of US foreign policy in creating the toxic environment that gives rise to things like isis. So to ensure that he totally discount. So because I don't think that's true. Honestly, I don't, you know a lot more about Sam than I do, but some of my friends and listeners will be like, dude, you got to listen to convenient talking point. I don't think he does. I listen to one podcast he did where he was responding to this article in the, the, the publication of, of Islamic Jihad or something, and he was like, look, this is what I'm talking about.

Speaker 3:          01:41:23       Like all, you know, I'm a non Muslim, should be killed and blah, blah blah. And he's going through this whole thing and it's been a year since I listened to it. So you know, apologies to Sam if I'm misremembering this, but what I remember thinking at the time was he, he said something like, well, there are people who think that it's US foreign policy, but that's ridiculous. This is Islam. This is Islam. It says it right here. This is the ideology of Islam. And I'm like, yeah, but dude, that particular ideology of Islam is taking hold a because of 100 years of foreign policy of, of humiliating and destroying these cultures, and B, because of American support for the Saudi supported a schools. I forgot the name of the schools that are all over the Middle East now because of Saudi Arabia, putting them into Pakistan and Afghanistan and all that.

Speaker 3:          01:42:16       That will hobby ism. Exactly. Thank you. Yeah, so I mean I think this is really important that when you destroy countries and when you do it the way we're doing it, we don't even have the balls to go in on the ground. You're just blasting people from the clouds. It creates blowback and if that's expressed in terms of a religious ideology or whatever it is, it's going to come back do. You're absolutely right. But there's also stuff that's happening to places that it has nothing to do with America. That's also related to. I mean look at what's going on in Iraq when the power vacuum was created because Saddam Hussein was killed and the Sunni's and this year I started a civil war and they're, they're, they're, they're starting a war that has nothing to do with America again, and the fact that America took out their dictator, but why does it exist?

Speaker 3:          01:43:08       Who created Iraq? We did the British and we created it and we created it like we did. When I say we, I'm talking about European know post World War II team, US principal, World War One. Really? Yeah. Team us. When they created these countries in Africa as well, they intentionally created them so that there were opposing tribes or populations within the country so that they could better exercise control over them. Right? So they engineered the Sunni and Shiite. They engineered. You look at the origins of, and I'm not an expert, this is. I've read this several different places, but I know it happened in in Africa as well, where they would intentionally draw the borders so that you have different tribes within that border who are all. You have a long lasting and enmity with each other so you can like arm and can manipulate one tribe to dominate the others. And then when dee colonialization happen, then we and we have all these unstable structures in place that we've left behind. I think what you're asking

Speaker 6:          01:44:08       lighting is that it's a very complex issue and it's not simply just the ideology and I 100 percent agree. I don't think anybody who's reasonable couldn't agree, but I also think that there's a problem with human psychology and ideologies and and we have this very bizarre desire to be all in, in whatever team that were on and when you're on a team that has in arguably in 2017, the most archaic mainstream ideology that's, that's Islam, right? I mean if you stop and think about how ancient is it in its practices the way, especially when it's in use in radical ways, the way women are forced to dress the way in Saudi Arabia, I think up until really recently they weren't allowed to drive. Right now they're allowing them to within the last two or three years, there's a lot of like stuff in it that we would think of as being a part of a bygone era of human beings. So for Alabama, Roy Moore's losing though apparently is he? Yeah. That's happening right down by 10 points.

Speaker 6:          01:45:14       Is paralyzed right on that. Yeah. There's definitely parallels. There's, I think it's like all things. We're always looking for one reason why something exists and look, the reason why you have this idea of jihad and jihadism being like involving suicide bombers and sacrifice and wore a lot of that is direct directly attributable to what happened to Afghanistan during the Soviet Union's interaction with them when we were training the Muja hi dean. If you don't, the way they talked people into going to war and arm them against the Soviet Union. These few tile attempts. Yeah. There was a lot of like this. A lot of encouragement for a lot of these suicidal tactics. Maybe not necessarily suicide bombing, but the mujahideen were armed directly by the United States and that is what turned Osama bin Ladin against us. Like he was with us.

Speaker 3:          01:46:11       Charlie Wilson's war. You seen that movie? No, it's about that. It's about the senator. I think he was who went to Pakistan and oversaw the arming of the Mujahideen. Tom Hanks. Oh, right. I'm the guy. Everyone says I look like a while ago. Philip Seymour Hoffman. What is his name, feel? Seymour Hoffman and also to relate back to what we were talking about earlier, think about the role of sexual frustration in getting a martyr's. You know, these are guys who never get laid.

Speaker 6:          01:46:43       A lot of them. These kids, man, a buddy of mine who was over in Afghanistan was telling me how they would put kids in front of

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       because tractors weren't expensive. Ah, Jesus, Dr. Shawn, right? Does doesn't want that. Dr Baker wasn't. I was thinking that was. I'm andy. I'm stumped, but no, I think it was Sean Baker was telling me that he was over in Afghanistan as a medic and he was saying that these guys had. He's like, I can always make another son. I can't get another tractor. Jesus God. So the other kids walk in front of the tractors to look for landmines. D, what does, here's the super bowl. The donkeys have blown up or any. Just fucking imagine that. That could even be something that someone could say and you realized the difference in the world that you'll in the harshness of the world that you're talking about and the worst thing. Sorry. The worst thing about Afghanistan is, I mean I know a lot old hippy, so used to that was on the hippie trail and Afghanistan was the best place. Everybody loved Afghanistan. The people are so nice. So welcoming your, your bus breaks down in the middle of the nowhere. People will come from miles away from the village and take you back to the village and feed you and take care of you and like it was the most hospitable places.

Speaker 7:          01:47:55       I'll tell you a scary story about that though, because when I'm there is that one of the teachers that he's Rom dass retreats, they all were on the hippie trail man. And one of them, her name's, I think Mirabai Bush, I think Mira, Mira, right? Uh, but she was telling the story how, you know, the hippie trail, they get in a bus. They traveled through Europe to end up in India. The fucking brotherhood of eternal love was like just just dispensing, just acid. Every listing. Do this trip. No, I mean you can have. You tried fucking bringing a rainbow bus through Afghanistan now man. We gotta go through Iran to get the soldiers to shoot it, but she was telling the story about how like all these hippies were hanging out at. I don't know where they were at, but these two fucking dudes wrote up and horses wearing like, you know, the, the full garb.

Speaker 7:          01:48:43       They had swords in one of the hippies said to them something like, we're all children of God, and he responded, my God has no children. It was like some kind of heavy duty is law. I'm just like, fuck you hippie. What are you talking about? So it wasn't. It wasn't. It wasn't necessarily. Everything wasn't necessarily peaceful and joyful over there with still fundamentalism happening there. But I think all this shit we're talking about, they're really creepy thing is that whatever this is, whether it's the United States stuck a fucking stick in the ants nest too much and now we've got like these fundamentalists lunatics who will blow themselves up to kill other people. Now, whether we've got a viral form of a religion that is infected people's brains and is now like a contained is going to spread with adversity. Their real problem is we're also dealing with an exponential increase in technological progress and this is when I interviewed this Guy Aaron Frank from university and is a scary thing he said is eventually there's going to be technology that exists where you can just like you can engineer a engineer fucking ebola using some kind of biological three d printer when, when that, that might be 50 years from now, 60 years from now, I don't know, but it's not that far away.

Speaker 7:          01:50:06       And also this fucking Cuban sound beam right there. There's kind of, you know, the story popped up about these people in Cuba state. There's some weird chirping sound. The embassy at the embassy, US embassy there shooting some sort of sound weapon at them and driving them crazy and it caused brain damage and so when you consider that already there is apparently some new sonic weapon existing that can make you mentally disabled maybe permanently. And we're dealing with people who are mentally disabled. And another fucking way, which is that they become infected with some paradigm that makes them think that there is an actual, like loony God out there that wants them to put babies in front of tractors and that wants them to explode other people. And they could maybe get ahold of this sound beam that goes through walls and just start launching it into people's house through walls.

Speaker 7:          01:51:04       I think it went through a wall. Yeah. So they haven't defined what this weapon is specifically, right? This isn't a new thing. Well this is the. No, have some sound weapons, some salad. But this is the thing. There was a time when a nuclear bomb did not exist and then it existed. There was a time when a gun didn't exist and then it existed. So I think it'd be a safe bet to say in the next 50 years we're going to get some brand new fucking weapon. There's some guy in Darpa right now whipping up some fucking thing. I don't know what it is. So who knows what it is, you know, just like, uh, a new kind of flashlight that shines through walls. And just makes you forget who you are, why you saw what Elon Musk said about the robots. You need a strobe light to see him because there'll be moving so fast in two years.

Speaker 7:          01:51:46       Yeah. Sleep tight, sleep tight. Because it's like, you know, not only do we have like these weapons are in the hands right now. Like you said, the nuclear weapons are in the hands of somebody won a popularity contest. I don't know who's gonna control the fucking robots, but one thing's for sure, man, there's a lot of crazy people on the planet right now and they're going to have access to shit unlike anything we've ever, we've ever seen in the question. Yes. And how about a weapon that just makes everyone. Infant tile doesn't kill you. Like the idea of the hydrogen bomb, the hydrogen bomb, right? That kills all the people. Leaves. All the buildings are beautiful. But what about neutron bomb? Neutrons that what it is. You're right. What about stupid bomb? Yeah, like a bomb that makes everybody have a 50 Iq. There you go. They thought they would drop a LSD, right? They were experimenting with Lsd in the sixties and seventies thinking that they could use that to make soldiers crazy on the battlefield, and so he initially wanted to use

Speaker 6:          01:52:46       it as a truth serum. They want to use it on captured enemy soldiers. Yeah. Yeah. There's. There's some hilarious videos from the 19 fifties given soldiers acid, world war two video. Yeah. We'll post World War II. They got them all doped up on acid, I think their English troops from the UK and they're wandering around and black and white footage. Just tripping balls. That's right.

Speaker 7:          01:53:08       Yeah. It's true. Dude. This is the. This is actually why we need lsd right now because the problem is we're. We're facing one of the most beautiful things that could ever happen to our society, which is we're about to create this beautiful technology that is going to be something unlike anything we've ever seen and it's wonderful. It's wonderful. Humans are mostly wonderful, I think, but we've got a few of us out there have been infected with this thing. You're talking about us or them, the team attitude. It's me and you. It's me versus you and this is the problem. This is the. This is a real problem. How do we fix that? That. Because it's like, yeah, I don't know who caused it. That's the thing, like what are is fucking Harvey Weinstein or these, you know, is it because we did teen teen teen boys aren't getting jerked off enough. I don't know. But we do have a problem right now which is that there's a lot of people whose minds are scrambled with crazy ideas and that's okay. That's okay. Back when there were crossbows and shit, but now that we've got these minds scramble with crazy ideas and access to information about how to make fertilizer bombs, how to make the Ivr already heard, ever happened.

Speaker 6:          01:54:24       Then with that, what, what did what, where'd you get the fertilizer?

Speaker 3:          01:54:28       Oh yeah. Yeah. So what happened was, so these cops, so, so this one cop is standing next to me and he's like, oh, so you're from the states on what part do you live in? And we're just chatting and then this other cop comes over and he's like, he's like, I'm gonna. Press my camera. I have to record this, you understand that are like, yes, I understand you're recording me and anything you say will be used. Yeah, yeah, I understand. And he's real up in my face and like, I think you're lying to me and giving me all this shit. And then he goes away and the other guy's like, yeah, don't worry. He's like, he gets uptight sometimes and I'm like, oh, so you're the good cop. Right? And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I said, all right, that's fine. As long as you're not American cop.

Speaker 3:          01:55:05       Right. I'm not worried about it because I knew like, I knew like eventually this was going to be just a good story. Yeah. And so they're like, well, you know, you're bad. Keeps coming back positive. And they checked my hands and my, they wiped my jeans and Shit and they said we got to get the dog, get the dog. So now I'm waiting there just chatting in the, bring this dog. Brian was the name of the dog and Brian sniffed my bag and didn't. There was nothing. And so they were like, eh. Brian says, you're, you're good to go that crazy. Fuck the equipment, let's adopt a dog. And they're telling me, and I'm like, guys, there's nothing. Trust me, there's, you can google me, like I'm not, you know, and they're like, the machines are never wrong. They've literally said that. And I'm like, well, they're wrong this time, you know, let's get 50 bucks, 50 pounds, you know, and like, yeah, we don't bet. Anyway, so finally I was like, when the, when the dog was like, you know, that I was free, I say, can I do a group Selfie with you guys? Like put it on Instagram, that'd be pretty funny. And they're like, Nah, we can't ever faces on right. But you can take a picture with Brian. So I got picture with the dog licking my cheek and Heathrow, hilarious.

Speaker 6:          01:56:13       Bought a laptop once, red band and uh, he was selling this windows laptop. I want it to get a second laptop. And the first time I used it took it through the airport and uh, it got screened. So, uh, they pull you aside. We're going to have to check this again. Have you been near farm? No, I didn't know what that meant back then. I didn't know about the fertilizer. They checked my hands. Nothing. They swab the entire laptop and they'll test positive for fertilizer and cum stains. It's probably just red bands. Just fucking a computer. But they, they went over it with a fine tooth comb with a swab and they went up and down. They had asked me a bunch of questions and I'll explain what I do. I'm a comedian, you know, a host fear factor. And they go, oh, okay. All right.

Speaker 6:          01:57:00       Get outta here. Just gave it to me. Gave me the laptop. Because they recognized you? Yeah, because they checked the laptop. They, I said I bought it from a friend. This is the work around the farm. I go, I don't think so. And uh, they just tested it and they swapped it and whatever the minimal amount of nitrogen or that they found on it, which exists in fertilizer, but also in bombs somehow or another. But it's also, by the way, nitrogen is the most common thing in the air. The air's 80 percent nitrogen. How they're getting. What they're getting off of the laptop, I don't know why it would test positive or what have you, but it was apparently a minimal amount in some way, shape or form. They thought it was okay.

Speaker 3:          01:57:40       I thought they were going to turn it on and check the content and you're going to get in trouble for

Speaker 6:          01:57:46       writing all the shit that I write down like the fuck is wrong with your head, but like if you worked on a farm and you got that nitrogen shit all over, you feel like you were laying down some fertilizer and gotten your clothes and you went straight to the airport. You're not flying anywhere, bro. Yeah. They check you and they find that shit on you. You know, if there's somehow or another it gets detected. It's touching your bags or something like that. Like you're gonna you're going to be in for some questioning. You know? That sucks man.

Speaker 3:          01:58:14       So what do you think's gonna happen with this democratization of weaponry that you were talking about? Because sometimes I think he could be a good thing if everybody had the capacity to destroy the planet. No Way. It's not a good thing. It's like, well, that's where we're going, where we're going to have to kill the people that we think would possibly destroy

Speaker 6:          01:58:36       on it, and then everyone's going to be scared. It's going to be like mccarthyism for nuclear catastrophe. Everyone's

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       going to think that metro our destruction, which works when one of the, when both people are saying, but when you're dealing with someone who wants to die and like and like these shooters, when you look at what's happening with these shooters, like the guy in Vegas, that's an example of a lunatic, getting ahold of some technology and using that technology to wipe out a shit ton of people not caring if he's going to die. What if that guy was up there with a fucking Cuban sonic, dumdum beam just blasting people with this beam that's making them for the rest of their lives, have some kind of neurological impairment. What if that person, God forbid he was up there like dusting out smallpox that he printed up and his three d printer. It's like the creepy thing about it is Chris, that there is not a solution.

Speaker 2:          01:59:31       I don't even know how you, like we're looking at like huge chunks of the human population that believe that in this insane creator force that actually wants them to explode themselves. You know, they went in and like that, that shooting that just happened where the isis came in and just fucking executed a bunch of Sufi. He's, you know, and Egypt and Sufi Islam. Like that's, that's, you know, it's such a, it's like mystical Islam. It's beautiful. It's beautiful dancing. Yes. It's dancing and so, so we already have this kind of insanity bubbling up in different parts of the planet. So in that, and then you have white, the loner person who just for whatever reason decides to go and shoot up a church or whatever. This is all like Sam Harris arguments. This is Sam Harris believes in when it comes to like ideologies being incredibly toxic in that form. Yeah. They can be, they can be. Yeah. They can be. I want to start a fight with Sam Harris, but I like him. It seems like a fun thing to do. I'm going to get you a few of your. Hey Mr.

Speaker 2:          02:00:39       logical focus, I'll get you for your focus being right all the time. No, no, but, but the um, the. Yeah man, this is like a, this is ai is a big problem, but also the fact that the current ai that we're running, the human operating system is like already fucking up in this kind of intense way. It's, it's. I don't know what the solution is. No one can really even think about it, but it's, it is going. It's a problem in the most intense way. Well, here's how easy the ais to hack Donald Trump who's never been religious at any point in his life ever now is able to say, God bless America and everybody starts clapping and they believe that he believes that God is blessing of America, which has never been a part of his thought process. Right? That's right. Like there's a giant history of Donald Trump interacting with the world. Never were. Was there any proselytizing, right? There's never any espousing or have any religious doctrines

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       are talking about the greatness of Christianity. But now he does it and because he's in this position where you have to believe it. We accept that new variation in his speech, the now he brings God into the equation. We never brought God into the equation before.

Speaker 7:          02:01:53       That's so creepy, man. The way you just said, I didn't know what you're talking about because I'm like, trump definitely didn't hack any fucking ai, but now I hear what you're saying.

Speaker 6:          02:01:59       Yeah, yeah. He's, he's tapped into this human ai acquire their requirement to believe in supernatural beings that are looking out for us. That's a requirement in 2017. You cannot. Like if Chris Ryan wanted to run for president, one of the real issues, it would be as I can't trust an atheist. Right? Oh, I think that's gonna be the least. I just read your book. We got to sit down and talk is I'm not some crazy polygamous monkey person. Be My first press conference would be a doozy. Let me tell you. You're great.

Speaker 7:          02:02:34       Yeah, man. That's that. So that, that is the problem is the human ai. We're getting better at hacking it. You know that. This is. I don't think it was St Harris who said it though. It might've been. Maybe it was Elon Musk, he was saying everyone thinks the problem with a, with ai is that it's going to be robots killing people, which is one part of it, but the real problem is that the ai is going to be able to start hacking the human operating system and we kind of have already witnessed that with the twitter bots. So it's like you can produce the uh, uh, you can produce the illusion of a majority opinion using bots. So, and the more advanced right now you can usually, you can at least kind of tell what the bots are like. You go back and look and you realize the body has been tweeting every like five minutes and it's got like lists of people in it and it's usually tweeting memes and it seems to be

Speaker 6:          02:03:28       Ben have, you'd have to chase it down if you just looked at the comments itself after a post, like say if you're someone who opposes president trump and they've got trump bots that they use to go and attack someone who says anything bad about trump, you would just see the overwhelming negative response versus positive.

Speaker 7:          02:03:45       Yeah. Well yeah, but you could still, I guess what I'm saying is like right now there's a way you can tell something's a bot, but as ai gets better, you're going to start seeing. I've been thinking about this. You're going to start seeing these basically social networking farmers. So the idea's like I created a teenage bought in. I figured out a way to get it to create its own facebook account and for like, I don't know, six years, it just posts shit on its own facebook account. Giving the illusion that this is a living thing. Now if I could do that with 7,000 of these teen bots, so now I have a, have a bought swarm of 7,000 ais that all have facebook accounts, twitter accounts, instagram accounts that they've been somehow populating with bullshit content for like seven years. So now no one can really even tell if it's a person or not. I've got a really

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       super powerful weapon and so I think that's what's the real creepy thing with ai is. And, and you know, you've seen that shit that popped up on the Internet. The ability. Here's a road in the day. Look, we just made it look like it's winter now. We just made it look like it's nighttime now. We just made it look like it's whatever, anytime of year that we want we can make. It's going to get to the point where we can make a person look like they said anything and you're not going to be able to tell the difference. And then on top of that, that's here. By the way, I think it was radio lab or something that did a podcast here. It's close. It's discernible, but it's getting close. So. So we're talking about reality video and audio. Yeah, it it. It's reality bombs where you're going to be able to bomb a culture with ai produced the illusion of anything that you fucking want, whatever you want, but in dme and people are gonna, believe it, but devil's advocate here.

Speaker 2:          02:05:33       Haven't we been doing that for a long time? Isn't that what a laugh track is? A studio audience, but it's creating the illusion of community of a bunch of people that believe a certain thing that react certain ways and that manipulates the hordes. Bernays wrote about this in the twenties about manipulating and effective. It's already been in its rudimentary form. Now imagine a super advanced form of that and what you're looking at is like the re one of the real problems of ai that maybe is more problematic than robots going so fast. You have to use a strobe light to see them. We're talking about people no longer if you believe that anything in the media or on the Internet is real or if you've been trying to like establish your concept of what the universe is or the world is based on the news based on the Internet and people have been doing that for a long time with newspapers and shit.

Speaker 2:          02:06:25       Then we're going to enter into a phase in human history where that is no longer necessarily a way for us to gauge what reality actually is because we're not even gonna know fucking humans are creating the content. We're not going to get to a certain point in time where we're not going to know if someone's human. Yeah, blade is a real thing that's going to happen. Yeah. That's not far away. They have some pretty God damn convincing robot heads now in Japan. Sex robots looking pretty good. They don't look too bad and we're. We're getting real close. We're getting within 50 years away from an indiscernible artificial life form. Buddy of mine had a wet dream recently. He's in his forties and he had a wet dream where he was having sex with two revolutions. Sex robots. Oh yeah, for sure. And that chicken, even though you could see right through her legs, she was clear. She had clear arms and shit. You still fuck shit up. Beautiful. She was nice to you. How do you know what is real? I mean, if it interacts with you, if you're talking to a premier shit, here's where it gets really interesting is like there's this mystic name Gurdjieff, and he called people spiritual

Speaker 7:          02:07:36       machines and so his thing was like most people already are. Robots are automatons and the sense that most people when they're doing anything, whatever the thing is they're doing, it's imitation. So when a person like you know, does any, the way a person, a person who's acting cool, right? Usually the person who is acting cool has Emma is learned that from something. It's all limitation. It's all autopilot already. So most human beings, they're not even autonomous at all. Like how most of it, most people will spend like three fucking days completely up in their heads. Not even knowing where they're at. I mean, I know I've been in that situation where like sometime will pass and suddenly I'll be like, wait, what the fuck? I've been in my head for three days straight. I'm running on autopilot. What's going on here man? That's like, how many people are.

Speaker 7:          02:08:31       They wake up in the morning, they get their coffee to get in a car. They go and do their thing. They come back, they go to bed. They barely even know what they're doing. Momentum, momentum. Right? So, so we're already dealing with a kind of organic robot, a meat machine that's barely even aware of what it's doing, you know, which is why I think, and I know you and I talk about Christ a lot, I'm going to bring it up on your show. Again. When Jesus is being crucified, I think one of the most poignant things and the new testament is when Jesus is being crucified, he looks out and he says, father, forgive them. They know not what they do. And a lot of people interpret that as being like they don't know I'm Jesus, but I think what he's really saying is they don't know what they're fucking doing, man, period. Period. They're just on autopilot. They don't know what they're not. They're barely sentience yet. Termites in the mountain.

Speaker 6:          02:09:21       Now let's think about what we were talking about earlier when we're talking about a 50 year old who's trying to grab it. No, no, I didn't know if you were passing it. Give them some of that shit. When we're talking about 50 year olds or 50 year old movies, you know those old movies where men smacked women and grabbed them and and how you're seeing these big changes in the way people behave. Now let's go 2000 years ago. Let's, let's, let's go way back before written things right, and let's go back before anybody knew how to write things down or read and let's imagine

Speaker 7:          02:09:53       like what is that? Ten thousand years ago, crypt 15, that was eight for writing rudimentary writing.

Speaker 6:          02:10:00       It's all. It's all insane. If you really think about the amount of raw change that's happening in our life, just what's going on right now with this whole me too. Movement, the sexual harassment and sexual assault, an outing of all these predators, all of this stuff. I'm good. Just put all this stuff that's happening now, is this, they get accelerated evolution, accelerated cultural compatibility like accelerated understanding of it. Almost like a, a new,

Speaker 8:          02:10:35       a new version of equality because it used to be that like you could fuck your employee because your employee couldn't say anything. Right? Right. They couldn't do anything. Well, now they can. Now everybody can and now other people find out about you and now it becomes an issue. It's all forced and so now we're going to change the way we think about behaving now and our standards going to change because our standards have radically changed from a thousand years ago. Radically changed from 2000 years ago and radically changed from the 19 fifties. If you look at the 19 fifties and we see it in uniquely, so in the 19 fifties is that we can see it in the form of mainstream media films. You can read about it in books, but seeing it visually in films, it's so shocking and stunning and you see just the way people interacted with each other and you just think about if someone from like 1950 tried to exist today, it would be hilarious.

Speaker 8:          02:11:26       Would be hilarious. Just watching them try to interact with everybody with phones and all the studies. They literally would be like a person from a foreign world that's going to be us a hundred years from now. One hundred years from now this world will be indiscernible. It's going. The technology is like literally a yellowstone about to blow up the entire country that literally about the super volcano, the whole world, and no one is prepared for the consequences. We just assume that the paradigms that exist today are going to remain and that it's just going to get better. It'd be easier to text people. No, no, no. This, this paradigm did not exist 2000 years ago. This world, the world, the way we operate and communicate and even get around. How about the way we get around? How about this hard surface and these metal boxes of rubber tires and now fucking drive themselves.

Speaker 8:          02:12:16       I mean we. We're at the. We're at, we're in the middle of it, but we're also at the gate to like insanity, pure, absolute world changing and sandy from DNA with Crispr, they've just started injecting it into live people. Now, some guy with some incurable disease allowed them to Guinea pig on him. What if he gets fucking cured? Right? What if people figure out a way to get smarter? What have they developed? Crispr telekinesis modules where they can insert them into your fucking head and use it, works off your own body's electricity and they never run bad and we all talk to each other through our minds and then in school they have to teach kids a new language, a universal language that's not not phonetically based, so people stopped talking. So our heads grow big. Like aliens are. Miles shiver up just like the aliens.

Speaker 8:          02:13:04       That's what the aliens. That's what that. That archetype is. That alien archetype is like what we know we're going to look like. If we keep going, we're all going to be like a merge of colors because that's problematic. All that Dick Stuff. That shit just gets in the way. Dude. Your your database now on your brain. Sure. Well, I liked this is the way Mckenna talked about how like what he say octupus like that. Like all the limbs, like they build the. It has to communicate with body language is so much more profound than it's like. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       Not only are we not going to have this form, we're going to be able to decide any form we want, any form, any form, anything you want to be, want to be a fucking octupus. Theoretically you could be an optimist if we get. If we get to that point, if we get to that point also nuclear arsenals, nuking ourselves or without like actual yellowstone or without like sending out. Maybe we just haven't produced, you know, we're, we always are scanning this guys for radio signals or that's what we used to do, but maybe we haven't even produced a signal than an advanced civilization would identify as being something that would come from a civilization. And the moment we do it, the moment somebody at cern or somebody at Darpa produces some kind of beam that emanates from the planet. It just summons a, just a fucking legion of like crafts that just want to enslave us, you know? You know what I mean? It just like the first little like boop, and then they're ready to harvest them.

Speaker 6:          02:14:29       Weirdest thoughts that I've ever had about interacting with other aliens or other life forms for another planet is not that it's a signal, it's not that like you you'd like, but you can go to a place that you can transform, like whatever your consciousness is into something that can travel to different dementias and that these things exist in dimensional planes as much as they exist in physical locations, so maybe it's got a physical location of a hundred billion light years away or whatever the fuck it is. Right? Yeah, but it's also right here. Yeah, like in that it's all tied in together. Like there's this really rudimentary crude physical distance space that we operate in on a daily basis because we're still as advanced as we are for earth. We're still fairly low level in terms of the ability to spring forth and entire universe from something the size of the head of a pin, which is what the Big Bang is, right?

Speaker 6:          02:15:22       So some insanely complex webbing of just insane distance plus potential life forms and different styles of, of, of, of life that could exist and all these different planets. Hundreds of billions of known galaxies in the universe. It's so big. Lawrence Krauss tried to explain to me the size of the universe and he changed the way I looked at it because he said it's not that we know for sure that the universe is 13 point 7 billion years old, but that's as far back as we can see with what we have now. And he was saying that time that he was trying to make some distinction between the amount of time it would take to go back more than 13 point 7 billion years in that time literally moves faster than that and that you can't detect it after what we're not. We're, we're very limited in our ability to detect things after a certain space. So he's not necessarily. The Universe is only 13 point 7 billion years old. It might be infinitely old.

Speaker 2:          02:16:27       It's like that's as far as we can see what their. So we assume

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       that's all there is.

Speaker 8:          02:16:30       Well that's what they have to operate on. What they can prove now. Right? So this is what they're saying. What we can prove now is that light is the light. We're getting is 13 point 7 billion years old or the radio waves that indicate that there was some sort of an explosion, but all of it is like super sketchy man. They're writing things down on a little legal notepad. They're all agreeing with the math and looking at it and they're way fucking smarter than me, so they're probably right about a lot of stuff, but it's entirely possible that just we don't have the ability to detect how much further it actually goes back. Might have this whole faulty assumption of this initial beginning of the universe might be bullshit. There might literally not have ever been a beginning because it has always been here. Right?

Speaker 3:          02:17:14       Well, in my area they've been saying anatomically modern human beings have existed for 200,000 years. That's what everybody, including me, rights in the books, you know the accepted wisdom couple months ago they found remains in Morocco. That seemed to be about 300,000 years old that appear to be from anatomically modern human. So it's like, oh, well. So when you say something goes back while you've had Graham Hancock on a lot, right, where you say something goes back a certain amount of time, often what you're saying is that's how far back we. We found something for that. We can detect it in the case of the space exploration.

Speaker 8:          02:17:47       Insane. And here's what's really insane. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt. Let's go half a million. That's not. Yeah, it's a blink of an eye. A half a million years ago. We were literally some kind of eighth thing half a million years ago, right? Yeah. Well we, Australia pithy, that gets 2 million years ago.

Speaker 3:          02:18:05       Australopithecus, you know, I stick with anatomically modern humans, which is why that really jumps out at me. But yeah, I'm not real clear on Australia, Perth, the kiss and Cro Magnon. And uh, I know neanderthals lived up to about 40,000 years ago. Can interbred with human.

Speaker 8:          02:18:21       How crazy is that one? Yeah. So that means there was some sort of like cultures, there was some sort of like villages and shit back then. Now stop and think how crazy that is. And we're, we're, we're talking about like Mesopotamia or mayor or a rack, we're talking about these incredibly advanced for the time civilizations that are like the oldest known modern style civilizations, early 6,000 years old. I know. It's crazy. It's so crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:18:48       And the other thing, I actually had an idea for a book which the rate I write, I'll never live to write it, but the idea is to look at the known unknowns in science, right? Because there are things that are you elucidated and example earlier where it's like, look, that's how far we can detect that doesn't mean that's how far it is. So we know, we don't know that

Speaker 8:          02:19:08       there's a lot of arrogance in the assumption that we have all the data when it comes to the civilizations to like how old they are. Like who you're, you're weird going into 6,000 years, you're not getting a lot of stuff when you go for thousand years before that you're getting way less stuff. You go 4,000 years before that. You might not have any stuff left. Right? Right. There might be like some shards of metal that you can explain and you can carbon date those anyway. Right. And I think rock you can carbon date. You need like physical things later, like living right, like you need like wood or food for carbon, carbon dating. Is that how they're doing it still? No, I think there's a, there's some other, uh, isotope that they're using that they don't need the carbon, the carbon is accepted and the other one's quite new.

Speaker 8:          02:19:51       It's pretty fucking crazy. They were so smart, not us obviously, but someone out there is so smart. They could take a piece of something and tell you roughly how old it is. That's fucking nuts. And apparently gets a little screwy in places where there's higher levels of carbon and there's like some weirdness to it, especially initially when it was first invented, but just the fact that that exists, that someone could say, oh, well we found out that the dinosaurs died 65 million years ago. You're like, what the fuck? Do you know that Chesney fuck? Did you figure that out? And and meanwhile, probably a hundred years from now, they'll have something that'll tell you that day the asteroid hit, they'll, they'll show you like a model of the Yucatan before and after. You'll be able to watch it with the HTC Vive, put it over your head. You'll be able to literally watch an accurate representation of that giant.

Speaker 8:          02:20:46       Was it five miles wide? Yeah. The crater. The action asteroid itself that killed all the dinosaurs. Yeah. I want to say it was five miles wide, but it might be making that up. Five. Imagine five mile wide city slamming into the earth, going 45,000 miles an hour from space and you could watch it all take place in virtual reality. That's going to happen. You gotta be able to see it. You're going to literally witness the people coming off the mayflower and clubbing native Americans and raping them and killing them. You will be able to literally see westworld. You Seen Westworld? Yeah. Yeah. It's intense, but I mean, I think that they're going to be able to recreate things in. As computing power gets more and more power. The only real problem would be things that really prehistorical in terms of like cultural things, maybe not like physical animal things, but as far as like things that people did or didn't do because they vary so much, it'd be so hard to pin down without real accurate like images and videos, but from here on out, from here on out there, they're going to be able to have recreations of things that happened that are going to be indistinguishable.

Speaker 8:          02:21:55       They have images of all of us. Everybody has a facebook page. Everybody has a picture of you. Alright, so the 300 billion, whatever it will be in 100 years, 320 million people that exist in this country right now. There's a probably a picture of everybody that that was not the case a hundred years ago. Right? In the future, there's going to be some sort of a three dimensional version of you that you use as an Avatar and you three d games and that's going to look exactly like you and they're going to be able to make something that literally recreates

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       moments in your life. Well, they're gonna. Be able to like take your social thumbprint. They're going to be able to theoretically they could scan all your instagram posts or facebook posts, all your tweets, even your podcast, analyze your voice, get an idea of your personality, construct some kind of massive amount of data, feed it to an ai, say create a personality based on this person, here's their picture, animate the picture and now you've cloned yourself in ai is like basically imbued all the data that exists and has been used to imbue an image of you with your personality and now you are living in some kind of simulator, which means that you're going to be able to anyone who has ever had their picture taken and as some kind of data out there to establish some kind of personality. You're gonna. Be able to use that to make a.

Speaker 2:          02:23:14       to simulate individuals that have lived in the past and do it. It's going to get really interesting ethically because it's like, all right, let me fucking take. Like, I dunno, he's somebody out there with like a huge social. Like, let me take Taylor swift. Right? I'm going to take her. I'm gonna have my ai produce a mini Taylor swift and I'm going to drop her into like a simulated reality filled with fire breathing scorpions to see what Taylor swift would do if she was like running through some doom simulator. They're gonna have to come up with laws about this, which is like you don't, you can't duplicate, you can't duplicate without permission. You know, talked about them on the podcast before with robots. We were like, what's going to stop you from making a replica of say Jennifer Lopez for a sex robot? It looks exactly like Jennifer Lopez and is that a violation of her?

Speaker 2:          02:24:04       You go over, you know, you go to the store and you could literally buy a Jennifer Lopez fucked all. It looks indistinguishable. You take it home and you fucked Jennifer Lowe more like, more than likely it's going to be. You're going to have some kind of like what you would have, I guess would be some kind of generic looking fucked all, but you put ai goggles on or augmented reality goggles on it projects, whoever you want onto this thing. So it's like you don't have, you don't, you wouldn't go buy a fucked all based on a celebrity. You would just have some kind of like basically a screen in the form of an android that your augmented reality would project a person onto that. So it kind of in love. Yeah. Yeah. Well I mean that's the, that's where it gets a deal person on doesn't want. And that's where it gets really fucking weird is that's the other thing that you're going to be able to do is you're gonna be able to sit across from someone and project onto them. Anyone that you want so that no longer you know, you'll, you'll be talking to western Winston Churchill, your girlfriend. Exactly. You and I could, could cope project something onto Joe. Could be like a game we'd play together. Yeah. Well especially if we all decided to live in virtual reality and if we spent most of our time alone in a room, but we felt like we were all hanging out together and the feeling is indistinguishable than being in a physical location. Right.

Speaker 9:          02:25:24       This is going to be a lot of that going on, man. Then you don't need a body anymore. We're going to get super close to the alien thing, man. We're going to engineer big giant heads and we're all going to exist in there. There's going to be htc vives built was no more atmosphere. We're going to blow out the atmosphere. So we have built in sunglasses. That's why the aliens have the big black eyes. Those are like bill built in ray band. Wayfair's. Yeah, dude, I think it's brought to you by ray ban skin that doesn't get cancer. It's bulletproof to figure that out. Don't you think this is like when you, when you smoked DMT and I've never smoked dmt and I never would do any illegal psychedelic, but let's say that I had, let's say that I had recently done it at like, I don't know, burning man where no one's doing drugs there anymore, but let's say that I had done it there, but I, they're so confused anymore. Back in the old days, it was like, so making up that I had had that I had a crazy

Speaker 2:          02:26:22       man where, uh, I looked down after drinking this very strong mint tea and I saw this, I saw this fucking, I don't know, it looked like a, it was a look, kind of like a cow or something, but coming out of it, it had this long neck with like a technological lantern hanging off of it. And I'm looking at that thing. And what's interesting about dmts, you look away and he looked back now fucking things still there, man. It's just right there. I'm like, what the fuck got sucked through this tube into this beautiful, beautiful domed structure. Oh Man. It was so pretty and it was just spinning with potential. It's just pure potentiality and I'm looking at this incredible thing. It's technology for sure. I mean, whatever. This was the way my brain was interpreting it as like, this is technology. Like I'm looking at some kind of super advanced simulator or some kind of machine that is like simulating realities and I'm looking at it.

Speaker 2:          02:27:26       It's like, my God, it's just so much potential here, but I thought to myself, I'm going to miss my friends if I have to hang out in this place, because the interesting thing about dmt is that there's a sense of, or I've heard other people report this, a sense of incredible familiarity or you're like, I have been here. In fact this is home, and then you realize that feeling of coming home is actually this is that it's not even close to the feeling of being at home here and I'm looking around at this and thinking, yeah, but my friends, my friends, what about all my friends? I'm going to, I'm in this space, I'm going to miss them, and that thing, it doesn't talk to you, but it's like, might as well be a voice is like, oh, oh, you can always go back there and then I open my eyes and I'm back at burning man, hanging out with my friends and that's when I realized, Oh fuck, I get reincarnation, man.

Speaker 2:          02:28:15       I get it. This thing you're talking about the simulator that is going to happen sometimes after having taken psychedelics. You think, no, no, no, it's already fucking happened and this thing that we're in right now are alive. The idea of reincarnation is you die and then you become a goat or something crazy like that larva slug, but what if it's that you die. You pop into that dmt realm and you get to jump back into your life at any frame of your life that you want to. You can. You can actually repopulate your life or reincarnate your life at any moment. So you die. You become the universal superintelligence and then you gaze back into what happened, and usually it's like in Buddhism they say the cause of suffering is attachment. That that what you're attached to that life, this thing you just were this fucking interdimensional temporal worm that burrowed through time with every action that you took and you're like, yeah, well you're just.

Speaker 2:          02:29:10       You. You're like, I want to go back. I want to go back to this moment right now, and I was podcasts when my pals doing a shrimp parade and then boom, there you are. You're back back in your life. So in any given moment, you could be reincarnating a million fucking times. You could just be like always coming back to any frame of your life that you want. And anyway, this is what came to me out there in the desert. And I was thinking, oh, I get it. It's not like you reincarnate into other life forms. You keep repeating your life, but it's not a circle. It's a spiral hopefully, because each time you can improve a little bit more, you can improve a little bit more, make decisions that you normally wouldn't make. Which is why, like at any given moment, you know the big moments that come when you're around somebody and you're about to say some shitty fucking thing to, um, you know, your enemy, your whoever it may be that moment where you're like about to do the fucking thing you always do.

Speaker 2:          02:30:02       And you can feel it like you're. You feel this gravitational pull to the habituation. And in that moment you're like, you don't say the shitty thing. And that moment you discipline yourself, you control yourself. You don't do the thing. You've always done whatever it is. And in that moment, your life spirals up a little bit and now you're existing in like a completely new new, like essentially a new universe plan. What you hit a higher place. Exactly. That's kind of in a way that replicates what you talk about sometimes on your social media. I see on your instagram, like taming the inner bitch you have the thing. The other day he was like, you know, I really do not want to do this today. You know, you got up, you know, after you do the show the night before, whatever. And you did it. And at the end of it, by doing that thing you didn't want to do or not doing the thing you do want to do.

Speaker 2:          02:30:50       Conversely you do move to a higher level and feel way better use. And, and that. So that thing, that thing you, you, you instagrammed, um, which I think is super cool thing that you do because I think it's like, a lot of people need to like think, yeah man, I could fucking. Anytime I want. I could just start jogging and. But it's like you could like really, you could, you just start doing it. You don't even have to be good at it. You don't have to do anything. Could just make sure, make sure you do it. If you just do that, everything changes for the better. And that seems easy. It

Speaker 6:          02:31:20       seems so ridiculous. But you need to hear people say it and you need to hear someone say it. Who actually does it?

Speaker 2:          02:31:25       Yes. Now that you know Rupert Sheldrake, I think you might have had them on. Oh, cool. Okay. So you know his idea of the Ronnell and the timespace content, he calls it a runnel basically. So that feeling when you're like, fuck, I'm not going to have a writing. You're not just feeling your own, like, you know, lack of ambition or laziness. You're literally feeling. Now again, I don't believe it's just like a thought experiment or whatever, but you're literally feeling the gravitational pull of infinite lifetimes where in that moment you decided not to go running. You're actually feeling like the track that you've carved deep into the time space continuum by every time that moment appears you keep making, so when you actually do go, I'm going to go fucking running your kind of climbing out of this trench that you've dug into time over countless incarnations and when you do that and you're out there running, you're like in a new dimension. Now you're like, what the fuck? This is the dimension where I decided to go running and then that and that's why everything starts changing a little bit. When you make these decisions, big life changing moves. Those are good for you and for some people going out. Jogging can be a life changing move. It doesn't have to be some spectacular thing. It can be as simple as

Speaker 6:          02:32:37       taking a yoga class, deciding to take a yoga class twice a week or three times a week and change your life.

Speaker 2:          02:32:42       Calling someone who you've said some shitty thing too because they're. They did something wrong and a Po and being the bigger person apologizing instead of holding that stupid garage, calling them up and being like, Hey, I'm sorry. I was fucking mad. I love you. You're great. Instead of like carrying on with this stupid angry war carousel and the carousel. Anytime you make decisions like that, things get better so fast and then like, I don't know if you've noticed that there's, I've noticed like synchronicities start happening more like good luck starts happening. More like interesting things start happening.

Speaker 6:          02:33:20       Yeah, I think you, we, we, we fight against ourselves sometimes accidentally liked me when I was young. When I was young I would have an interaction with someone and then I would always imagine what they were going to say when we talked again and then I would imagine me talking shit to them and that I would imagine then getting upset at me and having a delusional perspective. I would like play out this weird play in my mind. I'm on. And then when I was in my twenties I started to realize how preposterous it was. Took me that long and I realized like I'm wasting all this time and I didn't realize it was crazy. I didn't realize other people did. I talked to my friend Brian once and he was saying the same thing. I go, you have arguments with people that aren't there. It goes all the fucking time, all the fucking time. I have arguments in my head with people that were there that's like sometimes you'll have a conversation with someone about something and then you both immediately are like relieved and start laughing because you were both expecting the other person to be like Super Mad and come in like an asshole, but meanwhile you're both

Speaker 8:          02:34:17       apologize and then it just goes away and then everybody feels way better. A better way. Better like conflict is stupid. What's not stupid is exercising out all the anxiety that your body possesses, that it creates conflict in the first place. Whether it's exercising it through meditation or through taking a yoga class or doing something physical. That just gives you some relief of stress because you exert yourself. It doesn't have to be anything crazy. Fucking going on a nice hike. You go on a nice hike, you get to see things and you feel better like you're walking. The blood starts pumping through your brain. You come up with great ideas when you hike, you know, it's like all these things are just little incremental steps at every one of us can take and you do that and it changes everything. Then you be nicer, nicer to people. That changes everything too. And it helps you to be nicer if you have control of your physical body.

Speaker 2:          02:35:08       That's it. And, and the, you know, the question that we're talking about earlier, it's like, what the fuck do we do about the lunatics out there? Well, what you do, man, you, I mean, if you can, you start with a fucking lunatic that you're sitting in right now. That's what you do. Absolutely. Lunatic. And then, and then, and, and, and, and that, I mean, that's, that's exactly what Rom da says is, uh, we work on ourselves so we can help the people next to us. And that's all you can do because you can't do shit, man, to make another person. You're not really gonna do much to the other people around you. They're going to do their own thing. They're going to decide. I mean, this is something I've been thinking fucking Jesus, because a lot of people talk about miracles and stuff, especially like in the camps I hang out with. Like Duncan says, I've been thinking about fucking Jesus.

Speaker 2:          02:36:04       No, I will. That's freaking. That's a different thing. Fucking fucking Jesus. Yeah, I would totally do it. It's a different thing that you've already done it. If you do DMT, I, but that's part of the experience. Making Christ, having intercourse with the Christ. It would be an honor through all pours. It would be an honor. You go together like you just merge. You just merged. You just merge. You're on your knees again at the video store. This guy, it's always dirty with him, but she never be just psychedelic, psychedelic love about Jesus. Just be on your knees choking on Christ. Come or not, but I can guarantee you can guarantee that's going to be a semi. A sex simulator for sure. My to Christ there. Sure, sure. Of the Virgin Mary. She was hot. These people, they talk about mirrors. Nice guys. Come on. I'm trying to talk about fucking miracles here.

Speaker 2:          02:36:57       So I know these people, they talk about miracles that bunch and like, you know, having seen some of these fucking gurus do crazy shit, but they always say it doesn't matter. Like ultimately these are dishes like fireworks, kind of. It's just like tricks. It's a firework. It doesn't because like the thing is like you could sit in front of someone and like levitate bottles in front of him, like levitate a bunch of bottles, teleport across the room, come back and then tell the person, you know, you're going to be a lot happier if you go jogging. Like someone could do that to me and tomorrow I'm gonna wake up. And I was like, yeah, he levitated bottles. He poured across the room. They told me I should go jogging, I'll probably go tomorrow. No fucking jogging. I don't care. They don't care the liver. So the, you know what I mean? It doesn't matter. None of it. None of the point is like if. So if a person who can levitate bottles probably isn't gonna, make you go jogging, then certainly you're not going to be able to talk to a person and be like, hey, you know you're going to feel better if you do this, you all you can really do is look at yourself and be like, you know what, I'm gonna go fucking jogging.

Speaker 8:          02:38:15       This is a really good point. What is, what's your take on this in terms of like the miracles in the Bible? Like some of the weirder ones like walking on water, like what do you do? What do you think that's about? What do you think like the. Even though the interpretation of those is kind of suspect, right? Like what isn't the walking on water is a weird one because I think it has to do with translation and I think that it could be interpreted in other languages walking by the water, like walking near the water could be thought of as levitating and walking on water polo and the preposition. Man. Yeah. It's so hard when you're going from ancient Hebrew and Aramaic and all this different shit. But do you think that this, what you're saying is that someone would do tricks to get you to listen to them, like you levitate things or walk on water or turn water into wine minds?

Speaker 8:          02:39:02       Moses splits the sea. Like what? Like, you know, I used to have a bit about that where it was like, um, like there'd be like 100 people standing behind him going, how long can you hold that? Like, what the fuck is he doing? Like why do you split the, Oh, we have to walk across that because that's going to take dates. I'm like, how's he doing that magic. Tell that silly motherfucker uses magic and make us a boat. It's crazy walking a mile high of on one side or the other. You just walking through the middle. Just fucking dead fish flopping around in the middle walls of water on either side.

Speaker 2:          02:39:38       Yeah. Very humid. Yeah. Fuck that. Well, I mean you're, that's all, you know, that's literal interpretations. It's something that's way deeper than. That adds a lot of deeper meanings. It's probably a, you know, it's a, it's a myth. They're using these encoded stories to try to get across something that's a lot bigger and it's isn't about really walking on water maybe. No, no,

Speaker 8:          02:40:00       but I think that these showing that the people that had all this knowledge also had magic tricks is very telling. Like the people that everybody would follow. They were. They were able to do things right. Like, well, how about the guy who I'm called upon a. She bear to kill these kids that were mocking him for being bald. That's a story that's in the Bible. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There was a man, I forget his name. You can find that story. He called a upon a. She bear and God brought down a sheet bear to smite these children that were making fun of is balding.

Speaker 8:          02:40:39       She asked, well, I think it was a female bear. They would. They would do cold. She bare back then to today, they were, I guess we'd call it a sow sow bear, but that this bear killed the kids because they were making fun of him for being, for being bald. Like what? Like, you know, there again, you have to listen to this guy. He's got magic is able to conjure up from the forest to kill mocking children. Yeah. They walk on water. They turned water into wine here. Why did God killed 42 lads merely for saying Alicia was bald?

Speaker 7:          02:41:13       Forty two lads. That makes it worse. Friendly. Or let's read the verse. Then he went up from there to backfill. Anyways, going up, by the way, young lads came out from the city and mocked him and said, damn, go app your bald. Head Up. You bought it. When he looked behind him and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the Lord. It doesn't say what he says in all caps too, by the way, like it's fucking twitter account. Tooth then to feet. Yeah, Lord. God. Then to female bears, came out of the woods and tore up 42 lads have their number. I thought it was too too. That's crazy. It knows to bears either one. She bear weight. What is this? So this is like actually exploring this. Why would God allow two bears to kill 42 young black, and it's written by a guy named Matt Slick,

Speaker 8:          02:42:07       probably doing porn right now, red liquid. It says, let's take a look. Bitch. You ain't taking nothing. You're just guessing. Alicia was traveling from Jericho to Bethel when a group of young men verbally accosted him. A 42 is a large number of people and they were probably an organized group, gone out to challenge the La show. Their mockery implied a militia to a malicious intent, especially when the culture of the time insisted on showing respect to their elders. Furthermore, the statement go up. You bald head has cultural significance. First of all, go up in parenthesis is a probably a reference to a licensed predecessor Alijah ascending to heaven. In other words, they are stating that when Elijah got, oh, they want to lie Shangaan, it's, oh, this is just so ridiculously intense. Elijah had gone on to the next world. The implication is they wanted [inaudible] dead. Also, the epitaph, bald head was one of contempt in the east end. Quotes apply to a person who, a person, even with a bushy head of hair lepers had to shave

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       their heads, is such a statement, could easily have been deliberate, malicious insult, something dangerous. And um, yeah, so it's such a weird interpretation of what it is. Either way you sent bears to kill people for marketing your fucking head because you're saying it's okay if they were being disrespectful, that God would just call some bears. That this is the weirdest sort of a justification for attack by, by wild beasts. The creator of the universe is using a wild beast to attack because someone hurt with words. Have you read the book of Job? Nothing since I was like, it's so. It's a whopper men. So it's the story of this Guy Joe, who's like prosperous. He's in love, he's married, he has three children and lots of animals and land and everything's going great. And so up in heaven or in wherever they are, God and the devil are having a conversation and God is saying, look at how great I am, how everyone loves me.

Speaker 1:          02:44:07       And you know, look at Joe. He loves me. He worships all the time and all that, and the devil says, of course he does because his life so good take away is a sheep and see what he says. And God's like, alright, so he kills all job. Sheep and job goes to church and worships and no problem. And then the devil's lake. Yeah, but if you took away the cows and the land there, then you'd see. So God goes, it takes away the cows and the land and it goes on and on until job is totally destitute. All of his family is dead. He sitting on an ash heap with boils all over his body. That's how far God was willing to go, to prove a point to the devil. Jesus Christ. Remember that part? Didn't. He continued to love God. That's a crazy story. Sorry, let me just finish.

Speaker 1:          02:44:58       So then what? So then God wins the bet. Whereas tortured this dude and he gives back twice as much as everything to job to reward him. So now he has 400 sheep and one in six children. And it's like. So it didn't matter who those children were that you killed. And the wife, you just give them another wife and more children. You're better. Maybe had a little time machine spun it all back. I mean he did create the universe. He could do whatever the fuck you want. That is kind of like the part in job. That's. I mean again, literally. Yeah, it's fucking ridiculous. But it's not supposed to be stories that are meant to like encompass the human predicament and like one of the cool things in there isn't there? This great line where job is like questioning why he would job is questioning him too or something. He said something. Oh yeah. Yeah. He, they get into an argument. Response is something like I created. Yeah. Where were you when I created the heavens and the earth? And this is again man, the fucking tone. And at this debt, this tribal desert religion is really harsh and patriarchal. But the message behind it, it's pretty similar. The bhagavad Gita, which is

Speaker 7:          02:46:10       just a fucking battlefield where Krishna turns into that universal form is the quote ob Oppenheimer's quote, behold, I have become damn become the destroyer of worlds. And so it's a similar thing. Both of these are saying, listen, tiny little human thing all caught up in your life, so fixated on everything about you. You exist within the infinite span of time. A Big Bang to go with something like we were saying longer than 13 point 7 billion years. You tiny, tiny little thing. You exist in something so infinitely gigantic and beautiful. What do you think you control? What do you think you really control? You don't control shit. You don't control anything, so that's what they really. It's more of like when when we experienced inevitable catastrophe in our lives and we're looking around and like, what the fuck, man, what the fuck's wrong with the universe? It's like nothing's wrong with the universe. Nothing's wrong with you. Nothing's wrong with anything. In fact, everything's perfect. Just surrender to it. Even if you're sitting in the goddamn ash pile covered in boils, if you just let go and surrender and drop the bitterness, then you can. If nothing else, not suffer under the terrible weight of the resistance or feeling like a victim. That's, to me what I get at a job, you know, from the non literal level, the literal level. It's like God's hanging out with Satan, so they played poker and shit.

Speaker 8:          02:47:40       What does that mean? Like he just drops by like Satan sometimes just pops by wherever God lives and they make bets. They make beds. It's ridiculous, but it will suffer for God's bet like fear factor when you think about it. No, you got paid for Fairfax. Perfect. If you. When you made $50,000 job, the government takes a piece out of someone winning naked and afraid or any of those shows. Government takes piece. That's crazy. You're out there choking on bug. Dick's trying to make banana hammock out of literal banana leaves for Dick by love or biting you everywhere. It's so ridiculous. Those shows are so ridiculous. It's amazing. They haven't killed anybody. It is Kong. How come nobody's gotten bitten by spiders and died or some shit? Some people get super sick on the show. Oh yeah. Well they eat fucked up things. By the way, some of this stuff, if you eat things and don't cook them, those parasites can stay with you forever, so I don't do Sushi.

Speaker 8:          02:48:42       Sushi is not bad if you get ocean Sushi, but I've been told not to eat salmon. I've been told, yeah, someone said that. Freshwater Salmon. The problem is salmon is a freshwater fish as well. They go, they migrate to go to the ocean and they go and they're susceptible to some parasites apparently that a tuna and a lot of ocean born fish isn't susceptible to because I guess the parents don't. They just live way easier and fresh water, which makes sense, right? Yeah. Also the salmon stop eating and their metabolism changes once they get back to fresh water and so essentially they're dying from that point on, you know, so when you see them upstream there, they're like zombies. It's really gross. Sushi is a really nutty thing when you stop and think about it, right? Because here we are, we're, we're like on these little landmasses surrounded by a blue.

Speaker 8:          02:49:36       Like as soon as you get to the edge, you realize how much blue there and you're like, Holy Shit, that's all water. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll just so accustomed to it. No big deal. It's just water. So. No, no, it's this thing is mostly water. We're on the dirt spots of this thing. That's mostly water. Yeah. Well we do is we take these metal boxes and we float out there and we grab whatever is live and we scoop it up with nets and fucking bring it in Bro. It's great. We serve it with a little bit of Jalapeno on top and some ponds do sauce. You're gonna. Love it and we're just extracting the fish out of the water ever. Just pulling them out. It's the only thing like it in terms of that fact that we're not dealing with farmed animals were scooping up wild animals.

Speaker 8:          02:50:19       We don't allow that anymore in the United States, like the United States, you don't use the age to have market hunting for buffalo and for elk and for deer. You're not allowed to do that anymore. That's illegal. Now. Wild game is wild, but not wild fish, wild fish. You can commercially farm, you could commercially cultivated and harvest you go out there with giant fucking nets and just scoop up wild creatures in the middle of the ocean because we don't have good regulations for the fucking ocean. So 80 percent of what you bring up that you killed. Oh yes. Throw it over. We're just draining that thing. We're draining and it's wild. It's a wild thing. If like we, if anybody tried to propose that today with like elk, someone said, we're just going to get nets and just run through the forest and gather up all the elk and then we're going to sell it at the ELC store.

Speaker 8:          02:51:07       You'd be like the fuck you are right the fuck you are, man. Those things are wild and kill all the Iraqi tunes and squirrels. So you're decimating the environment and monkeys, they, you know, the, the nets are super a work. They work really hard, you know what I mean? Pulling through all that water. Two or three trips, they cut them loose. They don't pull them back up to the boat and recycle them. They cut them loose. So oceans are full of drifting nets, miles wide, just going on and killing more and more shit until they finally say no. Yeah. Because as you say, it's this kind of wilderness now where it's unregulated largely and there's no way to look at it and see all that Shit, you know? Holy Shit. Yeah. It's really freaked me out. Just thinking of the sheer numbers of nets drifting through the water and landing on the ground. I know that because a friend of mine was working with a guy who was, if I remember this correctly, it's in Chile, I think kyle who's a, he's a surfer,

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       goes around the world and does interesting research. And uh, he was in Chile and there was a guy starting a company that was created a market for those nets to encourage the fisherman to bring them back. And then he recycled that, that nylon, because it's a pretty high quality nylon. So the whole idea is he's, he's created a sustainable business selling these things made from the nylon that people know comes from the nylon. Wow. This is crazy. Ghost fishing. Yeah. So they just go around. Oh Man, I had a talking about Sushi. I had a really traumatic experience with that in Alaska that have I told you, you know, so I, I met this dude on the ferry going up. Really Cool Guy Ed from Oregon somewhere. He was camping next to me on the deck of a, the ferry boat and next to him was this really hot woman, Becca and Becca never changed her clothes in like three or four days on the ferry.

Speaker 3:          02:53:04       Really sexy but never changed her clothes. Never opened her backpack. She had this huge backpack. Finally it turned out it was full of weed. She was smuggling from Hawaii to Alaska. Yeah. Wow. So Ed sort of fell in love with her. We get to this town and we get off. I bet. Ads like all into fishing. Yeah, exactly. She's got it all bad. So anyway, he's super into fishing. His dream, his whole life has been to go to Alaska and fish. Wow. He's got this Super Nice Rod, carbon rod and all this stuff and I don't know shit about fishing, but we were in Petersburg, Alaska and we go out. I walk out with them. I'm a vegetarian, but anyway, he casts first cast. He catches the salmon, big salmon, brings it in and kills it with a rock and all that. And then another. He's super happy.

Speaker 3:          02:53:51       It's his dream. Everything's wonderful. We go back to this campsite where we are and there's like a maybe 10 tents around in this campground and it's central area with a fire and all that. And he so happy because he's going to feed everybody. He's got these three fish, he's feeling great and he's so he's got, you know, puts a onions and shit inside and the foil and all that. And everybody's hanging out. Everybody's super happy. He passes out the fish, he's got his own smaller one is for him. Everyone else is sharing the other two. And I'm sitting up behind him looking over his shoulder and I see movement in this fish and I'm like, hi. And we'd been drinking and it's firelight, but I'm pretty sure I see movement and I looked closer over shoulder and there's all these tiny little white worms at the center of the fish that hadn't been cooked out. And they're all just moving, moving like Sylvia. Right? Oh my God. How many of you had a bite already know I'm a vegetarian. Oh, that's right. At that point, right? So I didn't need any. And it's like the best night of his life. Oh my God. And I'm a. I got tell him. Yes, right. He's already eaten

Speaker 1:          02:55:03       half the fish. Oh Jesus. Oh. So I say, ed man, stop. Look, look at this. And he sees it and he's just like, oh fuck. He goes from the top of the world to the bottom, grabs this bottle of Tequila drinks half this bottle of Tequila it to try to kill what's in his stomach work. I don't know. It's a great idea. Probably would work guys. Thank you. It was just a good excuse to get fucked up and stub my toe. Kimmy. That Tequila quit. Got fired. Fuck you mean it. Tequila quick. Whatever happens. Tequila. I need half a bottle of Tequila on the devil. Will Tequila means cure all in Spanish. Oh man, got me to. Damn. Yeah, that's the worms are fucking scary shit, man. That guy that a ref. The guy who escaped North Korea, so they found enormous tapeworms in his body.

Speaker 1:          02:55:57       His body. He was like, I think they described it as a toy that had been broken, like it was just broken like all over the place, like legs are broken bones or broken. His insides are filled with parasites. You got nutrition or times or something. Yeah. Good shot four times here. The whole thing is horrific, man. That poor fucking guy, man. That poor fucking guy for Dune is falling apart. He gets short shot four times and he keeps running. Yeah. That's how bad he wanted to get free, I guess. Yeah, the videos and Naomi, you seen it? No, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's just making this run for it and they jumped out the car and they're shooting at me like really close distance while he's running. I mean, I didn't realize that they were that close to them. They were on the ground like 15, 20 feet away from him shooting at him as he's running, as he jumped out of his car.

Speaker 1:          02:56:43       You know, it's crazy. Is that video of that fucking dude from North Korea and the airport getting that poison put on him? No, I haven't seen that. Oh, Kim Jong. UN's brother? Yeah. Kim Jongens brothers video. The assassination. Watch it. It's why me is on it. It's pretty intense. What was it, seren? Is that what they put on him? I don't know what it was. Some nerve gas. They, they trick someone to doing that for them. Right. It wasn't a story. A defense of the people who did it. They're saying they didn't know, but apparently there was footage of them practicing it. Oh, Jesus Christ. That's him afterwards. That's him after getting zapped. But you can watch like a professional assassination. Yeah. Ready at the airport and apparently he had the antidote in his baggage. Oh Jesus Christ. This is the thing with the them having like Icbm Vieques, vieques that 20 minutes after VX poisoning. Just how nutty. I mean this is. This is some old school shit that they do in the Soviet Union to write a bunch of people over there have been killed with poisoned in London. Actually the. There they are

Speaker 1:          02:57:55       there right there. Just vx gas. Mr. Like puts a chloroform rag over his face. She just walks over and put the rag on his head and they're going to show another video where you watch just comes up behind him. Fluid is low. That's all it takes to kill you. That's fucking insane. And he's saying someone just put something on my face. Holy Shit. Yeah. That's insane. Yeah, it's not scary. Can't see that coming. So you stay in there and she just walks right up and jack. So whoa. She was fast too. That's intense, man. That's intense. So my buddy had got medivaced out of Petersburg with the worms in his stomach, intestinal bleeding. Jesus Christ. They were trying to burrow the way out. Yep. Eat his bones on the inside. This is your friend who drank that Tequila doesn't work to get rid of one. Killed them all.

Speaker 1:          02:58:56       He went to the doctor the next day in town and the doctor was like, yeah, it's probably no big deal. Whatever you'll be. Fuck you doctor. And then I left and traveled all around Alaska and then went back home and when I was home I got a letter from him that he had been medivaced out and had been in the hospital, had four or five surgeries. How many other people fucked up? I don't know if he'd lived a fish. You don't know if he lived. How many other people got sick? Just his story. If you just trust him, the other fish were fine. Could you go and find out for the story

Speaker 9:          02:59:27       so we know how we should feel. I don't like these open ended a fucking ed was. He lived in the country for old men type end. They lived happily ever after too, to tell you guys seen that video. That cam girl who's like a worm shoots at her ass, hope everyone seemed. Oh my God, we did. Jamie can know if it's on instagram. I haven't seen it. He squats down and it's like just the very tip of some kind of worm thing like pops out of her ass and sex back. Jamie seen this. Maybe I dreamed it. I'm pretty sure you might. It might not. How interesting is it that there's two completely different social media platforms that we all use?

Speaker 1:          03:00:20       Twitter and instagram and one of them allow straight up porn. Which one? Twitter. Twitter, a straight up porn on your feet and you see a chick just gagging on a fat dick taking one right in the ass right there, right at your feet and you're like, whoa. Yeah. I don't know. What is that? Instagram wanted to be show nipples, drills, blends, blurted, nipples out. Yeah. You got to put like little acorns is. What it's really interesting is because my eyesight's going shitty anyway, so if a girl is mildly billers or Nipples, to me it looks the same. So you're getting around

Speaker 9:          03:00:56       just getting around, playing the system built in system. No, for real though, how blurry does it happen? This is the question like would you see like a picture of my Dick? Right? If you have a picture of you sitting there and you want it to go on Instagram, you would that Hawaiian shirt on, Chris with your hog hanging out and you want to take a picture of slightly pixelate your Dick. He'll be like really clear where the head of it is, where the balls are, where the shaft is. Even the color of your deck will be very easy to start, but it's not totally your deck because it's all pixely. Oh there, look. Oh, okay. Show it from the beginning. I look. Watch a seems like a worm that's seems like she'd get parasites internally. Pixelation thing is one of them. Thanks for bringing that to our attention.

Speaker 9:          03:01:50       Not Be Real. I mean that wasn't the highest quality. That could have been like some CGI even more fucked up than CGI and worms and they cam girls assholes or. But if it was where I'm coming out of her ass hole, because you really suck it back in like that. I mean it's an asshole. It's not lips. It's like it sucked itself back in. Yeah. But you don't have a lung connected to your asshole. Like how much are you sucking? How much power does she have to get that Spaghetti back into her mouth? The wiring itself pulled its head back in. It was like, whoa. Another universe looking at me.

Speaker 9:          03:02:30       The camera. Fuck this. I know, right? She used to that steady. 90 six degrees. Yeah. It's cozy. Wow. How weird, man. That we can get those. I had a dog once, it had worms and when she would go to the bathroom, that's how I found it. I saw worms, inner poop and I saw worms like around her butthole and I was like, oh, someone's got a problem. And they do that as drag across the carpet will dogsled they eat everything, man, you know, they'll eat anything. They find a dead rat. They find a dead rat. They just start eating it and they'd get all kinds of fucked up things inside their body. Oh Shit, man. If you seen that documentary. Wait, he. God dammit. I can't believe I can't remember his name. He's the guy who like only ate McDonald's for Morgan spurlock. Have you seen Morgan spurlock's rats?

Speaker 9:          03:03:17       Yes. Yes. Oh my God. When they. When they dissect the rack and you see what's living in that thing. I about that bought fly that was in its neck. Literally like if you had a football grown out of your side of your neck. That's how big this Bot fly larva was. It's called red. It's on Netflix. It's called rats. It is fucked up and it's so good. So good. It's so good, man. But it is so deeply disturbing. The raw numbers that you get hit with you. Like what? Wait a minute. Is that real? Like when you, when you hear there's as many rats in New York City as there are human beings and you just go, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Really?

Speaker 6:          03:03:58       Yeah. There's the whole. That's from the butterfly larva. They pulled out of that things body. Jesus. Yeah, and they said that there were so many of them that they tested that have like terminal illnesses in them to just fucking everywhere to man and in New York they set this camera up while those garbage bags were being put out and you see the ratchet darn out of the sewer and then they stuck cameras down to sewer hose to find them and they learn about poisonous and they'll piss on it to warrant or they'll send in, didn't they? Didn't he say they'll send in like like Beta rats to the poison? Yeah, the sending Beta rats and they get stuck in traps and they get they poison and they'll sit back and they'll watch and you can observe them do this. They literally, yeah, they literally send the dumber or routes for their.

Speaker 6:          03:04:44       They're like all things we were talking about earlier, they're like a super organism, a rats. Rats are all basically the same shape and size. They vary a little bit bigger, a little bit smaller, but mostly the same thing. Who Look exactly the same and they behave like the same. They do, they all do the same shit and they all move into these and they're. They're happy to live with. Nothing else wants to live like we'll take it, we'll moving in and they move in and breed in a way that's unprecedented in terms of things that like mammals that live alongside humans, there's not a goddamn thing like rats, like no other animals figured out how to do it. Like Rats, k like they can do it in a way where this as many of them as there was a bus. Just imagine that there's smart.

Speaker 6:          03:05:25       His father must be a lot of cockroaches. Probably, I would guess more than there are rats, right? Sure. Because they're so small. Oh yeah, but those tools are like particular things. It's really interesting because people don't like to. They always want to think that they never. They never prejudge. They're not prejudice, but we certainly are. When it comes to rats and bugs. Butterflies are awesome. Butterfly landed on you. Everybody's psyched. Roche walks in the room, everybody freaks out. Wants to fucking stop it, get it. Get it right. Yeah. Mosquito comes in. Everybody's pissed. Spider walks in, AH, some people freak out. Some people want to help the spider. Yeah, man, when you see any kind of rat rats are no Bueno. Like to the core. You see that rat and you're like that. And a squirrel. Squirrels are cool. Just rats with bushy tail per well.

Speaker 6:          03:06:24       They don't eat meat. That's the thing about squirrels. Squirrels were eating acorns and shit. That is just a better animal, but they do eat meat sometimes. Here's the fucked up thing about animals, especially if there's, you know, they're sick or they have some weird nutrition requirement. There's a video of a squirrel eating a mouse and it's hard to watch. Man. The squirrel was holding onto this mouth mouse with its hands and just chewing into it. A fucking score. And you're like, Whoa, really? This is a real trusted you. Yeah, you're a fucking squirrel. You're supposed to

Speaker 8:          03:06:56       be super cool. I could feed you like you could. Like there it is. Look at it, but you always think, well you started it with the warm in the ass, but it's been downhill from there. I'm excited to look at that. It's insane because he doesn't have any problem eating that rap. He's watching a movie. It's like he's watching game of thrones, like enjoying some quickies devouring. It seems like it's like you holding onto a ham cream cone. Look at that because it's biting into it. Delicious. Looking at it. It's almost gone. Jesus. No, I dropped a big chunk. Oh, he dropped. So looking at these giant chunks of guts. It's consuming. He was hungry. This is amazing, man. It's too bad. The only audience he's bearing what's left of it. This is a ground squirrel. This is a different kind of squirrel. That might be why ground squirrels are a totally different kind of squirrel.

Speaker 8:          03:08:02       Ground. Squirrels are actually a real problem on ranches because they make millions. Yeah. They estimate to honed ranch is 270,000 acres and someone there told me, I didn't check this true, but just listen if it is told me that the biomass of these ground squirrels is bigger than anything else on the ranch because these tiny little things there so fucking many of them that all the deer, all the bear or the mountain lions, all the wild pigs, all the cattle that roam around there, all the elk, everything, every other bird, ground, nesting birds, Turkeys, everything. The biomass of those fucking ground squirrels was greater than all of it. He's like, I just want you to think about that for a second. I was like, what? He's like, we got a real problem with these things. He goes, you can't kill them, and they leave holes and then the cattle step in those holes and break their ankles.

Speaker 8:          03:08:54       You can't kill him because they're just too wildly where you gotta find them, sit out there with a pistol and you're going to shoot it like poison or is what he said. He said he shot one of them and when he shot it, another one grabbed it and dragged it into the hole to eat it. Dude. Eating it. Yeah. Not find out if ground nesting squirrels eat meat. If ground nesting squirrels are omnivores, I wonder if they have a just a totally different diet because the they have those gross tails to. They have almost rat tails. The gross little things. You don't feel good or when you're around them. That's why we need more snakes. Yeah. We don't need more snakes. We don't need more snakes. Snakes. Snakes are one of the only things that all babies are afraid of. Instinctively. Show an infant the new image of a snake and they'll just freak. Well, that's [inaudible] in the garden of Eden. The snake is what made eve eat

Speaker 9:          03:09:54       the tree of the knowledge of Jesus. True. He's right though. That's true. Snakes fault. Eaves a good chick. Most neotropic. Ground squirrels are omnivorous. Or you go. There you go. There you go. So they're eating meat. Ground oral sex. Caterpillar's crooked mice and make each other. Oh, they get in there and eat the eggs rather than asked. Yeah. Ground nesting birds. Ducks. Yeah. Eggs and chicks and ducks and birds. Mice. Smaller ground squirrels. Oh yeah. So squirrels. Ground squirrels are just little monsters. Yeah. That's why we feel bad about them. They're the little evil little mediators. So what? Coyotes, I guess probably get something. Yeah, but the problem is they dig into holes and the coyotes have a hard time catching them. Too dark to that fucking hole so quick. I don't think it's an effective method. I don't think they have a lot of effective methods of eradicating them other than like poison and shit.

Speaker 9:          03:10:47       If I had a guest. What about those? Rat Terriers in the spurlock shot? Remember that? God, it was amazing. They actually hunt rats. I haven't seen the film though. They tear these rats apart. They live for it. So they live for. They are in their glory when they let them loose with these terriers. Go correct. That's like Jack Russel terriers and that's why those little fuckers are so hyper because they're rat killers. It's like it's fucking dawn and the dad's like watching zombies them apart. It is the grab and shake. I'm so happy right now. This is the greatest thing that happens to these dogs is hunting. Fucking look at that and go, Oh yeah, look at the fucking rat. Try to get away. And they just shaking it. Whoa. That is amazing. Yeah. I guess the guys are helping them that they're digging them up.

Speaker 9:          03:11:36       Yeah. That's the idea. God. Laughter of children as you're watching her mother get ripped apart by monsters there in the dirt here and that. These, these guys are digging them out of the hole. And as they dig them out of the holes, the rats explained the dogs know that. Go to look for it. Yeah. Wagging their tails. There's so happy, dude. It's so nuts. It's crazy. You can almost engineer any animal. Oh, there's one. Got It. Got It. Jesus Christ moving. Yeah. And then what did they do? They're not eating them apart. They were tearing them apart. They're eating. Just like killing him. Well, they probably eat so much. They're stuffed now that just, uh, I'm sure they eat some of it though and that's a whole thing of that last one. It looked like he was bringing it over, like maybe they're trained to put them in a bag or something. That would be clutch. Maybe you got to do something with the body's a golden retrievers and stuff. Right. Then the ducks. Right. Why? Why, why are you so fascinated with this part in nature? Like sometimes I got to be careful with your feet, man, because it's like. I know man, if you like, if like you, I don't look at it. But yeah, inevitably if you tweet nature's, what do you say? Nature's

Speaker 8:          03:12:52       bitch. Uh, no. He says nature is. What do you say? What's the thing you say native friends are scary. Birch, something like that. If I see that I'm not watching this, she's going to be awful. Let's get. But why do you. Why do you? Yeah, why are you so interested in that aspect of nature? Well, super extreme, right? I mean this is an extreme event happening here. One life form is exploding on another life form and it seems like it's designed to do that. When you see a Jaguar, Kyla Cayman and grab it in the back of its neck and bite into a fucking crocodile and drag it in between its legs, up the beach to eat it. You're seeing one of the most extreme things that exists in the world. You're seeing a life form consuming another life form with its face, killing her, like eliminating it from us dimension with its teeth at a very specific part of its body and it seems like it's designed to do that and that's the only way you keep these populations and control the populations have a built in system and we want to look at it through the gobs of our civilization and through what we've accepted.

Speaker 8:          03:13:55       This is a pet and this is an animal that you eat and you never eat. Your pat and we have all these weird little sort of distinctions and cultural ideas that we've attached to animal life, but he watched them in their world. Their world is fucking. It's unbelievably ruthless, unbelievably ruthless. Like our ideas of animals have become so strange because we keep, some of them, we keep them around us and we feed them so they're like really sweet to us, but there's not a fucking animal in all of nature that is so sweet with the other animals around it.

Speaker 3:          03:14:31       Just many animals that are sweet with the other animals around them. All hurt animals for example. No, that's what I mean. Social, what I mean like Jaguars and antelopes aren't buddies. Well, when the Jaguar is eaton, he can walk right through the middle of the hurt and they won't even run away because they know he's not hungry. Oh, but that's so crazy to think that's like a murderer and kills one of your buddies and eat something. You'll be cool just wandering around that, but they're not visitors. They're eating. They're eating. Their interactions are incredibly ruthless when they wrap it, but see I. This is something I write about in this book I'm working on still, which is the lack of proportionality in this argument because what's your. This nature is ruthless red in tooth and claw thing. That's been very popular for a long time, but the real well it's real when it's real, but it's also real that we die in agony and often our agony is extended by medicine to last much longer than that mouse that just got eaten by the score. I'm fascinated by death by these interactions, but what I'm saying is that the, the conclusion to draw from those interactions that therefore nature is this battlefield misrepresents what actually happens in nature when predation happens, it can be nasty of. Right, but that's

Speaker 8:          03:15:50       what I'm saying. I'm not looking at the entire nature as a whole and making this distinction. This is the only thing interesting about nature. No, no, no. I'm saying when I just the depiction of nature as being ruthless. Well, it is in that moment that is nature and that isn't that moment and in that moment exists. The only reason why these predators can exist is because they have to be killing things all over the world. I mean, every place where there's a wolf, it means the wolf is alive because it's eating things, which means it's killing things all day long. I mean, that's not a. that's not an inaccurate depiction. The thing is there's so many things. There's so many elk exist, so many wolves. Most of the time the elk aren't getting killed by wolves, but wolves are killing an elk almost every store, so it's just a matter how you look at it. So it's just, it's correct to say diminishing the ruthless aspect of it because you're looking at the overall picture,

Speaker 3:          03:16:34       but. But I'm not diminishing it. What I'm saying is that that's one perspective on it and actually in terms of proportion, it's a minor perspective on it. For example, I was watching this nature thing and there were these seals playing in the waves and then the du Du du Du du Du du Du to start in this great white comes up and hits one of the seals and they slow it down to one 40th natural speeds. ORC. All right, well I think it was a great way. It may have been an Orca at same, same thing, and this seal lands in its mouth and you see a crunching the seal and the blood running down and the narration is nature is ruthless and there's the never ending struggle for survival and Yada, Yada, Yada, and so I'm looking at that. I'm thinking, how long do harbor seals live?

Speaker 3:          03:17:19       So I look it up. Online. Harbor Seals live about 25 to 30 years. I've seen a lot of seals lying around on rocks, having a good time not stressed out. I don't see a lot of high stress seals and so I think it's like, okay, this seal, let's say live 25 years. It's hanging out eating Sushi, having a good time. Then boom, it's dead so quickly that we have to slow this down to one 40th of normal speed so you can enjoy this death porn. That's a tiny sliver of that seals existence and we're depicting nature as this incredibly ruthless, horrible. We'll

Speaker 8:          03:17:55       bloody place. That's just inaccurate. Well, it's not in that moment. Not In that moment, but you can't ignore that in moment. No, of course not. That moment is the reason, but that moment is the reason why this seals population is controlled moment is the reason why the shark can. Oh yeah. It all has to be there. I agree with you, but I disagree with you. I agree with you. I see you're saying that there's way more going on than just as tooth Fang claw. I don't. I'm not looking at it from a moral perspective. I'm looking at it from a like a chaotic perspective. I'm like, it is fascinating. These to these schools of tuna that we scoop up with nets. They're out there, Jack and little fish. That's why they're in schools because they operate more efficiently that way and they're chasing down sardines and fucking them up and that's oftentimes how you catch fish.

Speaker 8:          03:18:39       When I was in, when I was a tuna fishing in Mexico, we're catching amberjack or skipjack, I forget, but you would find these pools of bait fish bullet going crazy on the surface of the water because the tune and were all ganging up on and Jack it up and then he got the Pelicans and top attack. Cc the birds and then you would see the froth of the water and then these fish would just. They'd go crazy and fuck up these little bait fish and you would literally just cast into this football field size swirling in the ocean and these fish would just bite it and you would just catch them up almost instantly so that that is not the whole ocean all the time, but that's still real. Like this is real. I'm not denying the reality. I'm talking to proportion. I agree, but the thing that I find the most fascinating for whatever fucked up reason is when the water, the water buffalo comes out the line and the line ducks under the water buffalo and grabs it by its neck and rolled it over and crushes it. Saying, I just, I am fascinated by the idea that all moral judgments aside nature has somehow engineered a Jaguar and a cayman, and then there's Jaguar looked at Cayman was like, ah, to figure out how to put that in me. And he snuck up, swam in the water, snuck up on a goddamn crocodile, shopped on its back. It's an equity. There's a lot of cool shit. I like watching. Jaguars is real. I liked watching Jaguars when they get ahold of psychedelic plants. Have you ever seen that?

Speaker 8:          03:20:10       There's a, there's this type of vine that's rich and dmt that Jaguars will chew on and then they literally just lie on their back and they're just staring out into space trip and balls like catnip for Jaguar. But if they think it's Psychedelic, they think that might be when you have all these Jaguar dreams, when people take Iowasca, it might be that the Jaguar is interfacing with the same dimension that you will. Oh, so that's the reason why. Because we know that these jaguars do take these psychedelic plants and we know that these psychedelic plants, when they were first discovered, they were trying to call. I'm harming, is uh, the, the uh, the chemical, but they were trying to call it telepathy theme was the same as harming. They had to run tests on it and find out that there was, it was already an established molecule that was an already established a compound.

Speaker 8:          03:21:01       So the reason why they call it telepathy was because people were experiencing group states of consciousness while they were taking this stuff, so they're thinking that these people that do Iowasca and have these trips with Jaguars, they literally might be interacting with Jaguars who were also tripping. Like I see this thing is just eating these leaves and lion dyads back clearly in an altered state, just rolling around on its back with its paws up in the air, staring at things that aren't there staring at. It's like in Brooklyn right now with a bunch of fucking people on some loft in Brooklyn with some fucking glass blowers. A couple of accountants. Its eyes dilate. It's mine's going back and forth. That is so fucking wild. I'm going to Peru in a couple of weeks. You're going to get down with the funky funky medicine plant medicine.

Speaker 8:          03:21:56       Yeah. Yeah. If the right situation presents itself, that's the thing, right? The problem and the people that say plant medicine, they all make go, oh yeah. They're like really into like other the plant medicine. You're like, okay, yeah. Okay. You might be cool if you used those terms all the time or you might be one of those fucking Weirdos. You know, there's, there's, there's a bunch of people that are into the psychedelic world that they know they would have been into the moonies if the moonies found them. Right. There are lots of different plants that they use though. It's not just Iowasca, so if you just use it as a general term there, San Pedro and all the time. I'm fully aware. It's just the people love saying it. Yeah. They love saying. I mean legally it's probably better to use the term plant medicine. It is so pretentious that aren't going to get you stopped at any borders.

Speaker 2:          03:22:44       Yeah, I think it's pretentious. Like I get it. I understand why you're calling it a plant medicine, but like when I'm getting stoned, I'm not thinking, let me take my medicine. I'm thinking, let me get. I want to get fucking high man. I wanna I wanna like get high play with synthesizers. When I'm like, when I'm taking Roba Tesson I'm thinking I'm taking medicine right now. It tastes like shit. It's gonna. Make me fall asleep. I just honestly, the reason I don't like the term plant medicine is because I think it, and forgive me out there you guys, but I feel like in some small way diminishes all the other reasons I want to take this fucking plant. Like when I'm, when I'm like, you know, and this is such a degraded thing to say, so I'm sorry, but remember when used to be sponsored by fleshlight. Yes. And you fucked a flashlight, right? And it made you come shut. You weren't thinking as you're fucking the flashlight for the pure joy of like experiencing an orgasm with this weird dumb thing. This tube. You're not thinking to yourself, I'm giving myself medicine. Now you're thinking, I don't want to assume this is you for you, for I want to come in the same way like with some of these substances that he'd never get high with you again, man.

Speaker 2:          03:24:00       The fucking house plants. It's just sometimes it's a plant medicine sometimes. Why do you get high? Are you saying that sometimes you get high just because it feels good to behind? That's exactly what I'm saying. That's why God made nitric oxide.

Speaker 8:          03:24:16       Can didn't you get your license with me from a black guy with dreadlocks was a doctor, was calling it the medicine wasn't a, didn't you? And I go to that place. I don't remember this. This was in the early days when it was like sketchy, sketchy, regrow ops were sketchy. He didn't want people to know. Where you grow up was it wasn't legal across the board. You had to get a doctor's recommendation. I remember we walked into the doctor's office. Tell me if you remember this. It was just cool black guy with dreadlocks and he had one of those volcano vapor bags, but it was extra long. He made an extra long bag, like a normal volcano. Bay bags like that big. He had one that was like three feet was. It was cartoonish and as soon as he saw us like, y'all look sick, need medicine, come on man, y'all need to layer. And it was baked out of his fucking mind. He was a legitimate doctor and he had full on dreadlocks.

Speaker 2:          03:25:09       No, that wasn't me. I wasn't with you. I would not that. That was not me, but you know, again, it is healing. I think it is a medicine and it can be. Obviously it's in Madison. It is a medicine that heals people for sure. I just think it's not just a medicine. I think it's much more than that. Maybe we just don't have the language to describe what it is necessarily yet, but people aren't or aren't taken Iowasca to field good. But it's not like a recreational drug. Oh yeah. You know what? I agree with you there, but I think that a lot of people are not necessarily taking Iowasca because they are. They want something more out of their life. They want to. They were or they want some novelty. They want a heightened experience. Many people are taking your Iwatch is they're chronically fucking depressed and they're desperate and they need help and the people who are administering it that are legitimate, they, they're like dog.

Speaker 2:          03:25:56       They're like doctors. Their understanding of these plants is as astounding and deep and I get all that and, and I, I, and I'm, and I'm so. I'm certainly not opposed to that concept. I'm just saying the term plant medicine itself, it feels like somehow it's less romantic than I picture psychedelics, to me, psychedelics or a combination, a hedonic tool, a portal, a means of communion, a spiritual practice, um, and also in medicine. But there are all those other things too. I just think it's more than a medicine. That's all. It's something bigger than medicine though. All those things I just mentioned you could call it medicine. It's just reducing either some expansion of healing to that goes beyond the physical and into the psychological and emotional and spiritual, you know, which makes me sound like a Hippie, but I just got schooled. I was using the term hallucinogens reflexively and I had Jim Fadiman on my podcast who's the microdosing guru and he very quickly said, you know, the, the Scott, a lot of baggage, Hulu, because you don't actually hallucinate, you know, and it's like, well, you're right. Psychedelics is, is definitely a better word for it. It's a better term.

Speaker 8:          03:27:09       But what is happening when you're closing your eyes when you're doing dmt? I think it's, it's entirely likely that we don't know. And that you, you might be actually interfacing with some other place, but you're seeing things that seemed like they must be hallucinations. Yeah. It seems like something is interacting with your visual perception abilities where your eyes are seeing things that are impossible. Now is that because you're actually there and you actually are experiencing these impossible things or is it a trick that's happening with chemicals and your eyeballs and your brain and neurochemistry and that's. That's a question to be answered by people far smarter than I. and what is the difference between those two things? To what extent is your experience your reality? Yeah. That's the real question, right? We want to think that if you can't weigh something on a scale, if I can bang on it with a hammer, if I can't draw on it with a marker, then it's not a real thing.

Speaker 8:          03:28:01       Right? Right, right. But if you said this, like if you had an experience with God where you literally were transported into heaven and you had a communication with God and then God gave you love and wisdom and then you came back down to Earth into your body and you this actually did happen, or you took a drug and the exact same experience took place in every way, shape and form the exact amount of time, the exact feeling, the exact message, the exact visuals, the exact reexamining of your life when you return, they're basically the same thing. I mean, if less you could get God in one of them tuna nets and bring them back here so I could prove that you had God and that you weren't just tripping your fucking balls off basically telling me a story, Bro.

Speaker 7:          03:28:48       Yeah, that'd be pissed. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I don't know. I'm sure that there's like a lot of scientific materialist hearing that and they're like, they're, they're, they're assholes. Or like squeezing into their body. Just in horror what you're saying, because it's like they're, they're like, well, the difference is like when you have a dream and you have this incredible dream or a unicorn comes out of the clearing in the forest and like a rainbow shoots out of it's worn, and then it turns into a swarm of fireflies that spell I love you. Well, that's like, you know, that's a really cool dream, right? But that's not real. That didn't happen. And it's completely different than if you went into a clearing, uh, and, and saw a fucking Unicorn because if you can go into clearing and see a fucking Unicorn, tell me where the clearing is. Let's get some nets.

Speaker 8:          03:29:36       Another thing too about, well, here's the thing about mushrooms, mushrooms enough to stop and think about the people that wrote the Bible. Stop to think about the people that have discovered mushrooms a long time ago by trial and error, or whatever the method was. And imagine everybody decided to get together in some field somewhere and you all take these mushrooms and you all literally go to heaven and you have this insane experience. And then you all come back and then you have to write about it in your ancient tongue. You have to write this down in Aramaic on animal skins. You roll these up and put them in clay jars in the caves of Qumran so that someone someday will know this and understand what you've been through. Well, when the drought came, the mushrooms went away and we were left with nothing but stories mean you have to repeat the craziest thing about psychedelics, especially the natural ones that don't kill anybody. Is it somehow or another somebody wound up bing enough people and putting off disinformation out that one of the most valuable things ever in for human exploration ever as far as like the exploration of our mind is the

Speaker 9:          03:30:40       one, one of the most valuable things that's ever existed for changing the way you view the world, giving you a reset. The one though and doesn't kill anybody,

Speaker 3:          03:30:50       it's illegal. It's illegal in societies that are oriented in a way that that would be corrosive. Right? And that's, that's why getting into legal, what's legal in Peru and

Speaker 9:          03:31:04       they just decriminalized lsd. And what is it, Sweden? Where do they do? I think it was a switcher go. Everything's legal. Yeah, Portugal's got it nailed. I think in Sweden they made it a misdemeanor to. I can't remember somewhere recently. They just made it a misdemeanor to have to get caught with asset on the books for the 2018 elections for California. We have to organize like, this is something we really should really should go after this. Like if you want to talk to me people, Oh God, that's going to go after military rooms. Don't you really could change the world and this is not bullshit. If we organized and we got a bunch of people to vote yes, on recreational use of mushrooms for adults, I literally think we could change the world. That would be the best. It could change the world because like medical marijuana, it will spread to recreational marijuana and recreational mushrooms get past and if they do medical mushrooms get passed and then they can start doing tests on mushrooms. Like the John Hopkins psilocybins studies that they've done. You would see literally a change in the world. You would see a shift in global consciousness and that's not. That's not a ridiculous thing to say. It's probably true.

Speaker 3:          03:32:10       Well, that's why Tim scully and his partner made all that orange sunshine acid. They weren't. I had him on my podcast. He's such a sweet guy. I'm not interested in money. He could have made tons of money doing other things. He was this child genius and he just made the acid and went to prison for it because he wanted to change the world. He really thought it would do it.

Speaker 9:          03:32:30       Know I've been talking to you through email to William Leonard Pickard. That dude who got busted with all that acid. He's in jail now for like a multiple life sentences. When they busted him, he is the guy that was like the missile silo that. Oh yeah. Was the guy that had the girl that lived with them and they were selling ecstasy and someone tried to kill somebody or something. It's so crazy. Someone got. The other guy got arrested. That girl Rad the guy out and holy shit, there's a great book he wrote. If you want to read it, really trippy book, he wrote this book called the Rose of paraklesis and it's this really cool book and it's kind of like flow. It's very intense to read and the way it's written, it's really not. But um, uh, it's pretty interesting. It's talking about sort of the life of a, it's a, the setup is a guy's going to talk to an lsd chemist and a who is sort of explaining what it's like to have to be a secret as you have to be if you're manufacturing what he calls planetary doses of Lsd, which is what they want planetary.

Speaker 9:          03:33:37       And that's

Speaker 2:          03:33:37       what they wanted to do. That was the idea is like let's manufacturer planetary doses of this substance to up shift the consciousness of the planet. And one of the things he says, it's all very flowery and beautiful, but he's talking about the lsd chemist and people being like, this is a for profit thing. And he's saying, no, you know, for us money is, is just the ability to move around. Because when you're an lsd chemist, and again, it's all very flowery writing, but he says something along the lines of when you're standing next to the forge of the gods, you stop thinking about money as meaning anything because you're breathing in the fumes. You're broke. You're like constantly in contact with this, like mind expanding substance. And good luck when you're mid, you know, 200 microgram trip. Good luck taking money seriously. And that moment is this fucking Shit, man. This stuff's ridiculous. You know? So, so, um, yeah man, there was, there still is, I hope, I don't know if there is, but there are people who are manufacturing psychedelics and putting their entire lives at risk, not because they want to make money. And it could be, maybe they started off wanting to make money, but now that they're manufacturing it because they know of all the ways to shift human consciousness, there's lots of ways theoretically to do it, you know,

Speaker 6:          03:34:55       can you imagine being the person who's responsible for literally like a swimming pool filled with acid that will change the world. Like, you know, like right in front of you. If you could get this, there would be such a hiccup and shift of culture. I mean, I don't know which way it would go. I don't know what would happen. I don't know how much schizophrenia you would trigger. I don't know how many people would blow fuses. I don't know, but I do know that something would happen and it will know about shy evil times when this happened based or God, right? Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah. That's what they think happened with the Salem witch trials that literally the Erg gotten the Rod because of an early frost. Some new fungus had grown on some of the bread and they were able to run tests on it and they believe that it has lsd like property to it.

Speaker 2:          03:35:37       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's the, uh, that's certainly one of the potential ways to like upshift consciousness, Epi, getting people having access to psychedelics in a consensual way. You know, like when you're fucking chomping polluted wheat and suddenly think your neighbors know fucking Satan. Pretty scared. That's, that's different than like deciding to take a psychedelic in a responsible way and then understanding a little bit more about how to be compassionate or something like that, you know,

Speaker 6:          03:36:10       seeing yourself for the first time. I remember seeing yourself though. The first time I took mushrooms I saw myself and I was like, oh yeah, that's who I am. You know, like you before you do it, it's like you have this idea looking in out and then you are separated from all of your life and you're like this entity observing from the outside your life yourself is the first time I ever considered myself outside of myself.

Speaker 2:          03:36:34       Dude, this is. I'm sorry.

Speaker 7:          03:36:36       I was bringing up Rhonda us on your podcast. A lot of them, but one of the grading under his beads, one of the great stories is one of the great stories is that, uh, uh, you know, he gave Lsd to Neem Karoli Baba, his guru twice, first time, and you can find a youtube video of him telling the story. It's amazing. It gives him like, you know, Owsley, Owsley kid, Charlemagne has given him this incredible lsd. Says it's 300 microgram tablets made by one of the great lsd chemist of our time and he's going to need to give it to people and he gives it to. He gives a 600 micrograms to Neem Karoli Baba. Now 600 micrograms is like, fuck that. Fuck that. Fuck that. That's just too much. And neem Karoli Baba eats it. But the way he's eating it, as he's like doing this, throwing it in his mouth and eats it, nothing happens.

Speaker 7:          03:37:26       So Rom das gets back to the United States. He's telling one of his scientists, friends, this store and a science friends, come on, dude. He didn't fucking eat it. He threw, he palmed it. He threw it over his shoulder. This story is bullshit. You got tricked. You got hoodwinked by fucking Bob out in India. They're all out there. They just want you to worship. Then they want you to think they're powerful. So like Rhonda is, gets back to India the second time with acid again. And this guy named Karoli Baba says to him, when you were here last time, what did you give me around us as says, well, I gave you lsd. And he's like, did I take it around? The US is like, I don't know, and he's like, give me more, give me more. So it gives him more. And he takes these pills, puts them in his mouth, chewing them up in front of him and opens his mouth.

Speaker 7:          03:38:17       His mouth is coated with tablet acid. He's taken a coordinator around us now, 900 Mike's of this stuff. And so he goes under his blanket and starts shaking. And I know people now, I've seen you saw this happen, not just him telling the story, who saw it happen? And they said like, the fucking blood rushed out around us, his face. He's like, oh my God. Oh my God, what have I done? What was I fucking thinking? I just drove this dude crate. I essentially just gave an old man 900 micrograms of fucking acid in the hills of India and he's going to go fucking nuts and it's going to be my fault. Right? And so, like, neem Karoli Baba comes out of the blanket, his eyes are back in his head, he's like, and then he just goes back to completely normal, nothing, no effect. And he says to him, so was he, was he laughing what now he was putting on? He was playing on a fuck. He was playing a joke to fuck with him, but he, but, uh, but, uh, he was just fucking with. But what, what, what, uh, what he said to him was really interesting. We said to him, was this, he said, we used it. They used to have something like this in the Indus Valley and he said, uh, this will bring you into the presence of Christ, but you have to leave better

Speaker 8:          03:39:34       to become Christ than to hang out with him. He said, which is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was his. Because their premise was, this is something like, this is definitely a thing for sure. But there could be that thing. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That was the, you can live there. Yeah. I think that we're entirely in prison divide a wall of ideas and of behavior and a momentum. And of culture and of conditioning and the way we look at the world is like in these preprogram trunks, that's a car that's a building we, I don't think necessarily we see it for what it really completely is, which is some very strange temporary life that no one has really defined the meaning of it. We're, we're in infinity hurling through space surrounding and giant nuclear explosion rocketing through the universe and all of that. Trying to make, make sense of it all, and in between there you've got cops killing people in hallways.

Speaker 8:          03:40:33       You've got black lives matter, you've got a. you've got every single possible variation from furries to people that it's their job to ticket street vendors who don't have the right. It'd be the whole thing is this entire thing that we're experiencing is really psychedelic. If you weren't living life and if life made way more sense, like in the world that we're normally accustomed to, is much more controlled and two dimensional, and you could see the world that we live in for the very first time. You'd be overwhelmed by how insane it is. You'd be overwhelmed by the possibilities. We'd be overwhelmed by the Internet. You'd be overwhelmed by language. You'd be overwhelmed by feelings and emotions and all of it. If we weren't used to it, all of it will be like, whoa, this is crazy. Like nonverbal expression. People Strip clubs for race cars, all of it planes.

Speaker 8:          03:41:29       Why don't they have metal tubes? They flying through the air, the fuck. We're just so used to all of it. That life itself is very psychedelic. It's just a psychedelic experience that we've grown deeply accustomed to and I think the psychedelic experience that you have when you're on a heavy duty thing, like a dmt, it's like you venture forth into a dimension that you don't have context for, but you feel familiar. You feel familiar with it, but you don't have context for it. It doesn't fit into your normal patterns, but the normal patterns are just as bizarre. Man. The normal patterns were taking liquid. How do these clear plastic things that are made out of oil that somehow the other they figured out to turn into a clear plastic. Can we fill it up with liquids and you drink them? The Chuck? These things and you follow the path of this plastic bottle, it might eventually wind up in some seagulls gut choking to death in the middle of the ocean. You know, I mean, it's bizarre, but then also add to that that you're melting into time to while you drink from the bottle, you're just not. The

Speaker 2:          03:42:32       insanity that is bottle is like your bottles mid process it somewhere from some batch of gooey shit to being a bottle to being in a seagulls. Got You're mid process to honey, you're getting funding getting dissolved, you know what I mean? You're mid process and and, and like the sun and so is the fucking sun. But you know, the fun thing to do, this is something that occurred to me when I was super high recently. I was sitting in this fucking apartment and then suddenly it dawned on me like, wait a minute, how many other people are going to fucking live here? And then I'm thinking like, wait, how many people have lived here? And then I'm thinking, how many conversations have happened in this fucking apartment where everybody thought these were really serious conversations. Like, Oh yeah, we're really getting into it, man, and then you realize, oh my God, I'm just a little.

Speaker 2:          03:43:21       I'm just a little eddy of air spinning around in this fucking apartment. I'm going to leave and there's going to be other little eddies of hair that spin around in this apartment. The apartment's going to be around way longer than any of those other eddies of air. So really just to add to what you're saying, the beauty of the glorious nature of the universe versus our ability to comprehend it is that we are so fucking impermanent. We are so impermanent and we are so fluid and we're so melting into time. It's a really amazing thing that will allow you and I and you say you say we're used to it and sometimes I think, yeah, that must be it, but I think also there's a lot of eggs. We're ignoring it. We're numb to it. It's too much. Too overwhelmed. Yes. You think about hunter gatherers, hunter gatherers lived in the world that created them, the world that they evolved in, right? So it's the same world. Your father and grandfather and great grandfather. Everybody lived in the same world, so the skills you're born learning,

Speaker 8:          03:44:17       I grew up learning. Those are the skills that are appropriate to your world where we're in a world now where even people who are alive are in a different world than the one they were born into. You know, and where I grew up before the Internet, right. This is all new. I was in my thirties when the shit started. Yeah. So nuts and. But people, younger people can't imagine what it was like to travel before there was email. Yeah. So you were like 40 when the first iphone came out, right? I was born in [inaudible]. Sixty two. Yeah. So the whole thing is, it's hard to imagine it being any different than it is, but if you really just think of what it is, I'll either, just the discussions that we've had here today about what the potential issues could be with ai, with advancing technology that has not been mapped out. It's not, it's not going to be regulated as far as how far innovation is allowed to continue. It's not going. They're going to. They're going to be so far ahead of the people that understand the regulations. Let's get that. Things are going to be coming out like the Internet itself. The Internet came out itself before they really understood what the implications were. If the government could go back in time and pull the fucking, hey, hey, hey, pop. Let's talk about this first. Pull that plug right out of the wall before the Internet on aol

Speaker 9:          03:45:30       and let's just talk about what we're going to do with this and let's, let's manage this because let me show you what it could be, and then you'd see 25 years later, people like holding on their phones, walking into traffic and getting hit by cars because they're so addicted to checking their facebook fan, man. Yeah, it's nuts. Yeah. Imagine if a drug could do with cell phones. Do imagine if a drug came along and the drug made you like stare at your hands all day, that everybody was just like staring at their hands. It means like praying. Yeah. The only. The only thing difference is you are getting some information, but I mean if there was a drug that came along that made you want to stare at your hands like 90 percent of the day, like if you're playing video games, you're not getting any information. That's true. Porn. Well they say the video games in some ways are good for the site though. Good for the psyche. They make it good for your mind. Pilots. Yeah. That's, you know, it's not good for my psyche getting my fucking ass kicked at hearthstone where this new expansion.

Speaker 9:          03:46:29       But very quickly the thing you're talking about the um, the uh, the, the concept of a drug that makes you stare at your hands. I think our thoughts at one point like the ability to think the way we do was a new technology. It started emerging. And so like when you're caught up in your thoughts, what's the difference between that and looking at your fucking cell phone? Like when you get obsessed with your thoughts and like, cause I've noticed like whenever I get really caught up in a flurry of thoughts and I allow myself to really get lost in the thing you're talking about the simulation, the projection into the future. You're 17 fights ahead with this person because they said this thing that they're never going to say. I think that's a form of looking at your cell phone only. It's the internal simulator inside the neuro computer that your brain is, but I don't think it's too much different.

Speaker 9:          03:47:18       I think both of these things are just different attempts to try to evade the present moment because the present moment is so overwhelmingly heartbreakingly beautiful that we'd rather have our faces buried in our phones or in our thoughts. I think that's the problem is the more that we get into the moment, it's fucking amazing here. It is amazing, but I don't think that's what's. I don't think it's the fact that it's beautiful that's making people be distracted. I think overwhelming the amount of data that's coming our way and I don't think we're designed for it. I think that's one of the things that gets people at peace. If you're on a hike in nature, this is all stuff where your brain has a whole fort. We're talking about keys, keys at slots. Those key is just fit in. There's a tree, there's the bird, all of that eagle. Holy Shit. Wow. Look, the salmon jumping, that's there's keys for that. There's receptors for all that stuff. When you're walking down fucking Santa Monica Boulevard and his people honking their horn and different music is playing in different cars and there's smells that aren't natural and there's so much data coming your way. It's overwhelming and then you're thinking about your work and your job and your boss keeps giving you massages. Creepy. You know? You just want to.

Speaker 3:          03:48:29       When it gets back to that natural, unnatural conversation we began with, right? Because you know you're. You're describing the metaphor of receptor cells or something for these different inputs, but another way to look at it is your body has expectations, right? Your eyes are designed with an expectation of certain wavelengths of light that are relevant to this animal, right? Those are like the reds of the berries are relevant because now they're ripe and you know there are different than blood is shocking and all that. The ears are expectations of certain decibel levels that would be important for this animal to hear. Rabbits I've totally different setup, you know, so your whole body, your lungs or an expectation of oxygen, rich air, you know everything. And when you take that animal out, it's confused because what it's expecting isn't there. So it's not just metaphorical, it's, it's actually physiologically we're living in a world that our bodies don't expect. Hmm.

Speaker 9:          03:49:28       God Damn. What a great way to end this thing sitting for five hours. This was fun. Jesus Christ. Thank you guys. Let's do this more often. Make these easy. We can all just will triple cast it. You want to do that while three? Put it out, put it. We'll do that. Whatever time. I think that's probably the best way to do it all the time. Yeah. Yeah. So that way nobody has to miss any of them or not subscribed. And um, you guys are both here. Now you're here, you're moving back. I'm back, you're done and you're here. So unless I get kidnapped and Peru and a little bit more often, there's some of my favorite podcast ever that Chris Ryan on twitter and the instagram. Same. Same beckers and Duncan trussell and everything. I can trust them. Alright fuckers. Thank you. Bye.
