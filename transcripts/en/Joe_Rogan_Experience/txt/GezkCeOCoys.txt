Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah, they're great. We've got two of them. I love it. You could pick the front of the bag. That's an interesting way to start to your weight. You can start it. We're talking about these toilets that have a built in. It's not really a bad day. It's more like a buck cleaner. Right. But the days are kind of crude. You ever use it a day? That's what it was. It is, but it's not good at it. Know what I mean? This was this stream of water. It was the perfect size and pressure warmth and I have had, I mean if we want to get into it right, right off the bat, I've had an anal orgasm before with a vibrator and the only once in my life and that day I was like, if I stayed on here like 10 more minutes I could get you. I think it could a lot of gals out there taking notes.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       I was like, I think I just use like diaper wipes in my butt. Yeah, that's good too. But I like think about it like, you know, like if my beard, if I had like shit smeared all over, would that be cool with the diaper wipe and just going out in public? I don't think so. So the idea is to power wash it. Yeah. That's what that power wash my face though. I scrub it, shower, put my head in a tub of water for a little bit. They're very smart with it, but day and the day never caught on here in America, they just went with paper, which, which gets caught in your butt and it gets caught if you're a girl with not a neatly tucked vagina. Like most women, little pieces break off ones that soft. Yeah. That's why I use Scott brand toilet paper instead of Sharman. Everyone thinks I'm being cheap and I'm like, no, I just don't want toilet paper stuck in my vagina. You ever wipe your Dick with toilet paper or not? It's just your bottle. No drip, drip, drop it right back. Don't worry about it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       Not a concern. I've always wondered that. Yeah, it's different. I mean girls, you know, it's obviously it's not as efficient delivery method. Really. Gotta be careful about the wiping front to back. What do you got? Oh No. Ryan, you want to send my daughter once my young daughter got sick from that. I learned the hard way. Yeah. She didn't understand and we were on vacation. I actually got sick from it. She gets a fever I think. I want to say she was three or, oh wow. Yeah. It's like, you know, you want to like, even if you tell them it doesn't make sense to them, you know, back to front is the way you'd normally it would go, but then you gotta do it in your head. You go that way until your arms get longer. Yeah. Yeah. And then you got to lift your leg up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:31       I can reach all the way around now. Do you wipe your ass with your leg up on the toilet? No, I stand up to wipe my ass. I like to get in there squat though. You could get into but whole area. It's true. I always do a captain Morgan stance to clean out the area. He has. Oh and the leg up on the barrel because when you stand up you gotta wipe and wipe and wipe. And when you're like, what is this going to end? Yeah. Well that's why I think every toilet should really, I mean it would it be hard

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       to have one of those jet things and every toilet it doesn't seem that.

Speaker 3:          00:03:03       I don't think that's a big ask. Yeah. My concern is so like if you're squirting and then like poop crumbles are coming out right, and they're going back down. Like could it ever then hit the thing that's squirting on you and then could poop squirt gun. That's my, that's my main concern.

Speaker 2:          00:03:19       Well there's bigger concerns in life, but that is one.

Speaker 3:          00:03:22       No, I mean we're just specifically talking about toilet concerns that a major one.

Speaker 2:          00:03:28       I don't think that because of the water pressure, I don't think you would have to have all like all of them,

Speaker 3:          00:03:33       like shit. I mean it would have to prairie dogging, right? Yeah. It would have to be like a cow patty fiber diet, who's already anyway, we're sex birth. Well, you're human. Every new how sex is in some way. A sexpert. Yeah. That's our platform because we don't, we're not, we're not experts at all. I said the other day to corrine, what's the name of the whole that hugs the Tampon and she was like, wow, okay Christina. That's the, we did look it up. Well, because people call the whole thing the vagina and that's inaccurate. Vaginas are so complicated. How the whole thing, it's the thing is not a vagina and that's inaccurate. The just the, the sex hole is the vagina. No, people call the whole thing the vagina, but that's not technically accurate. If the doors are closed and you look at on the outside, you'd go, hey, that's a vagina. Like, nope, that's not technically correct. My Labor. Yeah, that's Lavia you're looking at there. Yeah. Here's the church. Here's the staple because the door,

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       the, let me tell you how I feel about it. I think it's fucking gross. The operation where they remove labial lips, that seems so goddamn right.

Speaker 3:          00:04:40       Labioplasty yeah. Somebody actually, cause that doesn't do your vagina's fully functioning and it works fine. It's just the aesthetic. And then if you get the surgery and it goes awry, that's not good. Somebody had emailed us once about Dane Cook had a bit about like meaty posy lips a while ago and she'd got labioplasty because of that bit. And I was like, no, I like Dane Cook a Laba and I, but I had talked about that because I was, I was watching his special and I just put my hands over my face. I was like, this is not what we need it all. But I was like, surely no one's going to do it. Cause he said that it's a joke. He's a comic and he's a cute comics. So then you're like, should I do it? Not me personally. I mean, but it also desensitizes the area a lot. So you're, imagine you're cutting meat stitching things back up and things get numb. Oh, nice surgery.

Speaker 2:          00:05:32       And the slight, there's a slice down my knee that I had this knee operated on in 1994 and it's still numb. Oh whoa. Yeah. This skin, like where they did what's called a Patella tendon graft with, oh my God, they cut along. Slice. They took a piece of your Patella, they pull that out and then they stitch it inside the knee and that area in the front where they took the scar, like where the scars, it's numb. So just no nerves, nerve endings there. I don't feel,

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       well it feels notice will be different than the sides. Like that one strip where the scar is very different. So imagine that. Sure.

Speaker 3:          00:06:06       Yeah. I was like, imagine your policies, your knee and that just so what's the point of life? What's the point of living now? I'm always just an envision your knees as my pussy. Whenever I see plessy knee, it would be big

Speaker 4:          00:06:16       pussy too because it's little pussies opening. Yeah, and that's why babies come out. Otherwise you have to get c sections and then the, the baby doesn't get the product out of China. Juices on the baby and they don't get the right healthy bacteria.

Speaker 3:          00:06:31       Right? Yeah. No, I know why. There's a notepad here. I'm taking notes. Underline this

Speaker 4:          00:06:38       baby born by Cesarean section, especially elective Sicilian and section. It's actually unhealthy for the baby's immune system. I thought you were gonna say hotter because you're placing your face doesn't get sued.

Speaker 3:          00:06:52       Exactly. They're not mashed when they come out, they don't look like they've got a facebook photo, ratty face tune. We've heard, we've heard that. We didn't know what phase, tuning wise, we've been in La for like three days. We've heard face tuning it five times. You know you can auto tune Britney spears voice. So it sounds listenable to the general public, but you can also do that to your fucking face. Okay. So it's like, it's an app and then beyond filters you actually can take your finger. And if my, I think my face looks too fat, I can smudge it in so that it's thinner. But then you meet somebody in person, they're like, oh fatty, all the celebrities do it apparently. Oh, come

Speaker 4:          00:07:29       on. Oh, not all of them. Well not, not you. Well the weird ones do, but it see, the thing is like if you're doing that and then someone meets you in person, like that was the, the issue with, you know, the Kim Kardashians, Mexico pictures, you know, that's the whole thing. Kim Carter. You can imagine. I love that you're up on this though. I am a bitch. Kim Kardashians brings photographers with her and they pretend that she's getting paparazzied. Oh really? She hires these people. Then they take the photos and then they doctor the photos. They photoshop them and then they release them as candid photos. Well, she went down to Mexico and some real Paparazzi. Were there some real unpaid ones and they got unreached touched ashots and it is a monster. Really? Well, it's not cellulite. Here's the thing. It's fat taken out of her body and stuffed into her ass to give her this diaper.

Speaker 4:          00:08:17       Look, it's a, it's a meat diaper and you don't realize how gross it looks until you see it in real life. I've seen one of those in real life and it's chaotic. Oh, always seen him. What pants on? I haven't seen him naked, but I saw one. I was like, what in the fuck are you doing your body? It's chaos because you suck and fat out of your sides and your inner thigh and all this. Like, look at that. Whoa. What in the fuck is that? What the fuck is a diaper? And to say, I don't think it looks that bad. Oh, you're crazy. Let's find the Mexico pictures because there's the, there was Paparazzi pictures of her walking on the beach. Okay. Oh, see? Yeah, that's not even the bad ones. This makes me like

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       her more. Why? Because she's not perfect. Humanizes her. Okay, but wait a minute. She's projecting a face sheet section and that's her business. Anyone who thinks Kim guard issue cat Kardashians actually perfect is ridiculous. We're young and impressionable. People are held up to way higher standards. You look at that and you go, oh my God, how can I be like that? That's a new role models though. It's a parent's job or guardian's job to step in and be like, maybe you have maybe Ruth Bader Ginsburg give her her to her. Well, that's true, but here's the reality is if you're a little kid and you're paying attention to online stuff without supervision and you're hanging out with friends at school, you're going to be affected by this because this woman makes hundreds of millions of dollars. She's super glamorous, she's on television and you find out that she got fat stuffed into her ass to make that thing cause she cheated guided.

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       That's what it feels like. It's like, well if you're, if you're projecting this image of perfection and then it's like, well no that's not really, that's a lot of work to get the Paparazzi that you hire to edit it and then put it out like casually on the beach. In her defense it's a business or businesses this looking, I mean I don't even know. It sounds like I would just play a sentence to my child and be like, you know, it doesn't matter to us. You can say that. You could say that, but if you're a 16 year old girl and you know you see her on television and you see her popular at one time and there certainly were people who looked hotter but I still turned out okay and like I don't by any means have a a perfect 10 bodies, but she has confidence.

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       My body, I don't have any problems with it and I still ingested a lot of this kind of like fluffy pop culture. I actually love pop culture. It's one of my favorite things, like just inane information about celebrities, but this is a different kind of pop culture because this is pop culture that is famous for just being, if this is what I would call it, instagram culture, like these instagram models and everything, you do have to be careful about that because even I find myself at 32 flipping through instagram and going like, wow, there's a lot of work to do. There was some dude, I don't know who he was, some black guy, I don't know. He was, he just was some funny dude who had this video post about instagram girls saying, I want to thank all my fans. He goes, Yo, listen, you don't have fans. I'm just a pervert. I'm not your fan. He goes, and if you keep showing pictures of your ass, I'll keep looking because I'm like that shit. Stop pretending that you've got some talent, people who love you. That's uncomfortable talent to have fans though. Sadly, you just gotta be hot. I sometimes, there are people who I'm just fans of their ass.

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       You're not fans of anyone's ass bodies. I guess I'm a fan of looking at Kim Kardashian and I have no problem with saying no. I am enjoying funny. That's where my point was pointing

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       it out. Like you're like, well, let's go break it down. Specifically. Don't put me on this hierarchy of a fan. I'm a down to, you're jerking off team a bedroom. Yeah. I'm a fan of certain musicians. Right, exactly. I don't follow you around this. Some people do, but yeah, no. Karen was always very naturally confident and she's the only person I know that's a woman that has actually confident, Eh, you eat my snow. Someone else they way. No, just like the way you are confident is very unique because she truly doesn't give a shit. And I only talent and everyone comes up to me and they're like, it's Krinn. Quinsig really insecure. Right? I'm like, she's honestly not. Thank you. That's very nice. Are you a confident, are you insecure? What's your insecurities? Um, I'm pretty confident, I guess, but everyone's insecure little, a little bit of your own mortality.

Speaker 3:          00:12:42       You worry about all sorts of things. We're going to die. I'm constantly worried about that constantly. We're worried about everything. You worried about your health, you're worried about social status position in society, your friends worry about your health is an insecurity though. That's just carry the Kale security. Like it's, it's a broad definition, isn't it? Like we have to think of insecurity. What do you think of just like how people perceive you that don't know you? I think it's, you know, constantly trying to make up for something that you feel like you're lacking in an area you're lacking in. So a lot of people aren't confident in their intelligence there. How funny. We know whatever occupation you are that you're not the best in it. I mean, I constantly think I have things to work on. I'll never be satisfied until I'm the best, which will never happen.

Speaker 3:          00:13:30       So it's just a constant loop, the best, uh, anything existing, existing, anything I want to do, I want, like I want to try to do. And I don't, I tend not to do things if I don't think that I can excel in them, which is why I don't have fun. It's so true. It's very true. You don't have any fun. We did go to universal studios yesterday. That was fun. What do you mean by you don't have any fun? I don't, I mean I don't, I don't like fun. What? Yeah, I have like a, I have a bit about how I don't like fun and I, and I don't know, I just, I like working as opposed to fun, like just frivolous fun. If I feel like it's like a waste of like just hanging out. I have a hard time just like hanging out like a hard time relaxing because we're not doing something.

Speaker 3:          00:14:10       That's why I like hanging out with Christina because me and my friend, but we're also getting work done at the same time or in universal. We were in line, we were creating the intro for the show last night and we were all always were always working. Yeah, that's cool. But then I discovered psychedelics and I feel like that's the only kind of like that's the release that I need. Hmm. So you don't enjoy like recreational activities? Like you don't want to go fishing or whitewater rafting. So I feel like that is productive because I'm making my body stronger. So I do like stuff like that. This is very analytical, has to be a purpose to it. I mean I like skiing but it's because I was like, I'm doing something, I'm learning a new skill. I'm getting exercise. Want a party with that girl? No. Yeah, no. I mean, Gosh, I mean unless

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       I'm drinking, which yeah, like dmt or some shit. Yeah. Then that's super fun. She's so sweet when she's drunk. It's so weird cause she like gives you compliments and you'd never hear a compliment from her and she, she's like, you like look really good tonight, Christina. I'm like, bitch, you wasted. You always look good though. I think it's important to just space out compliments so that they're really powerful when you space them out. Yeah. When you give them that ration them. Yes, yes, yes. Exactly. Interesting you see, you seem, you seem interested like what is going on in your head right now? Nothing. Just trying to figure out why. You know, why you would issue fun, why you would, I mean it's not, it's not a bad thing. That's great that you're going to get more work done but it has it served you well?

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       Yes. I mean we're sitting here because of a great name for a podcast by the way. I use you guys an example all the time and when you do people email us, they tweet us and we go up like 10 positions of the podcast charts. All of them. Like God Dad, I know my manager was like the Rogan bump. I was like so cool. I usually guys, this is a great example of people that didn't have like a big social media profile or a big, you weren't on big TV shows or podcasts shot up because it's good cause it's fun. I like how you guys banter with each other too. You almost finish each other's sentences and you almost talk over each other but you don't. It's like you have like you have a thought and you'll interject with your thought while you're having a thought and then you pick up your thought right after her.

Speaker 1:          00:16:18       It's like you guys have a ads. We've been working together for many years before the podcast so I think and there was a lot of episodes of guys we fucked that I'd have to go back and listen to. It will be very embarrassed by how many times I interrupted the fucking guests or her and so it's hard, right? When you're enthusiastic and you're in his car and someone's talking, you don't know when to do it. Yeah, but a secret twin language, we've said like the same sentence, a long sentence at the same time and it's very creepy. We'll talk with our eyes when we're doing like a live show and know exactly what, what the next thing we need to do is now when you say you guys worked together before he did the podcast, what'd you do? We are a comedy duo is called, sorry about last night.

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       So we did a standup shows me, we were produced, we the two woman show at UCB. We would do sketches, video sketches, just shit. Anything we thought was funny, and this was one of the, the impetus for the podcast was a breakup crane got dumped in a Panera bread and it was like the worst I've ever seen anybody handle a breakup meeting. Like it really took a toll on her and it was not good. She doesn't show a lot of emotion. So I'd like to see her cry. I was like, Oh shit. And then one day she texted me, she's like, we should just interview every guy we've ever fucked. We'll do that on a podcast, which is called guys we fucked. And I was like, yeah, actually that's, yeah, that's good. I like how you call, you call it an anti slut shaming podcast too. Yeah. That's why that was my addition. That needs to stop. It's a ridiculous, it's ridiculous. And also you need to stop slut shaming yourself. I think a lot of people do that to themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       And I got to say like I feel like guys we fucked is the female Viagra because it gets, women have written us like I want to go out and have sex cause now I know how to communicate what I want. I know it's not weird to say what I want. It's not, I don't, I'm not a slut if I sleep with somebody on the first date or have a one night stand and it's like, that's really cool.

Speaker 2:          00:18:07       Well, I think this country, we still have the echoes of the puritans that landed here. I mean, yeah, there's some weird sexual politics that go on in this country. There's some weird way that we have a viewing sex that I think is directly connected to the original way this country was founded. Oh, he's like some serious pr prudishness that exists in America. It doesn't exist in other places and some people here, it's a good thing because they think that we get more work done because of it. That our society is more geared towards productivity and getting ahead as opposed to some societies that don't. But if you,

Speaker 5:          00:18:41       if you stifle a part of yourself though, that's going to come out somehow. And that's why people sexually assault, say the repression. I think black people act out sexually in any religion, any religion that oppresses people that were leaving. It's like you're going to explode one day. Catholicism.

Speaker 2:          00:18:57       I mean, it's the classic example and there's, if there was as many people in Nascar that fuck kids as Catholic priests, how quick would they shut down Nascar? Yes. Very quickly. Like religion is so controlling, but you can watch documentary after documentary, you know, the whole, do you know the whole story about ratzinger? Who was the last pope? He was, uh, he was wanted for crimes against humanity. I mean, it's got literally cannot leave Rome if he goes to certain places. He could be tried for pro crimes against humanity. What he did when he was a bishop or whatever the fuck the position they call, he was taking priests that were molesting kids and covering it up and moving them to another parish. He moved one priest to a place where he molested 100 deaf kids. Oh God. Damn. Yeah. And this was a hundred percent factual, proven, non speculative. I mean he's, he's responsible for moving these people and the number of Catholic priests, I mean, first of all, there's gotta be some Catholic priests out there who were wonderful people and I'm sorry you get lumped into this, but the sheer number of Catholic priests that have been involved in most dating, molesting kids,

Speaker 5:          00:20:06       fucking stunning. It's terrifying. Yeah. We had a guy emailed us, so it was in Boston. It was molested by one of the priests and he got interviewed on the, on the, by the, by that breaking piece about them, we get w one thing I've learned from doing guys, we fucked all that. I that really surprised me. I feel like 85% of the population has either been molested as children or raped or sexually assaulted in some way. Like some big way. Not just like groping. Yeah. And it's, I had no idea it was that common. And then I thought back, I'm like, shit, I get like one time I went to this doctor because I had to get blood work. So I picked a general doctor and he was like, it was this old man. He's like, I'm gonna give you a breast exam. I was like, Huh, okay. And then I, and he went real slow with it and then I left. I had put my shirt back on and I, when I left the doctor's

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       office and I was walking home and I was like, wait a second. Ah God damn it. I was so, and I was like, I'll let that slide. And then I turned into a bit, I was like, you ever been sexually assaulted? But she didn't realize until afterwards there's been a series of doctors that had been arrested for drug in their patients and then molesting whether under camera's like some patients with suspected it. And so they had done the investigation and put hidden cameras and caught the doctors feeling them. I even caught doctors having sex with patients while they were under. These are things that I may be just a neat to know. There's some fucking creeps out there. I know you're from Jersey as well. I was born there, but I only lived there toe seven cause I was like, my grandfather was in the hospital for cancer when that angel of death, I don't know if you heard about this doctor that coming around like killing people and we're pretty, we're pretty sure that's what happened. My grandfather died like pretty abruptly.

Speaker 4:          00:21:48       My Mom's gonna kill me. But she had said something to me privately, and I guess it was just two of settings. You can't trust anybody. It's not that you can't trust anybody. He's like, you're going to run into so many people that if, just like we were talking before the podcast started about social media, but like one out of 10 if you have nine people that are awesome and then one out of 10 is just a fucking creep, you get upset. God dammit. Now think about running into people. How many hundreds of people you run into. All it takes is one creep. And so it's not that you can't trust people, it's just like you're going to run into a certain amount of creeps just based on the numbers. The majority of people are not sexual predators are not giant pieces of shit, but the ones that are really stick out.

Speaker 4:          00:22:34       I think what you're talking about too is big too about the suppression. I think the suppression, any sort of suppression of desires, it, it fosters that sort of creepy behavior. It builds up and it looks for some sort of an outlet. And that outlet comes out in really weird ways. Like I have a friend, well Jim Norton Pretty Open about it. He loves dominatrix, he gets, he goes to them and all that kind of shit. And one of the things that he tells me is that these ladies say that a giant percentage of their business is like really powerful ceos, buttoned down men who have to like be in control all the time, have to, you know, have a very rigid, uh, profile that they're projecting to their company. And that these guys love to get shit on, kicked in the balls and the love to be told what to do. Work hard, play hard. What's in there, right? It's, there's a, there's a thing that's happening to people when you have to pretend to be something that you're not. Oh yeah. That's why you find a lot of Ortho. I'm Jewish and so like a lot of orthodox Jewish men are veil. There's a lot of, you know, hiring sex workers and it download and a lot of, I mean this is a very

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       broad statement to make, but you know a lot of touching on the subway kind of behavior. You just see it more. Did you see the, they're making sex robots that would look really, they look like actual women. I mean you could tell it's a robot but it's, it looks very close. And I was thinking like, because women have, I think with women they oppress themselves with their own sexuality and I'm like man, women are the ones that should be getting this sex dolls because then we can feel what it's like to have sex without giving a shit what the person we're having sex with. Thanks cause it's a fucking doll. And you could really go buck wild and let loose and be vulnerable. Be Vulnerable.

Speaker 4:          00:24:22       Brian, if you can use a vibrator, you could use a robot. Yeah. Oh, I would love just sex robot. But the robot do foreplay. I have to get one of those toilet seats. And then maybe, yeah, these are dolls though. These are guys who choose dolls is their life partners. I did an article, whatever you want to do, what? I wrote this article, this guy contacted me and he told me he had severe acne when he was young and then he's disfigured and he's never had sex with a woman. And this is why. And he said, if you want, if you want to ask me some questions, I'd be happy to answer you. It was all anonymously through email. So he and I started going back and forth about this, you know, cause he was upset that at the article that I was mocking these guys that think that this is their girlfriend. Okay, I see where you're coming from. Yeah, I see his point too though. Imagine if you were just,

Speaker 5:          00:25:13       he has an insecurity and he didn't want to be vulnerable with a person because you're risking the rejection and that rejection hurts. But I feel like in addition to the repression thing though, I think masculinity, I watched this documentary called I'm the mask I live in on Netflix. It's so good. And it points out these little things that little boys pick up like a, um, you know, I was at a pool with my friend one summer and this dad was trying to get his son to jump in the pool and he was like, come on, don't be a girl. Jumped in the pool. And then, then he jumped in with those little tiny things get in your head. And it gets to the point where when you're a grown man, you feel like you deserve pussy. Or the getting pussy or getting girls is gonna make you up, you know, raise in status and that's, that's

Speaker 4:          00:25:53       fucked up. It's also a code kind of a perpetuating cycle because if you're an idiot and you raise kids that are idiots, you know what I mean? If your parents were dumb and they raised you, you might have some really shitty ideas in your head that you've got to iron out. Yeah. And sometimes it takes like a lot of life experience to figure out what those are and how to get them out. If you, if you ever are self aware of it. And I feel like people go through their whole lives, they never know 100%. I mean there's a lot of people you run into that are 70 that are like, I was watching this, um, um, video on youtube. This guy looked like he was in his late sixties, and it was, um, giving some Asian guy a hard time on the bus and he was saying all this ratio. I watch that too. He and I was like, Jesus Christ, this is an old guy, old guy.

Speaker 5:          00:26:35       He also seemed a little not, yeah, he was a little mentally unstable. I think that night I saw that video actually, there

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       was a guy doing the same thing to a black, uh, that was at a Panera bread and there's this black guy. I was working there and, but it's always an opinion. We're trying to get them to sponsor our tour gift cards instead and give them out as prizes is that just show dealt with this guy. But he wasn't old but he was saying the n word like re like very, I was like, I want to intervene but I, he might stab me, just say that about someone to the, to the employee and the employee was trying to brush it off. I'm like, Oh God damn it. That sucks. And he was obviously, I don't know what the hell was up with him mentally, but he had some, some issues and he was talking to himself and smacking himself and pushed his chair over and picking it back up.

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       And I was like, you need to get the fuck outta here man. And then I like kind of like went away. I'm like, don't hit me. And, but then he eventually left, but I was like, fine line. Like when do you intervene if someone's mentally unstable? You can't fix them now to shame them. They're talking to voices that aren't even talking to them. You know, if you say, hey, you need to get the fuck outta here. Then they decided to shoot you and then you're done. Then employee like he know, he realized that the guy wasn't there like all there hopefully and was like, this doesn't, this doesn't matter. This guy in the subway figured that out too. He was so chill. Gay was, I seen that a lot in New York City though. People that seem disturbed and then just going off on racist rants to people or their faces.

Speaker 3:          00:28:07       I'm like, Damn. A lot of homophobic grants I've seen too, like was straight up to gay people, but I mean again, people who are, who are, as you say off, I mean there was a guy not too long ago who just went up to the man sitting next to me and he was like, Yo, I saw you looking at me. You're looking at me. I'm not like that. I'm not going to fuck you and this and this young woman, this young woman did very much like Kristina and I'm kind of just thinking in my head, I love to step in but that was not one some ways mentally unstable, it's we just all realized like, okay, we're not going to take anything this person saying to heart so boys are so weird cause you jam and that little thing with people and they know you can't get out.

Speaker 3:          00:28:48       That feeling of vulnerability is always in the air and because of that people that are fucked up, we'll take advantage of that. It's also a great, great place for sexual assault. Like all, most of the sexual assaults I've experienced have been on the subway, just hard cox elbow in the motorway stomach versus when you're on the subway late at night and there's not many people in the car and then you'll look up across from you and there's this guy with his hand down his pants. He's going to town on his dick and you're like, I want to die. And you make eye contact with them and you're like fuck. Or when someone sits right next to you when there's absolutely no reason to do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, man. Yeah. Wash it happens on the subway. I've seen people take his shit multiple times. Once on the platform. They just take a shit early in the morning, his bathroom usage time. If you don't have a bathroom to go to in the subway. So do they do it on the floor to do the over the edge? On the floor? On the floor. I don't have that Guy Kersey.

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       C'Mon. Yeah. They don't want to get hurt like homeless people? I think so. I would say yes, but maybe one or two of them haven't been. I don't know. We're just in a hurry or they be staging caveman. How many people have you seen shit on the floor for? Wow. You've more than me. I think I only saw two. How many masturbator is have you seen? Endless. Ruined my favorite Mcdonald's for me once I've ruined it. Audition. This guy like an Ellis, he had like elephant titus of the Dick. He's Dick. He had sweatpants on, but it was like a process. It was like the size of that bar that would inbox in his pants and I'm like, no way. And then he was like, I'm like, oh no, totally fucked up the audition in the pants, but his hands were outside of the pants.

Speaker 1:          00:30:27       I don't know. He was cradling it. He's cradling it is just doing a little jokey joke. So I had a hard big cock. He's one of those youtube pranksters like that was his thing. Hey, if he was great prankster really thought fucked you up for a couple of years. Me Up for a while was just sell from impractical jokers. Trust. Know that San Francisco, they have such a problem with shitting people shitting on this trip. They have an APP, they have an app where you could find out where the human shit is and report it so you could avoid it. Yeah, they have like piles. San Francisco is super duper liberal almost to the point where they're like creative unless you want to share. It's like they're just super open minded lefties. That's where we invited the homeless man in San Francisco to do Karaoke with us, but it was the best night ever lives there and he was like, well, I think they're trying to combat that by shitting on the street.

Speaker 1:          00:31:26       That's a good tactic to shit on the street who areas that have been, see there's like a can be near the tenderloin. Right. That's probably where a lot of people do. They're shitting, I love San Francisco by the way, but one of the things about them is that they're so progressive. There's, there's so left hard left that they just tolerate shit on the street bowl in like a really weird way. The homeless people in San Francisco tend to have a reputation of being aggressive and we were a karaoke night before I took the week cookie cookie of dude, I got it from a fan now we've since learned after our show here with her brother and the really fun and there was this homeless guy comes up.

Speaker 1:          00:32:23       He was like dancing to the music and it was like those scenes where everyone's having a fun, warm Christmas inside and then we'll come in. You want to dance. We bought him beers, went so well. It was my brother reacted like you and that's it. Everybody else. And then the match of the guys, we fucked dowels. Brought him in. We did buy him a couple of beers and then later found out he was an alcoholic, but he was already drunk. So I was like, Eh, this is not the day that he was. He was a veteran back on the wagon. And I asked him about him and his life and you know, when was the last time you hung out with? Like, I was just asking him about himself and he seemed to really like the way he was answering. And it was like no one ever asked me about me.

Speaker 1:          00:33:11       I'm like, whoa. He said it was like the best night of his life. And then he did mildly grew up Christina. Oh yeah. But again, I wasn't on the week cookie at that point. Shit, I really get groped a lot and I don't know what situation. It's like, you know, I grew up for your service. Where did he grow up? Me. I love how I'm asking Kerryn where and when I got slow, I like a city released from the hug. You know, sometimes like normally when you hug, you release out. You don't have to slide to release a minute. Wait a minute. He was drunk. Right? Who knows if he even knew what he was. You know what? I didn't care. That was what he did pretty, I'm pretty fluent in groping millions of lines, but she doesn't realize it. Are you sure you have the same definitions as her touching someone's breast without them wanting you to touch? It is growing, but it's tricky. If you have someone, you're holding them on the side and you listen. I'm not trying to know this guy lose his cameo on house of cards. It's fine.

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       I remember I say anything. Then you're like, no, not the policy. Hands off the breast. But you know, it was an, it was an area. One of the areas I do remember going, no, no, no. Don't ruin yourself for me, please. You guys were hanging out. You had a few drinks and he got feeling. Yeah, but I didn't get, I didn't care. I was happy that he had a good time and he was smiling. Not because he wasn't smiling because of that. Hopefully like a spectrum for sexual assault. Yes, there is. There's like the casual, like not quite touched your breasts, but hey, you went to, you grabbed me right here is getting, this isn't a hug. You using your hands is underwire. Right under tick on your hands is not good. I could feel breasts on a hug. Chest to chest hugs are good because his hands move to good. Even though you can feel it with your chest. You're not a hurricane. A hugger. Odd Girl. No, she is a good way stream. I, it's strange

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       to hug someone the first time you meet them without knowing anything about them. Like I w we shook hands and when I first met you and I will now hug you on the way out if I'm allowed with your consent, I want to consent. The was going for the hug and I was like, I don't know why he's thinking I was comfortable until you just used your hands. Is The underwire now I'm scared or did this,

Speaker 4:          00:36:02       I'll tell you that I'm very sensitive. Breasts on my crest. Mckee hug me. I don't really have a sensitive your face Danny Dick Style. Oh yeah. When a guy for five years, man that's over, jerked off in front of me, open the door once my trailing is jerking off, knocked on the door and let me open the door and he's jerking off and get into your trailer. I don't know what he was doing. He was either being silly, which is andy or he was high as fuck, which is Andy. He was looking to fuck me, which is also Andy. Yeah, he should have been a number of different things. Stephen and I might see him as my boyfriend and, and we've, we've met Andy, we hung out with a new bunch of, and it'll say in front of Steve, like when you get to leave your boyfriend and come fight where to stop.

Speaker 4:          00:36:49       Something like really funny in front of Steven and I fucking love it. Like I just get funny dude. He is, but he's, he has no filter and he has no control. And he wants to sometimes and like he'll go on, like he did my podcast once and he was talking about being sober. He's like, I'm sober now. I'm really happy I go, so you're going to stay sober. He goes, I don't know. We'll just have to see how it plays out. It was, but it was also one of those things where you, you understand his mindset is not like he, he's embraced his lack of control and some sort of strange way. Instead of like trying to re formulate the way he views the parameters that he establishes what for him to have a healthy, happy life because he was living in his ex wife's shed. He had a podcast called shed lights like that.

Speaker 3:          00:37:38       Yeah. Turn it into a comedy turn. Turn your shit. The shit show. That's what he called it. His programming is great. Does your also remember that reality TV show called the ass assistant, which is to this day one of the funniest things I've ever seen. It's right where you like abuse, potential assistance. Just funny physical, what? Back in the days when people could, you know, just appreciate physical assault for what it was. Yeah, let's go back to that time.

Speaker 4:          00:38:04       It's not the same with him because he's so crazy and you know it going in, but still, if you're standing next to him and then he just reaches over and grabs your tit, it's still wrong. Of course. I have a love for him in my heart that I, that part of who he is is like kind of like, you never know what he's going to do kind of thing. To me, I don't have it in my hand when I hang out with them. Like is it going to assault me? Like I never, I don't never think that, but it's, what I love about him is he's very unpredictable. He's a sweet, you know, and he's super

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       talented. Like I would do scenes together. I would have to Redo the scene over and over again cause I'd cry. Yeah, it'd be a real problem. He's really talented. Yeah. Well, the thing with him is,

Speaker 3:          00:38:46       yeah, when we met him, he was sober. So we kind of went into it knowing sober Andy Dick. And we actually met him at, I mean, I think it's supposed to be called these days Rehab facility. It was a halfway house. And we met him and he had just, I reached out and to his agent's assistant and he randomly agreed to do our podcasts. We met him in the music room of his a rehab facility. And he told us the only reason that he agreed to do the podcast was because he learned, uh, in a that as a, as an alcoholic, he's been really selfish, wasted people's time, hurt people. And so he said yes to doing guys we fucked because he was trying to make amends for all the bad he had done it. And I thought, I just thought that was really nice. Like what a, what a nice reason to do something. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       But he didn't do any bad to you guys. It sounds more like you want it to be on your podcast because it's popular.

Speaker 3:          00:39:36       No, no, he didn't. No, he had no fucking idea what it was. This was a couple of years ago. I know. Right. I miss, you know, he was in, it was, it was a Karma thing. I mean, yes, we aren't the people he hurt, but I think he was just trying to put good out into the universe and I really believed him and that's not something I would normally believe is like a year and a half, two years ago we interviewed, it was a while ago. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:39:54       that makes sense. Yeah. I mean he's, he's definitely had these moments of clarity. Yeah. Yeah. Well it was funny when he got fired from this movie recently for licking somebody and you said a misconduct is my middle name.

Speaker 3:          00:40:10       I agree. He's such a fucking care. Those I think about like, uh, the Wiva I have a monthly show that I run in New York City, uh, where my friend and I opened it up as characters, uh, need. And Simone were like, prostitutes. And where we have a guy, this guy will comes up and he intros us every month. And as I'll, I'll smack his ass and I've been thinking lately, I'm like shit probably shouldn't do that. Huh? Did you ask him if it's okay? No I did it. I just, I, I he doesn't did it mine or if he did, he didn't tell me. I mean he hasn't and we were were brand new take on it

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       is my take on it. There's a difference between girl doing it to a guy because a girl can't rape a guy. This is, you don't have a physical advantage over dry them. You could do anything shore if you drug them. But like smacking guy in the ass is very different. There were some women who are bigger than some men. Sure. Yeah. This is where those are outliers. There is absolutely the most part. There's a difference between a girl doing something like that to a guy and that's the difference.

Speaker 3:          00:41:05       Yeah. Cause you're no fear for your life. It's the physical threats.

Speaker 2:          00:41:09       Well, I got a buddy of mine who was sexually harassed by his boss was a woman and he said it was super fucking disturbing cause he's kind of introverted and is his boss would grab his ass when he was like getting coffee. Oh go to the coffee machine and she'd grab his ass, he'd Joel. And he was like really stunned and worried about being around her and she would tease him about him being approved and he said it made it really uncomfortable. And he said, now I know what like to be a woman.

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       And it was joking around about it, but yeah. Did you ever address it with her? No, I think he quit. Okay. One up quitting. It was a situation where I was like, you know, he was, he was below her in the, the social food chain of the office. She was his boss. She could fire him and you know, he wouldn't have any money and nobody would ever believe that she had done that to him. There was no proof there was, it was a weird sort of reversal of the dynamics.

Speaker 5:          00:41:58       And then that anxiety got created and he's working environment. I feel like women with women, it's like little things happen throughout your life when you're a chick that just, they're not, they don't make you feel unsafe. It's just like, ah, I just want to go to the God damn grocery store. Can you knock off to me? I just don't, and then that all adds up. Whether it's big things, little things is, and usually it's a combination of both and then that adds up to the feeling unsafe and then you hear stories and then you're like, oh fuck is.

Speaker 4:          00:42:24       Well the cosby thing freaked so many fucking people out, but I know a bunch of girls who've been drugged. I know a bunch of girls who have been at a bar and then how to drink that someone gave them, then all of a sudden their legs started giving out. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:42:38       [inaudible] as far as Ruthie, Ruthie, yes. This part ended there though. But yeah, I was somehow got, my friends were with me. It was at a bar, my own birthday party, a cup maybe when I was like 25 in that year of 24, 25 and uh, I was pushed in my, my friends pushed me in a cab because they just thought I was like, blackout drunk, but I really had been roofing that person's sins. Committed suicide. Yes. I'm not the person who roofie do. Yeah. I'm not mad. I knew who it was. I'm not, I'm not mad about it. People are like, aren't you angry? I'm like, no. That person had demons so much bigger than me getting roof. He didn't, I'm so thankful that nothing happened to me. Like I, I feel honestly, if that's what being a woman, that when you get roofie to, if you're lucky, you don't get raped.

Speaker 5:          00:43:21       I feel lucky. And that's being a woman. Yeah. It's weird to feel lucky that I've never been raped. It is. It's a, we're really luck because we hear about it. I mean, now the public is hearing about how often happens at Hollywood, which a lot of us already knew. But it happens in every economic status, every class of people, every eight. It happens so much. I mean we, it's to the point where a couple of times on our podcast, I've said statistically there has to be rapists listening to us. Somebody listening to us has, has raped somebody and I'm sure so fucking sick of hearing it. But I hear from the victims all God damn day and I, it doesn't help me get to the bottom of why this is happening. And so I'm like, if you're a rapist, make a fake email and email is, because I helped me understand this because I think about it all the time because we are constantly getting really pourable heartbreaking emails about it.

Speaker 5:          00:44:10       And we've had a couple of guys email us. One Guy, uh, was, uh, he said he was really sick and tired of seeing other men be Douche bags to women lie to women. And then they get laid. And by the time he turned 30 he said he broke and he started putting ads out on craigslist and then would rape the women. Then he still does it. But I'm like, the problem there is you felt entitled to a woman. Okay. Because he was acting like an asshole that has nothing to do with you. So I think that entitlement thing is, is an important building block in what, why people do this?

Speaker 2:          00:44:41       Well people start that. One thing that does happen, I've seen with men as they get older, as they start to associate women with pain because they get rejected and because they didn't try to hit on girls and they get shit on and they get rejected and they get angry. And then there's this antagonistic relationship between women and them. They look at women as the enemy and then they look at women as the cause of emotional pain and then they start to insult them and say nasty shit to them. I've seen it. I've seen it happen with guys where they, you know, they start off kind of like carefree and then as they get into their thirties and then they start getting more shitty and then they,

Speaker 5:          00:45:16       well you see the arc. I've seen the arc. Yeah, I've seen it. A couple of guys. Are they your friends? No. Okay. I was going to ask if you've ever talked to them about that because one thing I think would help is if dudes were like, hey, don't, don't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:45:28       Well, one of the reason why I'm not friends with, and one guy in particular is because of, uh, extreme lack of awareness that became more and more apparent as he got older where you couldn't talk to him about things. And if you can't talk to some about things, if they're doing something wrong and they're not going to ever learn, and if they're not going to ever learn and grow, you're always gonna have this weird blockade whenever you talk.

Speaker 5:          00:45:45       I hate that. Yeah, you can't talk to those people. It's just not one system because that's what that's he should learn. Like, hopefully if you lose it, if his friends continued to do that and he's like, wait, why the fuck weren't everybody go? Some people deep

Speaker 2:          00:45:57       seated trenches, these, these defense mechanisms that they just fall right into every time. And it's almost like they can't stay on the edges. Yeah. And whatever for whatever psychological reason. I mean, I'm not a psychologist, I don't know what's causing it, but there's, there's a lot of men that I think as time goes on and they get, maybe they're not attractive, maybe they're not successful. Maybe it's both. But as time goes on, they get more and more resentful and angry about women.

Speaker 5:          00:46:23       Yeah. Sometimes man, we meet men that are, you know, and it's not often, but you meet them and you're like, you hate women, you hate women. And a lot of times I've been doing this lately when we get like shitty things said to us on twitter, uh, all respond back with like, uh, you know, with a really nice thing to say, like a compliment. And then he'll, it'll like break them down and be like, Oh, who's brief on phony? And I'm like, okay. You know, and it's because to me when I see a man do that, when they do it, to me personally, it's hard not to take it personal, but that's, it's not a personal thing. They're projecting what they feel

Speaker 2:          00:46:56       do that to me all the time and they're doing it because they just want to get a reaction out of you. And one of the best ways to get a reaction down to you and make you feel bad. Yeah, that's true. If they say something nice to you, you don't respond, you know? And then,

Speaker 5:          00:47:06       oh, I just retweeted it. Well let me try it. Let me just, I want it to be honest. Maybe they try to respond. Thank you josh. Bond everybody. Right? What, when guys do that to you? Like what? What are the flag tries to say mean things Meghan call you a loser or whatever. And you know, there's always someone who's trying to push a button. Yes, I mean mean, but why

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       do they do that? This is the only reason cause they're losers. There's no one is like a happy, fulfilled person who hates on twitter. Doesn't exist. Do that exactly. I mean maybe you like I'm going to dedicate five minutes a day to be in a cut. I'm just gonna go online. I'm going to shit on people. Then I'm might go after cut times over. I'm going to just go water the garden and be nice to everybody and be very cathartic copies. You wouldn't do it. People need to squeeze in some current time in their day. I really think the social media version of a rage room where it's not really hurting anybody and no it's no one's actual dishes. You're breaking, someone's just bought at a thrift store and then you can let it out and then you can let your punching back cause God, John Ronson is one of the smartest people we've ever had the honor of talking to him and was super cry and he's like when are we going to stop making people are play thing or what?

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       What was the quote a week? People are play things or play toys like another quote that I don't know. It exists in chickens. You know, like I have chickens and one of the things you always hear about chickens is the thing called the pecking order. That shit is real as fuck and I, we have a big chicken coop, we have 22 chickens and one things that happens is the chickens will find the smallest chicken. They fucked that chicken. Oh my gosh. The other chickens will pile on and they'll chase the chicken around and peck it for no reason and sound like the chicken. So anything like it's just a smallest chicken because the chicken die sometimes. Sometimes chickens die and the other ones will peck at the whole, Oh my God. And try to eat it. Pitches being crazy terrifies her dogs and dogs. It exists.

Speaker 4:          00:49:09       There's the Alpha and then there's the Betas, wolf packs. It exists. I mean it's just a normal thing about nature where when humans see someone who's weak, you have to work very hard to resist the urge to go get the fuck Outta here, get your shit together, Pussy, stop fucking crying like that. That instinct to be cruel to someone whose week is like genetically predisposed and people, it's a part of what made the genes of the stronger people keep moving and ones that were weak and they couldn't handle emotional stress and then they were shunned when they were pushed out of the community. But we're finding now with this new society that live when we live in where people are able to gather information and communicate and doing things that don't even involve like person to person contact is that these people who are introverts and these people that are shy and maybe even like socially awkward or have are a huge problem with confrontation and you would consider them week. They have a type of creativity that doesn't exist in the Alphas. They have a type of creativity and they have a perspective and it may be in an introspective way of approaching things that is super valuable to like computer coding to a lot of other things that you would normally think of as being um, well they're not even normally think of, but it's

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       there. There are alternative methods of thinking.

Speaker 3:          00:50:31       You would perceive that an outgoing person would perceive that as like what are you an idiot or something? Well, they don't exist in the [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:50:36       normal paradigm. Like the, like if you look at human societies up until like the last couple hundred years, you're dealing with people that have these hardworking jobs. There's a few artists, musicians and painters and things along those lines. But most of what you're doing, if you're not a craftsperson, hard labor, very difficult jobs. There's no computer coding. There's no, there's no, well there's so many of these alternative positions as far as like the way the human mind works that were never available to someone who lived three, four, 500 years ago. So we're finding value, we're finding value in different kinds of thinking and people with a different people that are on the spectrum, asperger's and autism artist, while they have a different sort of intelligence and we are looking at them as if there's something wrong with them because they don't, they don't interact with people in the same way as most people do emotionally.

Speaker 2:          00:51:28       And sometimes they have like a real difficult funding, difficult time finding emotional and social bonds with people. But when it comes to numbers, when it comes to a lot of other things, some of these people, not all of them, but some of them excel at those things in a way that a lot of people can't, aren't even capable of. That's one of the things they say about people in Silicon Valley that work in a lot of, a lot of these um, jobs that involve computer coding and programming and things along that lines. You have a giant percentage of the people that are on the spectrum. Jonathan like it, it might be like 90 [inaudible] works there, but he's, yeah, he's not, he is mike much, much more social than me. You're not interacting with people a lot in that job. Yeah. That makes sense. That your bullock excel at that they want done.

Speaker 2:          00:52:08       You know, I think we have to realize that this is like if it was for you, the three of us, there'd be no fucking cell phones cause we were on a deserted island. You could live forever. The three of us, we live forever, whether it's his or her daughter and shit. The animals. Yeah. I've started a fire. Yeah. And we'd, I'd show you how to kill animals and maybe you guys could show me some emotional intelligence. Yeah, yeah. We can talk about working on feelings. I could make you a beautiful, like a mask for your face. You'd have great skin. Oh yeah. The urge to be cruel to someone who's weaker than you has to be resisted in, in any sort of a comfortable society. And that's not reinforced enough.

Speaker 3:          00:52:47       That should be on a bumper sticker. That trail where I thought you were going with this. I thought you were going to be, be like people who call a, you know, people out in a articles in jazz, the Bellin broadly are really meek when you meet him in person. That's what I thought that was, that's a good point. That's how I wasn't sure. And then I was falling and I was like, that's not at all where he's going with this. No, I think that's also true though. My experience is

Speaker 2:          00:53:10       kind of true in a lot of ways. But I think even what they're doing, like I don't want to mention anyone in particular, but this one particular feminist writer that I know who like will attack and go after women, she's like severely depressed and sad hurt. She's,

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       she's overweight and she's unhappy and unhealthy and it's, it's a, she aware of that core. Sorry. Okay. I got a mirror. You know, and you know what, thank you for saying that. Whether or not she revels in that awareness, right. But that's more, I guess what a lot of these people that are calling people out, look, there's people that are calling people out there doing the world a service because they're exposing real problematic behavior that I don't expect. Like, look what I was talking about my friend who gets sexually harassed by a woman. I don't experience that. Okay. I don't have a job where I have a boss who's a woman, you know. But if I was a woman and I had a boss who was a man who was trying to fuck me all the time, it would be, hell yeah. You know, what, if you, you know, you're worried you have to be a certain amount of flirtatious with this guy at a certain level so that you can maintain your position or maybe even like get a job, you know, a better job or promotion. I mean, that's some real shit.

Speaker 5:          00:54:15       Yeah. I mean it's also a place though too into like, even in comedy, like when Karen and I started comedy, I'm like, okay, I'm gonna I first made friends with older male comics because it was easier cause I hadn't, it's not that we wanted to fuck each other, but I at least had some, uh, currency in the flirting. Like there was currency in that. Like, no, it can be friendly with them and they will enjoy that and they would talk to you. Yeah. You just need to find people who are willing to give you the time of day. And a lot of times like it's because I want to look at you. So you're just like, but it's in a way that's not creepy. They don't cross a line. It's just, it's just like, we got our flow 40 and that's okay. You're just using each other, they're using you to feel good and young and sexual and you're using them to get comedy pro tip. Yeah. And none of us are being assholes to each other.

Speaker 4:          00:54:59       I mean, obviously we're talking about a bunch of different exchanges, but it doesn't always have to be negative either. Yeah. You can just be friendly with each other. Yeah. You know, like I, the last time I dated a female comedian, we were both 21 you know, and it was when I was in Boston and I was like, this is terrible.

Speaker 5:          00:55:15       Yeah. Yeah. As I say, it sounds like a bull fucking crazy. Sounds like the beginning of a bad wrong. It doesn't. Yeah. It doesn't work. But I think one of the things that happen, and we can work comedian Thomson around Christina possess gaelic super happy and yeah, they're both really funny. Bonnie and red rash. Yeah. Oh my God. I'm Natasha and they are a great couple. We found three thousands and thousands of sure. Interactions. Meyers. Yeah, that's a good one as well.

Speaker 4:          00:55:43       Sometimes it works. Sometimes it works. And we looked, I hate absolutes. Right. I never do this or never do that unless you saying like never eat babies.

Speaker 5:          00:55:51       Right. That's a good absolute to have a good one. Nope. Time. Um, but like also too with the flirting thing, I'm more comfortable, there was a time where I look back, I'm like, I don't not friends with any big female comedians. It's only male because I feel more comfortable going up to the mail cause I feel like there's something of like, I have something to offer only it's only flirting. That's it. We're not going to, I've never, I've had been in a relationship as long as I've been doing standup, so, but if not a fool, I would have probably fucked a lot comics, but a better this way, you know? And uh, but probably now

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       for sure. But when I think of going up to everybody, I know it's great going up to a woman. No, no. My boyfriend, boyfriend, my boyfriend's guide. But you know, in the past you could book a great open mic. Yeah, good. But going up to a female comic, I'm like, what do I have to, why would she want to talk to me? Because you're a human. Why would, why you may think of that? [inaudible] want to talk to me? Well, you're looking at yourself as what you're like the shit.

Speaker 2:          00:56:50       Yeah, but I mean, I've been doing standup for a long time. I've always had men friends that are coming in and friends and men and women friends.

Speaker 1:          00:56:57       Yes. I have friends that are female friends that are comedians. A lot that are on our same level. That started in the same time as us, but like, you know, a pro. I remember when I asked Bonnie Mcfarlane do the podcast. I was really nervous to approach her. She was super sweet and she was like, yeah, she's so supportive of other women. Reach whining. Just really champion championing women aren't funny. Her documentary. Yes. Yes. For. I liked it a lot. It's so funny. It's really and really like raw. Yeah. Opened up about a lot of shit. Yeah. I surprised. No, I've known Bonnie forever. We still have the same manager. Oh really? She's 1990. Oh, it was like, was it mine? Oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:57:31       Or some shit like that long ass time ago. She's awesome. But it's um, it's a different animal when, when you're a woman, you know. Yeah. And I think that's one of the things that I'm Eliza brought up when she was talking about this a whole Louis C k thing. She was talking about how some men, especially when she first started with treat her because she was just starting out, she wasn't very good yet. You know, she was, and someone who is established and is better and really has like their careers cooking, they will look at you like you are a lesser thing than them. They don't look at you like a peer. And I tried to tell this to as many young comics as I can. Um, that is incredibly important that we look at all of us, all of us that are doing this thing as the same thing.

Speaker 2:          00:58:16       Yeah. Somebody might be doing it for three days and someone might be doing it for 30 years, but we're all doing the same thing. We're all together. Yeah. So like doorman, like I, I'm super friendly with everybody who works at the comedy store is a great example that because everybody who works there is a comic. Like, yeah, the people who are the, the security or comics, a lot of people that were managers were comics and people, bartenders are comics. I know like a lot of the people like Josh Martin and Punky there, they're fucking comics. Even paid regulars and they still work. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:44       Oh Wow. That's cool. So there's a like an intense community there. It's, it's, it's, it's amazing. And then you never get a place where you have a pro shows every night and an indie show upstairs like that. Never, there's no place in New York that has won multiple rooms like that. A couple do, but their not, the quality of, of the spectrum of, of Comedians in terms of experience is, is so vast. Any night of the week there. And it's so cool.

Speaker 2:          00:59:09       And that's really supportive. Yeah, it is a super support and people that are not supportive, they get pushed.

Speaker 1:          00:59:15       Oh, and I love that. I think the comedy community in New York too was very supportive and we're very, we do bet we give each other when, when

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       we think of goods and it's, we just, we, we talk about comedy, we live and breathe it and we nerd out on in the green rooms and we really are supportive and, and uh, yeah, I like it. It's awesome. It did. Don't you guys think that now it's easier to do that too because it's not like everyone's competing for a very small amount of spots. Like it used to be like there was only so many spots on a sitcom. There's only so many spots to host a late night show and everybody was like hyper competitive. Yeah. Now

Speaker 3:          00:59:48       you're on opportunity. Create your on saying, I mean there's some examples of it guys. We fucked one of them. I'm broad city. Yeah. I love the story of broad city. Abby and Alana couldn't get on house teams. They just kept getting rejected from house teams at UCB. They were, they started working on this web series together. It blew up. I mean, the quality of the web series before I made it to air is phenomenal. They just put a lot of hard work into it and they said, we're not going to take no for an answer. And if this community that we've worked in so long is saying no, we're going to do it on our own. And they did,

Speaker 2:          01:00:16       you can do that. And also one of the things is that like podcasters and people that do things online, they support other people to do things online. Like you never see someone from a show on CBS getting promoted from a show on NBC. Right, right. Super Rare. But in the world of podcasting, it's super common. Yeah. Like everybody has everybody on their shows and we always talk everybody up and hey, go see she's playing here. And he's playing there and you promote their dates and it's a, it's a way more egalitarian, way more like supportive community. And it's a win win for everybody because it never feels good to be supportive of people you respect and admire.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       Talented. And you know, and, and it too, that's why I love standup because you're the only one who's going to do your act. Yeah. So don't worry about the company. Hopefully. That's true. Yeah. But uh, but yeah, I mean there's only one. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:01:03       You and the people that are shitty to other comedians they get, I mean, if you're a comic, you don't have any comedian friends. Like that's, that's a giant problem.

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       Just like a famous person. Oh, you can think of a lot of famous one. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:01:19       Some famous ones that come to the store and the, the door people get super bummed out and just look past them. They don't say hi to them. They'll go straight to bill burr or straight to someone famous and only talked to them and they don't talk to regular folks,

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       I feel like too. But I've had interactions with famous comics. Like the first one, the person was being a dick and just like looking down and, and I was being introduced by his friend and he was like, hey, how are you doing when it had sunglasses indoors? I'm like, yeah, but it was La Barf all over. You gimme a name they rhyme with. Well you're going to absolutely know. But then the second time we met him, if some couldn't have been nicer, maybe going through some weird shit. Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:01       Somewhat run into someone like at the wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:02:03       Yeah, and I labeled them. I labeled them an asshole though. He was going through some shit while showing pictures of himself to another person. But then is that how you act out sometimes if you're having a bad day or you're like, just go right to naked photos. Yeah. Get those modes in baby. Only if my ass, I just show them my app. Oh, that's what I do. Do you take nudes? No. Why not? Thinking of doing it now? Really just from two seconds. I want to see your recommended it, but just to be like a close up your butthole. Let's redefine the nude. I don't have any that I need to show anybody. Yeah, no. Do you, have you ever taken one? I don't need to see it. Uh, I'm sure I've taken pictures of it. Okay. Really just for because it was, cause you have a camera.

Speaker 1:          01:02:46       Good lighting, dude. He started taking pictures of everything. Take pictures of my policy. I never taken a picture of my po. I've never taken it as a check. If you have a weird feeling down there and just make sure everything's okay, it's, it's your own doctor. If I was a girl, I would definitely take pictures so I would really know what it looks like cause otherwise you can't really see it. Just a gold squat. A mirror. Yeah. Or you're super flexible. You'd have to like, oh Geez. One of them tap around. You've got to be a contortionist back. See my own pussy from here. Yeah, but you can't because we were discussed that you've seen the Labia, you're not really sure. We'll see. Is the whole thing right? The giant. It hugs the Tampon. That's the vagina would be the whole thing. I would say the Vaginas, just the, the, the whole that we're most concerned about. The Pussy is the house,

Speaker 2:          01:03:31       but the vagina is like the living room.

Speaker 1:          01:03:34       Okay. I think so. Okay. Yeah. You could be wrong. He could be right. And I honestly don't know which one it is. That's why we're relatable. Were you, when you started like being sexually active when you were younger, were you like a vagina? How do I, what do I even, what do I do? I, cause I kind of feel like men going into straight and by men that are going to be having sex with women. Like seib confusing cause it dick. It's like you have to void the Dick. Yeah, you already have one. But also like a woman as a woman who doesn't have a dick. I feel I know what to deal with it a little. Well guys share information with each other to grow. Share information about what to do with Dick's. Yeah, I didn't know guys shared information for sure. Oh because we've heard a lot guys like don't talk about it. I'm like why not? What you missing out on some tips? What's some information you've got and oh you just start talking about like a, what do you do? 18 or 15 the 1st of May going out with a girl. Like you should let your finger. Yeah. Bring Nice, clean being fingered at 14 is a fucking worst. It's just like Jack Camera. Like someone's ringing a doorbell inside. Yeah. They're not clean. Yeah. And there is no doorbell, but they don't know that. Oh, you got to pretend. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:04:42       yeah. It sucked. Well jackhammer fingers, man. It's gotta be better now then when we were young and it's gotta be better when we were young then when our parents were young. That is very true. It's all, and don't think that's the same thing. I mean I think that's with everything. I think one of the things that's going on right now, and one of the things with, uh, all this sexual assault stuff that's making the news is that we're, we're in the middle of a giant social change. I feel that too. And it's like our hurricane around us and fucking bathtubs and are flying through the

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       air and we're in the middle of it. And I think a lot of times you don't realize how much change is actually taking place. But if you just try to look at comedy from the 1980s and look at comedy from now, like what you can get away with then and we you like go watch Eddie Murphy Raw. And you would never do that today? No. Carla like a lot of them had like a lot homophobic shit. But you know Andrew dice clay would never fly today. Maybe because he was a director. I don't know. I don't know that that would work. He used to be Andrew Silverstein, you know Andrew Silverstein was, he would do straight stand up and then he had a bunch of characters he would do. One of the characters he's just do was the dice man dies, man. He put the jacket on, do these nursery rhymes.

Speaker 4:          01:06:07       Fuck yourself. He would just light a cigarette. Yeah. And then he became the dice man. It's like more comfortable to be that guy all the time. Yeah, that's true. That makes sense. It's comfortable being in a character. I'm not my stage. My bits are very, well, there's a lot of people that have done that and they got trapped like emo Phillips got trapped. I Aye. Yes. I just watched a documentary at dying laughing. I think it's called and he was on hell no, he's not like that cause I saw him when he stopped doing that. He stopped doing that for awhile and then he went back to it. Bobcat goldthwait talk to me about it. Like you talked about it on the podcast. It was really hard for him to stop doing it because everybody's like, hey man, do the Bob cat thing. He's like, Hey, fuck you.

Speaker 4:          01:06:49       I'm just a person just going to do my standup. And he's like, for a long time it was like really hard. Oh that would piss me off because everybody wanted him to go this thing for the longest time and he just got older and it was like, what the fuck am I doing? Oops. And it was really funny when he was younger then it just didn't want to do it anymore. But if you have that character, like if you're in a character all the time, you get stuck. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean we see hard to perform it never feel like yourself. That's what I like about it and that's why their objections stings that much more because like you were rejecting my soul or rejecting you or what you're presenting. Then you really got to take a second and think, well, I think for sure this is a tumultuous time of change and I think ultimately it's going to be very good, but I think I got some weird ideas on it though.

Speaker 4:          01:07:39       I really think that one of the things that holds us up is the ability of ally and I think that that's, that is not forever. I think the ability to lie, like I think I, I believe that we are, I don't know how many years away, whether it's 10 or 20 we're 20 whatever it is, years away of some Rosetta stone of human interaction that takes place electronically. I think they're going to figure out some way where we can teach children a language that's a universal language that's transmitted through computers or through some sort of a human internet interface, some sort of a neural interface that they're

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       working on hundreds of different versions of this right now where there they can already send thoughts back and forth to people from the Internet. They can send images to other people's minds. One person could send an image of a triangle to your mind.

Speaker 5:          01:08:29       They can currently do that current. Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:08:31       They do it through some sort of electrical stimulation of various parts of the brain where you send a signal and that signal through your thoughts of this object. Like you have this idea like say if you think of a bottle of water like well something really a triangle. Let's go back to that shape. It's a very obvious sit symbol, right? You know what it looks like. I know what it looks like and if I can think of that, there is a pattern in my brain that I can transmit to you through this very rudimentary technology. So I, I liken it to like a Morse code machine.

Speaker 5:          01:09:00       Did do,

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       they used to be able to communicate with those as good as you get. Now obviously you took a video on your phone, he sent it to someone New Zealand, right. It's, we're, we're in a different world. It's not that far away. I mean you're talking about just a couple of hundred years. We've gone from the Morse code to sending a video to New Zealand in real time.

Speaker 5:          01:09:18       Well have you ever heard of a Fisher Wallace stimulator? I've heard of that. Yeah. So my mom has had depression most of her life and she was, has been on 25 different meds and made her worse. And as a doctor prescribed a Fisher Wallace stimulator, it's just a little tiny machine with two pads or sponges. You what the sponge is a little bit and you put them on your temples. And she did it twice a day for about 20 minutes. And her fucking depression went away. And I felt, felt like I got my mom like a, you know, cause she just, it, the meds would just make her so numb and like emotionless and that would depress her and she like, I just lived my whole life I've been seeing her do these peaks and valleys and the Fisher Wallace stimulator, there's no side effects. If anything she gets a headache but there's no mental side effects and uh, and hurt.

Speaker 5:          01:10:08       It's insane how often the chef to do it. She has it twice a day. The only thing that I've noticed it, I guess it, this is a side effect. It makes her a little bit hyper and not hungry. She's getting are both hyper. I'm trying to tell as many people about. But I'm wondering if that's similar types of technology that are already happy. What if it'll make you fucking ecstatic? I don't know, but that's what I was wondering. I'm like, Mako borrow. If you slap that bitch on when you get on that Japanese toilet, hot water pumping up your claim like a molly machine. Yeah. Whoa. Put those babies on a, I've got to go to the bathroom now. That's great. Yeah, I just got to go light 20 milligrams. I had a fan, gave us a cookie in San Fran and uh, it was labeled, you know, but I didn't know how much he ate and we had to go on a plane. So I'm like, I'm going to throw this out. And I was like, at the end of a two week tour, we're doing two shows and I was so tired. I'm like, I don't want to get held up on the plane. So I took a little chunk, I ate it and then it kicked in when we were at the gate. And crim was like, I'm gonna go get starbucks. You want anything like that? Fine. And

Speaker 3:          01:11:13       then all of a sudden I'm like, no, I'm not fine. And I texted chrome like, you're going to hate me, but uh, oof. I'm going to die soon. And uh, this is not okay. And then I just started having a panic attack is already someone who is not going to have flying. No. Yeah, I would have panic attacks all the time. And then there's like, I was bawling my eyes out in this

Speaker 4:          01:11:31       little girl came up like two feet in front of me and she was like,

Speaker 3:          01:11:35       and she just tilted her head and stared at me and my career. Why is she doing that? That's weird. Yeah, it was. I thought I was going to die. I, that's the only time in my life I ever remember having the feeling of like, you're about to die. I got a nine little girl just came over like a normal little girl. And then when Christina said, why is this little girl looking at me? And I said, probably because she's never seen a grown woman have a tantrum in an airport and anxiety tantrum. And then, oh, getting on that plane, man. I thought I was gonna get kicked off that plane. She, uh, she almost did because it wants to it, I think in 2017, like saying did, she's not, I was like, she's not good at flying like that does, that doesn't fly anymore. And, uh, the lady was like, does she need to get off? And I was like, no, she's fine. She's going to be fine. We're going to get through this. We're going to get back home. How far? How far was the flight? Oh, it's from San Fran and New York, right? Yeah, it was all cross country.

Speaker 3:          01:12:30       An hour after I got home to my apartment, she just put a blanket over her and I was like, why? We're going to have like,

Speaker 4:          01:12:36       it was good. It was, well you wrote the Ro the storm. I did and I survived. Goddamn. But yeah, the edibles fucked me up. Well, they're just too God damn strong. Especially if you just try to eat a whole cookie. That could have been hundreds of milligrams. I just took a little chunk of it. It was a big ass cookie and I took a quarter of it. But then also, well yeah, quarter but that's why I'm scared like Corindus psychedelics. I, I feel like if you have anxiety, I've had a lot of anxiety, probably not for me it's a different thing because the anxiety that you get from edible marijuana is very peculiar. It's intensely introspective. Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:13:14       I don't love edibles either. I much prefer mushrooms, acid. I did DMT recently. I studied using partially using your documentaries. The thank you. Yeah. Thank you. It was very important. I mean cause that's scary shit. You need to study.

Speaker 4:          01:13:26       Yeah. It's definitely not something you should take.

Speaker 3:          01:13:29       No, absolutely not. I studied for, I had it sitting on my table and I studied for like a good two months. Watched a lot of stuff on the Internet. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:13:36       A lot about it. Talk to people who had done it. What's crazy is a natural part of human neurochemistry chemistry that exists, that your brain's making that stuff all the time and then you can just extract it from a thousand different plants and then you take it, smoke it, and then you meet Jesus and aliens and everything. Have you met Jesus? Meet everything. Things that are changing. So whatever the fuck they were a second ago, they're not the same thing a second later shift. This is pretty fucking intense. Such a curious person and you really try has, has psychedelics made you cause people, it really makes a

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       positive shift in their consciousness and their curiosity. I've seen it happen and sometimes it goes the other way but um, is that where we always are kind of purposes

Speaker 2:          01:14:20       curious, but it made my curiosity, it confirmed the need for it like that. If you do, when you do something like Dmt, it is so profoundly bizarre that after it's over you are so stunned at how few people know about this and how you didn't know about until that happened and how you'll never be the same again. Oh you'll never be the same again. No. Right. Are you never going to be the same again? Cause you know that's a real, you know that you could go through this chemical portal to what's essentially another dimension. I mean is it sounds like it another dimension where you're, you are interacting with ideas that seem to be sent in. They seem to be alive. You're, you're, you're, you're being inundated with thoughts and words that come at you without like a physical presence. Like no one's saying a word. But like if I said to you, hey, let's get a cup of coffee, like that signal goes into your brain because you're hearing my words. You interpret them. You get the same thing from these dmt states, but you don't actually hear the words. But you know what the words are fucking titanic. Really Bizarre.

Speaker 5:          01:15:28       Have you ever seen a heel, like a psych Akilah or have you ever had I've ever heard a psychic surgery and believe them, so I, okay. I don't like, I never really talk about this cause I don't, I don't need people, I'm not trying to convert anybody to believe in this shit, right. But I've had psychic surgery once and I, and my mom and I had from this work, uh, so he, this guy, his name was Dr V. Uh, and he did, I did have my shirt off the, that you wake up, know what? Ours is another revolution of another sexual assault. I was conscious the whole time, but, uh, I like my mom had, uh, breast tissue that was really hard in her breast because she had all these surgeries for, to get little tumors removed, they weren't cancerous and it really hurt or like if you've touched her boob, like it would hurt and he, okay, so this doctor, he used to work for NASA and a, he's Russian and he, he's very mysterious.

Speaker 5:          01:16:21       You looked into his background. I tried to Google it, but I didn't have the, I didn't have, it didn't seem, which we're going to new, a tiny little apartment and this old lady was answering and she was like, come in. And I'm like, but uh, but he did, he didn't touch her and he just, he kept moving his hands like this and he would, he would do this, like he was trying to get warm and then he would flick it and then he would, he would circle around her boob and then pull out like an imaginary thing and it was gone. The heart tissue was gone. It's the weirdest fucking thing. And he did it to me with my knee. It was the weirdest thing. And I mean it's like seeing a ghost like you. You don't, you're like, I need that just happened. That's undeniable.

Speaker 2:          01:17:01       Well, if you believe in it, your body can produce some pretty incredible results. And that's what the power of suggestion is. That's what placebo effect is. Placebo effects a hundred percent real totally. But I didn't even know that psychic surgery was a thing before he actually did it. I had no, he's not doing anything. He's just getting you convinced that he's doing something and by him being convincing you that he's doing something, you feel some sort of a positive response because your body reacts as if he's done something to you. That's a service in and of itself. Yeah. I mean, I'll take it is, it is a service in and of itself, but it's also deceptive. There's a weird thing that people do, like where they, you know, there's a lot of weird healers where they do like Reiki and all this different shit. I am, there's no science behind it. It's not, it's not real. But if you think that it's doing something to you, you can feel better. [inaudible] acupuncture. I don't know anything. I don't know. I've had it. I've had it, but the guy was a quack, but it doesn't mean that it's not real.

Speaker 3:          01:17:55       That's the I'm, I'm very skeptical, but I was working in a, but that was like a receptionist at a spa was my day job while pursuing comedy and there was an acupuncturist there and I was like, let me try it. Really? I was in a really deep depression and like the mind body connection, I got to say she and she's, and she's an md. She's not just the person off the street. This woman's an MD, a young woman, and it, it changed my life and I hate to even say that I'm embarrassed to even be like I have an acupuncturist. It seems so hippy dippy mind

Speaker 2:          01:18:26       body connection is a misnomer, right? Because your mind is a part of your body. I mean it's all one thing. That's why one of the things with people don't have healthy bodies. Yeah. But if you don't have a healthy body, your mind's not going to function at its best. You can be a brilliant person with an unhealthy body. Yes. But you will be better if you, your body functions well. It's not giving you trump problems. It's not causing you issues. Yeah. It's not a, uh, like a source of stress and concern. And I think that what these people can do or there's a lot of different things that are not supportive whatsoever by science and a lot of people that are very scientifically minded, they ish, they, they shun those things and they think those things have zero benefit. And they also put religion in that group as well.

Speaker 2:          01:19:09       And I think they're very similar in that if you believe in certain things like a, there was a thing that, a article recently by Robert Sapolsky who is a, um, he's a out of state, he's a professor at Stanford University and we had him on the podcast. We talked about, um, about primates and he's a really, really fascinating guy. Scott, some amazing studies that he's done on baboons and primate behavior. But one of the things he was talking about is the stress relieving aspect of, uh, an actual religious belief. So you could say that if you really do believe that everything's going to be fine cause God's looking out for you, that just, that alone, whether or not it's real or scientifically verifiable, that proof or it is not necessary for you to feel good. Yeah. I mean I choose to be a positive person because that's my survival mechanism. I wouldn't have made it through life without being positive. Positive is one thing, but an actual belief that something is happening to your body that's not scientifically possible like that someone can rub their right I all the bad juju out of your body. Yeah. But if you believe that though, just the belief in that can trigger a lot of what human neuro chemistry that literally will make you feel.

Speaker 5:          01:20:18       That's true. I can now, uh, after that experience, that was a couple of years ago, I can, if I like lay on my bed and meditate, I don't really do that cause I don't have time. But I can, if I think really hard, I can make certain parts of my body like have those pins and needle feeling, which I'm like, that's cool.

Speaker 2:          01:20:33       You should make the time. You probably do have kind of cool. Yeah. But it's weird like people worry about like the discipline of doing something like that, that it, it, it gets them concerned. Like I don't have time for that. And they pushed it off because this is something, there's a weird way that human beings are programmed that we, we avoid certain types of strenuous activity. Avoid getting up early when you know you should, there's a lot of things that we do where we go towards comfort and a way from these uncomfortable feelings and some of those uncomfortable feelings are just sitting alone, meditating, just sitting alone and concentrating on your breath for 20 minutes a day. Yeah. Yeah. Big benefits to that.

Speaker 5:          01:21:11       But yeah. And then you get down on yourself and then that stress and then you're like, whoa shit. And then you're in your room all day and you're like, fuck that. Then you go on the Internet and then you're saying your room for another week and then you read some bad comments. He's just masturbate real comments. That's the key to life. Not really give a shit about the comments.

Speaker 2:          01:21:28       I don't read them. Yeah. I very rarely will like glance through and look really quickly, but if I do it once a day,

Speaker 5:          01:21:34       oh yeah. Well sometimes I want to get pissed off and then sometimes we just make fun of it cause it's so hot. It's hilarious. We've had like a men's rights activists write articles about us, like calling has come dumpsters. I love it. And I didn't know that. I didn't know the phrase cum dumpster. How'd you make it to this part of life? I don't know. Did you feel least barfed first sentence in our book is, are you a degenerate cum dumpster? Unworthy of love and affection, a zealot. Somebody called you unworthy of love and affection that we said that we had sand in his cum dumpster.

Speaker 2:          01:22:07       Yeah. That's hilarious. If he said that, that would've made it even better because then you would know like how broken a person.

Speaker 5:          01:22:13       No, we had an inkling. That whole article. Yeah, it was fine. But that's how I like, to me that's the best feeling of like hate taking control of the situation by reading it and then roasting them. Human intelligence is far greater than a insulting

Speaker 2:          01:22:28       people. Did. You guys don't say mean Shit about men? I mean you're, you're pretty honest. Yeah. But you're not like anyone else. You're not negative. You're not like, you're not like anti men. Women, you mean you, you, you rightly,

Speaker 5:          01:22:41       no, not at all for shit that they've done. That's fucked up. But you, you guys aren't, we love the show is called guide. We fuck. Yeah. It's not like you guys were spit on guys. We kicked in the Dick. I love having sex with men. I like how you guys say it. Two guys. We fucked. And that's why to say it that way. Fun Park yet. But our, her we're far definition of feminism is women can be pieces of shit too. Yeah, it is. And I think that for men, I think it's a good

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       thing to be able to listen to women talk unfiltered. And I don't think and guys avoid that. They go to war here with these bitches have to say, you should listen. You should listen in, in a, not saying that you should listen because you have to agree with them, but you will gain a more of an understanding of how someone who is very different than you views maybe the exact same interaction and just that, just that one look at another perspective might make you sit back and go, okay, maybe I need to look at it from their point. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:23:35       Oh it's the best. And my favorite email is when a guy emails on and he's like, I gotta be honest. I listen to your podcast. I was expecting to like jerk off and shit, but I actually learned something. I'm like, oh bless you. I love you. Jerk off and shit. Sorry to disappoint. But I know that I love that we like that's the best. When you, when you, when you surprise somebody I think is, and the name of the podcast is people are going to either go, that's hilarious or that's discussing or what, or whatever the reaction is. They're going to check it out. They're going to remember. They're surprised by what they hear because it's not what they expected. It sticks. It's stronger.

Speaker 2:          01:24:08       Do you guys feel like the podcast has helped you understand yourselves and grow better?

Speaker 3:          01:24:14       Yes. Yeah. I mean that was it. We had no choice but to grow. When you have, when you're sitting down with people who you've had these intimate relationships, uh, both emotional and sexual with, it's just like holding a mirror up to yourself. And that was the concept. The concept was kind of to do this podcast much like John cusack and high fidelity and just learn about yourself through these people kind of slide you human yelp reviews.

Speaker 2:          01:24:37       Well, don't you think? You also learn about yourself from conversations where you're not looking at your phone, you're not checking the internet, you're not watching television, just sitting there for hours communicating with each other and that's a lost art.

Speaker 3:          01:24:48       It is an eye. We forget that the microphones are on. We forget that we're talking all the time. Well, one of the things that's changed for me is I settle the podcast. That, and that was the first time I ever said out loud. I was like, I really want to see my boyfriend. Fuck another woman. I just wanna like masturbate to it. And then Steven and it must have been like, well he edits the podcasts and he's like hey you want to uh tell me something. And I was like what the three way thing you want to see me. I'm like Oh yeah. And then we've had three ways and it brought us closer and it's so hot. So I have a cuckolding fetish that I didn't even realize I had queens queen. That sounds so we don't say that one cause it's, that's what you type in to porn hub. But it's like really cause it just cause it's a chick but it's queen that Q, u. E a. N. It's just like cut. It just sounds like q u. E. A. N. C. U. C. K. Q. U. E. A. N is queen. Don't Google it. No, come on. It'll be fun I believe yet. Yes it's cut queen. Cause I was looking up cuckold and I'm like why the fuck can't I get shit? And I'm like, dissolve for men. And then a duty male means like just diamond cook queen and it's fine.

Speaker 2:          01:25:56       Oh, okay. That wasn't the whole thing though was like guys that are like emasculated, like some big black dude comes in, right?

Speaker 3:          01:26:01       Yeah, yeah. Those I don't, and

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       you cry in a corner and you jerk. That's your lube. Yeah. And then one of them was like, at the end of it, the guy came in the other guy's mouth and I was like, whoa. I made the guy that took another, that's another category. It wasn't in it in the first place. It was all strictly for research. Right at the end of it, I was like, rope, this would that poor guy that just sits there and pretends, I mean it guess it's a guy who wanted me to suck a dick and they brought him in, they gave him a script and he's like, okay, I need to see these imt. But I mean the, the, the, the thing that they're projecting like this, this vision of like this poor guy who's with this hot girl and he can't control or any, can't satisfy or, but they're together. And then the big blackout comes over to sit the fuck in the corner and watched me, fuck your woman. And then, and he's like, do you watch just a couple? Okay. Uh, what were you researching? I don't like

Speaker 3:          01:27:00       that's what you're talking about. Googling a product. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:27:04       And know how I got there. Somebody probably googled it for me and then made me look at it. It was like, I don't even orgasm my pants off this. Do you watch a lot of porn? That a lot. What's that to you? What's not a lot like once or twice a week. Oh yeah. That's not a lot at all. Yeah. I think porn is like anything else. You can get obsessed with it. People get obsessed with all sorts of things and the porn gives you a stimulation, right. And that stimulation is, you're watching two people sexually interact with each other and you can pretend you're there. You can pretend you're doing it, whatever weird stimulation it is that that like weird thing that you're doing. People will numb themselves with that if they have too much stress. If there's too much going on their life and the it, it becomes almost like a drug.

Speaker 4:          01:27:51       Yup. And then after you're done jerking off and you call me, you're like, well why was I even doing this? What? I'm going to go eat cake and it's just sadness. That can happen too. I was like, can you say I feel pretty good after but I don't consume a ton of porn. Yeah, I was getting too much. I was like, you know what, I'm going to try masturbate into my mind and it's a lot more work but it's more rewarding. I love masturbating to I my imagination. I've got to start masturbating natural people. Yeah I know people you know like truck drivers.

Speaker 3:          01:28:17       I don't know any truck drivers using, if you weren't using your real people, were you cleaning Pten, creating beans in your mind? Yeah, the sims and my head. No, just imagining my boyfriend fucking somebody else. Oh like a real hot chick. Cause I'm like, I always think so high other people, and normally not my boys, but I, you know, I'd never allow my brain to like let's masturbate to like a that neighbor guy that we had or airbnb. Goddamn. And I did masturbate to him and it was really fun because cause I'm like, oh what are you playing a new game? And we got a new kid. It's like candy crush. Yes. But it's really fun. It's like you can go there in your head and he doesn't know that. So it's cool. You didn't hurt him, you didn't hurt your boyfriend and yeah, I didn't hurt anybody. It

Speaker 4:          01:28:59       doesn't seem the same as if you found out that a, that you know is

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       jerking off to you. I just don't want to find out. But if you're doing it, that's okay. They shouldn't dm you and tell you like so many men do. It's like you keep that to yourself. I don't mind if people jerk off to me, but I should never know about it. And we agree there's a difference between a girl saying that she plays with herself to you versus a godsend that he plays with them or a girl, a girl saying it to a guy is different than a guy saying it to a girl came up to me is like I jerked off to once. I'm like, no, I don't know. I get excited. It depends on how much schlage has. You were attracted to him probably. I mean, and that's, and that's this thing that we liked to pretend that's not true. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:29:37       If he was like this hot, sexy guy and he told me that, I'd be like, well like that article that I was pulling the sit on Joe's toilet for a little bit, an article that I pulled up before we started the podcast. Well there was a that a women and straight and gay men are more attracted to good looking muscular men, which shows that we're not making any progress with sexual gender stereotypes. Like no, that's not it. And that was like Newsweek or it's the same. This space go to the safest space, which is my favorite, one of my favorite twitter pages because they will retreat the most ridiculous social justice warrior men with muscles and money are more attractive to straight women and gay men showing gender roles aren't progressing. It's in tech and science. First of all, it's not tax, but it's not science that has god to have nonsense by a male. Sydney are female. I need to know, I mean, it matters not showing gender roles aren't progressing. Yeah. Neither does hot stays hot. Stupid. No. It's like if you use a lighter and you burn your skin, it stays hot. We're not progressing in our ability to defuse fire with your fucking skin.

Speaker 1:          01:30:54       To me, I like it because that means you're driven and you don't sit on your ass all day. No one wants to fuck a lazy person. I mean, if you do, that's your own thing. But uh, but also muscles. You don't like monster. I was gonna say, I was like, I wasn't surveyed for that, but I'm more attracted to somebody who truly like comedian, like funny. When you're funny. That is so much hotter to me. You could be overweight, you can be under what you could be whatever. When you're funny. Well, isn't that the thing about what is attractive is that everybody's got their own little thing. There's, there's some pretty standard things, but then when that go left or right and a bunch of different weird ways and that's kind of one of the cool things about being a person. You know? I know some women that are into like really skinny guys, like super skinny like ribs that heroin looks.

Speaker 1:          01:31:48       Some girls think that's high. I can't see that being high. My boyfriend is always like, I want to get skinny. Like iggy pop. I'm like no sex. Then chunk stars. That's my God. It was like a guy with like a legit gut. That's like Dave. I mean the Dave Matthews that people love that. And if David, Dave Matthews lost, he has a little belly. Yeah. And if he doesn't have that belly less hot. Have you ever been attracted to somebody, made you feel uncomfortable or attracted to them because it's not your type, but usually just take such great care of his body working out and we're like, we like fat three Paul triple out and get a donut machine. Definitely rooted out by weird stuff like the skinny one. The skinny ones were because that's like an unhealthy thing that could be looking at someone and they look like that.

Speaker 1:          01:32:39       Iggy pop look is like, boy he doesn't look healthy, was still using drugs and he still skinny. But it just Kinda, I think I like a guy that's bigger than me though. Like physically bigger than me cause I like that. Cause then when he hugged me exactly, there's a, it was pretty good actually. I take that back. He's got some muscles and he did a song with Kesha. That's an old man too. I mean that's impressive. He's 60 years old. They're like, yeah, that's him. Young man gets so much harder as they get older. There's some women though that just are, so we went to this summit that was like a lot of females. It was just female speakers, but women of the year summit chick's doing rad shit. Right. And this woman Sheila Nevins who's the head of documentaries at Hbo, I've never heard of her.

Speaker 1:          01:33:35       She is the sexiest woman I've ever seen. She hurt her style and her confidence is very, she's very graceful. But then she's like, just because you're a woman doesn't mean you're good at shit. And like she just is very, she has this realisticness to her that I'm like, you are so sexy. I don't give a fuck madness. That's the only a woman over 50 can have beautiful in a way that, cause I think sometimes young women use like I don't give a fuck, but like you give so much like Fox and there's, when you, when you truly don't give a fuck, you don't need to announce the person posted the most pictures of the relationship isn't the one in the worst relationship. When you've got to say it, it's sorta like really depressing. Strippers always have instagram pages that have a lot of like inspirational quotes. Memes. Yeah, a lot of memes. Memes. Like you know, I get so depressed at strip clubs I really can't handle. I Love Strip clubs. I love a hot chick dancing on me with her titties and my face. I just want to cry every time. We have nothing in common except our sense of humor. That's what it is. We like laughing at dark shit, like, like laughing at something that's real fucked up is the best feeling ever. To me, that's the same relationship I had with my brother. We're polar opposites except we share a sense of humor and I love that he's one of my favorite people in the whole world. I mean you don't have to be the same. No, we are not that all the same and it's

Speaker 4:          01:34:57       nice to see like I think a lot of people like seeing two women that like just a disagree on a lot of shit, but it's, that doesn't mean I don't like her. Yeah, that's a problem too is that people get so married to ideas that you don't like. People who don't think the same way that you do, which just seems to me to be kind of crazy. That is a dumb thing right now. It's really ramping, right? Identity politics and this idea that like you have to be on one team or the other. You've fucking just dig your heels in and fight the other side with tooth claw and nail. What did we see that strongly in? Politics. Right. And it's a gigantic issue in politics. Politics is fucking, it's exhausting, but you can't, people can't live in the opposites. Like you can be both things.

Speaker 4:          01:35:35       You can be a great comedian and you could also sexually assault people. Like he can be kind of Shitty in there, but you still look good. That doesn't, don't you think that the Colussy k thing was extra disturbing because he was doing it to one of us. Uh, he wasn't just doing it. It wasn't just saying, hey girls, stay still. I jerk off in front of you, which is gross. But he's also doing it to, it should be appear. Exactly. And that's why it's one of the case. To me it's a power dynamic. And it's a, you could have had a sex work, you could've jumped off, a sex worker would have been thrilled to take your money, and you could do a scenario where you're blocked the door and you jerk off and she's like, but that's a conceptual thing, right? That's why that indicates that meets the power struggle because that consensual thing doesn't give you the buzz that causes the, for Beth thing, that also says to me though that Louis is so intelligent that he did think it through a little bit more than he's letting on because it's like, you know, they're going to have to keep this secret because we're all in this club together.

Speaker 4:          01:36:30       So if you do it to a young comedian, I don't know about that.

Speaker 4:          01:36:35       There's certain thing about standups. I think everybody will agree we're impulsive. Standups are impulsive people. It's one of the reasons why you'll say the funny thing before everybody, some people might even not even entertained the thought. You opened the door and then blurt it out quicker than everybody else. There's an impersonal aspect to that. So you think that could be an impulse? No, I think that he's an impulsive guy. I think most comics are, and there's a wild thrill to that impulse. The problem is you're also doing it to a person that doesn't want you to do it to them. And even if you don't, there's no physical contact. You're making them watch you beat off, which is fucked up. And then, you know, the whole tig notaro thing with tig. Notaro thinks that he started helping her to show that he was a nice guy cause he's like a lesbian and a feminist and like he's going to promote her thing.

Speaker 4:          01:37:24       And this is like take some of the weight off of him. She said that she felt burdened by her relationship with him because she believes that he did it on purpose and he made a conscious decision. It could be, I don't know. You know, it's a good, it's a good branding move. It's a good, uh, let's try and save the reputation, but I don't know. I don't know. But, but with that though, it's like the, when he hosted snl in the monologues about pedophilia and he's like, he related it to like eating a snickers bar. You want to touch that little kid so bad and you know how horrible and

Speaker 3:          01:37:55       how many lives it ruins and how fucked up it makes you, you know the kid, but you still do it. Like that's what I think that with what he did, I'm like you really wanting to do that real bad. Cause comics all knew, we knew about it current and I knew about it five years ago. Yeah, I had heard it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:38:10       Wasn't true. And I had heard from someone who knows him better than me and I said, well what do you mean? And they gave me like this weird scenario where he was joking around, they were all joking around together and then the story got out and you know, like he like pulled his dick out like as a joke and everyone was laughing and it was like he was being silly. And then the real story came out. But I think, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:38:34       we've had people like the Ari Shaffir was our podcast. He pulled his, the, I mean he, he did ask, but like that was fine. I wanted to see his dick. I want to see had a vasectomy. So we wanted to see the scars. I mean, there was a reason and then also that we had never seen, um, someone who was not circumcised before and then he was like, do you want to see it? And where they'd said yes.

Speaker 2:          01:38:54       Does that think about that cutting baby Dick's is so common that you guys have gone through all your life to adulthood.

Speaker 3:          01:39:01       Sorry, shift more than the average person should fears

Speaker 2:          01:39:04       first. Dick, do you saw that wasn't sliced open as a baby?

Speaker 3:          01:39:07       It wasn't [inaudible]. It would dick that was uncircumcised. This was none of these are two separate dates. I can't believe I've never encountered an uncircumcised penis or he's a super Jew. Of course he's circumstance. I was like, I got the longest balls in the game and I'm like, I mean, shown to me, right? Like I want to see them and I'm like, damn you pretty gross. Grapefruit and an old lady's planning. I've seen, I've seen ours, Dick and balls multiple times. That's one thing that male comics do. You, they're done showing each other's dicks. I've never showed my pussy to anyway. Chris [inaudible] senior places not, I didn't like, it wasn't a big pussy. She didn't see your vagina. I saw it all. Yeah, I know. I didn't open up sliding. I like show you saw the staple. I saw the, yeah. That's just because here's my tv set. Here is my kitchen. I over slept for a flight and woke up drunk. That's why she saw my vagina, my pussy. That's a different story.

Speaker 2:          01:39:57       There's no like, genital mutilation tradition amongst women and people will say, Oh, you're looking at it the wrong way for skins, not mutilation. Bull. The fuck it isn't. It is.

Speaker 3:          01:40:08       Yeah. I saw a truck in Union square a couple of months ago. That's like a circumcision is male genital mutilation. And I was like, oh, it is. Yeah. A lot

Speaker 2:          01:40:15       of kids lose their dicks from it. Every year. Perfections. Yes. Not only that, there's so much shit. There's a famous story when it comes to, uh, there's a baby that was raised and raised as a woman because they did a botched circumcision on the kid when it was a baby and the his penis essentially, there was a massive infection. They had to remove his penis. And because of that, um, they had made the decision to try to transition this person into a woman. And so they transitioned this person to a woman and they gave him hormones, but he always wanted to be a man and it was like super confusing to him that he eventually wound up committing suicide when he was, it's a horrible

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       story.

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       Please leave your response

Speaker 4:          01:40:58       connect. It is, but what do you do when you cut off a baby's Dick? I did it. That's the question. When was the teacher wasn't a time when you can try to reconstruct or they did. This is the only, they've only started putting new Dick's on people, but in the last year I think there's actually only been yes, I think there's actually only been one or two successful penis transplants.

Speaker 3:          01:41:18       Wow. Yeah. I mean it is huge. It is harder to create a penis and it is

Speaker 4:          01:41:23       create a penis. You take it from a cadaver.

Speaker 3:          01:41:25       Well, whoa. It's not the same as I may dig where and when you transitioned male to female, you're flipping, you're flipping the deck, but they're add, they're adding on cadaver parts when they're going female and a male.

Speaker 4:          01:41:36       No, this isn't what I'm talking about. I'm talking about someone who's Dick [inaudible] who lost their Dan accident. Okay. Lorena Bobbitt. Yeah, I was going to say cut off her day. Yeah. Well they reattach that, but that thing, and they found that in the field and she likes you throw out the window. The window. Cause she should have through that in the river. I mean, yeah. There's another story about a woman in Orange County who tired her boyfriend up after she drugged him, tied him up and then cut his dick off and threw in the garbage disposal. She's, she's in jail. She shed be though. Yeah. Yeah. Bad Ass. But would you say that if a guy did that to a girl, that's horrible. I have a bit about like, uh, lost his penis during circumcision 17 years ago. Undergoes worlds third successful penis transplant with is a color discrepancy that surgeons will fix with tattooing. I mean, all right, you got it. A penis transplant, I wouldn't know. Complain about the color. Crazy. So goddamn crazy. People lose their dicks because of circumcision and then when it's not totally common. I mean it's, it, it's rare, but it happens when you're a cadaver. Who gets your dick taken off to put on another person? D is that the,

Speaker 3:          01:42:45       the, when you check the box on the back driver's license to donate your organs, like it's all right

Speaker 4:          01:42:50       for grabs. Like yes. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I'll just put that out there. If I die, take my deck. Go ahead. That's really nice of you. The thing is, um, it's probably really hard to get it to work right? To get all the, I mean, it's theirs. It's a such a complicated organ. There's so much going on in there as far as all these different connections and apparently the operation takes forever. It's a long crazy operation. Yeah. Kicking balls are so mystical to me. Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:43:19       Balls. You ever stare at your balls and they just think it's like there's an alien in it. It's like they just move like an octopus or something. I definitely weird. It's so weird. The movement. The first time I gave a hand job though did surprise me. The balls. I know the shaft. I didn't realize it was going to like move with me. Oh, the skin was going to like, I didn't say that out loud, but definitely thought at weight. The skin moves with you. Yeah. Where it's like, so I thought I was actually just to be like sliding on my hand up and down. But if there was a little like a give there. Mm.

Speaker 4:          01:43:49       A little gift. I thought that was a, Andy's rocky.

Speaker 3:          01:43:53       Oh, I thought it. Okay, I'm going to revisit that later. That's her boyfriend have a tech. He does have a dick. Well, he did say God, that's our first three way I, this girl gave him a Ninja blow job. Like it was so impressive. He came right away and I've never, I've sucked his dick many times. Still do. That doesn't happen. And uh, I was in the corner going, Huh, okay. You were in the corner of the bed. I was not terrorism but uh, you know, I was like Oh word. Okay. Which, and it was, you know, I stole the areas to see what you were doing because we learned this year Christina has been giving blow jobs. It's all wrong. I didn't know you had to suck, suck it when you go up like a fleshlight is pleasurable because of the suction and your, when you suck a dick you're supposed to like suck it in as you go.

Speaker 3:          01:44:42       Read a little airlock, little suctioning. I was just liking it like a lollipop and you know, no one told me cause they're probably just happy I was there. I don't know cause I'm like I don't really love giving blow jobs but it's like Christine is like, I love it. I'm like, yeah cause you're not doing it right. I know. I was just licking the dick the whole time. I would also like, well because it is a job, Joe a leg, he's gonna hate me. My boyfriend takes like, it takes a long time to calm and so, I mean just at a certain point your mouth is uncomfortable. That's why I don't like hand jobs. I'm like, you do it. You do it better than me. I like watching you do it. Why? Why are we sitting here and I'm trying this, you know, unless you really want me to, but I'm like gone. Are you comfortable talking about sex stuff? Are you sure? Yeah. Do you have sex toys? You sex toys? I used to have a flashlight. Was one of the sponsors, the earliest sponsor of the podcast. But you didn't, did you use it? Okay, so that's a sex toy friend doesn't use them. Anyway, I, we, he dated a famous porn star right before me and I discovered he could held on to her flashlight while Hurricane Sandy was flooding my apartment and curtain was over comfort or very uncomfortable life preserver to them.

Speaker 3:          01:46:05       It's not telling you? No. I picked up, I do a bit about this, but I picked it up and I thought it was a flashlight and I thought he'd thrown it away and I was like, oh, that's a butthole. Okay. I have a little talk on corrine leaves the bottle one. It's just crazy. They mold it. Yeah, I mean obviously not the internal parts, but the outside like they literally like put like, like rubber on and went to the place where they do stuff. We went to the Doc Johnson factory, which is in Los Angeles and we saw the chair that looks like an ob Gyn chair where the porn stars and there was like remnants of like whatever the stuff this and mentee stuff that they're putting in their body. Like this is stuff that we're taking picture right. Disneyland. It's our Disneyland. But when you jerk off with a fleshlight are

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       you closing your eyes? Are you looking, are you imagining because they make it look like an actual policy. But if that, that's what I thought. They also made it look like an alien. They made an Avatar one at one point in time. Whoa, I'm in a blue one. Like you know, fuck that big blue lady that out. But it's just a, it's just a little bit of a tube. It's just the part you need. You know what else they make that I thought it was hilarious. They make them that are like, you know those tall boy like pabst blue ribbon cans. They make them out of that. So you unscrewed that. It looks like a camp. You would have it in the freezer. Yeah, exactly. The pussy from your wife. Have you ever seen those little, uh, we'd be like one of these cavemen Nitros but you screw the top and you could stash money inside than it used to put my house keys. It does not look like a rock.

Speaker 4:          01:47:39       Classic. Rock and [inaudible] leave my key in the door and it would be less obvious than this rock. I go one over a friend of mine's house and he had fake rock speakers in his backyard, but the fucking do look like rocks here. This is not what real rock pressing. No one is. It's those fucking catalogs that they leave on planes. I love those. Remember those? You'd be going through those. I need that six foot big foot statue. My fucking my backyard. Yeah, he watches over the garden man. Fake. They make torsos. You ever seen one of those? It's just a chick's torso. Well it looks like those sex dolls, you know those real doll things. You know they have a brothel in Germany now where it's like a sex doll brothel in your house are so bizarre. I wouldn't be comfortable with that. Yeah, there it is. Probable Brothel. The Johns or getting too weird.

Speaker 4:          01:48:50       But that again would come in and pay off in the same hole. Would you ever fuck a sex doll for their story? We could talk about on the podcast. I'm not stupid so I wouldn't think it's a real person because I think was she beating off and then like when you're going so far that you're fucking this rubber thing pretending it's a person. You're taking it to a totally different place. Like you're not in a fantasy land where you're masturbating or watching porn and porn, aren't you thinking our guys, when they watch porn, like she's sucking my Dick sorta watch porn. You just thinking that the activity is exciting. Like the activity. Someone sucking a dick as excited and then you would like it if they were doing it to you, but you're not thinking, oh, she's doing it to me cause you're not. Oh you're not. Not, you're not stupid.

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       You know, but they're not their suspension of disbelief. It's like when you see a movie, like, you know you're at a theater, but if you're like holding onto some cold rubber and he got her to cold rubber feet in the air and you have a rubber pussy. Oh that was the other thing. The Guy told me that I wrote that article and I was going back and forth with him. The guy with a relationship with, he said he puts her in the, her in the tub. She, he fills a tub with hot water to heat up the temperature of the body. Oh, oh, I mean that's, yeah, it does seem like real murderer. So weird. It's very strange. I want to go over to his house but not hurting any. What do you guys think? Like if there is like this is theirs. Do you know what crispr is withdrawing the bottom of me.

Speaker 2:          01:50:34       Your Fridge? Veggies. Probably not though. Yes and no. It is that. But it's also a new thing that they're allowing. Um, they're, they're starting to experiment with this new method of altering, uh, DNA. And they're there, they're figuring out a way to do it with non-viable human embryos and they're starting to do it with humans now that are alive. And one a guy was recently one of the first people to be injected with a DNA from crispr. And as Crispr gets more and more complex and more and more effective, they think in the future, you're not only going to be able to pick like what happens to your children, like what your children are, what they look like, what traits they have and don't have. You literally going to have like a laundry list of things that you could pick and choose. But you might be able to do it to yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:51:22       Like they might be able to accelerate the, the, the actual capabilities of this technology to the point where you could take you and you'd say, I want to be a six foot three black woman. And then they shoot this stuff inside of you. And then over the course of like how ever long it takes to alter your body, this is all speculative cause this, this guy was just the first guy ever to this recent guy. See if he could find that, makes a ton of those people out there. But this, um, this technology's not going to just change the way you look. It will literally change who you are. It's going to stretch your legs out. It's going to change your features and what's in the way your brain works. They think they're going to go knock out Alzheimer's. They're going mail stop. A lot of the genes that allow people to have Parkinson's and a lot of different, different ailments that people have.

Speaker 2:          01:52:14       They've isolated those, those genes and they think they can shut them off. Whoa, cancer. I don't want to live to be 150 I'd be able to go, this is what's going to get really weird. Like you might not want to, and you might say that, but maybe if you're 80 and someone says, hey, you want to be 30 again, you might go, Whoa, he was in good health. I wouldn't mind it, but somebody might be willing, I mean it might physically be possible for you to not just look 30 but beathard like literally change your cellular structure

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       to the point where you're a young person and that's going to be the destruction of our society. Modifying your own jeans is just an injection away

Speaker 2:          01:52:52       if you're feeling lucky. Cause right now it's very experimental. Um, but this is a seat, but this is just speculative. There's an article with the very first guy had it done. Yeah. Very first use of crisper on a living person. Uh, so this is like, you know, there's this body acceptance thing, right? Like I'm happy with who I am. Be Happy girl, be happy boy. Be Happy. We are, you're happy until someone comes along and says, hey man, you, you could be thor. You know, you want to be thorough. I have to do to be thor. I'm not willing to make any sacrifices. No, you just go to the thor doc.

Speaker 1:          01:53:24       It's like Halloween for life. Yeah. He shoots a thor shot and your ass and you look like that. Christopher, whatever his name is guy. And could you, you think you would be able to change it? So like one day I'm thor, but the other next day I'm Cindy Crawford and might be able to, well, probably going to take a while for your body to shift to whatever form it's going to morph. And maybe if you keep doing it over and over again, it's like a vhs tape where you keep copying it over and over again and just scratch.

Speaker 1:          01:53:48       You might put some errors in your DNA and grow some extra feet and weird shit. Fun, exciting. Who knows? I mean, listen, there's gonna be some early adopters that are very upset and have buyer's remorse. There's no doubt about that. Yeah. And then what do you do when that happened? What do you do? Sorry, but it's like plastic surgery you can alter, I mean you can't obviously those, there's limitations for plastic surgery, but that don't seem to be on this. Hypothetically if it goes as far as it's like plastic surgery in the sense that there was one way they used to do it, which was awful, and now they're way better at it. Yeah. Sometimes you can't tell. Yeah. Like boob jobs. Yeah. My boob jobs now they make boobs that are soft. They're smushy and you could, when people's don't. I've met a couple of girls that are like, yeah, these are fake tits. I'm like, yeah, can I touch them? And then when you touch them, they feel like a boob. Yeah. Yeah. The crazy here. Or touch a fake boob. It felt like a real boob. Not No, but I've touched fake boobs. I let that alight. Yeah. I like fake boobs. I think they're kind of the fun. They are fun. What do you think joe there? Well

Speaker 2:          01:54:49       the real is better, but it's weird. Like you people accept fake girl parts. They do not accept fake boy parts. It's really interesting. And yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:54:59       calves and shit. Like what? What is it? Fakes. I know guys that have at peck implants. Calf implants. Yeah, it did. They look, can you, can you tell that they're obviously he's dead. Oh it's cause he had it and had a lot of issues and he's getting a lot of weird surgery and one of the things he got was peck implants. Wow. Yeah. That's nice to know that sometimes men can be just as insecure as living, but again, that's not imposes them. That's synthroid. What that guy's doing is he's injecting oil into his muscles, muscles larger and bolts and stop. It's not healthy, right? No, no, no, no. Those guys getting massive infections. You're, you're shooting. I didn't even know you could still could get cancer. 16th Century

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       Shit. No, no. Mitch Hedberg, Mitch Hedberg before he died, um, a couple of years before he wound up overdosing. We were a stand hope and I were hanging out and he got the call that Mitch was in the hospital for gang green shooting heroin into the same spot over and over again. Oh, okay. That makes sense. Yeah. You can get gang green for sure. People get it today. Shit. Yeah. Fuck. But um, the thing is like, you should be happy with who you are if you can't change it. The we're getting into is this weird place in the future. Do you found that article while you're out there? Google apps. I found I have jumped on that, that there was an article from very resells 16 that said someone in China was really, really recent. The recent, within the last couple of days, it said, man becomes the first living patient for crispr. They injected Crispr DNA.

Speaker 2:          01:56:39       What's in it was in the last week or two. That article, I'm typing that in. It says it's from 2016 and the recent ones says there's 20 embryos. They got check. Little search. Really recent. Really, really recent. Have you ever had a poop enemas? Yeah, I found. Found the guy. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Here it is. Genes altered inside a person for the first time ever. This is it. Exactly. In a bold experiment that has never been done before. A man had his jeans altered permanently and attempt to cure a disease. So this is one step and this guy had a disease and decided to take this chance and do this and to scientists for the first time. I tried to editing the gene inside the body in a bold attempt to permanently change a person's DNA to cure a disease. The experiment was done Monday in California on 44 year old Brian Maddix met do I do, um, through an ivy, he received billions of copies of a corrective gene and genetic tool to cut his DNA in a precise spot.

Speaker 2:          01:57:38       Uh, it's kind of humbling to be the first test said Medu who has a metabolic disease called Hunter Syndrome. I'm willing to take the risk. Hopefully it will help me and other people will good for that guy, for being the first guy to take that chance because that's one of the things that they need is they need someone who's willing. Yeah. And He, like I said, as an early adopter, they'll learn from him and maybe be able to improve it. But the point is this is happening at an incredible pace. Crispr was just discovered a few years ago. There's a great radio lab podcast on it. It's spelled c, R. I. S. P. R, I think it is. I think it has an e in it. But if you look up the radio lab podcast, it is fucking phenomenal. And it's, it's crazy when they explain how they discovered this and what the implications are. I got to tell my mom about that. She's got so many health thanks. And neurological and every doctor was ever in Canada is like, I don't know why. Sorry. And she's like, really? Was she around like any sort of like a farm? Yeah, the only thing, uh, she,

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       uh, she's pretty sure she had lyme disease and she didn't know I have lymes disease, but uh, I got, I got the bullseye right away and I got the antibiotics. Now they give you two weeks antibiotics. I only had 10 days at the time. So I feel like maybe I need to go back, but I don't, I don't, I have a very sensitive stomach. Uh, and that's all, that's all you have is a motherfucker fuck you up. Yeah. It doesn't get any worse and worse and worse. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. Not Good. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:59:07       But I need something like 60% of the ticks and the upper Hudson valley have lyme disease. Oh, Jesus. Yeah. Something insane. Like it's really high levels and it's all over the east coast. And you know for a long time doctors didn't even know what the fuck

Speaker 5:          01:59:19       that was. Oh yeah. But that's what I'm pretty sure cause it's neurological for all her shit neurological and she has like, she has an Arachnoid cyst and the base of our stem but they don't know if it was there when she was born in [inaudible] arachnoid cyst. Yeah. It's just like a spider says kind of. It's like a big ball. And then it like wraps around her, the base of her skull and the top of her spinal cord. Yeah. And they think she just got diagnosed with dementia and they think that possibly draining it would do something but they don't know. But then she just got half of her intestines taken out. She has, she's the one of the 3% of people who gets a bell's palsy and it doesn't go back. Oh God. And she's trouble get bell's palsy is from lyme disease. Oh re. Oh yes. I remember reading that because I didn't know you could get bell's palsy and then it goes back to normal and it's more common. It's like 97% chance your face is going to go back to normal. That the atrophy that happened. Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:00:09       A friend of mine, his son got it. He was really young and they brought him, the son got lyme disease and he brought the son to the doctor and doctor didn't think it was lyme disease and then finally the kid had bell's palsy and that's when they realized and then they started giving them like the series antibiotics and [inaudible] son was very young too. I think he was only four at the top. Yeah. Intense.

Speaker 5:          02:00:26       She had a, she had a stroke though when she gave birth to my brother. My older brother are first kid and uh, that's then after that was when the bell's palsy happened. So I'm like, it's, I guess it's the connected to that. She, she's like a walking health question phenomenon. Yeah, she is. She is crispr. Yeah. I'm sound like June. That shit probably could help

Speaker 2:          02:00:45       actually. Who knows. I mean we'll see what happens to this guy with hunter syndrome boat if this really works. And this is all, like I said, this discovery of Crispr is only a couple of years old. They're already starting to use it. I'm living humans.

Speaker 5:          02:00:57       She's at the end of her rope to the point where she would say whatever do it. I don't care cause I feel like she'd be a good candidate for that.

Speaker 2:          02:01:04       See, the thing about lyme disease too is that it has a neurotoxic element to it that it causes like mental disorders. Yeah. Yeah. It's also curry. It's connected to something called more challenge disease. Oh, I've heard of that. I don't know what Joe does is like people start thinking they have fibers growing out of their skin. They started scratching themselves and yeah, and the, the hallucinate. I did a TV show about it and one of the things that I found that was fascinating was there was one doctor who was like a legitimate doctor who had more gentleman's disease and it was explaining the hallucinations that he would have while he had, um, because he had lyme disease. Well. And he was thinking that when you get bit by a bug and that bug has like lyme disease and tick diseases are very, they vary and they vary in intensity and they also vary in how many different different pathogens that tick and contain.

Speaker 2:          02:01:53       And so the way he was describing it to me, it's like you're talking about one symptom, like a, something that happens to you when you have a host of different pathogens. And he said some of those pathogens he believes contain neurotoxic elements that causes people to hallucinate and why those hallucinations is they think that things are growing on their skin. And they started scratching themselves and he was seeing it on his eyeball. He was saying, you look in the mirror and he would see something crawling across his eyeball. But he knew knew wasn't really there. Fuck. And because he was so smart and because he was a doctor, he was recognizing like, okay, I am, my brain is malfunctioning. I've got a real issue here in the toxic element of this fucking lyme disease is spreading through his body and just to come to it. Yeah. And so he would, he, the more challenges like widely dismissed by a lot of medical practitioners is beans a psychosomatic disorder. They think that people are just crazy and they're hallucinating, but he's saying yes, but if you look into that, they almost all have lyme disease. Oh, okay. You're saying it is connected and people are missing this connect.

Speaker 1:          02:02:53       Yeah. Yeah, I have. I, yeah. And I feel like we've, we've always debated my mom and I that for mental shit is from that, from limes and then like I've haven't, I don't have many symptoms of lines. Well, one thing I've been getting lately, like the past maybe five years, it's anger attacks like fucking rage that I can't, I have to do something to get it out of my body because it's watching that girl suck your boys deck. No, I liked that though. But that was fun. How come I was jerking off to it? Uh, no, but it would just come out of nowhere and I'm like, it feel, it felt like, I felt like the incredible hulk. Like you wanted to, it's some medical issue that something was going on. Like there was a, uh, like there's like a problem I go because it didn't, it wasn't attached to hormonal, wasn't pms.

Speaker 1:          02:03:37       I also have bad pms, but that's more anxiety. It's not anger. I would get these like anger attacks and I would have to scream, oh, my poor boyfriend. Like I would scream. I still do. I will scream into a pillow until I can't talk anymore. I polyps on my vocal cords and I feel like that's mom help one. But it's, I need to get it out. I don't punch somebody, but I need to break something or I need a Pi or you need to hurt myself so I can feel embarrassed and then come down from it. But at least you confirmed my suspicions that all funny people are fucked up. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, I got it. Well, you don't, you don't seem very fucked up. Yeah. What's your fucked up? You fucked up and what? We did it out, but from martial arts, but it, my whole life I've beat people up. Vote. No, no, not, but I'd been in five competitions. Yeah. Oh, but that's healthy though. And then, yeah, maybe not. Oh, I got hit in the head a lot when I was a while. Your brain works well. You got a lot in there.

Speaker 2:          02:04:31       Yeah, it works pretty good, but it's also, there's a hair trigger there. There's a hair trigger mechanism. Always wants it to flip off and always wants to go dark.

Speaker 1:          02:04:40       You did. Oh Wow. What could we, what would trigger

Speaker 2:          02:04:43       do at an event? Like some, some someone doing something bad, something happening where I'd to you or to anybody? To anybody. Not to me. To anybody. There's just a, there's a, there's the anger switch where I'm not real comfortable that I have, uh, you know, like if you have your finger on a gun and the trigger is very light and you, you're applying pressure, but you're very like, whoa, this could go off any second. Now there's that. Oh, something goes weird.

Speaker 1:          02:05:06       Oh, that sucks. It's does. But if you work out a lot, you can keep it in check. Yeah. I workout, I lift weights. I do, I train and I do like, uh, like dead lifts and squats and Shit and that I love physical labor. I love using my muscles and uh, and it, it, it, it takes my anxiety away and it makes the rage attacks way less. I feel like I have a lot of testosterone. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:05:27       you probably do. I mean this is probably why you like threesomes and lot of crazy shit that some girls wouldn't be into. Yeah. Yeah. But there's nothing wrong with that, you know, but as long it's all in like finding what you need to do to kind of balance out whatever biological issues. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:05:40       That's what it is. Because right now at this point, like I feel like the world doesn't see the anger attacks when my poor fucking boyfriend, I mean, cause I live with them, so he's the one that gets the brunt of it and he cares about me and he'll go do when this happens. Do you want me to come upstairs? Do you want me to ignore you? I'm like, I don't know. I'm sorry

Speaker 2:          02:05:55       for, um, do you ever like do a, like a boxing class or something?

Speaker 1:          02:05:59       Did a bar, a punching bag to kickbox and once and I cried the whole class. Why did you cry? Cause I was like, I wonder cry. Yeah, you're crossing. Even I was in a good mood that day. I just, my friend Melissa like loves kickbox. She's very athletic and she's like you should come with me to a tiger shellmans class. And I was like okay. And then I came and all man I went to town on that punching bag. I love punching shit over. Yeah. Maybe you should do that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean the thing like I yeah I should take boxing classes. Just don't like when anybody else's around cause it Kinda is embarrassing. Well that's why the rage rooms that we were talking about before would be, cause you're in a rage room by yourself. They don't have them in New York City or rage room is a place they have you don't know about.

Speaker 1:          02:06:44       You would love this room. My life is men need rage rooms more than anyone for rage garage. Okay. Do you, would you break shit? No. Okay, so these, they'll go to a thrift store. They'll pop by all the, you know, away like sweets. Yeah. Right. And you can go in there with a fucking baseball bat boy. Yeah. This is my fantasy. Oh God. I mean that's Wayne. I want to break glass for wasteful, but yeah, this seems wasteful to me. Nah, I love it. I like this guy is like half ass and that he's not trying hard. He's not mad at all. He's just trying to fuck these girls. Girls get together like a rage in me afterwards. All my songs, Nascar. So he's got some deep roots. Might have some like hidden rage. Oh Hey. I like, Huh? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       This guy's like examining is on a hot to, so he's not even angry. They're faking it. He's an angry. The way he's hitting things. I mean, if I'm in a rage room, I do not want there to be cameras. I like how they put chest protectors on you. What? A bunch of pussies. Yeah. Well, Amen. Man Hits you the chair. You're going to be okay. But there's consequences to raise you. Fuck No. The whole idea. But I want it to destroy some shit and not have there be any consequences

Speaker 2:          02:08:01       you should do. I think you should seriously try to meditate because I think it would help you.

Speaker 5:          02:08:05       Yeah. Sometimes it makes me angry though. Yeah. But then I think you should go to a martial arts class. Yeah. You should do that. And go take the kickbox. Go Punch a battle cry. I bet. I bet it'll get it out of your system now. I bet it will. Maybe I've screamed, man. And then morph. You never tried yoga. I Love Yoga. I do yoga a lot. I, I do. I use the excuse of time. It does help. I, but I like, um, like that's why like weightlifting, like I, I got up to a point where I was, I was squatting 175 pounds and it was, ugh. It felt so good and it felt like I was, every cell in my body was working for something and it, and I got energy out. And if I hadn't gotten that energy out, I would have just had a fucking angered right

Speaker 2:          02:08:43       sites. Your whole endocrine system to the thing about lifting weights and specifically like squats and dead lifts and these are these big giant complex movements, is that it forces your body to get stronger in a way that it excites your hormonal system. It makes your bones denser. That's one of the most important things about it. Yeah, it's a great way to combat osteoporosis is to lift weights.

Speaker 5:          02:09:05       Oh Shit. I just like it because it's the one time like I like physical activity because you can, you, I have to think about the physical activity I'm doing so I can't stress about my career. Is that the only time I don't think about like getting a head. I'm just like the I, it's the only time I'm in the moment really, and I love talking to trainers because you're talking about next is that too in the moment, not just tired of her jaws hurting, hurting. My boyfriend said to me the other day, he's like, you never look me in the eye when we fuck. I'm like, Oh yeah, I guess I don't like we have a sex podcast. So I think that, I mean before before we had this sex pot cast, it was more freeing for me. Now I do think of work when I think of sex because when you have a sex podcast that is pay my rent. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:09:49       Well the is the ironic thing about careers is that especially in a creative endeavor, if you think too much about them, you paralyze yourself. Yeah. Like you're paralyzed it creativity cause you're thinking about advancement and getting ahead and success instead of thinking about creative ideas like you can, you could definitely like have too much of one or the other. I mean you can only think about creative and never, never get your career online because you just never figured out how to monetize things. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:10:14       And don't put pressure on the idea. Like when guys we fucked it just came out of like, let's just do this. We didn't, I and I, and I was nervous to do it because the name was so brash and I knew it was good, but I'm like, damn, my mom's going to find out. And I was worried about that. I hid it from her for two years successfully. That's hilarious. It started getting too big though. But we honestly, both of us were like, no one's going to, wasn't a shit. No one's gonna listen to me talk about my pussy. So might as well just talk about it and not care and see the lesson.

Speaker 2:          02:10:41       That's the way podcasts evolve the best. When I first started doing it, me and my friend Brian, we just started fucking around with a laptop, set up a laptop and we're doing it on ustream and we didn't even have it uploaded to itunes. Yeah, you're just doing this live streaming thing. And then people would ask questions and there was like 200 people watching. And it was like, that was the early days. There was no pressure on it at all. And then it was like, oh, do this every week. And then every week started building and building and building. Then we started getting some numbers in and it was like, hmm. People watching this thing and then it got weird.

Speaker 5:          02:11:16       Well it's cool cause like doing your podcast and you can do every fucking late night show on television and you get, you reach more people because podcasts, you can hear it anywhere. There's Internet in the world. You can get access to it. That's so powerful.

Speaker 2:          02:11:27       There's definitely that. And there's also no one's interrupting you. No one's telling you what to talk about. Like thinking about some of the fucked up shit we've said in the last couple,

Speaker 5:          02:11:34       right. We [inaudible] are fine with it and pitch like dark shit and just see the blood draining for their face. I'm like, Oh fuck you pussies. But then you remember you have to be, Jean has never going to sign onto that concept. Yeah. Hell No. Different world. Those people, those TV people, they live in a world of tricking dummies in the middle of the country. That's what they look for the next three and a half. Men like what I get, what can I need a big bang theory to shut down these morons throats? They were really open about it. They're like a lot of concepts we pitched. They're like, yeah, but the middle of the country, they're not going to like, and there's a lot of great people

Speaker 2:          02:12:15       in the middle of the country now too. This is the thing about the middle of the country. It doesn't exist anymore because the middle of the country is the Internet too. So like ignorance is, I mean there's going to be pockets of ignorance no matter what you do. And we found that out in Charlottesville, like there was a big shocker for a lot of people. They didn't know that. There's still people with fucking Tiki torches walking on the street talking about the blend of our fathers and all this goofy shit. But you're, you're finding more and more people. Like if you tour, you can go to places like Kansas City. You run it up.

Speaker 5:          02:12:45       Cool people, we were in spokane, we had a Gig in spokane are spokane, Washington. It's awesome though. Alice, Great Salt Lake City. I really love Texas. Texas is awesome. Our live show is very to love it, are going to hate it and I would go to going to like a more conservative state. I'm like, I going to see you. They liked it. You're coming. Exactly. It's like they found their, their podcasts that helps them live in Dallas, Texas or wherever it may be. We did a segment called, we did a segment called sexting theater and we're like, who in here? Sex? And then when they raised their hand like, give me your phone. I want to, we do a theatrical interpretation of their sex. The raunchiest, I didn't want to read it. I was blushing. Was in Dallas. This guy's talking about sucking a fart out of someone's

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       body. Like it was our first gay man. So of course he was. But I was like, that's impressive and unexpected. You were on board with the fart sucking until you heard it was a man was trying to take it all in and then he hit me with gay man and it won't even further so much joe fruit of missed that part of my life. Of course you have your finger on the button. No, you have a prostate shit in there. You don't do it after you've eaten a Burrito. I agree with you. No. Okay. Wait, I don't want to like, I'm going to give you a homework assignment for the girl with a bullet for a ring. That's where bullets belong on jewelry, but everyone thinks is a cocaine bio. I'm like, oh that's a good point. And stimulator. So your prostate is your g spot and you just put it in.

Speaker 1:          02:14:28       You just put it in you upset. So we put it in a knee jerk off. When I hear men talk about like they love women when they, when a woman comes, it's so hot to them. I've never experienced that with men because they're always like, oh, this thing I'm telling you, I can reenact that. So many times I've seen it, but when they had, when my boyfriend has the product that we use a narrows Ros, it's a prostate simulator simulator. It's a Rog, you shove in there, it's more like gently glide with big and a and you put it in and we have sex orgasm. Yes. Like a curve baby day ruined to that. No, it's like a, it's like a mini Dildo for your button. We were all having a nice time. No, but, and then you have sex, you do what you gotta do anyway. And the orgasm for the guy is so much more intense to the point where I'm like, that's the hottest thing I've ever seen is the hottest thing I've ever seen. And he likes it. So you should try it. Do you have a good orgasm face? I'm not looking in the mirror. Why do you feel it? Judge her coffin. Front of the mirror. Angry or sad.

Speaker 1:          02:15:50       Oh Wow. The one we use is, is black. I think. I don't see jess getting a white would cause lead, pull it out, but also checking the oil. This podcast on this note, really fun. Like I said before, I think you guys, you proved to me that you don't have to be like a famous person to have a very successful podcast. And people kept saying that to me. Like, oh, it's oversaturated bullshit. And I would say, what about guys? We fucked those girls came out of nowhere. They're

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       always top 10 I go, they're kicking ass. And they're just good. They just, they flow together. You're, you're having fun together. Thank you. It's great.

Speaker 3:          02:16:36       Every time you mentioned a span of spiking, it's really, you are powerful. You really got a powerful, but you got a year, like you're the, you're the top podcasts all the time. One time we were above you and Canada and everyone freaked down. They emailed us and they were like, Holy Shit. And I just felt like we are not worthy. Oh my God. But we appreciate it. It's nice to earn somebody's respect that you respect and it's because you, you, you have something. That's good.

Speaker 2:          02:16:59       I appreciate you guys too, and I appreciate the fact that you guys are really good at being yourselves, you know? And I think that I'm a professional. Yeah. That's

Speaker 3:          02:17:08       buckets. You have a huge point though because that's, I mean that's what half of our book is about is about that just being me that damn, that's all I'm off.

Speaker 2:          02:17:17       Right? Isn't it amazing that that in itself is incredibly rare? It, it makes me sad, but yes, but shouldn't make you sad because I think it's going to be less rare hemophilia change. I hope. I hope so. I think human beings, and I think our culture is evolving like we were talking about like the the social climate of this happening and how many things are going on right now and words that people are not supposed to use any more and things that people used to think of as being commonplace and now thought of as being problematic. This lot going on. It does feel like there's this, there's a shift. I feel it. It's, I think in along with things like this crispr technology and a bunch of other probably unforeseen technologies that are being worked on right now as we speak. I think some weird shit is going down in 40 years. We're all going to be like basketball players and shifts can be fun. We're going to be aliens. I would do that. I would choose that Crispr, which go with the big gray head and the black eyes and

Speaker 3:          02:18:11       yeah, that's a hack alien alien would you like? They got titties. Octopus. You can kill people. Number one, I would be purple and metallic. Those are an aesthetically I would choose me to be like that chess monster from things you remember, the guys on your chest, you might have more control over your destiny. If you could just wham it down on things. I wish I could just put it just,

Speaker 2:          02:18:34       and on that note, thank you ladies. Thank. Thank you so much for having us guys. We fucked you can get it on itunes and elsewhere. Uh, twitters,

Speaker 3:          02:18:43       uh, philanthropy. Gow Christina Hutch with two ys.

Speaker 2:          02:18:48       That's it. Goodbye everybody. It was so much fun.
