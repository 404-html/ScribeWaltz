Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Two, one,

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Ah, just a less than a month before Armageddon. And uh, we're here in the bunker. Lovely Woodland Hills, California. That's right. Brian motherfucking Kaolin is here. He is. He's willing for Jill Stein because she, like Brian wants 16 year olds to be able to vote, but we both think it's super rational and a great idea because no one, no one better to decide the future of the world. A hormonally flooded baby. Yeah. What do you think about the boner? What 18 year olds drinking instead of 21? I don't think there's anything wrong with someone who is supervised who was 18, who is sort of mentored into having a couple of drinks with an intelligent and very disciplined parental figure. Like someone who's a smart dad or smart mom who says, listen, I don't want you to be. I don't want it to be something that's so out of reach that you wind up doing it and getting obsessed with it because it's the forbidden. Dang. It becomes a big deal. Yep. How about a drink or two? Right. You know, but they have to be like a really conscientious parent. They should be there with the kid, make sure no one's driving, no stupid shit, but we all had beers before we were 21. Everybody did all of us.

Speaker 3:          00:01:25       I also think that if you're going to get people that responsibility to vote and they can carry the can join the army and go and fight and die and kings give them a license to kill. Yes. It seems very strange to me that you're not also allowed to vote and I mean I'm sorry, drink because it used to be in I think 19, 84 is when the law changed. You were able to drink? Yeah, man. It was like I missed it by just a few years fuckers. I didn't. I don't think I did. Yeah, he did because 85. I was 17, so that was when I graduated high school. I think I was 18 and 85. I was drinking in college. Where are you? Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I drank in high school, but I could drink in bars in Washington DC. I remember. Oh really? There are different laws.

Speaker 3:          00:02:07       I was 18. I was an early 18, January 26th. I'm so mature now who are mature. I say that about you all the time, so let's say for a grownup baby, that's the attitude. I'm looking the other day at the, at the comedy store, and we run down to this other part of the comedy store and there was a mirror and both of us stop. Look in the mirror and we pull our shirts up and start flexing. You start going, oh, look at my stomach. Look at my. Oh my. Oh, leaks as absent, and then just as quickly through our shirts down and ran away as I was going, I said I just barked were losers. We're fucking losers. We're babies, we're going up babies, but everybody is until you have so much responsibility that you're beaten down, it's no fun anymore. I didn't. I think I have figured out the delineation there.

Speaker 3:          00:02:55       It's fun to be immature and we are and to be silly geese, but I think the difference is you become a real adult and you become mature when you have other people that rely on you and where were other people's happiness to some degree is more important than your own. So you know what I mean, and their development is causes you concern or angst and requires your time and sacrifice. And if I could throw something in there, the only way that silly goose stuff works at all as if you've got your bases covered. That's right, right? Like, it's really tough to be a silly goose if you're behind on your taxes, if you have massive credit card debt that you're ignoring or there's these stacking stress things, these events, these, these, uh, factors in your life that can really get involved in your, your happiness and your silliness.

Speaker 3:          00:03:49       So as long as you know your, your ducks are in a row, then you can kind of laugh a little bit. It's stuff. Well, we've taken for granted the fact that we have figured out a way to preserve our biology and most countries in terms of like we have life saving medications or sort of preventions for keeping us from things like malaria and diptheria and all those things that used to really. Because when they. They always talk about when you go into a country and you want to get that country on its feet and you want to help develop that country, the first thing you'd have to make sure of is that people aren't suffering from chronic illnesses, parasites, diseases that, that just make them feel shitty. They've got the right nutrition. So the first thing to do is take care of your biology, take care of that.

Speaker 3:          00:04:32       You know, that sort of thing that you live in that machine. Because otherwise if you don't feel good, there's a little rudimentary things. If you don't feel good like hookworm in the south. But when after World War, I mean, I'm sorry, civil war was so endemic in getting your feet and was like a, like a ringworm type thing. Now hookworm gets in your interest or your feet because kids would that people would always use the bat, they wouldn't use outhouses, they use the great outdoors and then you'd walk around in your bare feet. So what hookworm does is it gets into your, it guy gets it, goes through your feet and then it causes you to become anemic because it latches on. Um, I don't know. It had to have some mechanism where it lapsed on the intestine or something. Either way. Huge portions of the south after the civil war, after the civil war were anemic.

Speaker 3:          00:05:18       I mean huge towns. And in fact it was so bad that they started renting, running campaigns, saying bought. Use An outhouse or die was an outhouse or die and they solved the problem. But it was a major issue in reconstruction after the war. Major issue in this country in the south when I lived in Florida, people used to always talk about worms. Now that I'm thinking about it, like this was one of the first times I'm remembering this. I think one of my aunts got it. I think she used to walk around barefoot and Florida is so tropical, you know, there's so much. When we lived there, we see alligators all the time. Oh yeah. Like, and this was when they were there were um, there were protected. You ever have worms? No,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       I never got like, I've gotten ringworm before though. Yeah, me too. But this guy right here that you're looking at it as the worms come out of his ass, told me this. One of my most vivid memories was my sister screaming and crying and I run in and there's a giant pink warm coming right out of her four year old ass or whatever it was. She didn't know what the fuck was happening. And I was like, I was. I was like, it's a worm. You just have told mom I was a six, you know, worried about worms coming out of your system. I was a kid. I, I'd had him and I was looking to snakes and stuff. I was like, me, my mother made it like, look at you now. Take this medicine. Now what happens if you don't have those warrants or if you don't take the medication for those worms, worms, parasite.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Right? So how bad can they fuck you up badly. Look what tapeworm and the worms. Parasites like worms were a major issue. And if you remember New Guinea worms which caused I think elephantiasis to diocese. Um, but, but they're awful like New Guinea worms. Look Up New Guinea worms. They would, they would, I guess if you want to look up something and look up this video. That red band was showing me the other night at the comedy store about some guy who had an insane amount of worms removed from his gut that you went to the doctor and the complainant's stomach pain that was originally. Yeah. Oh Dude. So there's a video. Sanitation is such a huge factor in the foot there. Jim, how dare you, how dare you, what I'm talking about? Sanitation. Cynical. Just put it on for us. So that the uh, video. So we don't get pulled.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       Yeah, yeah. We can get a look at it here. Twenty five year old bodybuilder. That thing. Is that it? Yeah, I think that's it. Yeah. So was there a real thing? But they. They can be deadly. Check this out. They literally have to read. It says parasitic worms need a high deal. Okay. This might be like one of those vegan propaganda videos probably. I'm looking at all these worms though. Fucking shit coming out of this guy's body. I mean, it is insane. His, his gut is just stuffed with these squirming worms as he's pulling them out. It's like Spaghetti looks like moving spaghetti. Spaghetti looks like that. You're not crazy. That I can say look how much it is. Yeah, that's discussed. You're looking literally at a large bowl of spaghetti, right? Yeah. Like I would, I would be wondering if I could eat that whole.

Speaker 1:          00:08:22       That was the reality for a lot of people over time. Look at all of that. That was all inside that dude's body. And take a look at tape worms. Tapeworms are. That might be a tape worm that looks like a long tapeworm. But um, do they need animal protein to stay alive? Is that true? Or could they eat anything to stay alive? Seat. There you go. Take it to I. I don't know if that's true like a. let's find out if that's true because if that is true. Well first of all, if you've got bugs and worms, you got a problem. Period. Right now it's supposed to get worms and just because you get sick because you get worms and the worms have food to eat because you eat a certain diet. It doesn't mean you shouldn't eat that certain diet. You still have a fucking warm living in.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       You've still got a warm and loving it. Yeah. You got to kill that thing. Figure out how about those worms, that breakout of your skin and that would be a tapeworm massive tape. Worn. Discovered inside a man who complained to the stomach. Yeah. That's an even different kind of warm. That other guy had small. I guess there's a gang of different parasites you can get. You can get it from raw meat. Look at that, but that is something to know. Find out if that's true, because if they can only survive in a person that's eating a protein diet or a high animal protein diet. I don't know if that's true because people got plenty of worms in southern India where they were very. They were vegetarians. That's, that's nonsense. The worms were a fact of life for any human being. They're just parasitic date, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       Right. They can get. But that said, if you're consuming animal protein, it's probably another delivery mechanism, right? Yes. Food borne, foodborne worms. However, there's also the fact that you grew your, your, your irrigated, including your vegetables in human shit and animal shit. And you know, as part of the fertilizer, when that fertilizer got on a piece of lettuce or something that was raw or got on your hands and you ingest it, that's how you get things like hepatitis a. that's how you get other, uh, parasites. Yeah. That's the apparently the biggest form of Ecolab poisonings from salads. That's right. And that crazy just like, or was it broccoli or sounds, but it was a type of Ecolab. Right? So it's not just run off, you know, that was so ruined. The salt and sea. You do you know about the salt and sea? Oh yes, of course we do.

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       You mean the one in, uh, in Russia? No, no. The salt and seasoned California. They were calling it the inland Riviera. California's inland Riviera in the 19 fifties. It opened up the Colorado River and they flooded this valley in California. It's about, it's outside of Palm Beach. I'm not sure how far. Maybe a couple of hours or something. I'm not sure it desert though, but it's in the desert and for a long time, meaning, you know, a couple of decades. It was awesome. So people partied there. Sonny Bono and share how to fucking house there. They would boat, they would fish and swim and there was all these like beautiful vacation videos like visit the beautiful Salton Sea, Californias Inland Riviera greetings from the Salton Sea. So they filled that fucking place up with water and there was tilapia in there and people would boat and all the, like the hip people from the 19 fifties they would go to fucking party at the Salton Sea.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       It was just the spot to be right. Yeah. Then the runoff, the runoff from all the pesticides and all the farmers use all got in that water and the die off is so the fish die off that the white sands around the shores in some spots are actually just dead fish bones like that right there. That is all that guy is standing on dead fish bones because they're tilapia or like particularly hardy, and they were like one of the only fish that can survive in that fucking polluted cesspool. Now really it's Sonny Bono. Before he died, before we went skiing and wacked into a tree, his goal was to find some sort of a desalination and filtration method for taking all the runoff and all the, all the pesticides and bullshit out of the salt and sea. He wanted to try to clean it up. It was like one of his ideas of what does that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       You just showed us that before and after. No. Um, but it's, um, it's an amazing story. It's an amazing story because they just didn't understand what was going on. What is the, is it the LLC that was a, the picture. Yeah, that's crazy. That was a real legit see that the, uh, somehow environmentally we know the Russians or whoever was in that area, it's fucked up. How did they do that? Dried it up. Yeah. I can't remember the reason, but it had something to do with irrigation and farming I think, and maybe I'm wrong. When I was in Seattle a couple months ago, uh, I talked to this gentleman who runs, um, there's this like salmon thing down there where you can go underneath one of the bridges and actually see the ladders where the salmon pass through and you could see the salmon swimming up the river.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       It's really fucking bad. Yeah, it's really cool. Like you go under the river and these are just wild salmon that are doing their thing, but you get to look at them through like a window. So they took something that happens naturally anyway and they just gave put a window so you can go under ground, check it out. And then they made it like an awareness thing. They showed the salmon, we're, which sort of accounts the fish as they go through in some spots. But this guy was saying that at one point in time they had carved a channel into this lake and connected this lake to the ocean, and as they were connecting this lake to the ocean, they fucked up and it drained, uh, these other waterways. And so the salmon didn't have a way to get back into the lake anymore. And so they died in mass.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       Just millions of salmon just piled up and took the path they always take and just died. And Rod, I don't know why she just had this toilet, this image of when you were talking about all the salmon that died and, but they're swimming in one direction. I, I had this image of all the actors come to Los Angeles. I would always feel that way sometimes. I remember driving and traffic to an audition or something, and, and I would always get this image of being a salmon swimming up river. And more importantly, I didn't know what the. I wasn't really sure what I was doing it for. The guy was like, I wonder if I'm doing this, so I can see if I can win at this. Impossible game or do I really want to be on set acting like what's really going on and what is acting anyway and why did I get into this in the first place and who am I heroes? Oh yeah, De Niro and walk in and Chino and. But then I know what they're really doing and do I just want to be in the movie and

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       be the guy in the movie or do I really want to be an actor and why am I spending so much time doing Jujitsu and other things when I should be working on my acting isn't interesting and if girls weren't involved with I do it. All right. Those are

Speaker 4:          00:15:03       questions to lot to bring a lot to bring out. It's a lot to unbox. It's hard to kind of get a on something important to say.

Speaker 5:          00:15:11       Mick Westie bunk. That video, the warms. It's not real. It has nothing to do with me. According to him, there's a video of a three year old with that many worms too.

Speaker 4:          00:15:18       Ah, west is a smart man and mark to this debunked that motherfucker, so that doesn't make sense if it's coming from a Vegan site. Those are guys are always here.

Speaker 5:          00:15:25       Ron saw so added that it's what's shown is called a worm Bolis, but b, o l u s, he says it's an uncommon complication of infection and has nothing to do with eating lots of meat.

Speaker 4:          00:15:36       Yeah, no, it's an MC west. He's brilliant. He. I met him when I did the Joe Rogan questions. Everything show and we were talking about chem trails, which he is worked really hard to try to explain to people that are ultra paranoid. He calls them the training wheels. They won't listen. Conspiracy theories now, they won't. Won't listen, but what? What he had to say and what I saw from the people that believe in them. It's pretty obvious what's going on and the problem with everybody freaking out about these fucking artificial clouds that are made naturally by jets as they passed through the air with the moisture in the air. The problem with them freaking out about that kind of stuff is the government does do shady shit sometimes, but you got to be able to differentiate between what it's actually doing shady shit and when it's just a chemical reaction or just a natural reaction of the superheated jet engine hits the cool air and it creates this cloud. I mean, that's what it is. They can, you can, you can do it right now. You can go do it right now. It's not hurting anybody, but I, I think, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:16:33       my experience with people who are conspiracy theorists is not so much that they're looking for the truth. I think it's a little bit more and I want to be fair, but I think it's, I always noticed that they are more interested in belonging to a club that is in the know. There's an identity attached to it, so it no longer becomes really about the search for see if you're, if you're scientifically minded, right? If you, if you're somebody who says, I, like Michael Shermer says, I believe in the scientific method. What that really means is you start with doubt. Doubt is always present because you're always trying to prove what your assumptions and your assumptions are usually assumed to be wrong until they are proven otherwise through trial and error, independent lines of inquiry that come to the same conclusion. All things being equal, you know, those are the things that we, that is how we live. I mean, that's what the, that was good. It goes into the medicine, the computer that you use and everything else. I mean there's, there is, there is a way to get to a result that actually has tangible, mathematical, measurable reality. Um, and I think that conspiracy theorists are as attached to being a conspiracy theorist regardless of what that means as they are, as someone who would be, I don't know, it's an identity as opposed to a certain

Speaker 4:          00:17:51       for truth. Well, it's also like a default view. Can't wait to default. The default view is that it's a conspiracy. The problem with that default view is that sometimes it's a conspiracy, but if you're wrong, a lot. And conspiracy theories are wrong a lot because they jump too quickly. They jumped to conclusions too quickly instead of actually looking at what the fuck the facts are and then going, okay, well what's fishy about the facts? All they do is concentrate on what's fishy. Right? That's it. They did try to narrow in on the one thing that they think is the most fishy. I don't remember these jet planes when I was a kid. I'm like, bitch, you don't even remember what call your house was. Okay. You don't remember shit from when you were a kid. Of course you don't remember whether or not there with lines behind jets, but there's photos that show lines behind Jack Horse and you show them that.

Speaker 4:          00:18:36       They get those photos, man. Like, come on, this is. I know there's a lot of shady shit the government has done, but this one has been tied up. It's obvious with this. Here's the problem. When you pretend that those are clouds and that these clouds that are coming out of the back of these jets are some sort of a chemical spray that the government is launching indiscriminately down on on civilization for mind control or some nefarious purpose. So whatever fucking nefarious purpose that believe it's the worst, it's the most obvious government program ever because it's so ineffective. Jack Shit like they. It hasn't done anything. People are living longer than ever. Diseases are getting cured, whether there they're more rebellious than ever. Everyone was for Bill Murray shirt on and people would. If Bill Murray was running for fucking president right now, people will vote. They would vote for him.

Speaker 3:          00:19:26       Really awesome about the Internet and about all of this is that I think like all you hear lately and I agree, is that the mainstream media is not really a reliable source of truth anymore. They're not objective. They're just not objective. Look, I don't, I don't. I don't like trump, but I will admit that the New York liberal media, who I rarely agree with anyway has been, has given him. I'll fucking. I mean he's not as. He's his own worst enemy of course, but there's no question that a lot of it's either bought off or it's or it's or influenced by by its owners because. And influenced by the fact that it has to be entertaining. It can be for ratings, but it's also not objective. When I was watching Hannity on Fox News, he wouldn't even let this woman get her point of view out about Hillary and he wouldn't.

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       He just kept interrupting. So you know, it's not about a discussion. It's about pushing an agenda. Exactly, and I think what's what's to happen and what has happened is you have things like viceland and different independent movements that are saying, you know what, let's get integrity back into journalism because it's very needed and let's, let's get out there and get real stories that are going to take guts and let's do some real investigative journaling. I think they'll always be a marketplace for that. We want to know the truth. We want the truth. You're not going to have a full. I know that Fox News

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       and CNN are give a lot of news to a lot of people, but I think as they continue to discredit themselves with certain behaviors, people are going to be looking for more advice. Well, they can't. They can't fall back on that anymore because they're the purveyors of truth. You are the only ones here, the only world purveyors of truth, CNN, Fox News, NBC, ABC, CBS, the big ones, everybody that's putting out these gigantic shows that are being viewed by millions of people. There's a small handful of you and if you're full of shit, it's a giant problem, so if you're full of shit, it doesn't matter. All the good stuff that you do, it doesn't really matter because you're fucking us. And I watched Fox News, I watch CNN the other day and I'm going back and forth between the two of them and I would just watch one for now and then watch what the other for now.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       One of them just wants to talk about nothing but sexual assault and they were talking about how important it is that we. We don't use certain language in the workplace and Don Lemon was telling people's, I've had Czech people have my personal life and that amazing. Just talking about gender, it's about sexual assault, but look, the sexual assault allegations and everything, they're all serious, right? You don't want a guy who's a sexual assault attacker who is in the White House. You don't want that, nobody wants that. Right. But it's also important that you look at all the fucking corruption that's been shown about the Democratic Party, but what they did to keep Bernie sanders out the way they conspired. Well, Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, I mean there's the list of grievances and corruption has been well documented as a mile long. It's almost like if I was Hillary Clinton and I knew that I like, there's a lot of dirt on me.

Speaker 1:          00:22:28       Like God damn, I did some shady shit and now the internet starting to expose my financial dealings and these $250,000 speeches that she get to, you know what? I would wait to run against someone who is so fucking terrible. Someone's a horrible person and just like maybe I could get donald to like do me a solid. And Donald's like, oh, I'll play it up. Big Pussy grab and I'll say a bunch of crazy. She will leak some tapes. It's not that far fetched almost. You know, talk about a conspiracy. It was a Democrat, you know that right? Donald trump used to be, I believe that's. Well, I don't think Donald trump was anything but Donald Trump. Ian, I mean I. I don't think that Donald Trump has an ideology or philosophy because that would require. Oh, he does. He has an ideology and philosophy in terms of what he can see in what he has experienced and felt, but if you're, if you think Donald Trump actually has a philosophy and an ideology that was based on him sort of really thinking and reading and take and stepping outside himself, reaching beyond himself, you're out of your mind. That's my problem with Donald Trump. That's my problem. Go to Morgan Murphys, instagram page and pulled pork and Murphy put this thing up today. She's hilarious. She put this thing up today about a Donald Trump debating a scientist.

Speaker 1:          00:23:50       Put this up. Oh, it's, it's. He's just such a character like there's never been a character like this running for president. I'm so torn like, watch this. Go fullscreen and press press place that we get here.

Speaker 6:          00:24:05       Philosophy, Maxwell's equations together in the right way. You'll get the velocity of waves moving down in actual.

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       That's actually genius, but here's he'll look at his facial expressions. He, this is why I've started feeling like life is fiction because his facial expressions are literally what you would see in a Dr Seuss book. Like, look, he pulls his Chin in tight. Look at that. I don't mind any of that. I actually find him. I see all of that stuff that people talk about. Um, I think to me is so a of minimal importance. Believe it or not, there's so much of what he does is actually entertaining and stuff like that. He talks, he teases. He's insulting. If the guy was really up on issues, if the guy, if there was every, any evidence, he took advice, just taking advice. He can't take advice. He didn't even prepare for the debates at all. You could see it. He's just so off the cuff and I'll be honest with you, I'll be honest.

Speaker 1:          00:25:13       I'll be honest with you. I think there's cheating going on and she's broken and I'll collaborate. Posey, he's. Someone needs to explain to him economy of words. It's super important, but he doesn't know because he could get to a position of like being a leader like she like. She's really good at that. Her economy of words is excellent. That's how her brain is organized. His brain is not organized that way. His brain is organized to be impulsive, to be reactive. If you to draw a picture of his brain, like a side view of his brain? Yeah. How, what percentage of it would just say grab the pussy inside if you had to break it up like wisdom health. Like what? What he's thinking about. I think that the grab the pussy would be much smaller than the part of the. Brandon just said me, you know, that's my aunt.

Speaker 1:          00:26:01       She was a Democrat from 2001 to 2008, 2008. He gave to John Mccain for president. He gave to Hillary Clinton's campaign, but then he was also as a real estate developer. He was very. He was. He gave to whatever political party was going to get him the tax breaks he needed or give them the favors. He needed that. That's really what you do. I was secretly hoping that he was doing all this asshole stuff running to get the Republican nomination. Then once you've got the Republican nomination, he would just completely. I Quito, the whole thing and Intel, you know, Hillary, look, I'm, I'm going to be as reasonable and rational as possible and I don't want to insult you and I don't want to pretend that things are any worse

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       than they really are, but I believe that you're part of a systemically corrupt system and I wanted to just get to this position so that I once now I'm here now I can just tell you how I really feel, but I feel like the system is broken. It is and it's crazy. It's crazy that we stick to it because we could definitely come up with a better one, but we stick to it because it's old. Well also though, I, I see, I don't begrudge, I don't like when people insult trump voters and I'll tell you why. I think there are a lot of trump voters. I might be ignorant or not interested in, you know, but I always, I think it's unfair. I think it's unfair to categorize somebody who wants to vote for trump or not vote for hillary. I think it's very unfair and condescending to consider them to be a DM or a rednecks.

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       I think the problem with that is this, Hilary Clinton is talking in very much the same way and along the same parallels that Obama did eight years ago. If you are a working class dude, if you are somebody who has been left behind through globalization and through, I guess just how the country is moving technology, so if you're a coal miner, if you're A. I don't know, there are a lot of industries. You are listening to this woman speak exactly the way Obama did eight years ago and your life has gotten worse. It hasn't gotten better. It's gotten worse. Why in the world would you not? Why in the world would out of desperation would you not try this very entertaining, oh, giant white guy who's, who's got confidence, who wants to break Washington apart and who saying, I'm going to make Washington. I mean America Great.

Speaker 3:          00:28:18       Again, it that that appeals to our emotions and I don't think, and I, I do a lot of reading and stuff. I don't think I would necessarily be that different if I, if I didn't know what else you take acting and stand up away from me or whatever. What am I going to do? Teach. I don't know what I do. Either way. I would be pretty. I'd be pretty desperate for a change and I wouldn't be voting for Hillary, but don't you think there's a giant issue in, in deciding that you're going to vote for someone who says they're going to go after someone and lock them in jail. That's what a dictator done. A set set of special prosecutor on her and how? Because if I was president, you'd be in jail like she's, she's, but that's how it dictating him. How a dictator dictator.

Speaker 3:          00:28:58       What do they always do? When dictators coming to power, their opposition gets locked up or killed. You can correct me if I'm wrong. There's the president doesn't have the power to do that. You have the power to start some special investigation on her. The answer, the short answer is yes. The president can appoint an attorney general, uh, uh, from the Justice Department is on attorney general, I believe, to investigate, uh, the, uh, special case. Okay. He could technically do that. Wow. That's not seem fucked. You can. She could do that to him too, by the way. Right. It's, it's much deeper than that because Donald Trump will say things like this. I, I, if I told the generals what to do, they would do it. And I've always said we go in and take the oyster. You're paraphrasing. I'm not phrasing that he actually said that. He said, if I, if I told them what to do, they do it.

Speaker 3:          00:29:44       In other words, hey, I, I know how to run the military. Unlike these people he's had and our general failed five deferments. Well, this is what I'm saying is that as a dictator, if he was in charge, he didn't even know how that works, but he really said that is what my point is. Yes. He said many things like that. He's such a, he's such an obvious Megalomania may megalomaniac such an obvious demagogue. And, and I don't, and you're talking to a guy, I don't like Hillary at all. I think she's, I think she's more of the same. Yes. But I think she's a corrupt human being. There are a lot of examples of that. However, I'm not as uncharitable to say that I think she's, I don't think she's evil. I think she has a vision for the world. I think she wished she, in her mind, she believes she knows what's best for the country, but there's a difference because I think she's willing to take big shortcuts to gain influence and always has in her career.

Speaker 3:          00:30:36       And uh, and like what, like what kind of big, using influence, using political influence to get what she wants when, when, I mean, if you look at the people that Clinton pardoned, I mean, that part of scandal was the craziest thing in the world would be. Pardon Frank? Rich, take a look at the list. Frank, rich, uh, the, the, he, he, Hillary wanted to run for Senate in New York and he needed certain counties and he needed a large, I believe, Hasidic Jewish vote and he pardoned some guy in a rabbi or somebody in there that it was such a blur. It literally, I remember the democratic, someone I think maybe was one of the democratic pundents who said, I don't know how you defend this. It's just so obvious that he's trying to buy his wife votes that he's trying to buy influence. And that was, that's well documented.

Speaker 3:          00:31:26       I don't think a lot of Democrats would disagree with that. You know, look it up. Look up the uranium one deal. That's just what they did. One deal. Who through Bill Clinton's influence, this Canadian businessman bought the cars like oil, a uranium fields. Well, let's go one scandal at a time. The first one, did you find the first one? Yeah. The guy's name. Mark richens Scott up before. I think he was going to go down as like the at the time, largest tax evasion. Oh, that's right. Time living in Switzerland. He was prosecuting things right here in the middle. Yeah. Hm. Future. He was a fugitive who fled to us during his prosecution, was residing in Switzerland. He had $48,000,000 in taxes and was charged with 51 cases. Accounts of tax was pardoned for tax evasion. He was required to pay a $1,000,000 fine and waive any use of the pardon as a defense against any future civil charges that were filed against him in the same case.

Speaker 3:          00:32:23       Whoa. Critics complained that Denise Eisenberg, rich, his former wife, had made substantial donations to the Clinton library and Mrs Clinton's Senate campaign. What a surprise that Marc Rich, who lives in Switzerland and you're going to give him a pardon? Do you think they're connected? It was so blatant. It was ridiculous, but you can keep going with the pardons. There are a lot of examples of that. So to call Hillary Clinton, not corrupt the uranium one deal. God, look that up. What's that? What's uranium? Well, well, uh, the, uh, Canadian businessman bought the Kazak in Pakistan, used to be a part of the Soviet Union, a uranium fields. Uh, some of the, some huge uranium fields, I think some of the biggest in the world, uranium which you use to make nuclear weapons, oh shit. And Bill Clinton helped him with his influence, a well documented influence, help this Canadian businessman by those uranium fields.

Speaker 3:          00:33:20       But here's the problem, that Canadian businessman gave $31,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation with a pledge for 100 million more and he gave Clinton a $500,000 check for speaking for a speech and then $500,000. Then when it came time for the Clinton, for, for the cars, like oil fields to be sold to a Russian company, a Russian company that the State Department and everybody else in our intelligence, he said, our guys, the Soviets are going to have a lot of access to uranium, some of the biggest reserves in the world. And this Canadian business has been sell to a Russian company. Um, Hillary Clinton was secretary of state at the time and she okayed that deal. She was one of the people that had, that had to give her. Okay. So now the Russians own a lot of that, although those oil fields. Oh, and by the way, look up the Russian, the US Russian technology initiative where we're.

Speaker 3:          00:34:18       One of the, one of the movements is to have Russian citizens in Russian. I'm American citizens, share technology, share technology and technological sort of ideas and stuff. Um, the problem with that is that, that requires American investors. Twenty eight of them were chosen, were chosen. Sixty percent were 60. Oh, I'm sorry. And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state was, was spearheading that. Of the 28 us partners that invested 60 percent gave to the Clinton Foundation. Now come on now, come on. This is blatant stuff. So we have to look at that. You can't quit. Great picture. They got over it. Could she look more guilty? The report Russian government initiative gave millions of dollars to Clinton Foundation. And what does that on while Clinton was serving as secretary of state? You don't think she knew that? What's the website? That's one freebie. Kay was in the Wall Street Journal. It's been well documented. This is not. This is not a conspiracy stuff. This is every major publication in the world would knows this and concur is along the same lines, the same story. It's the same story. They could, they could print the same story. It's not just what do they do with the money? Like what is the challenge here is the money because here's the question that she just recently got some crazy award. Uh, the

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       charity, the Clinton Foundation received some highest accreditation or it's a very good car. It's a very good question. First of all, be careful of those explanations. Foundations have always been notoriously corrupt and in every aspect including getting high ratings, but, but there is no doubt that the Clinton Foundation does a lot of good for children with AIDS overseas for I think things like malaria, malaria nets, they, I think they even work maybe with the gates foundation. They do a lot of good stuff now. There are a lot of reporters have written about how it's a slush fund, how it's used for other things. I don't know anything about that and I don't begrudge explained slush fund. How would that mean they would take the money from there and use it for their own updates? Flush look up slush fund. I can give you. I can give you a definition, but for the most part it's.

Speaker 1:          00:36:30       I'm a slush fund typically would be a place to put money that under the under certain offices has said for this, but it's actually used for other things. A reserve of money used for illicit purposes. Especially political bribery. Yes, but you say, but what you say is, Oh, this money is for, you know, curing this disease. But it's used for other things. So I asked him that might be unfair to say that the Clinton Foundation's is less fun. That's what journalists, especially from conservative newspapers like Wall Street Journal will say. Of course. Yeah, of course they're going to do that. I mean, what I was going to say earlier about Tony back and forth between CNN and Fox News, it was one of the best examples I've ever seen of the fact that they. These guys are playing a game and this is just the propaganda news network. Now this is a propaganda news network for the left and his propaganda news network for the right and they're both guilty guilty of both guilty.

Speaker 1:          00:37:23       No one's being honest about her. No one's having this conversation that we're having where we're saying, look, maybe wouldn't be the worst idea in the world to get someone in there who's some crazy rich guy who's this gigantic figure that'll stir things up. Like maybe like having a guy like him would be a doorway to having someone who has like some next level view of running government and including people in the process and, and moving it away from this. This, the system is too restrictive and it's too restrictive based on the times in which it was creative. The representative government model that they needed in 1776. It's a very different world today. It's 2016. I don't know. I think that that the bigger culprit may be less systemic like you're talking about. I actually think the bigger culprit is the wrong ideas are starting to win the day. And here's what I mean. Um, if you, let's just take the left. Let's just take the hysterical left. Uh, and I think by the way, I'm, I'm more of a libertarian so that maybe would make me maybe more swing. We're both pretty left a lot of stuff. Exactly. I was about to say it was about to categorize it. That's the problem is these categories, categories are

Speaker 4:          00:38:35       fucking stupid to. It's super left on almost every social issue on welfare, on government programs to help communities and boys clubs and girls clubs and things along those lines.

Speaker 3:          00:38:50       You're making my point for me. Exactly. So when I say left, what do I really mean when I say I'm a libertarian? What do I mean by that? Because I'm not a total libertarian. Right? So here's a better way is exactly what I'm trying to say. Here's a much better way of establishing sort of where you stand and rather than say, these people over here are wrong and these people over here, right? Or these people are left to right. What you're doing is categorizing people and we know that people are all over the place. Look at you and I left this way. I'm socially very liberal. I believe in fair play. I also believe in common sense. I also believe in personal responsibility. That's where it gets weird. You start moving right? Isn't that interesting? Well, that's what happens, but that's called. That's called being occupying the entire intellectual and emotional spectrum as a human being.

Speaker 3:          00:39:37       What a surprise. I'm a sinner and I'm a St Motherfucker and a lot of times I'm in the joker, joker, and a smoker as well. Come on, midnight Toker. Sometimes they don't want to run. Fuck no, I stand. I. I set my heels and I fucking Dr Steve. Man, I bought my own fucking tongue. Whoa easy. But here's the. Here's the. Here's a better way. Here's, here's the enemy, not a person. Here's the enemy. It's this at one example. It's this thought process. We have a disenfranchised group over here. Let's call them transsexuals or let's call them black people, or let's call them women. I can't believe you lumped all those three people. Well, we do this with. Let's just take. Let's take. Let's take the fact that women are victims of sexual assault. All right. We've. We've established that sexual assault is first. Let's define what it is, but we know that for the most part it's a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:40:27       It's a terrible thing when it happens, right? I'm talking about rape now. Um, there's, there's a, we know we want to solve that or make it better or make women safer and make the world safer. I think what happens is a lot of times, one group that one thought process in solving that problem is as follows, well, let's find out who's doing the raping. It's mad. It's mad. Um, so what we're going to do is make it better because we are going the way we're going to make a bit as we're going to take the power away from those men and we're gonna get somewhere else. And how are we going to do that? Well, there's only one way to do it. You need a, you need a big, big, powerful authority to actually be able to enforce that. You need laws and you need regulations and union restrictions.

Speaker 3:          00:41:16       So the idea that by you will make someone else who's not powerful, more powerful by putting down people that are already powerful by taking that power away from them financially or with laws as if that is going to make the people who have been oppressed as it's going to make their lives better. I think that's a faulty way of thinking. I don't think that empowers women. I don't think that empowers black people. I don't. I think rather personal responsibility and making it so that that group can figure out how to empower themselves and the way you empower yourself is not by taking power from somebody else. I mean unless they were there, you know, a sadist and keeping you in a cage. But for the most part, I think that's a very important distinction and discussion to have. That's the discussion. That's the debate. I'd love to hear between CNN, Fox, but I don't. Well,

Speaker 4:          00:42:13       I also think there's a big problem with this right? And left system in the. You pick a side and you want that side to win and it's, it's, it's almost like a civil war in America every time. The [inaudible] elections come up and I think it's bogus. I think the whole setup is bogus. I think the distinction between the two groups is bogus and I think we're so used to having teams compete against teams that we slide right into it. I think what we really should be worried about is who's, you know, there should be a set of things that we're all worried about. Who is ruining the party? Who's, who's, who's, who's doing terrible things, who are they as it people that are robbing people's that people that are selling meth is the people that are murdering people who's doing all, who's ruining the party.

Speaker 4:          00:42:57       Okay, well first we got to find them. It might be the people that are driving the narrative. This is, should be the. This should be the entire focus of a culture. Okay. Second of all, where are the weak links in our chains? Like we're. How are these poor people supposed to get by? How were they? They're born into poverty. They're born into shitty parents, like, how do we fucking nip that in the bud? So we have less people that are just suffering through the emotional baggage of being raised by fuckheads. There are different. There are different schools of thought on that. Right? So that's what happens. Yeah, there are different schools of thought, but let me keep going. And then W, W why? Why the fuck would we fight Russia? Like why are we in Afghanistan? Why would we, why would anybody do any of these things?

Speaker 4:          00:43:32       Like at what point in time is it going to be ridiculous for the idea of giant groups of people to go over and try to fuck up other giant groups of people that are all in on it together for the profits of some person who probably doesn't give a fuck about you and is super happy to let you go to war for them so they can get more oil. The same reason people argue the same people that people. The reason people have different points of view. The two party thing, it's the two team thing. It's the natural inclination that people have to compete against each other. Even on a global scale. If it keeps ramping up, I'm sure it works that way with like billionaires that like they want to have the biggest yacht, like having a giant yacht. It's not good enough. They want the biggest yacht ever and they keep competing against each other. It's just isn't that. Isn't that human? Isn't that the human condition, that conflict, that need to impose your own? Really, you're on mark. I don't know you. If you would ever. If you try to change that, you're trying. You're messing with human saints. The problem is with having anyone being a figurehead, I think once you have who's a figurehead and

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       that figurehead position becomes a coveted position. It's hard to get to. It's very important. It becomes a goal and once it becomes a goal, you're going to get the super competitive people that are trying to achieve that goal and then along the way they start realizing that they can sell influence and speeches and that Bill Clinton got paid half a million bucks, had talked to these people for an hour and Hillary Clinton got 250,000 and talk to some bankers for an hour. Like it's like there's so much money in it that they start realizing like that position carries with it an incredible fiscal windfall. It's called an economy of influence. It's an amazing. You know how Switzerland is ruled. It's really interesting how they do it. So they have a lot of different parties, lots of different parties, and the first three parties that when are voted in, they get to choose two presidents each.

Speaker 1:          00:45:18       Whoa. And those. And then the fourth party, the party that comes in fourth place with the fourth number of votes, they get to elect one president. So you actually have seven presidents way better idea and not only have seven presidents, they all have regular jobs. That's not their only job, and so they meet, they meet and they discuss legislation, but guess what else? Those, those groups are the ones. Those parties are the ones that elected their own. They're their own presidents. Yeah, but what do they have to worry about? Oh, someone's invading to steal our cheese in our army. Knives. What's the great. What's the great quote? Who was descended? Uh, 500 years of continual warfare in Italy gave rise to the renaissance and 500 years of relative peace in Switzerland gave rise to the cuckoo clock, a beautiful clock. And the chicks are hot.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       Why build things when you can just fuck all the girls that lived there because they're just super hot. Well, this term onto something or does turmoil create beauty and it may be. What is innovation? It's a form of destruction was beauty. You know, what's more beautiful, peaceful day just overlooking a field or the Vatican. I have an answer. I bet you're wrong. Well, do you know how the Greeks top man, you're wrong. You know the Greeks defined it in one word that you enroll Jamie. How becky? You're fucking wrong. What do you hold your breath and started smelling trump? What is trump's breath smell like? You had to guess I can meet and for sure a lot of flame and yon and they just just meet and oppression and depression. Wash and a wasp flies out. Stinks you in the face once a little. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:46:54       I bet you know what, you know what the irony is? I guarantee he'd be a fun guy to hang out with. He's a fucking blast. For sure. For sure. Use it. He'd probably be one of my favorite people even though Jeff Ross said he was great when the, uh, they roasted them, so it was great. He said he even advised him to laugh at the jokes about him and he's like, you know, it's like, it's probably better if you laugh along. Like you don't want people to think you don't have a sense of humor. And he's like, you're right. You're right. That's great. That's great. It's great. I mean there's a, he's a, he's a great American figure. He's, well, he's a, I wouldn't say great in terms of like the

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       overall influence that he's having on people right now, but as far as him being a great figure in terms of like big, he's a huge historical figure yet is on an airline for awhile has been this figure in this, like this sort of a symbol of wealth, but he's all. It's also revitalized a lot of political discussion

Speaker 3:          00:47:52       because I was forced to explain and articulate and think about why he's dangerous. I was forced to look up words like demagogue. I didn't have to look that ladies and gentlemen, you know what I mean, but I was forced to do all these things and that in a way is good. I mean that in a way you, you to have somebody to go, wait a minute, wait a minute. I, I can't afford to be, to not be politically committed right now. And here's another reason I don't like Hillary. The uranium one deal, and here's the way there. The reason I don't like trump, at least it got me thinking and talking. We're all talking about it and and younger people are listening to podcasts like this, or at least listening. Maybe they agree, maybe they don't, but hopefully both so that they can then formulate their own opinion.

Speaker 4:          00:48:32       Eddie Bravo things. We're going to war with Russia. Alrighty. Well, Eddie's done a lot of the big fear. The big fear in the conservative, the conservative, excuse me, conspiracy theory world is this has been explained to me that they think that they're going to start a war with Russia to distract us from the wikileaks wikileaks revelations because there's new ones that are coming out. Apparently new wiki leaks. Stuff's coming out and as if, as if people don't have enemies, everybody's anatomy in government. They couldn't answer my question. They cut. Julian assange is a Internet connection. What question was that? How do you define beauty as one word? Oh, what is it? It's what? The Greeks and rambled for an hour. I forgot what the fuck you suck. I did. Did Not wanna make sure Fran bold Richard brambles. Oh, you're ready for it? Yeah, go ahead. And this is how you define beauty.

Speaker 4:          00:49:22       How harmony. Hmm. Interesting. So when you see a cheetah running, why is it beautiful? All moving parts, all the parts and moving, but if it's running it, you're so beautiful. It's horrible running at your kid. Fuck you. I get it. If it's running at your kid, is that beautiful? Good question. It's a horror show. Beautiful beauty is without a doubt, as the old expression goes in the eye of the beholder. Certain people like certain things, certain people like certain kinds of art that I find disgusting. They love it. They love certain kinds of music. They love certain features on people. They love certain looks. As far as clothing goes, it's whatever the fuck you think it is. If it's beautiful to you, it's ridiculous. Anyway, few physical beauty and the human being. The difference between a person who's cheeks are this wide, like you know, like five inches wide or seven inches wide.

Speaker 4:          00:50:09       That extra two inches can make you look like a fucking Weirdo. Yes. Symmetry, symmetry and proportion. I'm talking about just the way you look. Not, not that it throws you off because you look at it, the FIBONACCI sequence of a person, like that's what happens when someone gets a nose job, you know if they have like a, a naturally huge and they get that bitch chopped down on something little will look weird about their face to you because your brain is used to looking at things in a very distinct sequence. The FIBONACCI sequence which exists on nautilus shells and sunflower seeds and all these different versions of it in nature, but it also you can use that sequence. You can use that, those measurements to show roughly what a person's facial features will be like. They're all kind of, they say so when you surgically mess with that?

Speaker 4:          00:50:54       Yeah. You fuck with the whole outline of your face. That's like when you see someone and their lips are way too big and their mouth is stretched too wide, so you know they've got started fillers in the horn. If it keeps going and some sort of a, a, a neck job where their faces pulled back, you're. You're immediately like your math is off on them. Like you're looking at them, you're like my math off. Like, why is, why are your lips so big? Like this isn't dogs I think will be like I've seen my neighbor used, do a lot of below. My dog would flip the. She'd come and go, hey, what's going on? In my thought was like, oh, get the fuck away from me. Like my dog immediately knew some shit was wrong with the way she was moving a. But that's someone who on coke, she was probably aggressive to your dog too and you're wearing around.

Speaker 4:          00:51:36       She's probably maybe, or she was just talking with my dog was like, I don't like this fucking person maybe, but I'm what the fuck we were talking about, we're talking about. And then we got to do something before that. Clarity and how beauty is beauty is dictates contextual, right? It's weird how like, there's certain things if people just decide or beautiful and there's certain things that are beautiful to certain people that just don't resonate with others at all, you know? And certain people or certain looks. You know, there's guys that are legitimately into morbidly obese women. Yeah. Really enjoy it. That's what's at new podcasts would disagree. I listened to that podcast and Gad said was talking about how even congenitally he went through a whole litany of reasons why hip to waist ratio and breast size and all that stuff and, and uh, symmetry and proportion are biological triggers for men and the idea that there isn't a standard of beauty that turns on men in general.

Speaker 4:          00:52:33       So, you know, and that's what I'm saying, there absolutely is of course, but there's certainly upset exceptions. Yes, there is a giant SPEC. That's why some guys are gay because that's their, that's where they fall into the spectrum. Their, their, their beauty to them, what they're attracted to his men, you know, and there's gonna be certain versions of men that are attracted to all kinds of, some kinds are attracted to giant lemon that can carry them around. Do you remember our crum? I shared to hearsay. Sad documentary is amazing. Great. I knew about him because our neighbors, when I was a kid, you know, my parents were hippies. We live in San Francisco from a age seven to 11. I lived in San Francisco and we had these crazy neighbors. He's gay guys. My aunt used to smoke pot, go next door and they would go get naked and play bongos together. This guy was black as the sky on a, on a moonless night and he would get high as fuck

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       and take all his clothes off and he was gay and his boyfriend, they would live together and they would, they would all just get naked and play bongos together. My aunt would go down there and get baked with them, but anyway, they had these comic books. They had our crum and there was the first time I was ever exposed to our crump. Weird guy. Well No, they would carry him. Oh, that's right. Had giant legs, enormous classes. They looked like avatar. Women like they didn't even look like they were real powerful. So he was, he was into like, like see, like he's got this all this power illuminating office, woman's giant legs and she looks like what you would see today, like from some crazy mega crossfit type chick, like their big muscular legs. That was what he was into. I wonder if though those kinds of examples are.

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       First of all, I wonder. I think everybody though, regardless of what your aberration, you're a perversion fetish is whatever you want to call the word. I think though that that still doesn't mean that they don't and can't recognize what would it be considered harmonious? Yeah, but it doesn't matter. Like I tell her, obviously he keeps taking drawing photos of these girls with giant legs and giant muscles and it says back that off a little so I could read the how to have fun with a strong girl. I stand before, before her trembling with anticipation. Then she struts and prances around the room, boldly displaying her magnificent physique. She's full of narcissistic pride is obviously enjoying the effect she's having on me and it's him. Our chrome, who was just nerdy looking guy and he's got boxer shorts on with a boner and socks and his hairy legs.

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       Really hilarious writing and hilarious artwork and that was what he was all about. It was all this weird perverted shit. So I got exposed to this stuff when I was like, shit, I guess I was like eight, somewhere around eight or nine. I was like, what the fuck is going on? Why is this guy into like giant women? Like, what the fuck is this? Yeah. And he had a bunch of different like characters that he would, uh, draw and all of these weird comic books. But, you know, it's, yeah, there's a girl at a giant in, you know, what's really weird her first day in the city. I mean this is, I saw this kind of stuff when I was real little. Okay. Well how do you explain this? So for me, look at the, all that asshole hair. It's amazing. It's such a good piece coming out with his nose in the air.

Speaker 1:          00:55:47       Um, I, I don't, I don't know if that messes with my head. What does that title that's going to be my next tattoo? My first tattoo. Her first day in the city. If you're looking for it, Google that original art crumb. What does it say? The rest snatches snatch comics. Is that the snatch? So he had a lot of vagina base. He's stepping into her vagina and he's looking around. He's looking around at this. Notice that giant vagina. He's about to step to step into it. Gosh. Contract type hood. Sure. Get a type could sure get last round here and not to step into her vagina. Looks like a chicken. Looks like I'm a tunnel. Here's hoping. Take City woman been. Oh my God. It's a metaphor. But here's, here's the thing that's confusing. I am very attracted to crossfit. Very muscular women. I think that's hot, right?

Speaker 1:          00:56:42       So I'd love to have one that can beat your ass. Nope. I just like that power in the legs and like a message you'd like them to underestimate you and you without russel them. Is that your move? I mean that has been in the past, but that's less. What's interesting. I think when I see a crossfit woman, like a woman who's just got a blow out ass and powerful legs and all that and uh, back on her, maybe I want to breed with our swipes. So maybe primarily I want to be with her. So my kids are studs, but I just find it physically very attractive. When a girl's got to an asset, you should find our chrome. He lives in Paris, which you could hang out. You could just jerk off together. Well, hold on because you're drawing Sarah. Hold on, hold on sir.

Speaker 1:          00:57:18       Because then there's the other side of me that likes a super feminine, petite, curvy woman and that might be who I'd rather cuddle with and date. Whereas the other one I just want to have animal sex with and so there's this. I'm kind of pulled. Yeah. Welcome to being a man. Motherfucker. Why you making this sound like it's a big complicated issue. Oh Man. I'm just saying I have to say maybe I just like all different kinds of went over you. This is what I'm into. I like my shakes in white chicks. Maybe there's a problem. You're right. What I'm saying is I'm attracted to everybody. Well, that's part of the problem with being a man is a genetically. You're designed to spread them jeans around as much as possible to ensure the survival of the race. However, that's not really necessary anymore. Like we used to die really young.

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       We were eaten by things left and right, so we have this fucking insatiable instinct to fuck all the time and get rid of loads and make people, but there's a lot of us now, like we figured it out somewhere along the line, but we still have the genes of people that live 10,000 years ago when your survival, it wasn't guaranteed at all and it was most likely that something would go wrong and so the, the likelihood of you staying alive past 30 or 40 was very low, so there was like a frantic urge to live. Yeah. You know, I think if we knew that we had way less time and that it was, the death was way more common. If we start 10 year olds will be walking on pregnant. Yeah. And that's how it is normally. Yeah. I think we decided some someone roll on the lawn, rightly so.

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       That's not, that's not healthy for our species. It's not healthy for our culture. It's not healthy for children to be burdened down by the responsibility of being a parent. While they're still trying to figure it out and they'd probably do a way better job if they waited, so all that stuff is sort of balancing itself out now because people are becoming more and more aware of it, so we don't, but we're still. We still have the same genes, so the same fucking caveman genes. The genetics have to be like constantly managed by the psyche, constantly managed by discipline, constantly managed by thinking, you know, whether it's yelling at somebody in traffic or whether it's all the other ridiculous male instincts that people have to, whether it's a star wars or to kick their ass because they're rooting for the wrong team and all that stuff is.

Speaker 1:          00:59:35       It's based on like these ancient reward systems that we've got stuck in our pilot. Things like excitement. It can be really weird things secretly for excitement and ideas to get charged up. Yeah. Being not as good word, a naughty bus. The naughty list. Pernod is huge because my friend, when I was with my buddy one time and this giant woman giant a big Oh my God. No, I'm not joking. Three hundred pounds. Gabby Garcia big. Yeah, but, but, but, but curvy are way more. Have giant tits. Jaimee. She was every bit of six foot five. Oh my God. I'm not exaggerating with her shoes off. I'm not kidding. Oh my God. Uh, I'll tell you later. I think you should be. You're asking more detailed with this story that everyone thinks she can beat your ass. There's, she could eat me as a whole. I mean, I never had to fight for your life.

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       If you were in a hotel ballroom, you got locked in there with her and she's coming full clip. She has. This is for real. She had no training. Uh, maybe I could tie her out, but I'd have no. The answer is probably not. Wow. Fuck her up. She'd come get some. You. She's, you're ready. You're ready to get low. If a giant woman, I'll tell you right now, there is a giant. There is a size where that a woman would hit where you. Regardless you. There is that number. How tall, how heaven can't hear this. Just bet on me, dude. Really? I'm gonna kick her ass. No woman from ever getting into a street fight with 350 pounds, six foot five woman, no woman on the planet. I'm going to kick her out. So she's there, she's there and I and I, and she says hi. She recognizes me and I go, oh, I'm kidding. Big giant women. Don't try to beat me up. These are just jokes. These are all just silly woman. Leave me the fuck alone. Don't hurt me.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       Just a bunch of waiting outside the door. Motherfucker. She has a beard. He sure you're a woman. I'm just, dude, I know shot, uh, an antelope or some, some animal in Africa that was a Hermaphrodite knew it was a female animal. Antelope with crazy horns like these crazy antlers that like curved in some weird way. We're actually digging into its head who was actually a call animal. They had to put it down because it's the way its horn was growing. It was like literally growing into its head. Oh Damn. It was comfortable. It was a very weird case. And they also, I guess they wanted to study its body because they were pretty sure it was a hermaphrodite wow. Yeah, that's a weird fucked. Again, all those genetic aberrations happened. Yeah. I was talking to this woman from South Africa recently at this party. I told you the story about all the kids that um, or

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       she grew up in. She lives in South Africa for awhile and it's really funny because she was talking about mountain lions and now how hilarious it is. The people are worried about mountain lions. We would have to worry about that. Rely on water. Buffalo snakes, all the above. All of the above. Um, but she was talking about a kids in silicone valley that are having problems dealing with their, they're hyper successful parents and the lack of time and attention that's being paid to them. And there's like a gigantic epidemic, suicides and all kinds of crazy shit. They're cutting each other. And it was a really disturbing conversation. And she called it, what they call, what they call it. Affluenza. You know, that's the term for young rich kids. But the thing is like nobody cared, like they didn't ask to be rich, but we blame them for being rich.

Speaker 4:          01:03:15       So like you don't look at a young rich kid as like a young kid with problems. You Go, Oh, poor rich baby, you know, like that somehow now that the money that these kids have when they're 16, they have a fucking fresh BMW. The money that money provides connection and love and, and, and that you mean something to your parents because it's so unattainable for so many folks. Money and being rich like one of these kids seems like, well they hit the lottery. I'm supposed to feel bad for them. But you don't realize that like they didn't ask for that. First of all, they didn't ask to be born that. And it's not ideal. It's not working out well. You'd be way better off with a happy healthy parents that were around and went to your sports events and hung out with Ya and did things with you and, and were there all the time and gave you a feeling of comfort while you're growing up.

Speaker 4:          01:04:03       So you can grow up with like a sense of security, like there's a lot of these kids that are grown up, they are all fucked up because their parents are never around. So you don't feel like you matter or you don't feel in many ways you feel like you were thrown away and rampant drug abuse, man. The amount of kids that are doing pain pills today as apparently just off the charts, they're doing adderall for studying and for for examinations and they're doing pain pills all the time. It's just become an epidemic with people. They're so fucking easy to get. I know they're trying to curb that. I try to make it more difficult to get, but there's still a ton of money that's being pumped into the system from the manufacturers of these, as you were talking about before, about the use of influence and in politics. The company that makes fentanyl is that I said I never figured that out. So fentanyl, they spent a half of a fucking million dollars on ads in Arizona just to try to make medical marijuana illegal. Try to make it to to to do ads against them in their recreational, like why would they give a fuck? Why are they doing that? Like why would, why would the makers of a pill like Google that too? Because it's another thing I keep wondering about how much stronger is that shit that oxycontin because it's much

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       stronger. Thought it was an elephant tranquilizer. I maybe I'm wrong. I don't know that what they were putting in the heroin and everybody was dying. Okay. They that, that I think is an elephant. Tranquilizer, fentanyl, whatever it is. I don't know if it's an elephant tranquilizer they use on the elephants and people, but they definitely use it on people. It was something to be stronger right then then, then, then, then I don't know. We're trying to find that out. I think at least I remember the number. 10

Speaker 5:          01:05:46       inverse.com. It looks like an okay story written on. It says it's 80 times as potent as morphine. Oh my God. Yeah. Which is 80 times of times the animal analgesic punch of heroin.

Speaker 1:          01:05:58       Well, Jesus said, there you go. That's got to be good. Yeah. Well, this is what people are dropping dead off and the company that makes that shit is trying to put out ads or pay for the campaign against marijuana being recreationally legal, which is just fucking crazy. It's crazy. You know? I know that they think that they're going to lose profit from marijuana being legal, so I know that they're acting out of a business purpose. It's that's just what businesses do, but you just expect them on something that's so fucking important culturally and such an important precedent like that. Any company that's against marijuana becoming legal, that is such a damaging position to take and if you get away with it today, by the time people examine this and by the time it's looked back on five, 10 years from now, whatever it is, you're gonna look preposterous, that you spent any money to try to make marijuana illegal reason.

Speaker 1:          01:06:58       I think no reason why anyone should step in and try to make it illegal. It's the will of the people and there is no medical evidence whatsoever that shows that it's even remotely as dangerous as a million different things that are already illegal. But that's, see, that's another, that's sort of another example of what I was talking about before, which is that you can try to legislate and pass laws and enforce sort of your view of reality of World War, what you think is good for people, but what's it seems to me a better way to go is to win the idea, what do the idea that marijuana is not as destructive. For example, in many ways I'm not an expert, but in many ways to say alcohol, which is legal. Well, it's just. You don't even have to say I'm not an expert. It's absolutely scientifically proven fact, but that act. But that took time to not only be sort of enough experiment just in real life and real time started to prove that to be true, but then that idea and that experience had to dissipate into the national or international collective conscious. Part of that was because of Richard Nixon, Richard Nixon funded study. They put studies together to try to find out what are the bad things about marijuana. They couldn't find anything. No.

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       This is way before that when reefer madness was in 19 thirties, the the shit that Nixon did, Nixon pass a sweeping set psychedelic act of 1970. That made everything scheduled. One those dmt and mushrooms and all that shit and that Nixon did and yeah, it was during his administration and they also. One of the things they did was they did these studies on marijuana trying to find things that were bad. They couldn't, and when the studies came up with favorable results, they buried them. And this is also been proven, so this is shit they knew for a long fucking time. It's just a team thing. It's going back to that same thing again is pro and con. There's, there's, you know, right and left and even along this marijuana thing, there's a bunch of people that are scrambling to try to keep it illegal as long as possible.

Speaker 4:          01:08:58       So that continues their profits with painkillers. Painkillers are worried that if marijuana becomes legal, if marijuana, especially edible marijuana, which is incredibly potent but doesn't have any of the fucking downsides, doesn't have any of the negative effects. No one's dying from it, which is the biggest one, right, and it's been shown to help so many people with seizures, so many different diseases. People that have aids, people that are on chemotherapy is hundreds and hundreds of different things that it's been shown to help with people with, um, uh, what is it? I'm glaucoma. What is that for the ocular pressure, international ocular pressure, relieved that it's amazing for inflammation for people that have back problems and all sorts of other issues regarding pain and inflammatory issues that people have, but these are the things that would profit from keeping it illegal are the same things to killing people and the idea that they're allowed to do that and that no one steps in and no politicians talk about it being huge, evil, and a real problem.

Speaker 4:          01:10:02       It's one of the things that's left completely off the debate. It's not to diminish sexual assault because obviously that's really important. It's not to diminish primary, obviously that's really important and those pay to play stuff and all these accusations of corruption on both sides. It's all very important, but man sows that love. That is. And also learning how to distinguish and learning, learning how to distinguish what you should label, for example, a psychedelic or. Well, not, not, not just that, but sometimes I wonder if if when you call for the legalization of marijuana, which I would do, of course, and I've always said that ultimately it's all about letting people make their own choices, but I wonder if it's important to distinguish between drugs, like do you think that it certainly is. Heroin and cocaine should also be legal. I think as an adult, as you Brian Callen the idea that me as me, Joe Rogan could tell you you can't do heroin is preposterous. Who the fuck am I? Who am I to tell you? Well, you can do it under a doctor's supervision or you could do morphine. You gonna have to have a morphine drip. You have a button. You're pressing. The morphine goes into your bloodstream. Man, I don't know. All

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       I know is a lot of fucking people are dying from pain pills and politicians never discuss it and why don't they talk about it. Just stop and think about is is is the big issue of one super rich guy who was a pussy grabber or is the big issue half a million people dying from cigarettes in this country alone every year? Is that an issue? How come at issues and discuss if there was something else that was killing half a million people a year, wouldn't we freak out? I agree. 100. If there was some new sport would have parked. Core was claiming a half a million kids every year saying that are saying the bigger, more challenging issues than a guy who is a groper. I would imagine roper. I think it's terrible to be a groper. I think it's certainly something that should be discussed. That's not the problem.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       The problem is they're not discussing this other thing. No, they're not discussing how many fucking people are hooked on painkillers. It's giant, massive epidemic and the idea that the same people that are selling those painkillers are actively working to make sure that marijuana stays illegal. He lets you know that you're in a crazy system when the protectors and the politicians don't bring that up at all because who's driving the narrative? Think about who's driving. Think about drive and then the people who are driving, driving the narrative in the, for example, in the lip, in the New York liberal media, right? That is why is it academics were academics and why is academia? Why is that driving the narrative on everything from gender to even social? Why? Why? Because we don't live in the real world. We assume they're the smarter ones, but they're they. They have theoretical knowledge and I think there's a place for academics and I think there's an obvious place for a strong intellectual energy, but my God, there's nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:12:53       There's no group more intolerant to new ideas in many ways. I would say religious people were far more intolerant than academics. I would think that academics on a whole would probably be very tonal pens. They just lean left. They just leaned left almost, almost exclusively, except when it comes to like economic. I don't think they're tolerant at all. I think they suffer from collective madness, in fact. Well, gender mania, I think. Look at, look at. Look at this. Let's take trump. I actually resent the fact that first of all, obviously I've never been a fan of this guys, but I resent the fact that people seem to be equating equating a groping and even even a kissing somebody or talking about it as rape, sexual assault to a woman, a woman who doesn't want it. If he comes up and grabs you on the poster is sexual assault. I would agree with that, but that is one of the accusations, right? Well, I want to distinguish between what is that sexual misconduct? Is it sexual assault? What is, what is the girl loves it. Then it's neither like if she, if she pulls her panties to the side and he goes, oh daddy goes down it and like you found a freak,

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       right? You know, but he took a big fucking chance where you just grab the pussy. She probably asked, well you're an asshole. She probably just say, hey, you're thinking about grabbing your posts. You're here. What do you think? Want to think about it for awhile? I'll be out here waiting. You've got to give her time to. And not under pressure. You don't want be looming over was a big guy. So he asked the Lord lawyer show.

Speaker 3:          01:14:30       I think these. These are really important distinctions because otherwise people that are a woman who's held down. Let's just take a terrible example, a woman, a stranger, breaks into your house, holds you down and rapes her, right? We would all agree that that is, that is fucking horrifying, right? And if you've found the guy be hard not to kill the guy and all that stuff, but, but let's make it. Let's make a distinction. Ready? Ready? A big bully. A guy like trump comes up, grabs you and, and, and puts his fingers in your mouth. That's pretty. That's pretty invasive. So hot. That's fucking evasive. And you're and you work for the guy and you're scared to lose your job. And he grabs you and he puts his finger, came out and he goes, come on baby. Give me a kiss. And because you're so afraid and so overwhelmed, you don't know what to do, and he starts kissing you and you're like, oh Jesus, let this be over with. I'm sure that's happened 1 million times in life with women. And this is why women when they see that shit, they go, I've met a guy like that. I've been 10 guys like that. And that's why the reaction for women is like, fuck this guy. He's going to fall by 14 points. However, let's as as citizens and in this discussion in the law, you have to make a distinction. Even the media, because if you start calling that rape or if you start calling that sexual assault versus, I don't know, sexual misconduct or I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:15:44       Wait, hold on a second. If somebody grabs you and kisses you and you don't want them to do that, it means that is. It is a form of assault. Not Assault punching you in the face, but it should be illegal to hold you and detain you and like and forced a kiss on you. Like you're violating that person's physical space. You're violating their humanity because you're choosing to enforce your wants and needs over what they want. Budget. Would you equate this problem? Fucking, you know, and I know that there have been times in people's lives when someone has grabbed a woman and kissed her and she loved it and they want up getting married and having kids. Yes. You never fucking know who the hell knows? I mean like no one wants sexual assault, right? No one wants anyone to have anything done to them against their will.

Speaker 4:          01:16:31       No one does this rational or kind in a way, shape or form. But we all know there's crazy moments in life, right? You know, there's weird things happen with people. People had sex without saying a word to each other. Dan Bilzerian was just talking about the other day. Sure. He met some girl in Paris. He purposely went out of his way to not say a word, see if he could do it and had sex with a girl. There's no consent there. It's just implied consent based on physical movement. So, so, so. So in other words, still, but my point is yes, but my point is do you shouldn't compare worst versions of rape and say that this version of what you would call sexual assault is not that big of a deal, but you're kind of saying that by saying that you're calling it why call, but you're diminishing the horribleness of the other people's experiences by actually getting physically raped and well, the nights of their neck and getting fucked by a book, there has to be a difference right there.

Speaker 4:          01:17:23       Has, there is a difference that the physical action is different in every single one. I mean it's, it's, it's different in a girl gets pulled over and the cop makes her suck his dick get out of a ticket. People have done that, right? That's, that's a different thing than, than uh, than a girl who grabs her a male employees dick all the time. I mean, that's a, that's unwanted and he doesn't want to lose his job, but that's not as threatening. How about this? There's a bunch of different experiences. My point in her, like anyone who's been grabbed, that doesn't mean that I mean by by, by saying that it's not as bad as getting raped. That's like saying, yeah, of course it's not as bad as gang raped and murdered. It's not as bad as getting raped and murdered and they make you eat yourself before they kill you. It's going worse and worse and worse

Speaker 3:          01:18:09       saying is that I feel there's a movement, a movement to have to treat all the perpetrators of that kind of behavior as one. And I think that's what standards. So for example, you have a guy who meets a girl. She does, you know, she drinks 15 Margarita's, uh, you guys making out. You're dancing. Uh, you go, he follows her. I don't know what happens. Next thing you know, somebody sees her. He's on top of her making out with her and he's fingering her and she was out cold. She's cold, she's holding the. Hold on, hold on. Now. We now in California, that's not considered rape. Somebody had to sit down and go, what's rape? Let's define it. Fingers in the mouth, fingers in the vagina or penis in vagina. We got to make these definitions and the law, the law tends to make very strong distinctions, knows distinctions have been thought about and fought over and stuff like that. And then we, we penalize people accordingly. Okay. Okay. Okay. However, it seems to me that in, for example, on certain colleges, they now have investigative committee committees, investigative communities who decide whether or not this was sexual assault or whether or not this was rape, where I think actually that should be anytime there's sexual, you know, assault or rape, shouldn't that be the police's job? Shouldn't that be reported immediately to the police? And isn't that, isn't that

Speaker 4:          01:19:33       or jurisdiction where there's a lot of lawsuits based on the, you know, the Occidental College one, you know, that one where a guy and a girl were exchanging text messages. Uh, she says, uh, you bring condoms? He says, yeah, I got condoms. Okay, they're ready to get laid. She says, uh, she texts, her friend says, I'm about to get laid. They have sex, and he gets kicked out for sexual assault because he's drunk. And she's drunk so he gets kicked out of school, she stays in the school and he's the, he's the perpetrator. But meanwhile there's so much evidence that they're both just young kids who got drunk and fuck. There you go it into a life and his life is ruined. Let's. He's suing the shit out of him and I hope he gets enough money so I can live in a Jay z video for the rest of his life.

Speaker 4:          01:20:14       Fuck them. You know, like look, every like any God damn person who has ever been 18 or however old these people were and been away from your parents for the first time and been drunk and hooked up with a girl like you, you, you don't know. There's nothing evil going on there. This is like two people that want to be together to get together. Like to call that rape in any way, shape or form is. That's crazy. Well, how about, how about this though, but see that, I agree with you, but that's so different than pussy grabbing, man. Pussy grabbing and pushing people up against the wall and kissing him. That is way more a salty sea. That's way more violation of your physical space. Gray. See, like if a big guy did that to me, if a big guy just grabbed me and kissed me and be like, oh my God, motherfucker, what do I do?

Speaker 4:          01:20:56       I don't want this guy to kill me. You know, it's some giant seven foot tall, 350 pound dude wants to kiss you. That's what it's like. I'm sure a woman and a guy like trump grabs you. That's right. Now, if you're a dude and you're into having big dudes grab you and kiss you, you like fucking bonus. I nailed it today. But I'm saying that if there is a movement to again, that the enemy is. There's a movement to lump all behavior under the same sort of dark. See, I don't think there is, man. I think there's a movement to make people more aware of behavior like that. Hold on. How about this? This is where I think things get crazy. A woman has sex, she gets drunk, she has sex with a guy, and then she speaks to somebody who says you were drunk.

Speaker 4:          01:21:37       Um, and do you have regrets about it? I have regrets about it. Well, if you have regrets then that that's rape. Now somebody says that to her and she goes to a committee in her school who does an investigation and now you're being investigated because this girl has regrets. Six months later, this is where, in my opinion, madness starts to this very scary. It's very scary because now you've got have mob mentality over there. It's all he's hearsay the guy. The worst thing that can be branded as a sex criminal. My God, I ruined your whole fucking life and it's easy to get. The distinction you have to do is have one person who hates you, accuse you of. There you go. Bam. So now what? So, so I'm just saying we better start making these distinctions are mines forget that. That's where the white nights will step in and say what is most important is women safety.

Speaker 4:          01:22:27       And if I have to be wrongly accused, I had a conversation with a guy who actually said that on a podcast. He said that if, if he was wrongly accused, that he would be happier with that than with a woman facing some sort of sexual assault, which is this first of all, as if they're in any way, shape or form connected. Personally, it goes back to my point, wrongly accused means you have a shitty system and someone lied like it shouldn't. That shouldn't be the case at all, but that it shouldn't be an option. That goes back to my point. You're not gonna. You're not going to liberate women by falsely accusing. Men were so. This guy's like signing up to be the diminished party signing up to be the more vulnerable parts. I'll take the hit, take the hit. I'm a white knight. Yeah, it is a light, but it's also not happening to him when he's talking about it because it was happening.

Speaker 4:          01:23:15       You'd be freaking out screaming your innocence from a rooftop yelling about how you used to be a feminist because I can't believe this is happening because 10 injustice. Yeah, it is an injustice, but there's a gang of injustices there. The grabbing and the pussy grabbing, that's an injustice to write. It's just like what's. Where's the level? And I think one thing as men that it's easy to think of is, is it's, it's easy to forget that when you're a chick, there's a whole nother element when you're dealing with men and that element is size, strength, and even though violence is five, highly unlikely in any work place scenario, you still feel like if you're. Your body knows that if the shit went down, Donald Trump could choke you to death. Yeah. Don't, don't you think your body would know that? Not only does your body know that, but women all around you.

Speaker 4:          01:24:06       If he grabbed you, he's bigger than you. You know that, right? Yeah. He grabbed you in wanting to kiss you and just grabbed you and kiss you. Would that be assault if he grabbed you and him alone? He grabs you, grabs you. Package. Yeah, and he shoved his tongue down. Usually pins you up against walls. That assault. Yeah. I beat his ass though. What of your heart? God got me confused. And what does he smell? Good does he, does he have trump breath? I think, I think you're totally right about these committees in campuses and universities and I also think there's a real problem and telling young kids are victims when they might not necessarily be victims that you know, you, you, you enforce this sort of victim mentality and then you get people really hooked on outrage, getting hooked on outrage as opposed to getting hooked on acceptance and working on your own, your own self and your own thing and your own issues, but you're also taking power away from women when you do that.

Speaker 4:          01:24:56       So, so what he's saying is that, okay, so women have to be protected at all costs and that's the most important thing. And I, I will be there, I will have legislation there, I will have committees there and all of us are going to protect women on campus and because they can't protect themselves, they can't, they can't look out for danger. They can't see because I win in most of the time. Know that what? Even a 100 men are safe. There's always one seminar. Let me stop you there because here's. We're going to go back and forth because you and I agree on this, but here's the question. All right. How do you stop campus sexual assault? Now that we know that there's a lot of it where they're trying to stop or getting people in trouble for shit that's not really sexual assault, but we also know that there's a lot of guys that are fucking douchebags and guaranteed someone's going to get drunk. It's happened before. They've caught them on tape or people are passed down. There's a train of dudes out the bedroom. How do you stop people from doing shit like that? That's the real question. It's not like accusing more people because then you're going to get people that are even more frustrated with the opposite sex. If you find out that guys are getting locked up in jail for doing the exact same thing, their girlfriend

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       was both being drunk and both having sex and the guy all of a sudden is a sexual Predator because he's drunk. There are two ways to do it. The first is you raise awareness, but that the second is you. You learn we're not to place your energy. You learn. We're not to be pointing your guns because when you do the other, when you diminish, yeah, you, you are not making the problem better. So we're wasting a lot of time and energy in by, by, by sort of condemning and going after this ankle when we should be like, what, what? It goes back to what does that wonderful saying? I don't care what you think. It's how you think that what's more important is not what you think, but how you think. It's like a woman says, these radical Islamists are bastards and my opinion, you know, we should just eradicate all of them.

Speaker 3:          01:26:48       Well, you sound like a Nazi. You're thinking the way, not the Nazis and nicest. You're thinking exactly how your enemy and the person you're criticizing us. So it's really methodology here. Hey, you would know this. This is a good question for you because somebody said when he wrote this the other day about how when we call Isis, um, when we first started having conflicts in the Middle East after the Iraq war, it's a Sunni and Shia in Iraq, and then there's all these other groups and factions, the Taliban, there's al Qaeda and there's a Boko Haram, there's all these different factors. We sort of kind of lumped them all together and decided they were one big enemy. That's a fact. And I want you to say this, like that guy and the drug commercial that's eating the salad and the guy goes. So you're saying that if I buy drugs or support terrorism, so, so, so, so she, the fact that I, I think to draw the distinction though, Taliban, what is Talib?

Speaker 3:          01:27:42       It means student. So if you're a Taliban, you're a student of the Koran, you know, you're a student, uh, uh, al Qaeda. Okay. That means the base loosely translated sort of. This is the base. This is as now. Is this what they call themselves a? I believe they do, yes. I think these were, these were names that were given to themselves and then, and then a Boko Haram. Haram in Arabic means a bad, like you say, like an Arabic. A lot of times when something happens that's bad, you always say you had, um, you know, like that's fucked up, you know, almost. So Boko Haram is sort of a slang, I believe, loosely translated idea that everything western is bad. Whoa, okay. That's outrageous. And it also part of those folks drugs. It also has happens to be the fact then the case that these are all Islamic movements, but when you say Islamic movements, be careful because what you're really talking about is puritanical.

Speaker 3:          01:28:38       The notion that there is a puritanical strain. There's only one form of Islam and that Islam is the Islam that the prophet preached in the what, what century is it? The 13th or 15th or whatever it is. So, um, that is, if there's any glue to those groups, it is that they essentially adhere to a very strident, puritanical form of Islam with no room for interpretation. There is only right and wrong and they are willing to resort to what they would consider to be jihad, which the root of which means struggle, but then what they, what they considered to be, you know, violence isn't, is a, is a, is the only option and Islam must sail in a sea of blood because that's the only way it happens. So there's all this sort of idea that, you know, will use the slave fix that. So, so, so, so that again, what is that?

Speaker 3:          01:29:30       That's an idea. It's an ideology. You have to kill the bad guys, but you also have to win the workplace of ideas. I mean the battlefield, the battlefield of ideas, that's very important. Not only that, when the casualties are so one sided in terms of like all of it is taking place in one part of the world versus in our part of the world where we're engaging in a completely different spot in the country. It makes martyrs, you know, it makes a lot of people get excited about joining the cause. They, they see the imbalance and the conflict. They also see. They also see though that when they go through Istanbul airport and they get into Syria and they die really quickly, that it's, uh, it's, they're starting to realize very quickly that it's also a death sentence. You don't want to fuck with the peshmerga.

Speaker 3:          01:30:10       You don't want to fuck with, you know, the American Special Forces. I mean, these guys are just getting. And now the Russians in you're, you're asking for if you want to join isol now, please go ahead and have a real issue with isis and Eisele a key. They keep changing their name back and forth, uh, wasn't, uh, it wasn't Isi at one point in time. I still state right? It means the, uh, too many, um, too many different isis. This stick with one year, a new band. They want to create a challenge. Your name, they want credit, caliphate, you know, they want to create an Islamic state, which means there are no those boundaries. Syria, remember Lebanon, those were British boundaries. Those were, those were created by the British after World War One a, in some cases world war two, but for the most part, those are British boundaries. Not so recent.

Speaker 3:          01:30:56       Think about how recent that is, folks. Very recent. It's ridiculous. That's not even a hundred years. It's nothing. I think that the problem with Islamic fundamentalism is not as much a worry because they're not offering anything. Communism had a something that lasts that that ideology lasted 70 years, but I think it lasted so long because communism was something that you could kind of. There was a compassionate element to it, you know, don't believe in God, believe in reason, and let's live on communes and all share and be nice to each other. That idea is pretty potent and especially the young people who are trying to figure the world out and who love each other and any sanders. Yeah. I'm Goddamn Kami. Right. Well, he's definitely a social thing to Bernie sanders stepped in right now. He would win. Like if he ran as an independent, it'd be like, look, I can't let you people do this. Fuck the Democrats. I'm going independent. You don't need the libertarian. They don't know what they're doing. I can do this. We could figure this out folks. This is a disaster tooled. How dare you. It just looks a little up in step in right now. Has Got Shitty posture. He needs one of those neck things. You're hanging from the doorway. Yeah. He looks too old

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       and he's just to please man, don't forget about what he looks like. He almost got in. He got real close look, man. Uh, I think also that Bernie Sanders, how dare he say such horrible things. He's, he's, he's pretty. He's, he's, um, I just think people. He's not very presidential and plead the presidency is a symbolic post as well. It's very much a symbolic post. What would you listen to what you just said? He's too old. He's tall. He's too old looking. He doesn't seem very presidential. That's what the electric say. Well, why? Why would you say that though? Well, that's what I'm saying. That's when would, when you don't think that if he stepped in now as an independent, that he'd have a real chance. At the very least, he would confuse the fuck out of the system because there's a giant movement of people that wanted to see him in place.

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       You want to see him as democratic representative. Yeah. And those people be super energized if he did step in. I Dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno about that. Oh Wow. I don't know. I think for sure for sure. I think there's still a giant movement of people out there that love that guy and loved that he was. He seemed to be like a guy who wasn't greedy. He seemed to be a guy who wasn't corrupt. Like how is this possible? I don't think he is cropped and I don't think. I don't think he is either. But that was. That's the number one issue with someone like the Clintons. And then the thing is that everybody thinks that that's the only way to do it. Like the, the what, what people that support the left. The people that are really into being Democrats, they have this thing that they've sort of resigned themselves to, hey, this is politics.

Speaker 1:          01:33:26       This is how they do it. This is politics as usual. When, when you have an example of a guy like Bernie Sanders, you go, well, no, it doesn't have to be like, look at that guy like that guy didn't do it. Cal Come. They have to do this, they have to get that money to speak. They have to do all this shit. They have to talk to the banks. They have to. Are you sure they have to or is it just this is what the. The people that do the things that you liked the most. They also do these things. Is that okay? That's okay for you, but sometimes I think that that things start to happen by default, so if you started, let's just say we we could return to kind of scramble everything up and go back to set point zero. I feel like in 30 years we'd be right back to where we started.

Speaker 1:          01:34:07       Like somebody talking about factory farming. It's talking to a guy who has been in the food business forever and I was talking about. There's a book called the tornado effect about when how food flavoring. When scientists figured out how to make a corn chip tastes like a Taco, it kind of changed everything because we were able to isolate flavors. There was a machine that allowed us to. Because we didn't know why strawberry tastes like a strawberry on ours, tastes like an orange, but um, and I had this guy on my podcast on the Brian Council and, and uh, the, the, the guy who writes this book about how food flavoring changed the way we ate and it ended up, it allowed us to take very non nutritious food and make it nutritious. Trying to figure out how you're gonna bring this back to factory farming. If we ended up and he was talking about how we need to get back to sort of, you know, family farming and farming and stuff. But I

Speaker 3:          01:34:57       talked to this guy who was in the food business. He said, you know, the problem with that is that family farms are a great idea and we do probably need more family farms, but what would happen is probably in the next 20 years we'd be back to factory farming. I said, what do you mean? He said what would happen is that some farms wouldn't be as efficient or they wouldn't be as good and in another farms better and that farm and say, let me buy you a farm. I do a better job, and then that he'd say, let me buy this farm, and then he had all of a sudden he'd buy all the farms in this area because he's really good at organization automation and everything else and that would start to happen. Then a bigger company to come along and say, let me buy all your farms, man, you've got market share here and I can do this even better because there's a better way to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:35:32       Not only that, keep the prices stable because we're going to have a lot of eggs. So when I hop I have doesn't have to say, well today, since we only get our, our eggs from a local source today they're the eggs are $5. Whereas yesterday were three 99. That's kind of what would happen because it would depend on production and distribution. And so he was kind of saying, you know, it's nice to think that we need family farming, but chances are with such a huge population that we have to feed the way we do it as quickly as we do, we'd probably be back to, hey, we're running out of chickens who can make a chicken that can mature in six weeks. Well that's the big issue. The big issue is the population and a big issue

Speaker 4:          01:36:13       will do their best, you know, they do their best to recycle. They do their best to try to figure out how to pollute the least and consume the least and leave the smallest carbon footprint. And some people are very conscious about it. But there's a lot of things that people overlook and one of them is all the vegetables that you get from the grocery store, no matter what, if you think you are somehow or another Karma free because you're only eating vegetables. Man, I hate to tell you, but that whole thing of growing vegetables in mass is only slightly less controversial than growing animals in mass. It's all weird. There's a lot of displacement. Wildlife. There's a lot of pollution of the environment due to pesticides, the runoff from the salt and sea that I was telling you about. That's all directly attributed to farming and most of it is agriculture.

Speaker 4:          01:37:00       It's great. It's fucking pesticides and shit. It all flows down down river and you're fucked and there's a lot of other issues like first of all, it's not natural. It's not natural to keep growing things in one spot. That is just not how the world is supposed to be designed. It's supposed to be a gigantic cycle of animals dying and their bodies rotting and their bodies fueling the plants that they actually eat, and then animals eat them and they die and their bodies rod and fuel the plants that grow around them. We've circumvented that thing with these giant things we call cities. We figured out a way to stack all these people on top of each other and then we had to figure out a way to get them all food because the fucking buildings kept growing and the people kept needing more and more and more and they're running out of room fuck. And so that's the problem, the problem is we got the cart way ahead of the train, we're what we're way ahead of it. And we didn't, we didn't anticipate for 7 billion people, we didn't anticipate for 300 million Americans and

Speaker 1:          01:37:55       we're kind of doing it right now, but even with our vegetables, we're fucking up giant chunks of land, you know, even with our vegetables. And do you think it's not easy like this idea that it's easy to feed a bunch of people at 20 million people with a Vegan Diet? Goddammit, it's not, it's not easy to feed 20 million people with any kind of diet and it requires a lot of resources and organization and, and you know, sort of consolidation. Yeah. No, but I would imagine it's not saying factory farming from animals is awesome. It's disgusting. It's scary that it got this far and he got this far while we weren't paying attention to it, all of us. I think pretty much all Americans at one point in their life had to be told of factory farming. And then when, what the fuck, like this wasn't something that was discussed when we were in high school.

Speaker 1:          01:38:44       When I was in college, there was never a word and I was barely in college by the way, but when I was in college were the same age. That's what I'm. What I'm saying is no one discussed it. It wasn't this gigantic issue. I don't think we were quite as aware. That's another creepy things. Those AG gag laws were to legal, to film these horrific conditions that pigs Robert concerns have to live in. That's you can. You can go to jail for letting people know about animal torture that's being taken place where they're hitting a fucking cow in the head with a wrench. I saw this crazy video of this guy crowbars a cow in the head. The first time I ever saw the first time I ever learned about factory farming was there as a pamphlet in my college and they were talking about how smart pigs are and how they.

Speaker 1:          01:39:30       They. They showed a picture of a pig chewing the bars independent within and how pigs go crazy because they want to roam with. They're too smart to just sit in that pen and I got so claustrophobic that I didn't eat bacon for a year out of compassion. I was like, I can't eat bacon now to Kenny Baker. And then he was right back on the big show. And then I read a book called fit for life, which was all about being a vegetarian. Try that for about six days. Didn't work for me. I just can't do it. Well, vegetarian is way more healthy than just going straight Vegan. As far as like own, I say way more healthy, meaning that it's easier to be waiting on healthy. Like you can pull off the Vegan thing if you're super on the ball with your essential fats and you make sure you take, what is it, Dah da. And there's a pet.

Speaker 1:          01:40:12       What is the, the, the, the um, Omega threes and sixes that you can get from the fuck. Is that stuff called that you get from a flag from Kelp? Flaxseed, flaxseed, flaxseed. But apparently the biological stuff is better. There's Omega threes and sixes that you can help an animal though. No, it's plant kelp is not thinking about. I'm thinking about Krill. Krill. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's an animal. Well, you know, here's another thing that a Sam Harris was telling me is that mollusks, if you. At least if you look at them on paper, there's more of an argument to be made that plants are intelligent than molochs. Really? Yeah. Models. They don't feel shit. That is a little blobs of snot. It is living. Come live in com that lives in a shell. You know, they're weird. There's a weird little things and apparently they're super, super primitive.

Speaker 1:          01:41:07       Will all what we decide that they are an animal that should not be eaten. Whereas a plant is something that should be eaten based on whether or not they move. Wait, wait. What's a scallop death? Not the same as a mollusk. Well, this Gallup is a mollusk clams mussels, scallops. There's a lot of different shelled organisms, but they're super, super, super primitive. I did not have nerve endings. Like, yeah, they don't feel pain. Like that's the other thing about lobsters. Lobsters is creeping. Where do they are? Apparently they don't feel pain. Too primitive to feel pain. There's a great essay by David Foster Wallace called consider the lobster and it's all about this. Yeah, I don't know. I mean there's a thing called the lobster liberation organization to break into restaurants and they take lots and they throw them back in the ocean. What kind of a one?

Speaker 1:          01:41:51       Kind of a radical group that's trying to get proof for that group. I just want to get that phone call from. From jail. I'm in jail. Which you do. So we met from the law to get into a fistfight. What did you read? This pamphlet would judge me. No doubt. I uh, I let a lobster free what I let lobsters free. Oh, those giant Cunty roaches. That one. Just bite your fingers off. You let those things for dummy. They are members. Delicious insect family. I guess the other they are. That's why if you eat cricket, a flower like that, it was a thing in protein bars. If you have an allergy to shellfish, you can break out. And that's so true, and I can validate that by fear factor, fear factor. We gave people roaches and one of the dudes that we gave roaches was allergic to shellfish.

Speaker 1:          01:42:40       So when he ate the roaches, he got sick due to Roche. Yeah. It wasn't like very overrated is. No, it's not. It's not terrible. Tasting is not a big deal. It wasn't. It wasn't hard to do hate the body that I just. I had a giant one. It was a Madagascar hissing. Cockroaches. Yeah. It was like a live on that. I mean, could for sure. One hundred percent. Yeah. You could live on that same weekend. Live on crap. Where'd you afraid it was going to bite you or no? They don't bite. That's kid of a bug. Fuck. I'm tests of bug, but poison didn't have poison. I knew I was going to Jack. I'm quick. Was it dirty in there? Yeah, whenever. So it a peanut butter and Jelly Sandwich and drop on the ground. If you're hungry, you pick it up and you just ate a Goddamn cockroach. Bad Dude. People been eating them forever. We were insectivores probably before we ever figured out how to kill animals. Fuckers. Yeah. Oh look, no bond deal, dude. It's no big deal. They'll look at young Joe Rogan was ending that young man. Full head is fairly young. Fairly. C'Mon dude. Look at these poor girls.

Speaker 1:          01:43:39       Dude. You just did it. It's, it's not that big. Show this and let's not even move on with this. You're not really that. It's um, I coughed a lot. There was a lot of little parts and stuff that we're going down the back of my throat, the whole um, little legs and shit, you know, because it's, you're chewing up this hard, hard skeleton and trying to swallow that too. That made me gag a couple of times. But as far as like taste, it's really nothing. It's like almost like a void of taste and Merlin Mann. Allah gave me the back of the deer's eyeball. Oh yeah, that's right. It was fat. And he said to that just like chewing gum. And I was like, no. He said it tastes like dough. Yeah, like dough. Yeah, like bread dough. It did SORTA. It looked like bread dough, interesting. Like it's fat behind the eyes. While I appreciated the fact that he eat that too. He eats everything. Hell yeah. Know that guy has more respect for, uh, a downed animal than, uh, any, any hunter of. Yeah, buddy down to dude, you did I miss.

Speaker 4:          01:44:41       Well, is this a thing? Here's the other thing, like everybody can't do that. That's a really important point to point to bring up whenever we're also pro hunting and talking about how great it is to eat animals that you've harvested yourself, you know exactly where they came from. You. They're wild. You know, they've never been abused and never been raised in slavery and Fed antibiotics and hormones. They lived wild until you shot him. Yeah. But everybody can't do that. That's, there's a problem with that too. Like even even admitting that, like even saying that like for me personally, it's the better option. I enjoy that option. I think it's the best option. It's still everybody can't do it, so it's, we're fucked no matter what. But we've come a long way with just feeding people. Half the world was starving in the seventies, of course with.

Speaker 4:          01:45:23       We just weren't back to what we're saying, you know, factory farming. That's how they did it. I mean they figured out how to do it. Large scale agriculture, indiscriminant combines that chew up the amount of animals that die when they chew up the fucking grain and corn and all the different things. They. It's a fucking horror show. My friend John Dudley who lives in Iowa, he has a farm and he says when they run those combines, when they pick up whatever grains or whatever they have, they run these big giant ass machines and he says, you'll see the buzzards circling in the sky. Like they literally know that things are just. Oh, you mean like rats and rabbits and rats and rabbits and deer fons and ground nesting birds. Fuck, I never thought of that. All those animals don't realize that these, what they're living in is temporary.

Speaker 4:          01:46:11       They look at it as, oh, this is an awesome shelter. I'm going to go in here. It's thick with all these branches. No predators are going to find me. I'll just go here and nest so, so that. Now the green tea, I've never heard this grain combines. Have you ever seen a green combine? Now Jamie, Jamie, pull it up and you'll get an understanding, an understanding of what kind of volume you're talking about. So, so in your bread you're saying with the grain, because you have a lot of animal. That's totally that. It's not just that, well, I don't know how good it is for you and how much of it gets baked off, but the problem is it's not animal death free. It's just not right. We were showing something. Brian put up this video the other day of a grain silo in Russia and now these pigeons fall into the grain silo and try to eat the grain.

Speaker 4:          01:46:56       Then gets sucked into the gears as the the silo or the machine is turning up the grain so they land on the grain and try to get some of it and then they get sucked into the gears over and over and over and over again. We're launching like 10:15 of them and like of course of a couple of minutes get sucked into this machine that chews up the pigeons. And so. So when they say what does the machine taking the grain and making it finer, is that what it's doing? Well, yeah, but let's, yeah, well let's not, let's see. A large view so we can get an understanding of the mass. So that's just, that's a small one. Look at large scale grain combine and see if you could find a video of it, but they have these fucking hundreds of feet long and they're just chewing up giant chunks of these crops and when they're doing these large scale agriculture, like that one right there.

Speaker 4:          01:47:42       Perfect exam. But isn't that, isn't that just clear cutting? That's not actually using any of that stuff. No, it's using it. That's how, that's how they chew that shit up dude. Yeah, but that's not, that's not a, that's actually isn't a cornfield. They, they pick the corn. That's actually um, I believe that's a truck going through it and taking out all those they can replant. I think it is possible that that's what that is, but there's a bunch of different kinds of machines they use for that same kind of purpose, meaning for whether it's they're just going to replant them, whether it's their harvesting. Um, there's got machines running over that ground all the time, like see if you could find the big combines, they spread out like a t and it's like, so there's a truck and then to the right and the left, they spread out on either side with these just years that chopped down the plants and then get them ready for harvest.

Speaker 4:          01:48:30       And they also do it when they're, um, when they're making hay, you know, they do that. They have these machines that they drive through and chop everything down and they roll it up for hey, like here. So that's a combine. And that thing, as that guy pulls it, that thing is chewing up every fucking thing that's down there. Everything and animals, especially Fonz is one of the weird things about deer fonds when they're really young, they just stay put. So they, uh, if they hear things, you could literally walk up to a baby deer fond and if the mom's not around you can touch it because their instincts until they get old enough to run away from stuff, their instincts are to stay put just to ensure survival. So a lot of them get chewed up in this and there was some estimation that I read when they were talking about the problems with this and the ways they were trying to figure out how to mitigate wildlife loss from use of indiscriminate combine.

Speaker 4:          01:49:24       It's like this. And they were talking about each pound of grain. How many animals has to die. I don't remember what the number was. Oh, this is the video of the pigeons that gets shoved into this, uh, for the grinder. Yeah. Oh Dude. He goes on forever. You guys? Yeah. Whoops. Oh No. And they keep doing it. So they're not smart enough to figure out what's going on. Look at that one. Whoops. Oh Shit. Fuck. This is insane. Yeah. Then this is going away there. Granted, fly. You made it. You made it to fly. Well how about that? One in the end, she's just watching his buddies go down. He doesn't say a goddamn thing. One of them jumped right in the middle of was like, Hey, look at this. It's amazing. Just flag it. There you go. Guys said WHO's going to get smart now?

Speaker 4:          01:50:04       This one's. This one's gone. Say it dude. Oh, last week. I bet you could make a lot of money. This is what. This is a gambler's dream. I got the one right. Is this one going to get down and I'd have to have stacks of money on the name of this video. Jamie. Oh Dude, you went to facebook exploding. Oh, that's not it. What was the pigeons are being sucked in with the green on a bread making plant in Russia. Russian pity comes up. Okay man. You too. But. So the point is to make gigantic groups of people happy and fed even just with vegetables. You need a lot of that stuff going on. So it's not nice to anybody. It's not nice. I mean this is, again, this is not defending factory farming, which is obviously disgusting and horrible and it's a. it's one of the darker aspects of human civilization, the fact that standard in the United States that that shit is really, really, really common and that's how we can afford meat so cheap, but even vegetables, even vegetables, it's not like growing your own shit.

Speaker 4:          01:51:12       Ideally what we're supposed to do. Those were all supposed to grow our own shit. We're all supposed to have a piece of land and you're supposed to have vegetables on it and he's supposed to have a few animals that you raised, whether it's for for milk or for cheese or for meat or for whatever. That would be the way you could do it. It's just not scalable. It's just not scalable. People would starve. Well, it's not scalable in terms of the way we've decided to jam everybody into these cities. It's just not well. Again, I think that was just what would happen anyway. By default, people organize. You feel safer in cities. You get more access to food and shelter of course, of course, but if you. If you stop and think about the requirements, like the food requirements of all these people, people are.

Speaker 4:          01:51:55       It's so easy for someone you and me included to say, oh, I don't have time to fucking gather and hunt someone, go get my food. I've got to do comedy. I got to set, I got to do at the Improv. I'm going to go to the store and buy a sandwich. You know, like you want that access and it seems like the only way you can get that kind of access to supermarkets and fast food restaurants, the only way is this system that we've got now, like where you've just got massive amounts of animals. They're getting slaughtered it. It allows for thought and things that you see if you have to live. If you have spent so much of your time just feeding yourself and your family or whatever that, that, that somebody was talking about. Well, where? Why did Greek philosophy philosophy come out of grace where they had all that time to think? Well, a lot of like certain. I think it was the historian William Mcneil said, well, they were able to export timber, olive oil

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       and wine, and so they made money. Their economy. You could actually have some leisure time, you could buy leisure time because they would trade, you know, for all those, for those goods that were wanted everywhere. So what happened was you had, you know, there are people that made a lot of money and they could sit around and think [inaudible] they could be somebody was there to feed them and they didn't have to worry about things that the climate was temperate. Uh, so you didn't have to. We're really worried about the winter as much. I mean it gets cold, but not that goal. That's so fascinating because that mirrors what John Anthony West said about Egypt. He was talking about the early days of ancient Egypt and the Nile River being such a fertile area and the food just blew up out of nowhere. Like it would just, it would just, it was easy to, to, to grow things also is also animal grasses that grew.

Speaker 1:          01:53:30       Anyway, you know that there was barley and there was I think millet and there was, you know, that that's a huge factor that you didn't know you could cultivate and the natural grasses that just grew anyway, we're also wheat. The, those were there so you didn't have to kind of import them from other places. So it's like we need these kinds of situations like these city type situations where we have massive amounts of resources, but we're doing it on a scale that no one else has ever done it before. We're doing on this really bizarre scale and we have to recognize that this is all incredibly recent in terms of like human history, like to jam millions and millions of people in cities. I mean there had been a few cities in China that had done it, you know, there's a few places around the world that had done it, but they were essentially primitive.

Speaker 1:          01:54:17       They were, you know, like you're talking about what they've done in terms of developing a city where it had a million people in the year, 1200 versus what has to be done in the year 2016. First of all, you have electricity, you have power everywhere. You have sewage lines running everywhere. You've got all these people shitting and pissing into tubes and then pumping water through this fucking pipe that gets rid of it somewhere. You got to get rid of all that shit. Piss water. You've got to figure out a place to put it. You've got to have treatment plants for it. I mean you have to bring in truck boron over bridges and the same places where everybody else's and they're filled with chickens and pigs and fucking and cabbage and you just got to constantly just keep bringing them food and bring it out there. Shit, bringing in their food, bringing out their shit.

Speaker 1:          01:55:06       You know what else that does for, for agricultural communities that the benefit for [inaudible] when agricultural communities we go to war with, like you know, a nomadic tribes or with with the exception of the Mongols, but with nomadic tribes and other like native Americans for example, is that when you come from a tradition of agriculture and cities like that where you have contact with animals, nasty diseases, nasty diseases start to breathe and then you build an immunity to it, but guess who doesn't? The people you come into contact with. So, so many of the people like the native Americans, they were killed by bullets, but they were mainly killed by things like influenza and the European diseases that they

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       had zero contact with. Well, that's interesting because a Dan Flores wrote up a paper thing was called bison diplomacy. Bison ecology. Bison, Bison Ecology or reading his book right now about coyotes and he wrote this book about the Buffalo and he said that the mass numbers that people had seen of the buffalo when there was, you know, millions of them roaming across the plains. It coincided with the native American population dwindling substantially because of disease by Europeans. When the Europeans came over and brought diseases, it wiped out a giant percentage of the population and he. His contention was Spanish, right? Is that, who can say yes and French too, right? I think it was mostly Spanish, but yeah. But anyway, Europeans that came over and they brought a bunch of dirty daddy candy bags and their pigs and I'm on also horses of course, but they said he said that the native Americans with a firearm and with horses were already on their way to extra padding the buffalo from a lot of its range before they got hit with these crazy diseases so that when you saw these millions of Buffalo, it was a direct response to a lack of a predator.

Speaker 4:          01:56:55       Wow. A lack of a competent Predator, one that they used to have in the native Americans that would follow them around with the native Americans that were introduced to firearms. I believe he was talking about firearms and um, maybe even spears and bows and arrows as well. But the horseback was the big issue because being on horseback you can just get right to the buffalo, you just follow. They don't, but they didn't even know what the fuck you were, you know, they let you get right up on them like they never got jacked by horses before they get jacked by wolves and they got jacked by mountain lions and they never got jacked by a horse, a horse with a dude on it with a fucking spear of my side, which is run up on them and kill him, kill a ton of them. And then they would all feast and they would follow the buffalo herd around and just keep jacking him, you know, and most likely that this, uh, this Guy Dan Flores is saying that they were on their way to diminishing the population's greatly.

Speaker 4:          01:57:48       And he points to the early European travelers who came through. They didn't talk about the Buffalo. There's no, no mention of the Buffalo. They talked about all these other animals. They talked about elk, they talked about deer. They talked about bear, who talked about antelope. They talked about all these plains animals that they discovered and encountered. They didn't talk about buffalo from. From how far back? Way Far back when they first started coming in [inaudible] 91. So that. Yeah, so the early settlers accounts did not include these massive populations of Buffalo. So when they had gotten to these crazy numbers, like when they started killing them for. There's a bunch of different reasons why they killed them and one of the reasons why they killed him was there for another one was their tongues. They would kill gigantic herds, just thousands of Buffalo. They just take their tongues and leave their bodies to Rye. They use their tongues like they ate them. They were there. A delicate. Yeah, there was, I guess it was valuable at the time

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       and they also, they used it for the meat market so they would kill them and they would take them and they would sell them to market. So there were, there were market hunters and they were just indiscriminately white bow, just giant numbers of them. So without a doubt the the native, the native Americans were on their way. But we showed them how to do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There are always stories about sort of cowboys with their shoulders that were black and blue because they were shooting buffalo all day long and then they would take the tarps and stretch them out and it covered like a square mile and some crazy night. Not that, but like football fields of just tarps that were spread out and then rubbed with oil, I guess to make, you know, so that the tarp. So you created a buffalo skin, uh, hide and at night you'd hear the coyotes fighting and snarling over the, sort of the licking the highs and chewing that the shoe, the coyotes away.

Speaker 1:          01:59:33       And then they figured out, they said, why don't we just lace the buffalo before we kill him? Let's laced the buffalo with strict nights. It will scan them and list the meat. Some of the meat with strychnine and those animals need the strychnine and they'll die. And then we can take those papers and send them back east as well. Well, I never heard that. Yeah. What animals were they doing? So, so, so all the boxes would come in, all the coyotes, all the wolves, and then all the birds and so they would take the feathers and send them to Europe for hats and they will take the, the coyote skins and they take the wolf skin and everything else that they're releasing. Buffalo meat was trick. Now there's a great book that did that with wild horses. Well, they did that with Buffalo. There was a great book called of wolves and men, I believe I read a long time ago.

Speaker 1:          02:00:15       And as they, as they laid the railroad down, they were shooting them from trains. But as they, as they did that, that was really what cause the planes of the great plains looked very much like the Kalahari. Apparently like a, you know the African, the African wilderness. That's funny that you brought that up because that's another book the floors is working on. He's working on the American Serengeti Flores gets his fucking information from you as a professor. You're amazing. Yeah. I just did. He taught at a major university. I worked, I worked from Mugu. He talked about. That's the reason why the antelope run so fast, so at the antelope run so fast because they were there being chased by these big cats. Like we used to have a cat. We still have a lion that lived in North America that's bigger than an African lion.

Speaker 1:          02:01:01       Yeah. Oh, that was a short tail. I don't know what kind of tail it had. We had a thing called a short face bear. There was apparently damn most dangerous bear that's ever lived. Giant bigger than to bring that up bigger than a polar bear. Why? Huge formidable Predator that they think was one of the reasons why it took so long for people to migrate into North America. It might have been that the bering strait was the realm of the short face bear. I want no part of it. Never seen those days. Sure. Haven't. You need to see this. And uh, whatever the American lion was, there was also a thing called a terror bird that was this giant, seven foot tall birds, flightless bird with a giant hatchet for a face that would just fuck things up. That's, that is the relative size. That's obviously a replica that's the size of a short face bear.

Speaker 1:          02:01:49       Apparently. It was just an enormous, enormous bear and look at that other fucking thing is that. That's a dangerous day at Don Dawn. Dawn, some other horrible looking monster with teeth. It looks like a deer with wolf teeth. Well, it looks like a hedgehog. Yeah, well, like a buffalo, which I. Andy fucking pig. Yeah. God Damn Man. There were some crazy fucking animals I want. No. Part of that was really interesting is that the massive them went extinct somewhere around the end of the ice age. They just all got. We'll probably for the same reason why the ice age and probably a lot of shit going on. A lot of factors. That's how big it is. Oh my God. That's impressive. Look at the size of that fucking thing. That's just a Kodiak bear. I could easily be a Kodiak that easily kept their 11 feet high or some shit.

Speaker 1:          02:02:36       Yeah. The big ones are. Are you kidding me? Yeah. There's a great video. You want to shit your pants. It a great video from a guard booth in Alaska where these guys are inside, like one of those part ranger guard booths and they're watching this bear walkthrough. That's the size of a bus complete is a fucking tank. It looks like a few like a VW bus and and they're, they're in there and go, oh my God, look at him, look at him, look at him, look at him, and the thing just strolls right past the guard booth and you get a sense because they're inside this building, but the building is only 10 feet from this animal. So you get like a really clear sense of proportion of how big it is and you're like, oh my God, fucking crazy. It's like 11 feet long and it probably weighs, you know, who knows how much, how many, how much do I have?

Speaker 1:          02:03:20       Fifteen hundred pounds. You never, you feel such a good way to feel like food and shoes. You're so demeaning of you. That's why going to zoos makes me always feel a little shitty about myself. I'm the weakest link in the chain. I'm just a ball pink piece of fucking food. I suck compared to your guns and cars and shit that's brain and figured it out, but when you see this thing, got it. No bear giant bear walks. Past Guard booth in Alaska. I'll find it. You want. If you want to be a big cat before you're eaten by a bear because bears just start eating you and you're alive. Big Cat to get the back of your neck and quite. Yeah, they get your face. They don't want to fight. Now they want you to die so they could eat you. Yuck. Bears are so vulnerable. They don't feel the need to kill you first.

Speaker 1:          02:04:08       It's not necessary. They just hold you down. Here it is. Watch this. So these guys around the guard booth and this thing starts. Lumbering. Tourism. Grizzly. It's so big. It's so. What's the name of it? Jamie says, must see huge brown bear walking pass. Brooks Lodge. Ranger station. So as these guys are sitting there in their truck like, look how close it is, what it was on the road doing these. These guys are stand there. Watch out walks right by there. I mean that things tend to fade away. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. They don't even swear and they're so nice up there. I look at that. No, watch this. Look at the lady walking down the road. See down there. What is that? A dude might be a dude. So let's say lady might be a lady, but either way it just decides not to walk over and eat her. Like she's just out there. If it went into a dead sprint, that'd be around. It's catching her. Oh, for sure. You never getting away from that thing and that she didn't even see that bear? No. She would have heard it coming. She would have heard of breathing properly.

Speaker 1:          02:05:14       Yeah. I wonder what it would've done if we'd have checked to see if she had a gun. Oh no, I wouldn't eat in her. I mean what it like just run up to her and eating her. Because the thing they say about grizzlies is it's way less likely that a grizzly bear is going to kill you for food and wine. More likely they're going to kill you because you stumble upon a mother with her cubs and she's protecting her because grizzly bears don't necessarily look at people's food, but black bear apparently are more opportunistic predators and there's way more way more incidents of black bears attacking and killing people for food. Then there is a of grizzly bears. Grizzly bears definitely have done it, but it appears that a black bears do it more for food more for predation. Brunello was telling us about a story about, oh shit. Running up to a dog. It scared that a dog is a that's from American Werewolf in London. Video ended right as a set of people that were filming it. Oh really? Yeah, because they were fucking with says mom Barrett tax. Oh wait, okay. I don't need to say that.

Speaker 1:          02:06:14       It is A. Anyway, bears scary. Not Good. Don't get eaten. But it was telling a story about a friend of his, a. I'm going to fuck the story up, I'm sure. But, uh, I think that just the story was they took this guy out for the first time hunting ever. He got attacked by a 500 pound predatory black bear in his tent while he's sleeping. Bear comes in the tent, mauls him. Somebody wakes up, shoots the bear, hits him in the wrist, breaks his wrist, and then the bear gets out of that tank, runs in another tent and they shoot it 500 pound predatory black bear. So that's a bear. That's how much you weigh. One 71 72, shred it. So I'm somewhere in the range of 200 pounds. So you and I and then a lot more. Another 100 plus pounds, another 125 pounds and it's a fucking bear and you're by yourself and you're sleeping.

Speaker 1:          02:07:06       It's your first time ever hunting and this thing comes through the door. Just all hot fucking funk breath. Never taken a bath in it's life. Just looking to rip you apart while you fast twitch muscle and dense bone. Your friend shoots you in the wrist, your friend shoots at it, and I don't know if it got a pass through and the the the bear's body and then hit him because that sometimes happens, but either way you get shot in the wrist. Bear mauls. You were talking about how the new it used to kill seals and they would use

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       polar bear bone. Now, how do you kill a polar bear? Do you know how, but I know how to killed wolves. You know, they used to kill wolves, whether used to take a blade and put blood on it and it was just keep looking and bleed today, but I believe with polar bears, they would kill them missile. When they were sleeping, it was find out where they were sleeping and they would come in there and stabbed the shit out of them while they were sleeping and then they would take that box. It was extra hard and they would put at the end of their spirit and that's how they would kill seals. Did you ever wonder how inuits who lived in that ice region got water? Because remember what the water is, it's all saltwater, right? Ice Is all salt water. So how do you get water?

Speaker 3:          02:08:18       How the fuck you get water is polar bears Dick. Very good. And, and I, and yes, most of the time you're not very scientific. Oh, do I am okay. But you have to. Apparently they would be able to see what the old guys, the old old ice by the color of it, the older the ice, the, I guess the, the less salt. So you would find really old ice. And that was the ice that you would meltdown as water. Where's the fuck? Yeah. So the, the Arctic explorers who didn't hook up with the inuit always died. They just froze to death. They didn't, they couldn't find food. It sucked. And the ones that immediately made friends with the nun, uh, they, they came back nice and fat. They had plenty of seal meat and they would always have to get rid of all their clothing and where exactly what the intuit would wear, what kind of a fucking crazy person decides to go to the Antarctic.

Speaker 3:          02:09:12       Uh, the British who wanted to find a different way routes from trade, but just think about what kind of a crazy person and you feel like that's what I want to do this. I want to go home and be the first guy to go to Antarctica. Bad asses. I'm just gonna walk across that frozen. It looks like nothing that had the Messiness, that story about, I can't remember the name, wasn't shackleton was another guy who was an explorer and he, he, his men were all starving and dying and he knew he was going to die, but he was a British Aristocrat, you know. And, and when you were in Britain, you had a duty, you've got a duty to, to essentially use your free time to make the world a better place. And so, uh, he famously stiff upper lip, uh, grew up on a life of discipline, never showing every your emotions properly carted away to boarding school at six years old as they always were.

Speaker 3:          02:09:57       Definitely did some buggery, uh, as to do that. Right. That was real common. Still is, uh, the opera class to send their kids to school at seven, the older classmates and like, hey jay stuff, there's a lot of problems. Uh, but uh, he said famously, um, as he knew he was going to die his, his foot, apparently it was gangrene and he looked at his men and he said, I'm going for a walk and they may be some time and he just, wow. He just rather than convenience and with his death, because that would be very unblemish he walked off and frozen stuff. That's a bad ass because, because keeping up and if you read some of the letters as they were dying and starving to death, their letters are incredibly formal and still poised and always taking into account that they had to keep up appearances and that they had to uh, always remind themselves that they were there for a bigger cause and that their personal discomfort was just not something you inconvenience anybody with.

Speaker 4:          02:10:53       That was the highest level of civilization they will capable of expressing before emojis. See now you could send someone a text message and say, I don't think the dis dis shit is going to work out.

Speaker 3:          02:11:07       Yeah, the piece out if you want to sell fam and then you'd have like an Emoji with a peace sign and then like you and then a gun dude, if you want to see the antithesis to the Emoji and the American culture as it is now. Good. Youtube a debate between James Baldwin, the Great African American author and William F Buckley at Cambridge University in 1965. Everybody who's listening please do that. Just set up to do with emojis just because that was debate and language and formality and hieroglyphs and cadres goes. They're all, they're talking about. Uh, the, the, the question was, is it was the American dream at the expense of the American Negro or does it not? And that is the debate. And Ms Dot Buckley was close. Choose that. It is not an Mr Ronald Reagan's visit. It is. And James Bond gets him a rousing speech. Nineteen 65. I brought the cotton to market and I picked the cotton for nothing, for nothing. But I would always be an inevitable and then William Buckley, he gets up and. But the formality, the theatricality and the fucking language, the way English was spoken by the upper classes are the educated back in the day. This is so great. He's 12 years old. No, no. That's not the beginning of that bait flowing dresses for university. He's. Yeah. And fast forward to James Baldwin talking. It's actually quite amazing.

Speaker 4:          02:12:32       We can't really play it anyway. We'll get yanked off of youtube. That's somebody else's content that somebody else owns us. It's really important to watch though, I think. Well, that was my though was that. Do you think that the reason why that formality was so appreciated and accepted and it was so highly regarded, was because that was the highest level of civilization that they had before technology, before technology and before being. There was a limited amount that you can influence the environment back then and you could have more influence yourself. You could more educate yourself. You could, if you wanted to go somewhere, you got to get on a boat. Okay. You got to get on a boat with everybody else. He had to get on a train. If you want to get across the country, you had to get on the train. If you want to write something, you had to use a quill and you had to have a little thing of ink and yet a dip it in there and that's how he wrote period and it was a limited amount that you could do. Like you know, you couldn't just go home and sit and watch television. You couldn't a code, a video game. He says less distraction. There's less distraction and the the, the level of ability that you could where you could express civilization at its highest level. It was basically like code a few machines that people had built, a few combustion machines, the trains, things along those lines and then the rest of it was just like houses and rule.

Speaker 3:          02:13:50       I don't know if that's. I don't know if that's accurate. I think it might also be that I like. I think that's part of it and I think that's a valid kind of a description of maybe part of what was going on, but I think something else is going on with those, with those debates. I think that when you the reason like something like firing line watch, firing line with William F Buckley, popular show, it's molasses. You, you've got to read. You're listening to men speak about long ideas. Actually. One of the things I really appreciate about your show because you're having such smart people on having real discussions, but then how the fuck did you get on here? I have no idea what barn, but I think he got me. He fucking got me again, but. But back then like there was. It feels like political commitment and winning these arguments between right and left as they were known had actual ramifications because the.

Speaker 3:          02:14:44       It feels like politics and whatever happens in an election today means less to people and has less of an effect. At least an immediate effect because back in those days, 65, the wars that were going on with ideology and wars with fascism and communism and capitalism. People were actually dying and having real wars. They were national awards that were set to defend not only resources but those ideologies and entire movement, and I think that there was the sense that if this side wins, then that side of it is going to come over and take us over. There was this real ideology between this and so I think that those debates people took very personally because they probably knew somebody who died defending the world against fascism. They were afraid of the red scare or they were committed communists and they were being persecuted for it because they couldn't get a job in Hollywood. There's a real, a culture war that had actual tangible ramifications that you could see every day. My God, the Vietnam War, Americans were dying every day because there were. There were sent out there to make the world safe for democracy. Right.

Speaker 4:          02:15:54       That was a factor too. I think that was not a factor. I think there certainly was a lot going on there with that, but we were really talking about people even before that era. I think when we were talking about the guy from Antarctica that I'm going out for a walk maybe some times. Yeah, I think there was something with the intellectuals of the day where they were way more uncorrupted by, by the world that we live in today in terms of. You mean like they had a sense of duty and I think there was, it was a very, very important position, right to be the who disseminated the information in 17, 95 made decisions and made decisions and was in charge of like libraries and books and it was teaching universities. I mean you've got to think of like what different British universities were around the 17 hundreds, like quite a few, right?

Speaker 4:          02:16:43       I bet you could name like, like isn't Yale for the seventh when yell was founded in late, late 17 or I think Harvard as well, or at least I think didn't Thomas Jefferson wrote about a Cambridge, Cambridge Oxford didn't. I think Isaac Newton went to Oxford gala. 17, 17, 11. Incredible. Incredible. Wow. So like back then raising and that was the. So you think of let's just go to 17. Oh, one in 17, 11, the intellectuals with the highest expression of civilization because there really wasn't that much technological expression. There really wasn't that much that had been done. There's where there was guns, there was some machines. I don't even know they even have a printing press. I don't believe they did in 17. Oh, one. When was the dependent printing presses, but with added, was it? Yes. Oh, that's right. That's when Martin Luther was. Um, yeah, they had a printing press back then. Yeah. Um, um, what's his name? What's, who invented the printing press? I can't believe I'm forgetting this or certainly didn't have typewriters. So they, they'd have to type face things. So they would probably read off manuscripts in schools. So like when, when they were in schools and they would write, I think they interpreted. Did they have typewriters printing, press. Gutenberg. What year was the typewriter?

Speaker 4:          02:18:01       Probably back then. Here's what's crazy about it all. This is something that I've been talking about on stage is a how recent all that was. It seems, it seems so far away for us, but this is the way I describe it, like people live to be 100, that's 300 years ago. It's three people crazy. It's three people go whoa. Thirteen years there with 17, so they had 13 years of no typewriters and then written by scrawls things with sell written by Inc and I'm sure you know, it took a long time for that diffusion of that innovation when you think the typewriter really like totally kicked in for 18 hundreds. I bet that 19th century, or maybe it was the 18th and the 19th century before it was mass produced with the industrial age when you could make a lot of them for cheap enough to buy would imagine.

Speaker 4:          02:18:49       Isn't it crazy to that? We still use the cordy. Uh, the way the keyboards are assembled, it works is to use the court. He configuration it does work, but it's not the fastest way to do it. And some people are dorks. No, some people are dorks and they learned the other way. What's the other way? Dove racks or something like that. So you find the most efficient typing configuration, there's a second type of configuration that's more efficient and not a friend of mine tried it, he tried to learn it and he said it was, but it took them too long and he would have to like reprogram computers when he got them and enough to buy this certain keyboard. And if you had a laptop you were fucked. This is the. Yeah, D

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       Devora, black man or coal Mac. Okay. So there's two different ones. Qwerty is what we have. But a scroll up again so I could read that. So alternative keyboard layouts explained should you switch to devor, ach or coal muck. So Cole, c o, l e m a k or D v O r a k. So there's two different configurations, like we see that configuration, like it doesn't have quarterly at the top. The very top is like those Arrow keys and the dot and the comma. And then it starts with a p. that's the first letter on the first, uh, the first column. And then the other letter, it's a as in the same place, but as isn't in the same place right next to a is. Oh and S is way the fuck over there with your other pinkie is. It's really confusing. But apparently if you really learn how to type, that's the best configuration because your, your hands can flow more smoothly.

Speaker 1:          02:20:19       And I think the scroll back up there please. So we can see that. I think that configuration was, if I remember correctly, they invented that because the old typewriters used to bind if you smash keys next to each other too quickly. So they decided to spread it out a little bit. I'm old enough to remember that. That's pathetic. I was. Fuck, I'm not kidding. I remember that. That happened in my with my mother's when I was trying to type. I'll be at Calgary this weekend, just weekend. I'll be there this weekend. Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Yuck. Calgary. Come see me. I love Calgary. I'm bringing heat to have big factory farming up there. They don't. Not sure they do, but I love color. I love Calgary. Trying to pay the people of Canada. Don't you love Canadians to do. We were talking about that. Yeah. The nicest people in the world.

Speaker 1:          02:21:06       Yeah, so I always like to go to Calgary. I'm going to. I'm doing Massey Hall on December ninth. Tickets went on presale today. It's with Russell Peters and big Jay Oakerson. Really? The two of you guys and a big chase? Yeah. Wow. And that's December, ninth night before the UFC. That's impressive. Yeah. That's going to be the time. Yeah. What about you? What are you doing that night? I'll be in. Well, I know. I don't know that night to say, what are you doing in December ninth and 10th? I'm going to be. I know where I'm going to be in at the Fort Lauderdale Improv. I was going to ask you to come with us. I would love to, but the Fort Lauderdale Improv is one of my favorite places to perform. Yeah. It's a fun place to. While I'm especially if you like drunks that are trying to escape from New Jersey while we're plugging things, because Brendan Schaub will beat me up if I don't mention that fighter and kid live will be in West Palm Beach November 11th and twelfth and in New York.

Speaker 1:          02:22:02       Gramsci Hall. I think we're almost sold out a November third. Excellent. Some CS. Go see them. Hilarious show. My netflix special comes out this Friday, October 21st. So available for download. A. People have been asking if you can get it in other countries. That's a real good question. I will ask that myself and I'll find out. I'll get back to you. You know, since you told me about dairy and not putting it in your coughing. Uh, I have not had the same throat issues. Issues. What kind of. Well apparently, and I didn't know this, but Brendan told me that I was always going. Yeah, no, definitely. And my wife said the same thing. I was doing that with butter coffee. I switched. If you hear it and you say, Hey, I don't hear you clear your throat as much, you're always going to have to clear your throat when you talk.

Speaker 1:          02:22:48       As much as I do a lot of bullshit coming out of my mouth. I got gotta, but I drink black coffee now. During the podcast I'll still drink coffee with a grass fed butter and mct oil, but I don't drink it before podcast. I don't drink it during a podcast I should say. Some people get bummed out like Steven l he lives with that shit when he comes in, he's gonna come in and a couple of weeks we have to give it to him because he'll be sad. He'll be sad. Well there's nothing like really good coffee with, but I can't do any kind of a cow dairy anymore. I liked. I know you said that you let you like goat milk, goat milk to raw milk and I like butter. Butter. I can kill. I love butter. I'll tell you when my daughter was little, she could not.

Speaker 1:          02:23:27       She, if she drank milk at all, she would throw up when she was really little. I could not drink milk. We try, you know, it's hard to gauge when you have a little kid, see what they like, what they don't like and what a. But goat milk went down like that. Like nothing. It was really interesting. She was, I mean we're talking like she was a really young baby. She loved goat milk and for whatever reason we stopped buying it and now we buy just regular cow's milk. They didn't really enchanting experiment with with goats and kind of proving that when you eat a food that's super delicious, like say you eat a peach and you love peaches, then you meet another peach and you love peaches, but there's somewhere along the line where with foods that are also giving you nutrition, you stopped as a trigger.

Speaker 1:          02:24:07       So whereas when you flavor food that doesn't have any nutritional value, you'll just keep eating it. Like to read us. You keep eating, keep eating and keeping and it tricks your body, but there's something about this guy did this experiment where this professor at the university took these goats and he starved them a phosphorous. You didn't get many phosphorous in their diet and they started doing weird things like drinking their own urine and drinking each other's urine and pawn at the dirt and weird shit because they need phosphorous. So then he would feed them two different samples of food, but the coconut, the coconut flavored, and there was maple flavored food. Uh, and so the coconut flavored food, when he'd feed them the coconut flavored food, uh, then he would put a tube down their throat and fill their stomachs with the phosphorous. And all of a sudden the goats were instinctively going for the coconut flavored food. Now, the, the thing you'd say is, well, wait a minute, maybe they just like coconut flavored food. But then he took the maple flavored food and the coconut flavor food, another control group. And when those goats would eat the maple food, he'd stick the tube down their throat and fill their stomachs with phosphorus. Now the goats didn't know that they were getting. And so that control group would always go for the maple. Whoa. Because they could, even though they didn't know they are getting phosphorous, they just somehow equated the

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       fact that they were going to get the phosphorus from that. So they think that human beings have this strange mechanism in their, in their sort of brain and body where they, once you are eating a food that has nutritional value, so if it's sweet like dates, it's got nutritional value as well or whatever it might be. Somewhere online we get satiated no matter how delicious we find it, if it's a natural foods. True. Because nobody eats like a giant bowl of peaches. Yeah. You might eat two of your crazy right and this, but you'll eat a fucking pie. Fuck yeah. You lead a buyer, you'll lead with ice cream. You might eat that whole pie, especially when it's artificially flavored. That that triggers this weird. And one of the things in this book, Dorito effect is that this guy talks about the fact that that has kind of thrown our, you know, that that's one of the things, one of the culprits of obesity perhaps.

Speaker 3:          02:26:14       For sure. Yeah, for sure. Flavoring, flavoring for sure. One hundred percent that totally makes sense. And then the sugar thing. Yeah. Chickens take chickens because we grow them so fast. So, so usually like after World War Two, the fastest chicken they could grow, they had a contest was to get it to the point where you could eat. It was 14 weeks and now we've got it down to six weeks and yeah. So now you what you're eating his big fat babies. The problem is that the oils aren't the same. They're not as nutritious as an heirloom chicken and chicken. It's grown to eight when it far just like the chickens you have, they like worms and whatever they want. I don't eat my chicken, so. Yeah. But if you ate that chicken to be the oils and the meat would be different and it'd be. And it'd be also more flavorful.

Speaker 3:          02:26:53       Um, but because chicken has no taste, we had to figure out. There's a lot of things you had to do to a chicken to make it take. You've got to Brian it, you've got to flavor it. You've got to do all kinds of shit. And it was way better than children. That wild Turkey that we shot with vanilla. Fuck yeah, that was delicious. I, I cook that whole thing on the grill. I marinated it in my standard marinade, which is newman zone, balsamic vinegarette taste. Just marinate and everything in that. So good. Yeah. The red beat, the darker meat was different. Like the breast plates of like the way a Rinella did. He breaded it and fried it. And I used to do this good. I used to joke about when we did our live podcast, Brent and I about how I called it Rogan's gift when you bought me that bow and arrow.

Speaker 3:          02:27:34       And first I talked about when we hunted Turkey and I was like, kill a Turkey with dressed in the field map and we cut it and it was. I mean I didn't shoot it, but I've secured Joe's hips when he shot the Turkey and I go, we got it. We brought it up and it tastes just like Turkey, you know, and they don't lock. And then I go to this whole fucking thing. Remember when he gave me the bow and Arrow and I was like, I looked at, I was like, I didn't know what to say because I don't know anything about boys, but I think I saw the whole thing and I went, got me a fucking hoyt and you were like carbon fiber. I go, whole thing, hundred percent carbon fiber. Now you like trying to show somebody who really appreciate the gift, but you don't know what to say about it. Fuck, I can shoot one shot, one Arrow because you want to have me over. No, you'd never. You'd never organized it. I'm not going to be the one who does all the work. You were so trusting. The greatest is crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       The fuck that. The grant and Swiss you with that expert Guy Archer and the greatest tax was, are you going to have me come over and I was going to shoot with you guys. You got so into it. I got a text from you and you go, hey brother, this is not going to work today. I got a lot of really important work to do with this guy. You're so obsessed with it. He told me we need it needs to. You need to be looking at one person, like if you're working with one person, you're working on their archery form. Oh, if you're working on two people at the same time, you're not even going to get half the work done with either. That makes sense and he wants to do something with you and Brendan, he wants to do something where he hooks you guys up with hoyt.

Speaker 4:          02:28:57       Both teaches you and you guys could all make a video. It can make a video of you guys shooting bows for the first time when. But he's like, it has to like, he's like, I can't do that and work with you because work with me. I'm many years advanced. Not, not saying that I'm really good because I'm not. I'm so far advanced from you guys. Like he would have to work with you. So specifically on every little thing and there's so many different things you have to think of when it takes a long fucking time. Like give me an example of bone arrow. So give me an example, because I would imagine how you stand, how you breathe, how you pull back. There's a ton of different things. It's how you hold the bow. What technique used to draw back what muscles you're pulling with. You have to be super conscious of pulling with the muscles and your scapula.

Speaker 4:          02:29:37       Like, Whoa, where's your elbow position? How will you torquing the bow? How are you gripping the bose, the bow, crossing the lifeline on your hand. If it is, that's a problem. You've got to readdress it. How you gripping it with your fingers. Do you have a death grip? Do you have a loose grip? Is that affecting the actual trajectory of the Arrow is at torquing when you release it, when you release it, do you punch the triggers? The Arrow flying randomly left and right, and all sorts of different directions. There's so many forever. It takes forever. It takes forever. And I'm not even like one 100 of the way there, but I'm three years ahead of you. Do you think, do you think that the, uh, here fucked? Do you think that when you get really good at something like just take our trays and example, I know there's a book called the archery book, but do you think that when you master something like archery, like do you think that's almost enough to learn about life or do you think that that's a little bit romantic?

Speaker 4:          02:30:34       I think there are elements from anything that you get really good at that apply to life. The idea that learning something, getting really good at it, you learn about life has been disproved over and over again by extreme winters who are gigantic fuck ups in their regular life. I think when you get obsessed with something to the point of excellence to the point where you're the best at it or one of the best added or you're in the running to be one of the best at in your fucking brain does not have much room for a lot of the normal shit that everybody else has stuffed in their head. You're not going to be online on forums, gossiping about celebrity bullshit or you know, talking shit about the latest movie or talking shit about the latest song. You will be obsessed with one task and that does not necessarily make you a balance person.

Speaker 4:          02:31:18       You might not have time for your family. You might have time to talk to your friends. You might not have time to have friends. I mean you might be in recovery training. You might be doing a million different things to try to accentuate your abilities in basketball and primarily a male characteristic. Of course, that's a feature of the male brain and the ability to exclude everything else, but one thing, it's very rare in women, but you see it and it's an aberration. You see it. A lot of women athletes you see in a lot of women's superstar athletes for sure. It's also much rarer. Apparently, I mean worse. Yeah, well that's why when someone like Rhonda Rousey comes along, you go, oh, look at that. There's one of those, you know, there's a female version of the super winter exists, you know, and they seek out male versions of those super winters and you know, they have super winter babies that's a, you know, standard stuff, but it's, it's to me, I don't think it's indicative of learning about life.

Speaker 4:          02:32:10       It's learning how to get really awesome at one thing and that might translate if you can step away from the madness and the momentum of whatever the fuck it is. You're obsessed with that ability to really completely focusing on one thing might aid you if you can completely focus in on life, but the idea that an athlete or an archer or anybody else is doing anything obsessive, Lee is actually focusing on life. That's, that might not be the case. That's a good point. I never thought of that. That's a good way to articulate because even like you see like great artists like Paul Jackson, pollock, whoever they were, they, they weren't that happy. I mean they, they, you know, a lot of that, a lot of examples of like, you know, great authors are great artists or whoever they are, and they, they were so obsessed with their expression that they also live depressive lives now.

Speaker 4:          02:32:53       Whether or not whether or not though depressives tend to obsess might be another question, but that's probably both. Both things are probably true. You know, I was a giant prince fan still am. He was like one of my all time favorite musical artists. So you know, when I found out that prince had all these issues with his health and he's taking pain pills and he was addicted to pain pills, it was almost like in denial about it. I was like, no, that guy's too smart for that. Like that guy is like, he's smarter than the system. We figured out how to make a symbol to get out of a contract because he had to use his name. So he was the artist formerly known as Prince and became a mean. That was what. That was all bad. They will look, you can't use the name Prince.

Speaker 4:          02:33:34       It's like, oh, for real motherfucker. Do you know how famous I am? I'll make a symbol. I'll be, I'll just be assembled locks this and. But then when you hear prints like interviewed, which you rarely do, you see as art, which is amazing. You know, I still to this day, I think the purple rain, you know, like it's one of the greatest songs when the greatest. It was a great movie musical album. Yeah, let's go crazy. I mean he had some fucking jams and in that time he was revolutionary. He's just weird little androgynous guy. And then just like the whole thing was crazy. The dancing is like hair. Oh my God, I should have known. Oh my God. The way, ways that it wouldn't last. And he had that hair all done up at a high stiletto heels. It was amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       My friend, my friend Tommy, I'll never forget my friend Tommy goes, he's so fucking gay. And then he goes in there and he goes, but he's fucking awesome. While he wasn't gay, it wasn't good. He was heterosexual and he wasn't even really like gay people. That's one of the weirdest jobs is witnessed and it was. He kind of said some homophobic shit that people get really mad at him about, about one of the reasons he was trying to equate, okay, stop. He was trying to equate all of these different things that were going on in the world with people not following God's way and sticking their dick in any place they want and people are like, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Did you just say that? Did you just say that? Yeah, let's go crazy. You're the guy. The fucking addresses in purple and talks about being a pervert, but he's very, very conservative and a lot of ways wasn't it?

Speaker 1:          02:35:03       But what were you saying about to say is that he also was into chem trails. He also believed that the government was spraying the sky and that's what was making everybody angry. So when you listened to him talk and you hear him like discuss things, you'll realize, oh, okay, what? What he said about Kennedy. I was funny. He said, you know, what I've noticed is that when a plane would go by and you'd see these trails and everybody started acting crazy and they'd be fighting and I'm all I'm saying is take a look at it, just take a look at it. And I was like, I won't, I won't, I won't take a right here. I love you as a musical genius. I won't take a look at it, but there's also a problem that when he said that he was probably 50 and when he got famous he was probably 20, so 30 years of being completely insulated and isolated people kissing your ass and you saying a bunch of poetic shit while you were alone in Minneapolis and he did right.

Speaker 1:          02:35:55       Myopic enough to never read a newspaper or anything. I mean, no, I don't know. I don't know what he was like. I don't know what he was looking for. That's what he was like, because I know, I know somebody. My friend's brother was in his band. Really? Yes. Your friend's brother taught with prince, my friend Rico. Somehow many different types of aids. Did he get well? Uh, no, he rica simone was just wonderful guy who died of colon cancer and his brother fucking what was his name? His brother toward prints and, and he knew prince and man, that dude was, he did, he really did play every instrument fluently and he had high standards and, and he's just a, like, nobody worked like him. No body but it, it required almost all of them, right? I mean it just, it. He was so devoted to just music and well it's obvious.

Speaker 1:          02:36:42       I mean his, he was, his style was so diverse. You just mixed it up a lot, you know, he would like remember raspberry beret. It comes out of nowhere. I mean he, he was different when he's saying that Tom Jones cover and that high operatic voice, you know, I, I didn't meet him but I stood next to him at a party. Prince, do you? No. Prince, do you know how small he was? How small was it? I'm going to go ahead and say, and I don't care if NASA comes and shows me like his measurements. He under five feet tall. Really? And I'm not kidding, he was straight up under five feet tall. I couldn't. He was in high heels and I couldn't believe how small he was white and he walked by me twice and then he was standing in a group and I was, I was, they're invisible because everybody else was way too famous and I just kept looking at him and I was like, don't stare at a print stuff staring prince neck normally you fucking asshole.

Speaker 1:          02:37:36       He was a, just a little bit above a dwarf. Wow. For Real. He was absolutely tiny. Shockingly. You think you the most pussy ever for a little tiny guy? Probably don't know what his sex life was. I don't know. You know, who knows? Used to bank Carmen Electra, right? I know he wrote a lot of songs for people. I don't know. I was never in the room. I don't know. I shouldn't say bang. I worked with Carmen Electra. I did too. What a doll. She's pretty such a cool, very nice. She's fun. It was friendly and professional and I wonder why she hasn't. She's a good person to probably just chilling. I wish good things. Do you read this year? So I'm a good guy. Here's his job. I was doing a series that I thought was going gonna make me a star yet. Another disappointment. Yet another disappointment with gentleman.

Speaker 1:          02:38:22       I was doing fed actress. Oh yeah, man, I remember when you were high on that. He lost a lot of weight. I got a lot of attention for that. And then, uh, was Christie. Allie was like, inner peak, but I hadn't famous Broadway directors calling me, telling me I was great on the show and they wanted to put me in their plant. I was so excited when they trying to fuck you or they're just trying to get some Dick. No, no, probably not. I wish I'm not that good looking. What happened? That was a showtime show, wasn't it? It was a big deal because of the name. It was like very controversial. Like wow, she's so bold. That name. Yeah. Yeah. Since she was like one of the first people to have like a, a great sense of humor. She's about eating herself into a bizarre shape.

Speaker 1:          02:39:03       She's just, she's smart and a force of nature. She's a scientologist in her house, her house many times, and she had so many animals. She had to blind lemurs. You know, Christie would be the one who was like, you got a blind monkey. I'll take it. She had a rabbit, a giant desert hair that couldn't use the back. Its back legs. Do you not feel the need to temper? She's so smart with. She's a scientologist. Well, having read, going clear as you have a. and having been in class for over 10 years with many scientologists. So I remember the class that was mentioned in that book. I remember when I used to go visit you. Do you remember when you and I went to watch a guy sing songs? Yes, and he was fantastic. He was wonderful and hassles and his shoes, his choice. He said something interesting about it.

Speaker 1:          02:39:50       He'd been scientologist for 20 years and go, he call and he said, I have a scientologist did. Somebody asked me that. He said, let me just let me put this to rest as I'm a member of the church. Tells you what does that mean. I, I've taken a lot of classes there and I've got nothing out of a lot of classes and some classes. I've gotten a lot. If you want to call me a scientologists then go ahead and then we just get to in class. He was a fucking great teacher, but his. I mean he's in a, not A. I think it makes him in Jeffrey Tambor, who's The star of transparent, used to be a scientologist for years and he quit and it's called. He blew. He ran. He got out. Do you get in trouble when you do that? No, but there's David miscavige.

Speaker 1:          02:40:29       The secretive sort of leader has never been painted in a very favorable light. Especially if you read that book. I don't know though. Yeah. It seems like a naughty little group of humans. It does. It does, but I'm. Allie was in that naughty little group of human. Yeah, like any, like any group, like any group, anybody who belongs to any group, you're going to have dogma. You're going to. You're going to need tradition and story to to keep that group together. You can't have a group without having stories written by a guy on a captain's outfit on with metals he gave himself. Yeah, he was, uh, he was probably very crazy and crazy as fuck. Apparently, there's a great new documentary that I've been hearing about called Holy Hell about some guy who got involved in some really nutty cult in 1985 and was in a cult for like 20 years and a documented a bunch of crazy shit and is going to put a documentary out about it.

Speaker 1:          02:41:25       Wow. Yeah. And the cult leader is apparently he hit his past as a gay porn star and he was there. He is at, as we have the ABS on that guy, but people are always going to be long to call. People. Always going to want to group up with their version of the truth. A documentary villain for the ages and unprecedented closeup look. We watch with bated breath as the mask slowly, slowly pulled away, pulled off. Um, what I always thought baited was B, a t be a t, e d, what does it even mean? Baden Bat ed. Bated breath. Like, oh, I thought I thought that it was ba because bated breath, I never knew what it meant, and the in great suspense very anxiously or excitedly, he waited for a reply to his offered with bated breath. I never knew what the, I knew what it implied, you know, that you waited and it was highly anticipating it, but I never knew led.

Speaker 1:          02:42:19       It was spelled that way or what it was supposed to get out of weird words that you'll hear sometimes time ago. Not a long, like, um, I heard somebody use the word solipsistic and I was like, yes, of course. Yeah. I've said I've got to go back to a definition on that one and I never did. It just means. Has anything else ever baited? Is it only bated breath? I've only heard it used in context of bated breath, but it's not a weird, that's a very bizarre word. If it's only used with breath, that's it. You know, some people are so good with words. Like I was listening to a, I was reading the lyrics of Bob Dylan's a after we won a Nobel prize for literature. Solipsistic solipsistic means means essentially that you can only be sure that you exist and you're not even sure anybody else use theory that the self is all that can be known to exist.

Speaker 1:          02:43:09       Hmm. That's a weird word. It's a very limited view of the world killed Bob. Dylan won't respond to them. The people trying to give him his prize. It's like Bob Dylan, fuck off. If you look at the lyrics of chimes of freedom and and look at what he was writing when he was in his twenties to take a look at an Indian. He had an interview I listened to and they were talking about these lyrics and he said, and that's something he said, what do you mean? He said, I had no idea how I wrote that and I could never do it again. That magic is gone. And he says, people look me up and they'll come out and asked me about organic farming and he goes, what do you know about organic farming? He was absolutely nothing. They just put all this stuff on him because he was a great lyricist and a great thinker.

Speaker 1:          02:43:49       Obviously he wrote all along the watchtower. Hell yeah, he wrote, he was such a fucking influence of springsteen was just doing a BBC interview and he said it was the first time I'd ever heard anybody describe America the way it really was looking at as far between sundowns finished and midnights broken tool. We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing as majestic. Bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing. Yeah. He was, uh, an interesting voice of a generation. Listen to this part, flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight flashing for the refugees on an unarmed road of flight and for each and every underdog soldier in the night as we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. He's a young guy reading it because I read a book. What's that? It's probably high as fuck.

Speaker 1:          02:44:37       And he ruined all those. I don't think he was. How dare you? You don't think he was doing drugs? Bob Dylan? Um, itch please. I, I, uh, I think mom was doing drugs. I don't, I don't know. I don't know enough about of Shit for sure. That was. He was smoking weed and Lsd for sure. I would imagine. Well, La, who's that rock historian who said that the rock and roll is the greatest. When they were doing, they were doing psychedelics and they were smoking weed and cocaine and heroin came in. It was when the music pat. That's when Lou Reed and that's when all those guys, the Mamas and Papas and all those guys, you know, after Haight Ashbury, I think 1968 that that when when heroin and marijuana and cocaine came in, the music basically died. A lot of time was smoked. Says according to Eric von Schmidt, the early sixties contemporary of Dylan's in the Cambridge folk scene.

Speaker 1:          02:45:27       Cambridge folk scene. Good Lord. Smells like feet. Where he dylan in a singing pow. Richard Farina usually got together a lot of pot with smoke, so yeah, it was probably just doing a lot of pot, but if they were doing a lot of pot, I guarantee you they did some acid to get ahold of some mushrooms. Psychedelics and we'd probably are not going to be your enemies as an artist, but I would imagine heroin and cocaine don't usually they. When do you think it's going to come a day when we require that of politicians? We require psychedelic experiences. Like we require education. When Bob Dylan turned the Beatles on to marijuana while you got them. Hi, this is outrageous. Um, when do you think it's going to be a requirement for politicians? Like, I think every politician should have a mushroom

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       trip. I don't think that's a lot to ask. I think you should. You should have to have survived us threshold braking experience, a real breakthrough experience. I would start with politicians having to go to another country for awhile and just seeing how people keep them here at dose him up. Fuck all that. Travel. Travel's dangerous doses. Just doses. Just, just fucking put them in a room for a bunch of people are gonna. Watch the doors. Keep them in place. Turn the lights off. Keep keep them silent and just dose the shit out of them. I just think we, we all know everybody that's had one that knows that there's giant benefits to them, but it's poo pooed in society as being like a drug that's detrimental to your health. It's detrimental to your, your, your function as a kid or you don't know where that droves coming from.

Speaker 4:          02:46:58       So that's why change it. It was legal, used to be right and sure until Nixon that fuck. Nixon fucked up a lot of things. People don't realize like when people were doing an ass in the fifties and sixties, it wasn't even illegal. You know, there's a lot of stuff. Marijuana was illegal, but mushrooms weren't illegal until 1970. It's amazing. Yeah, it's crazy. But there's still stuff that's not technically illegal. That's way more powerful than that five methoxy DMT. You used to be able to buy it. Not for human consumption from chemical companies online. He used to be able to buy like a fucking coffee tumbler full of it. Yeah. I'm not joking. You could smoke and meanwhile and effective dose. It's five Meo DMT is in more potent psychedelic ounce per ounce gram per gram than nn dmt. It's the most potent, it doesn't have the visuals, so it doesn't give you the visuals, but as far as like, um, effective dose, it's the most potent, so a small amount can get you fucked up and used to be able to buy that stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:47:58       Well, pot was illegal. You used to be able to buy five Meo dmt online and if you smoke did, you just got shot through a cannon to the center of the universe. We cease to exist, the terrifying trip because you absolutely thought you were dead, like you absolutely ceased to exist and you became one with everything and it's, it's a very weird non visual experience. Whereas DMT is filled with all these patterns and this beautiful feeling that you get the five Meo dmt is like this powerful white geometry. It's all just pale white and all these weird sort of microscopic fractal geometric patterns that are sort of dancing around you. But one thing is invisible. Like what do you, what do you like about psychedelics? What do you think, um, is typically the benefit of the second? I think there's a lot of benefits to any experience and extreme experiences give you more benefits.

Speaker 4:          02:48:51       You take in more data knowing that that psychedelic experience is possible. Just knowing that that experience that you can hit, you can hit that note that you can get into that, that dimension, wherever the fuck it is in a psychedelic experience, it makes you look at the that is unchanging around you without drugs and it makes you go, oh well this isn't all there is. Like there's another thing that you can get to really easily. You can get to this other thing really easily and although it's not regular everyday drive through starbucks, stuck in traffic, waiting for your phone call, so the alarm goes off in the morning. You don't want to get up. It's not that world, but it's still an accessible world that's right there. That's mindblowing. Well, I think what you said Eagle dissolvent, but even prior to that is the idea that it shows you what is possible or what is out there.

Speaker 4:          02:49:41       That's, that's to me the most important element for change in a person's consciousness. When you are shown that there is a higher bar or you're shown that there is, there are other possibilities, more illuminating possibilities because a lot of times you can live in a, in a world where your vision of reality that's given to you and that's that you're privy to on a daily basis is so limited that you don't even. You need to be shown that there is something higher to aspire to. Yeah, for sure. You know what I'm saying? And so I think that's kind of the value. Maybe that's one of the biggest values to quote unquote education or the biggest value to exposing yourself to experiences like you're talking about. I think both of them are valid and both of them are important. I think you should have like difficult tests.

Speaker 4:          02:50:31       I think it's probably good for people to try to run a marathon. I think that's good for people to try to rock climb. I think it's good for people to go on long difficult hikes. I think you learn from that just like you learn from education and I don't think it's. I don't think they're mutually exclusive and I think they combined together for a balanced person, a person who tries to do and tries to accomplish difficult things along with becoming educated. The problem is that this whole competitive thing that arises amongst people where you want to be the best at something like we were talking about, which sort of defines you in this way, that requires a lot of tunnel vision and it requires you to not be fully balanced and not be. You know, one of the things I had a problem with when I was teaching, when I teach martial arts, I, I noticed that smart people were way more nervous before fights and I was like, oh, I see what's going on.

Speaker 4:          02:51:23       They are aware of the variables like whereas these dumb people that you would teach or the people that weren't as smart awareness, curious, they didn't have nearly as much of a problem with competing. I'm like, this is really fascinating. Like this really smart people are aware of almost too much. Yeah. Well, David Foster Wallace in this incredible essay called how Tracy Austin broke my heart. It was. It's really story about Tracy Austin when she won Wimbledon at 14. Oh, and and he said then she wrote a book like on her experience and trying to get a physical genius to describe what they do. Part of the reason that they performed so well under pressure. Sometimes it's not because they're dumb, but their brain, they don't have the kind of mine that a writer would have,

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       which is to ask a thousand questions to be introspective to the point where you're essentially neurotic or going around in a circle. You can't have that. You've got to be able to shut that down. That's why when they ask great athletes to describe what was going on in their mind, when they got that ball over the end zone, it's invariably kind of disappointing because they never really know how to explain it. What they say is, I just knew I had to get the football cross line and we just executed and my team was there. It's not hard. I just did this thing recently about climbing this area of Yosemite that's incredibly different. Difficult to pass. What is, what is it? It's. It's just. It was just released. I think the video is called heaven something heaven. Alex honnold heaven. I bet it's very. He's talking about as he's moving and he's doing these years.

Speaker 1:          02:52:52       I'm not thinking about anything. I'm just executing and he goes, I'm just executing the movements and he's literally upside down climbing this thing thousands of feet up in the air. It's. It's horrific. When you watch them do that and you're like, well, I dunno. I mean I guess he knows what he's doing and he's done it before, but when you watch him do it, he free Solos. Heaven that's experiential is hard to put into words, right? I mean he's, he's, he's the ultimate experiential guru. A guy who you. But look what he's doing. Oh my God is not using. Oh No. He doesn't use any ropes. You look at. No, it's heaven. This is what it's called. But if you, if you see how he's climbing this thing, this, this one area. I don't know what mountain is that? These are. Maybe it is El Capitan. Is that?

Speaker 1:          02:53:37       I think that's El Capitan. I think that's all cat. But anyway, what he's doing is he's climbing up. If it's not straight, it's leaned back. So he's hanging as he's climbing and he's climbing thousands of feet above the ground, like look at the trees below him there. Look at that fucking picture. When they find guys that fall off El Cap, they can't really find much of their body apparently. Find out if that's the name of this thing, how many pull ups can he do? Did you ask him to do that? I want to know. I don't know. Maybe you told me. I'm so nervous. He didn't say what the mountain is. It's. I think it's Yosemite. Just carry a small shoot on the back of his body. Please just go. Yeah. Well He. No, no, no shoots. There's no shoots. There's no getting out here. Apparently it's, he knows what he's doing and he can do it.

Speaker 1:          02:54:30       Who's done it before? But there's a lot of free solo climber dudes that see the stuff that he does and even old school climbers, they go. It's not a matter of if, it's when it's a matter of when there was this whole, um, television show they did about it, where there's these old school climber guys were kind of upset with them. You know, they're thinking that what he's doing is taking far too many risks, but he doesn't think so. He thinks he knows what he's doing and he knows how to do it well. I would imagine. I would imagine the route is called Heaven at glacier point. Glacier point is the mountain. I would imagine the feeling, but by the way, good job Brian Gallon. I watched I, one piece of stone. I'm like, it looks like Al Capp. I've fucking, I've climbed 10 times. We're both wrong about 100 things in a podcast all the time, but harmful jamie here with the google.

Speaker 1:          02:55:11       I'm sure my uranium one will get a, you know, I'm sure they had some picture. Oh, come on. Oh my God. Look at that picture. That's insane. On what? What is that? Is that a 45 degree angle? I don't know, Dude. That's horrifying. Is that Jamie? You would know is that it's close to a 45 degree and not get tired. How does have you ever rock climbed? No. Is the most exhausting thing. You your fingers and hands. I mean you get so pumped so quickly that you, you, you just, you literally can't use your hands and I'm talking to you as very fat fingers. Like it's really interesting cause he's a very thin guy. He did the podcast. I know when I was talking to him, his asked him to show me his hands because you have fat fingers. Yeah. He's a friend of mine.

Speaker 1:          02:55:52       Got Damn. It just doesn't have. I mean they're not small hands. What's the way do you think? Very light. Yeah. It was probably 1:50 tall. If I had to guess, probably like a five, 11, six feet. How tall is he fucking done, dude? No, I just want to know what his body type. I think he's a real light and long and thin and strong for that kind of stuff because all the time and he just knows how to climb and he knows what he's doing and he stays super calm while he does it. That's one of the things that he emphasized. This is him at the very top. See, look how every movement is like really measured. Dude. He's the master. He's a master at that kind of stuff and he lives in a van. He, he lives in his van and he drives around and just finds places.

Speaker 1:          02:56:32       Parks and climbs. He's incredible. He's, he really is. It's interesting. He's like Samurai or something freak, that's for sure. But I mean, he's made this name by being this guy who does the dangerous scary climbing stuff that nobody wants to do. When I read that book, the Book of five rings by me and month Masashi like I got the same sense that, that was the experiential, like his life, the margin for error in a, in a sword fight. Uh, and also he said how you practice has to be almost life and death like until you're no longer doing it, like the, the, the extreme notion of living always on the edge. Um, and that, that feels like the exact same path, mindset and probably probably result. I don't know if you've got a lot of ways, God forbid he dies, but the appearance seems, see sort of when that becomes a necessity or that becomes, I guess how you or what you crave, this sort of intimate relationship between life and death.

Speaker 1:          02:57:37       This sort of like, you know, I think it would, he craves, is doing it like getting some slow. The flow you get into it knowing that there's a massive risk behind it, but still being able to execute flawlessly. That's what he craves, you know? And instead of it being a sword coming out of him that he has to check instead of that, it's him figuring out how to climb a 45 degree face that's hanging 2000 feet above the ground or whatever the fuck that is. How many feet do you think that is above the ground? When you look down and see those trees in the background, it looks like more than 2000 feet. Yeah, it does. How many feet do you think you can climb in a day? You know, because a mile is what? Five thousand feet? 500 something feet. Now a mile is 1000, 300, 434,000, 280 yards. Dairies, losses. It's $3,000 along with yards to fuck 3000 foot vertical wall.

Speaker 1:          02:58:27       So almost a month. I got like three quarters of a mile up. Three hundred feet above the crown in that over overhang with me and 40 feet. You're climbing out 40 feet. Come on, my God. Oh my God. Let's wrap with that. Let's end with Alex honnold. You're a bad motherfucker. Motherfucker. He lit up when Brian was going to introduce them to porn stars though. He was like, what? You know them really no points. Yeah. Yeah. You ain't. You Ain't get no pussy up there on the mountain. Even a zen monk can fall for those. You know those cars. That's why they stay abstinent. Massive distraction from your climbing. Oh yeah. Brian Collin, the fighter and the kid.com.
