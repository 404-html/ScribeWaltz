Speaker 1:          00:00:01       That's very cool.

Speaker 2:          00:00:03       Three, two, one. Yeah. A guy named was his online twitter or instagram handles tgt studios and he makes these. I actually had one made for Elon. Elon Musk loved it too, so we made him one when he made one with like this very beautiful redwood and those are one of those things. May Not have jamie the some diodes or something. Nixey tubes. Tubes. The old. Yeah. Yeah. He has to get them from Russia. That's a. He has them delivered over from Russia. So they might have like listening devices implanted in the most. Well, so Brian, good to see you, man. Great to be back. Yeah. Great to have you back. So tell me about this tour that you're doing. It's a, it's a world. Try to keep this soccer like a fist. There you go. How's that? That perfect. Yeah. So we'll tour starts next week

Speaker 3:          00:00:55       and I'm the UK and then we go everywhere from the South Island in New Zealand all the way to the Arctic circle to Svalbard, which is North, the furthest north that you can go on a commercial aircraft in the middle of where in the states for a month in a mainly may and uh, yeah, it's, it's about cosmology and about the questions that cosmology raises. So Abo, interested in the science of how did the universe begin, even questions of what may have been there is a universal eternal. Is there such a thing as before the big bang. What is the future of the universe? How does complexity emerge spontaneously in a universe. And then we sort of take it for granted that we, there's a big bang and it's all heart and there's just this kind of hot glow of stuff. And I altered that spontaneously in 13 point 8 billion years. You get something like the earth with the civilization and life on it. So how does that, do we know anything about that? I mean, we do. I'm asking the question rhetorically. We know quite a lot about it, so it's, it's really about showing the size and scale of the universe, but addressing those questions I think everybody has about what is it, what does it mean to be human? This tiny little finite life that we lead in a possibly infinite universe. How do you make sense of that?

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       Well, it's incredibly exciting to me that there's a giant audience for this and that what Neil degrasse Tyson had been doing and what a lot of public touring intellectuals are doing now, they're doing these giant theaters and these people are coming out to see these shows and we're realizing that there's. I mean, I hate to use the term market for this, but there's a demand for this and there's a lot of people who are incredibly fascinated by this and it's spreading information and spreading knowledge. Yeah. I mean in the UK particularly, I've been to Wembley arena. For example, you know, you're talking about 10,000 people, 12,000 people in the shows and you're right, they are coming. I'll the big shows, spectacular screens and all that. They're coming full to think that they come into here about what we know

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       about the universe and nature and I think, you know, I think I'm not surprised people are interested because these are questions that everybody asks. You don't to just why am I here? You know, everybody's sat there asking that question, but I, my point is that there is a framework, there's a framework of knowledge, there are things we know about the universe, so it is true that science scientists are not going to tell you why you're here and you're not to say what the meaning of life is, but there is actually a, there are things you need to know if you want to start to explore those questions for yourself. You need to know that there are 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. You need to know the Milky Way Galaxy has got 200 billion stars. Most of those stars now we know have planetary systems. We estimate there are something like 20 billion earth like planets or potentially earth like planets in the Milky Way galaxy alone.

Speaker 3:          00:03:51       So if you're asking questions about what is my place in the universe, you need to know those things. First of all, it's a framework within which you can think when you get to those numbers, when you're talking about trillions and billions and all those zeros, my brain just goes numb. I, there's this lack of comprehension that I'm well aware of. Like those numbers get thrown about. I go, oh, $200 million now. And I think everybody does. I think every scientist that no scientist can picture that number. I mean he even the small number $200 billion, the number of stars in one galaxy. And then when you say 2 trillion galaxies, you know that that's. I challenge anyone to be able to picture that. But it is the reality that we've observed. We've, you know, we, I mean we haven't counted all 2 trillion by the way we have.

Speaker 3:          00:04:43       We have a thing called the Sloan digital sky survey, which maps the positions of galaxies. So you can, you know, how much should the sky you surveyed and you know how many galaxies you've counted and then you can spread that across the wider universe and you get this picture of a vast and possibly infinite universe meet. We, we know that the universe or very strongly suspect that the university is much bigger than the piece we can see. So we have good reason to think that's the case. Whether it's infinite or not is another question. And then that goes to your, you know that. Can you picture infinity while no one can picture infinity? This is a weird thing as well about, you know, we, we say the universe began 13 point 8 billion years ago. So that's a measurement. So because we can measure the speed that all the galaxies are flying away from us essentially.

Speaker 3:          00:05:30       And then you can run time backwards if you like. So to find out when they were all on top of each other. And so it's quite a simple measurement and we've done that. So we say the universe began 13 point 8 billion years ago, but actually all we know really was the universe was very hot and very dense at that time and we have some theories that the universe was in existence before that and perhaps some sort of circumstantial evidence and that means that actually the universe could, could have always been their eternal. And um, when, when I tell it to people sometimes they get a bit, some people got upset about that. Some people would rather it had a beginning. The idea that it might have been around forever is more frightening somehow. Then the fact that it began. It's, it's interesting the way people's minds work. What terrifies you the most and eternal universe or a finite universe?

Speaker 4:          00:06:18       Yeah. Other, both incomprehensible. The eternal universe. W, W, W, if there was an eternal universe, is that negate the theory of the big bang or does it mean that there's a constant cycle of big bangs and then expansion and then recompression or

Speaker 3:          00:06:36       could do say those theories that are back in vogue. Some of those theories are back in vogue again. So yes, some of them say that there's a cycling universe, um, so the big bang is an event when space gets very hot and very dense and filled with particles. And that may happen again, are some of the other theories. Uh, there's a theory called eternal inflation, which is a theory that, and it's actually the most popular theory, I think at the moment, but what happened, but why the big bang is the way that it is who's got some very special features, the Big Bang, which we could talk about, but inflation is the idea that space space time was around before the big bang and it was expanding extremely fast and there was doubling in size in the most popular of these theories. Every 10 to the minus 37 seconds, which is point naught, naught, naught, naught, naught, naught with 37 knots, one of a second.

Speaker 3:          00:07:26       So he's an imaginably fast expansion. And then the idea is that draws to a close, so quite naturally sort of dies away and the expansion slows down and all the energy that was taken there was causing that expansions sort of gets dumped into space. And heats it up and makes particles and that's what we call the big bank and those theories that slight extension to those and say that that that slowing down just happens in little patches. So most of the universe, the overwhelming majority of the university still inflating that insane sort of speed and they're just little patches stop and they are big banks. So you get multiple universities, a multiverse, it's called the inflationary multiverse and we are in one of those bubbles and that's one of the more popular theories. Dad's another one. I mean that right now,

Speaker 4:          00:08:17       aware of what you're saying. I, I can, I can sort of visualize it in some sort of a graphic form, but it's incomprehensible like my mind doesn't. It doesn't have the capacity to expand the, the sense of distance and size to that, that grass is this because of just the way we evolved. We evolved here on earth to deal with the space. It's in front of us and now over the course of an industrial civilization and education, we are now grasping these concepts that are so alien to the reality, the tangible reality that we exist in every day. I'm sure that's

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       right. And the, the, you know, even very simple things like you go back to the Greeks. So Aristotle and the great, you know, very clever people, but they thought the earth was the center of the universe. Why? Because it feels like it's at the central is it feels like we're not moving. Um, and that's quite a deep point actually in physics. It's like why is it that we're flying around relative to the sun very fast at whatever speed is 18 miles a second or something like that. And the whole solar system is going around the Milky Way Galaxy and so on. Why is it that we don't feel it? And then the Greeks quite naturally said, well, because we're at the center of the universe, they also said everything falls to the earth. So therefore the earth has to be at the center is natural. And, and actually it's quite a deep a thought, so to understand why it doesn't feel that we're moving, you have to go all the way to Einstein really for someone to take that very seriously.

Speaker 3:          00:09:50       And he why he said actually he said, well, this, um, there's a great little explanation in Stephen Hawking's brief history of time about this, that the idea that you can't tell whether you're moving or not demolishes the notion of absolute space. So if we think about space space to you or most people, I suppose you'd think it the way that Newton didn't have a big box within which things happen. And that's got to be, that's a natural picture of space and the universe isn't, it isn't a thing in which all the planets and galaxies are placed. But, um, in, in the brief history of time harking says, well, imagine bouncing a ball. So he bends a bowl at the table, now a tennis ball. So I drop it and I catch it again. Um, so let's say I drop it and it takes a second to bands up.

Speaker 3:          00:10:31       So in that second, the earth has moved about 80 miles or so in space around the sun. So you could ask the question, did that ball returned to the same place in space or not? And the answer is you can't answer it you. It does from our perspective. But from the perspective of someone watching the earth go all the way around, the sudden it went up, I caught it again. It had moved 18 miles and then from some other perspective it would have been something else. So the point is you can't say this is a point in space, it came back to the same place because that just depends on your perspective. Depends on whether he watching the sudden the earth around the sun or whatever it is. So. So Einstein said that means there's no such thing as absolute space, which is kind of follows if you think about it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:17       But that's a difficult. It's, it's cool. Put difficult thought process, right? I mean that's, that's essentially what's happening when you're on a plane. I mean, if you're throwing a ball up in the air and catching it on the planes, having another much smaller scale, right? Yeah. I mean you're flying at whatever, 600 miles an hour relative to grand, but when you're sitting there, yeah, and Einstein elevated that to a principal and said, if you're moving it but it'd be not accelerated and you just moving at a constant speed in a plane or now. I mean that's essentially what we're doing. Now. We're moving around the sun that effectively constant speed. Then you can't tell, so there's no experiment you can do. We could look at the decay of radioactive nuclear, saw some electricity and magnetism or Banzel have a pendulum, whatever it is, and there's no experiment you can do to tell you whether you're moving or not.

Speaker 3:          00:12:04       Therefore, that concept has no meaning because you can't measure it and that that's led Einstein to relativity so that that's the basis of general relativity, which is our best theory of the universe, don't. Why is it that we think that the known universe is larger than what we can observe? Well, one point is that it's an expanding and we always see the same radiation out there, so the glow of the big bang, but there is some deeper reasons. Um, the one from the theory of inflation, the, the, the, the best way to explain the universe, the properties that we see is that it's very much bigger than the piece we can see. So for example, we measure space to be what's called flat. I don't even have to say what's called flattery is flat. So if you imagine slices of space, let's imagine slicer to them at different times.

Speaker 3:          00:13:08       So, so you just sliced the universe and say there's a big sheets like this, like a tesla sheet of space and there's another sheet and another sheet. And it can, it can have a geometry, right? It can be flat, like a table top or it could be curved like a sphere or it could be curved in the opposite direction, sort of like a saddle or a bowl. And we can measure that. And when we measure it, we see it, it's absolutely flat and that's a very unusual thing for it to be like, um, it requires because what Einstein's theory says is that the shape of space that the curvature of space and determined by the stuff that's in it, that's, that's basically Einstein's theory of general relativity put stuff into space and it curves it and bends it in warp and stretches it and so on.

Speaker 3:          00:13:51       And what we find is that with this precisely the right amount of stuff in the universe to have a completely flat universe. And the, the, the explanation, the most favored explanation for that is university is way bigger than the piece we can see. And so it's like looking at a piece of the earth. Are you looking at little one Mile Square of the earth? Right? Then it's, it is flat, right? You have to look at big distances. It's kind of avoided the radius of the earth or you know, bigger, bigger than one kilometer anyway, on one mile to see the. Actually you're on a curved surface. And that's one of the ideas about the universe. And white appears to be the way that it is because it's way, way bigger. So we were just looking at a little piece and that's why it looks flat. And that's one of the ideas.

Speaker 3:          00:14:37       Now when you say flat like that, my brain doesn't understand this because from our perspective, when you look up at the Milky Way, you see all these stars all over the place. So if you're saying flat like a what, how much height and what, what are you saying? So terms of like the way to measure it, the best way to think about it is not to think of three dimensions of space because then we can't picture it. But you can think of to like this table top. And that's all right. We just forget the other one for now. And so you know what flat is on this table? I mean you could define it. So you could say for example, that if I draw a triangle on the top of the table, then all the angles add up to 180 degrees. So that actually defines flat. If you did that on the surface of the earth with the big triangle, then the angles wouldn't adopt 280 degrees and all.

Speaker 3:          00:15:25       You could draw a circle and say what's Pi? So Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. That's only true on a flat surface is different if the surface is curved. So you can define flatness, so when you. But when you're saying flatness, how, what is the height and what is the width? Like if you're talking about it as if it's a table, there must be some sort of A. There's a dimension to it, correct? Oh yeah. There's a third dimension of space, but the same applies. It's just a generalization of geometry. Then say you can pick fights. We can picture it in two dimensions, but you can. You can draw. You can quite literally, you could imagine sending light beams out and we do this measurement. Actually we can look at the disc. The most distant light we can see, which is something called the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is if you imagine looking out, if you look at the Andromeda Galaxy, which we can see with the naked eye here in la, you can see that, so the most distant object you can see with the naked eye and it's about two, 2 million light years away or so, which means the light took 2 million years to get to us.

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       So it's a long way away, but it's very big. So it as you look further out into the universe to more and more distant galaxies, you're looking further back in time because you look at something that's a billion light years away. Then the light took a billion years to get to us. So you see it as it was a billion years in the past and we can actually look so far out that we can see almost back to 13 point 8 billion years ago, which is very close to the big bank. So we can look to light. That began its journey before they were galaxies and that's the the oldest light in the universe. Which is, by the way, one of the, one of the pieces of evidence from people say, I don't believe in the big bank. The answer is, well, you can see it. Sorry, I just dare, you can see it.

Speaker 3:          00:17:14       We have pictures of it and that light, it turns out that there are such structures are ripples in that light, um, which we can use as a ruler. So quite literally as a ruler on the sky. And then because that light has been traveling through the universe, we can see how that rule has been distorted as, as the lightest traveled through space. And so we can infer where the space is flat or curved or how it's warped, if you like. Just from that measurement is the beautiful measurement. Is it possible that in the future we'll be able to see past 13 point 8 billion years? Not with light, not because. Well, the picture is that before it's actually released 300, 80,000 years after the big bang. It's a very precise number. You might say. How do you know that? Well, before that time, the universe was so hot, the atoms couldn't form, so you had a soup of electrically charged particles if just too hot for electrons to go into orbit around Nuclei, so the universe was opaque to light, so you just couldn't.

Speaker 3:          00:18:15       It was like one, almost like a big glowing star if you like, and then when it was expanding, it cooled past the point where the atoms could form and at that point it becomes transparent really almost instantly and it cosmic time scale and so the light could then travel in straight lines through the universe and we can see that light so we see the light from that time, but further back than that, it's opaque. So you can't see past that with light, but you can potentially with gravitational waves, which is this measurement that got the Nobel prize a couple of years ago. The ligo experiment here in the United States and that seat looks for ripples in the fabric of space and time. And in principle, if we had a big enough detector, you could see the ripples from the big bang. So you could. If you could take an image of the big bang in gravitational waves, which will be, but you need an enormous space based detector that we're not gonna build anytime soon.

Speaker 3:          00:19:12       No, obviously this is all through equipment and technology that's been invented over the last few hundred years and perfected. Is it possible that things could get better and you could get some some ability to detect things even in a far more distant way? Yeah. I mean the gravitational waves are incredible. I mean Einstein predicted them in 1915. Never thought they'd be detected because you need such a high unit. Lasers for didn't have lasers, but they think Lygo this experiment, which is half in a near Seattle in Washington state and half in Louisiana, so they've got two detectors and they're basically sort of a a no three mile long laser beams and that just sit and measure this of stretching and squashing of space as the ripples in the fabric of the universe to go through and what they've been observing. Collisions of black holes, so you can imagine how extreme a colliding black holes.

Speaker 3:          00:20:09       He said incredibly extreme event, so it shakes the fabric of the universe and the referrals come across the universe and these laser beams, we should just basically, rulers can detect it. They just sort of ring, just vibrate as the referrals go through in space and time. That kip Thorne, he got the Nobel prize last year for. This is one of the greatest living physicists I was signed. Describe it as a storm in time, so you've got this time to storm. It's a beautiful image. So that technology is incredible because the change in length is that kind of been the exact number, but it's way, way, way less than the diameter of an atomic nucleus. So the change in length of the beams. It's tiny measurement, but we can do it. So this collision of black holes, the idea that you can detect that? Yeah, that. Yeah, they did. I said the paper, the first paper they published that two black holes and they were about 30 times the mass of the sun each and they're all beside each other and spiraling in towards each other and they accelerated.

Speaker 3:          00:21:17       At one point. They were approaching each other at one third, the speed of light and the accelerated to two thirds, the speed of light in a 10th of a second and now hit each other and the explosion, the energy release was, I think I'm right, it was something like 50 times the energy release that the power of all the stars in the observable universe glowing and it was something like 50 times and that of energy for a tiny fraction of a second, but it's, it's an unimaginably violent event and that's why our detectors can see the ripples that that makes in space and time. And we detected kind of it's two or three of them now and also two neutron stars colliding. We saw that as well with it. So it's an incredible machine, which is why he got the Nobel prize. Now there's a supermassive black hole.

Speaker 3:          00:22:08       The center of every galaxy. Yeah. There is also other black holes that aren't necessarily in the center of galaxies. So these little ones were little, a few times the mass of the sun and they're from collapsed hours. So they are stars at the end of their life. Very bigness and more massive than the sun, but they run out of their fuel and they start to collapse because gravity squashes them and if they're sufficiently massive, then there's nothing that can stop the collapse and so they collapse as far as we know to a point, right? Essentially an infinitely dense point. We don't really know what happens that we don't know what happened right in the middle, but they collapsed to such an extent that there's a region around it where from which light contest game and that's a so nothing can escape and that that's a black hole. And what happens to them?

Speaker 3:          00:23:02       Do they travel? They moving through space? Yeah, they'll still stars. So they're still there. They're surrounded this region, wherever you fall in, it's called the event horizon and if you go across that horizon, then you are going to the center. There's one way of thinking about it, which is quite cool. Which is that at the time and space sort of flip is one way to think about it. So in the same way that we are going into the future now, so. So we're going to tomorrow. There's nothing we can do about it. We are going to tomorrow. I'm in the same way. If you fall in cross the event horizon of a black hole, you are going to the middle, the singularity, it's called, so that's, that's your future. Every. Every line of your future points to the center of the black hole. So it's kind of the ultimate of no escape for the ultimate prison.

Speaker 3:          00:23:54       You're going to get squashed to an infinitely dense. So point not every star becomes a black hole at the end of its life now because if, if I'm sensing light the sun and we have a small stock, it's quite small. Yeah, and when it collapses, there's A. There's a sort of a pressure force if you like, which is caused by the fact the electrons don't like to be very close to each other, so it's called the Paleo exclusion principle, but essentially what happens is that says they get squashed closer and closer together. They move faster and faster to get out of each of this way if you like. And that makes a force which holds them up. And so that creates what's called a white dwarf star, so you can have a blob of Matzoh. They're about the size of the earth, but they're about the mass of the sun.

Speaker 3:          00:24:43       And uh, so that's, that's for smaller stars. They end up as these white dwarf things which are very dense objects as another version which is called a neutron star, which is the same thing, but for neutrons and they, they move faster and faster. So if it's, if it's massive enough that it overwhelms the electron thing, then the electrons sort of crush into protons and turned into neutrons. And the whole thing starts again. And so a neutron star can be, you know, elite one and a half times the mass of the sudden, let's say. But it can be about what, 10 miles across. So, so that's an incredibly dense ball of matter held up by this neutrons moving around. It's got a fancy name, it's called Neutron degeneracy pressure with it. But if you go even bigger than even that can't hold it up. And as far as we know them, there's no known force that we know of that can hold, hold the thing up if it's too massive.

Speaker 3:          00:25:38       And so that's when it just almost winks out of existence. If you like it, it collapses and collapses and collapses. And, and that's when you get a black hole. We try to put that into perspective of the earth. The Sun is a million times bigger than the earth in this. This neutron star is, would you say one and a half times the mass of the 10 miles wide? Yeah. Yeah. So, and there's loads of those around them. They're called sales. So we see those all over the place there. The first one that was discovered was called LGM one because they're spinning very fast. And then the, it was called lgm one because it's a very irregular pulse and they thought it was a little green men. So they called it kind of jokingly little green men one. And um, so yeah, we, we've seen that there's one called the crab pulsar, which is in the crab Nebula, which we saw the supernova explosion.

Speaker 3:          00:26:27       So that's when a lot of the styles explodes at the end of its life and then collapses to form a neutron star. And we saw that in 10:54 add, wasn't there some speculation that our gout or our solar system at one point was, had, it was a binary star system and that one of those stars had become a door. I don't know. Um, some, someone had said something about that in relationship to the dense object they believe is outside the Kuyper belt. Yeah. I mean there's some evidence that the bits of evidence that there's something out there. Yeah. Yeah. And could, because of the periodic extinctions and things on earth, you get periodic bombardments from in the belt. So yeah, I think one of the theories, histrionic extinctions. Well, yeah, so figuring out like the, you know, they've been. There had been mass extinctions on earth when a lot of the life died and then we don't know what caused all those.

Speaker 3:          00:27:23       But um, sometimes there are impacts from space that seems clear. And so yeah, there are theories that there's something over tonight which can disrupt all these objects are in the pipe, the belt that sends low to comets and asteroids inwards to the inner solar system and can cause a habit. And so there's some people look at those theories. I mean, I don't know, it's one of those, it is a possibility that the same as the circulation was, that there's something out there is the, correct me if I'm wrong, something called the galactic shelf like that it gets to a certain space and it indicates that there's something far larger out there. Uh, yeah. I mean I think, I don't know the exact about the stellar sized or mass objects out there. I don't know that. I mean there is some sort of suggestions. Is another planet out there, big planet for example.

Speaker 3:          00:28:15       But you're right, there can be the be stuff in way beyond the bell and we talk in, you know, a light year away or something like that. Now it's interesting because it's incomprehensible the distance, right? And in our minds how far that must be out past what we used to call Pluto, but for whatever reason that becomes more interesting because it's in our neighborhood. Whereas if they find some distant star system and that it might have a planet similar to Earth, that doesn't seem as compelling for whatever weird reason now. Yeah, I mean, I think the planets around Alpha Centuri approximate Centura, which is the closest stars. It seems like there are planets around those now. And then that, that was interesting because we could conceive of go in there and there was this idea, you're Stephen Hawking actually and some others at before he died, had this idea called breakthrough starshot, which is the idea to send a little probe out to at the center at the Alpha Centura system.

Speaker 3:          00:29:13       And it, I think in their view, Yuri milner as well, the, the, you know, the, the entrepreneur wanting to do that. And uh, the, I think he said something like a hundred years traveled time or something with, with the, with our current technology. And they pointed out that we don't do that now. We don't think a hundred years in the future, but if you go back when people were building cathedrals, people used to routinely start projects that would take a hundred years to bear fruit and so we imagine going there and that's. That then becomes fascinating I think because then you've got a solar system and know the solar system that you could go and visit conceivably. Conceivably.

Speaker 4:          00:29:53       Yeah. I mean what kind of speed are we talking and how long would it take to get there? Well, yeah, I mean, so it is. I think the, the idea was about 100 years to get there, so it's going four light years or so in 100 years or whatever that you would have to essentially do what they didn't like the Ridley Scott Alien Film and put people into some sort of a, Oh, you're a robotic probe. It wouldn't be a. It wouldn't be possible for a crew. Well it is, but you have to freeze them. Yeah. That's always the. When you touch your engineer's, you had Ilan and didn't use engineers always say, you know, physicists go, well, it's possible in principle, so over to you, you do it now there are no laws of physics that tells us we can't do it, so we just do it. But you know, that's a weird relationship with physics.

Speaker 4:          00:30:36       Physicists and engineers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, but yeah, in principle you're right. If you can send a little robots facial there, you can send a crude spaceship. I'm of the opinion as time goes on and augmented and virtual reality gets better and better that it doesn't totally make sense unless we're talking about colonizing someplace to send biological life to another planet and if we can send some probe that doesn't have to worry about the, you know, the biology being affected by radiation or by the speed of travel or even buy food, we can send something out there and almost be there by virtue of goggles, virtual reality goggles or something else.

Speaker 3:          00:31:19       Yeah. You hear that in science at the moment. Space Science. We have this debate alive actually because of course I'm space probes like curiosity. That's on Mars at the moment. That's really cheap compared to sending people to Mars, and so quite often the scientists who wants to find out about the world's will say, well, we should spend it on robots. We shouldn't spend it on people. I think crewed space exploration is in some ways, I mean it's clearly true at the moment that humans can do more than robots so we can explore the place better for an now. Yeah, but. But I think it has to be. It's about something else. I mean it's about. It's not only, it's about living and working off the planet, which I think is quite persuasive argument. Actually. We've. We've already industrialized near Earth orbit, so it's already a multibillion dollar industry in every communication satellites and weather satellites, gps, whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:32:16       Yeah. We're already up there and so learning to live and work in space is I think a natural extension of our, of our civilization. Plus the fact he taught, so Elon or Jeff Bezos, they point out that the amount of resources available just slightly above our heads is vast. And so I remember I talked to Jeff Bezos actually once and he, he thinks really simply and he said maybe for example, in the asteroid belt, there's enough metal, I think to build a skyscraper side, what is it? Something like 800 stories tall and cover the earth in it, right if you want. Now we don't want to dig that. But his point was that the energy from the sun is all up there. The resources are up there. So you could almost imagine trying to zone the earth residential at some point in the future to protect the planets.

Speaker 3:          00:33:05       And do you have a industry off the planet, for example. And these sound, it sounds like science fiction except that now space x and blue origin, those people have got reusable rockets. So suddenly the economics become sensible. So I think it, I think, I think expansion is good and I think we will expand and I think we will expand outwards because there's not much room left on this planet to expand. So I think we'll do so. But that's a whole different idea. It's not about gathering scientific information, it's about a frontier. And and all the benefits that come from operating as a civilization on the frontier which we have lost on the earth because there is no from to your left. And so I like that idea that Mars. And when you talk about Mars, especially with Elon He's right? That that's the only place you can go.

Speaker 3:          00:33:54       So there, there is no other planet we can go to other than Mars. You can go to Jupiter or Saturn, mercury or Venus. So if we want to go somewhere and expand our civilization, it has to be mild and everything's there that you need. So with that, that's a different thing. Saying that you want to find out stuff, you're right. If we just want to find out stuff, then you send robots. But as far as expanding actual civilization and bring you to another place, one of the things that freaked me out as people get depressed about living in Seattle, I mean, you, you're going to live on Mars. I wouldn't agree with you. It'd be a horrendous thing is it's like the. It'd be like the western front. Yeah. It's different here. When people cross the states, incredibly dangerous thing to do that when across the states they still got to Wyoming and beautiful places in Colorado and.

Speaker 3:          00:34:41       Yeah, but it was hard. Yeah. I wouldn't want it to do it. But once you got there, there's a river and there's trout in the river and the metals are green and I agree with you. Right? I mean I'm not going to go there. So there were vineyards and hotels and things. However, it is true that there are people he liked the challenge and what is true about Mars? It's interesting actually because we know something about the history of miles now quite a lot about the history of Mars and it's certainly clear that there was water almost certainly oceans, rivers, so and that water is almost certainly still there. So I would say certainly still there where they have found large quantities of ice now, right? Yeah. So there's certainly ice. The may even be pockets of liquid water below the surface somewhere. So couple that with all the minerals and the resources that we know are there and you have everything you need.

Speaker 3:          00:35:34       So that's the thing about Mars, which is quite nice relative to everywhere else other than the earth. You can't go to Venus, you just metal. What is it? Four hundred and something degrees and 90 atmospheric pressure as I said so, so, so Mars is quite nice but I wouldn't go there. I agree with you because it's not gravity of Mars in relationship to third, third, I think third, right? Yeah, something like that. So it would still have a significant weakening effect. Like if you went to Mars and then somehow or another in the future they were able to get back to earth. Yeah. Your body would have a real problem with that. Right there is there is still grabbing. It's a bit more than a third. I can't quite remember, but it's something like that. But yeah, so there's still gravity. So there's gravity, there's um, some protection from the that you'd probably want to live in the caves actually or something like that because there's no magnetic field there.

Speaker 3:          00:36:29       So it's quite high radiation environment, but not too bad. It was further from the sun than we are. It's not to the replaces a mouse, there's a very deep critical helis which has a big impact basin. And at the bottom, the, the, it's so deep you could fit everest in it. So you put Mount Everest in the summit of Everest, wouldn't reach the rim of the crater. So it says something like, I don't know what it is, seven miles deep or six miles deep. So you could go there and at the bottom the atmospheric pressure is so high that you could just about have liquid water on occasionally on the floor of that crater. And sometimes it can be 20 degrees. Really? Yeah, the Celsius. Wow. So, so better than experiencing a series called, right? Yeah. So it can be warmer than Minnesota. And so there are places where it's not horrendous on Mars.

Speaker 3:          00:37:25       Uh, you know, so the Martian is kind of really stick in that sense, sort of bits of it. Do you watch those movies and shake your head? I like him. I like science fiction, you know, you know, so yeah. And I sit there. I grew up with star wars. That was my, when I was nine years old, list and say, yeah, I'm not having this. I didn't, I did an argument with Neil degrasse Tyson, not an argument, but a debate with him about lightsabers ones because I claimed that they're physically the in principle they're possible. Um, and he was trying to say that they aren't, but they are, would, they'd have to loop back around because the light's not continuing to like the fact that it goes to a certain distance and pauses. We'd have to have a mirror or something, I guess. Yeah. Something that's pretty be the end of it. Right? That's true. So it wouldn't, it'd be a different kind of lights there. The only point I was making is that photons, particles of light can bounce off each other. So we see that in really high energy experiments in particle accelerators. We can collide photons together. So my point was a bit of a pedantic physicists one, but he's because he. It is true that light can bounce off. It can hit light, but very, very high energy. But when they press that button, it goes

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       to a certain distance. I wasn't, that's engineering, right? I agree with you. I agree with you. The distance thing doesn't mass to it. Right. So as you're swinging it around, you wouldn't have the leverage of a long thing, so why not make it really long? Because it wouldn't be difficult to swing around. Like you could stab someone with a light saber a mile away. That's true. Well that's just the laser in it. Yes. Like why? Why make it so short? Ridiculous. You have to swing. You got to be close to hitting a person with it. That's a silly, silly design. You are picking holes correctly in the engineering part of my. The only point I was making is that physics, is that we shut him. He's quite interested in. Is it light can bounce off light. Yes. So, but it would have, there would have to be something that causes it to stop at the very end.

Speaker 2:          00:39:29       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which will be, you're right, it has merit, but he wouldn't look cool with it if there was no kind of thing with them. But what drives me crazy about star wars is not the light sabers. It's the lasers when they're shooting the guns, so I'm like, why can I see that when I can't see bullets? This is supposed to be way faster than a bullet. Like why is it easy to see this? Because it's like you can get out of the way. Those things they really slow. It would be so angry. I'd be like, this is so dumb. I could go warp speed in this Millennium Falcon and travel the speed of light, but for whatever reason, these lasers are so slow that you could duck out of the way of them. That's so dumb. And it's not only style loads. He takes everything.

Speaker 2:          00:40:10       Every single film. Does that. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's like films, like also I worked on one of these films years ago. Sunshine. Very underappreciated movement. Yeah, I think so. I think it's brilliant film, but in that, so they, they asked me, uh, Danny said I want to do it right. So I'll do the spacecraft without any sand. So when it's traveling through space, there'll be silent and it looks shit. It just, when you. It's the same when when you try and fill the astronauts and you and they're in zero g and they always move slowly. It's like, why, you know, you're right, you're right. You'd be able to move very fast did you want. But it looks silly. So this kind of a, I suppose it's what audiences have got used to over the years. And so in the end you have a partner in 2001 which didn't do it silent in 2001.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       Well, Kubrick was a stickler for science and for him he was apparently he would do complex mathematics in his spare time. Left. Fascinating guy. That must have been. Yeah, I read that. They just, um, someone just found it. Interview didn't idea of the day where he explained the ending of 2001. I didn't say that it yesterday actually. And it was, it was kind of a really simple version of it. He just said, well, the super intelligent beings take him in and put him in a zoo basically, and watch him grow old and then sending back to the earth as a super being. That's the worst explanation at the end of 2001 I've ever heard, but it was Kubrick's. That's what cubic said, so that he falls into the monolith. Yeah. They just put them in this room, which is kind of a bad version of a French chateau or something watching grow old and then send him back to the earth is a super being. Wow. Okay. That was Kubrick's version. Strange. It's a, it's a, it's a weird genre, right? Because sometimes people get things right, like didn't hg wells predict a, a significant amount of scientific inventions in the future? Well, there is. I mean, defenders. Which one doesn't it? There was a moon one wasn't there. He did an agenda to the moon. I mean he's time machine is not able to do that. Really worked out yet.

Speaker 2:          00:42:31       I think it's, I, I always liked science fiction. I like Arthur c Clarke a lot, you know, because I think it is. You're right. It's a form that you can let your imagination wander and address things. That restriction I think. Did you like the alien series? I loved it. Yeah. So I leave when I was, uh, when I was at school, he's 19, 79 and we had a school film club and in the seventies they weren't like they are now, you know, and so the first films they put on the three films, I was 11 and it was alien, apocalypse now in life of Brian. Wow. Which I. So that was my introduction to allow. Well those are three great choices, but I feel like really Scott's original alien is probably one of the greatest horror science fiction movies of all time. One of my all time favorite movies.

Speaker 2:          00:43:18       But I really liked the newer ones as well. Like I like promethium and I really liked covenant. The last one. Yeah, for ets. I don't know, I guess it's not the best one, what they're trying to do with it. The, the whole idea of what the engineers coming back in time and that's it. That's why I was disappointed with it because I thought the, the opening is brilliant and I thought this is just going to be brilliant. I thought it just lost its way and it was a disappointment because it could have been so brilliant. Yes, I agree with you. Yeah. The beginning was fantastic, but I think covenant was more more exciting and. Well, it's also preposterous. Like if you went to another planet, I. The last thing you'd be doing is just breathing in the air. Right? I mean we'd have to be really cool if there was a life on the planet, we'd have to be really careful than a. not to contaminate but be not to be contaminated. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah. There's also. I mean, you know, the other thing is science fiction films is gravity because you always give me an alien. You always just say the spaceships got gravity again is only 2001. Right where everybody floats around. Yeah. Because all has a spinning thing. The spaceship has gravity and then when you land the gravity's exactly like earth. Yeah. Perfect. But it's ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       Yeah. I've been with what are the odds that you would find a planet that is exempt? Like even if a planet was one and a half times the size of earth, it would have far more gravity. Right. And that's, that's really common for a planet to be like just a little bit bigger. And then we will be like, fuck everywhere it'd be walking. We'd be, we'd be getting crushed. Right. I agree with you. Yeah. Well I suppose that's not the point. It's about ideas, isn't it? Science class and you know, this whole idea where you just supposed to let it, let the, you know, let the story play out and. Well, I mean sunshine was um, you know, the, the premise is, is silly. I mean it's, the premise is the son is dying and we're going to go and fix it. Yeah. Both of those things.

Speaker 3:          00:45:16       It fails on its first line in incentive reasons, but the idea is that it's not about that. It's about, it's about the, it's about the sun as a god in some ways. So it's about our response to the power of nature and it's about day fighting this thing and worshiping it and how ultimately you go mad if you remember the film, the pin backer, who's the first captain that went to the captain, the first mission to go and restart the sun, which is the mad bit, but then became a religious fundamentalist essentially, and then decided it's a fascinating idea that he decides to to bring meaning to his life. He will become the last, last man, the last human, and so he wants to be the lest he wants the son to die and he wants to take humanity with it and he decided to make that happen.

Speaker 3:          00:46:08       So he stays there waiting for the second ship. And I like those ideas that, you know, what, what's your reaction to the power of nature this afternoon? One of the thing to do my shows, I'm not being a commercial person, I've just thought of it. One of the great things about cosmologies that it is terrifying in the, in the truest sense of the word mean. We talked a bit about the size and scale of the universe and black holes colliding and those things, you know, it is very frightening, but also the I think the act of trying to understand our place in nature and the size and scale of the universe and now our tiny presence within it is valuable. It's a, it's a so that you can be terrified but also inspired and interested and it's part of if you want to find, if you want to ask questions about what it means to be human and means to be alive, then I think you find the answers in confronting that reality, which is that we live in a terrifyingly vast universe.

Speaker 3:          00:47:11       Pat, the powers in the universe that we cannot comprehend as you said, but that, that that's what you've got to face because that's reality, so you can't hide your head in the sand and just duck it and it sends them. It can send some people crazy. I'm sure it is really interesting that we need that suspension of disbelief in order to sort of make a film on space. You almost have to like go, well this isn't really how it would be, but this is how you have to make it in order to fit it into a two hour movie. Yeah. And then the film as we sunshine becomes about your. Then you can have the film about something else. Yes. [inaudible]. It's not really that well. Did you like a event horizon? Yeah, I did actually. I thought that's ridiculous. I'm saying I always wanted to ask about their, their concept of propulsion that you almost like space would be flat, you would fold space over and you would intersect those two points and you'd be able to travel vast distances instantaneously.

Speaker 3:          00:48:12       Right. And I'm doing a terrible job of explaining it, I'm sure. But is that a concept that people have actually considered? Yeah, you can in general relativity. So. So Einstein, I should say. Well it is Einstein's theory of general relativity is our best theory of space and time and so it really is, as we've talked about before, it's you imagine space and time as a sheet. Just imagine it as a thing, literally a sheet surface and all the theory says is that if you put matter and or energy into that, then it curves it and distort it and it can stretch it and make it shrink. And so it's the response of space and time to matter and energy. So if you, if you, the simplest version will be the sun. So you put the big spherical ball of stuff in there and it warp space and time searched at the nice straight lines, something just traveling minute.

Speaker 3:          00:49:05       So in business through that warp space turns into an orbit and that's why you can actually kind of see things that are behind the sun. Yeah, so light bends around the sun because it's just traveling through the curved space. The earth goes around the sun because it's just rolling, minding its own business through the curve space. So an example would be, you might say, well how does curb space, how can connect, give rise to something? It looks like a force, which is gravity. So the best analogy I know of is to think of walking around on the surface of the earth to be stand on the equator of the earth and you with your friend and you say, we're going to do north. So we're going to set off, let's say we're a thousand miles apart on the equator and we're gonna walk due north and what's going to happen?

Speaker 3:          00:49:49       So you walk in straight lines, you don't change direction, you don't do any accelerating, but the straight lines and lines of longitude on the surface of the earth. So as you go further and further north, you get closer and closer together and he carried onto the pole. You bump into each other, but nothing's happened and no one's no one. There's no forces acting. It's just that you're moving on a curved surface and so you get closer. And that's basically Einstein's theory of general relativity. Now, why did I start talking about event horizon? The idea of a full. Oh yeah. So, so you can. So all you have to do, so those folded kinds of geometries is you have to try and specify hat where you would put the matter and what kind of stuff you'd put there to make the geometry fold in that way.

Speaker 3:          00:50:35       And you can do, you can do it so you can. You can write down that geometry is called a warp drive. Geometry I think is called that is in textbooks. So you can do that too. To have a warp drive. The question becomes what sorts of stuff would you have to actually put into the real universe to make it warp in that way. And it always usually turns out that it's the kind of stuff that doesn't exist, but it has properties. Is Matt sort of matter or sort of energy that has properties that do not exist in nature as far as we can tell, but you can still write the geometry down in Einstein's theory. So if you had the sadness, guilt force or mass or whatever it is, if you had that stuff that doesn't exist, it is a concept that. Yeah. So the geometry exists is so you can.

Speaker 3:          00:51:22       You can, you can do it and you can do the calculations and you can see the walk drive, you can construct wormholes that connect distant regions of the universe, which you could use as time machines and you can do all that in the theory, but in nature you'd have to have the right stuff to do it, but that stuff is not real. That seems to be as far as we know now what would have to happen, like you would have to have enough power or mass to be able to fold those two things together. It tends to be weird stuff like, um, stuff that has a negative pressure or something like that. So stuff that has physical properties that are just bizarre and that no matter or energy that we know of in the universe has so that to make, to make the geometry happen.

Speaker 3:          00:52:09       But it's conceivable in theory that this could exist even though it doesn't. It's a, it's a, it's a dba ultimately. Um, so wormholes that a good example. So that would be quite literally it. We talked about the surface of the earth. So you fly to Australia from La and you have to go quite a long way around the edge of the earth or you could turn or straight through and get there quicker. So you get that. That's a word. Jamie's got a little graphic up there and there it is. So you could go all the way around the edge or you could take the shortcut. So the question is, so you can do that in theory, you can write down that geometry and there it is. So the first question is can you make it? And as we've said, we don't think that stuff exists. There's a second set of theoretical bits of theoretical work, which if you had a worm hole then what would happen if you tried to travel through it and what seems to happen is that is that they become unstable the moment anything tries to go through.

Speaker 3:          00:53:10       So you get kind of a feedback of stuff going through and through and through and through and so it collapses and that there's a great. There's a great book by Kip Thorne actually we just mentioned him. He got the Nobel Prize last year for the gravitational waves and he wrote a brilliant book, things in the eighties called black holes and time warps way talks about the. The answer is we don't fully know, but most physicists thing that even if they existed, they will be unstable and as soon as you even tried to transmit information through them, send a bit of light through, then there will be sought feedback and they'd collapse. And ultimately the reason we don't really know absolutely is because you need what's called a quantum theory of gravity and we don't have one, so we don't have the theoretical tools to be absolutely sure that these things would be unstable or don't exist in nature, but we strongly suspect that they don't.

Speaker 3:          00:54:02       If they did, you could build a time machine. So there Stephen Hawking wrote a paper called the chronology protection conjecture, um, and conjectures the important word. So he, at the conjecture basically was that the laws of nature will be such that you can't have stable wormholes and you can't build time machines. And if you send something through it, it would destabilize it. And if it didn't destabilize it, how would your physical body deal with the stress of that? Well, it doesn't have to be that you can. You can build them. That's called the tidal gravitational force. So it's the difference in gravitational pull across your body because you. One of the things that gets you to fall into a black hole, so before you actually get to the singularity you can get is called Spaghetti fight. So you get there and it's just like the moon's, you know the tidal effects on the earth, which is quite small, but they still raised hides on the oceans.

Speaker 3:          00:54:57       So that can be. If you think about something like a black hole, that can be any massive difference in gravitational pull from your head to your feet. And so it can stretch you out. And so what you can with wormholes you, you can, you can write the geometry down the United States theory such that you could go through so you don't have to be destroyed or anything weird happened to you. Would you have to have some something protecting you? Some force, some, some sort of a. You just literally eat, fall through. I mean it's so, so you know, if they were, they were, they exist. You just, you just go through, you sit in a little spaceship but you, you, you wouldn't. There's nothing inherently in them that says that you will be ripped apart or anything like that. But what are your thoughts on, on alien life, on life outside of this planet as something you think about?

Speaker 3:          00:55:52       Yeah, I think there must be. I'm even in the solar system, I would not be surprised if we find microbes on Mars are sort of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn where there's liquid water like Europa. Yeah, and the reason is that if you think about. The reason I think that guests is because if you look at the history of life on earth, then so earth formed and it was just a. There was no life. It was a ball of rock an almost. As soon as it cooled down, we see evidence of life. So certainly three point 8 billion years ago, possibly even further back than that. We see evidence of life on earth. So somewhere along the line, geochemistry, active geochemistry became biochemistry on earth and we have some idea, you know, that the, if you get a gradient of temperature and acid and alkaline and the conditions that are naturally present on the surface of oceans, then complex carbon chemistry spontaneously happens.

Speaker 3:          00:56:56       So we have a. We know that life almost certainly we know that life began on earth. I mean the other opportunity came from space or something like that, but probably didn't really properly began on earth. And so that means that at least here that happened and we know that the conditions that lead to the origin of life on earth were present a miles three point eight, 4 billion years ago. And we know that they're present on Europa today. So I don't see that there's anything special. Life is just chemistry and it and the, the idea that geochemistry becomes biochemistry's not fanciful because it happened here. So I think that given the same conditions, it will be surprising to me at the same thing didn't happen in that life begins. So I, I, that's one of the two tests. That is one of the great frontiers of science now, which one of the great challenges, which is why another reason we're interested in Mars, because we know those conditions where there, we know there were what's called hydrothermal vent systems on the floors, have oceans on Mars, three point eight or 4 billion years ago. So it will be good to know what I've said is right and the way we find out is to find life or evidence of past life.

Speaker 4:          00:58:12       Are you aware of, uh, the speculation that was going around with how recent was it that occupy thing, the, uh, uh, the octopus eggs, they, there was a group of scientists that were speculating that it's Panspermia the idea of Panspermia, that it's possible that Octopi had come from somewhere else and frozen eggs had actually come from somewhere else and landed on earth. And these are like legitimate scientists are contemplating not morons. I don't think I've seen this, the, no, I didn't, but I mean it. So panspermia doesn't have to be unlikely. I mean, for example, you might have seen the other day we found an earth rock on the mood. Yes, right. Well they'll back on this now because he apollo astronauts brought it back in the 4 billion years old or something. One of the oldest rocks ever found. Yeah. So. So we know that material

Speaker 3:          00:59:00       transfer between planets and so it's not inconceivable that microbes could survive that journey. Right. We know that microbes can survive in space, for example, so that isn't mad. It's probably unlikely, but he's not mad. But with the octopus I hadn't heard that, but the thing is that the octopus is still extremely biologically

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       to us. I mean the difference is negligible, so it's still got the same energy system with a single ATP and DNA and all that stuff. It's all very, very similar. It was something about rna and DNA. Did you find that out?

Speaker 5:          00:59:34       I'm enough. I'm looking at a different one from a different website. It's about the same thing. It has to do with the Cambrian explosion and there were 33 authors on a paper that got published and the progress and in biophysics and molecular biology that talked about this possibility. There are other people that disagree with it though.

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       Right. I suppose the, I haven't seen it, so I think it's unlikely because the octopus is extremely similar to us, so that suggests a common origin. To me that's a pose. The cancer argument you could, you could advance would be there's only one way to do life, so you could say the actually given because the laws of physics and chemistry the same everywhere, so maybe it's maybe DNA, which is the only way to do it. So that's the way it gets done. Which is why they're so similar to us is so alien as well. Yeah, they're not though, you know, that's the thing. If not. So that's why I'm surprised about because they're not that alien. They're very similar. While they're in their abilities, their ability to transform their texture and their color instant almost instantaneously. They have incredible camouflage abilities that really don't exist in the mammalian world.

Speaker 2:          01:00:44       Yeah. But on a cellular level, you look at Knox for sell in among under a microscope and you wouldn't be able to sell the treating not for selling humans. So the only way that that would make sense as if all life comes from basically the same kind of building blocks and just varies depending upon the conditions and where it takes place. I'm, I'm guessing, but yes, that, that that must be the. The only way you could sustain that, given that they're so similar to us because they really are biochemically, is that that's the only way it can be done given the given the building block, the toolkit, the laws of nature and the elements and so on that we have in our universe, we have so many different life forms on our planet, but if we found anything that's remotely similar to what we have here on earth, on another planet, it would be such an incredible discovery.

Speaker 2:          01:01:29       Like we sat, we found a frog on the moon. I mean the world would stop. Right. I'd be very surprised if we found anything anywhere that is any, in any way similar. An insect on Mars. Well, this is. I mean, as I said, it'd be micro. I think every single celled things remember. I mean you mentioned the Cambrian explosion, so that is that. What we do know that earth is that although life began, let's say three point 8 billion years ago, it wasn't until around 600 million years ago or so, that maybe most 700 that you see any complex multicellular organisms at all. So if there's something like 3 billion years, it was single celled alone and that's one of the reasons why I would guess if I had to guess, I would say that microbes would be common because life began very quickly on earth and I wouldn't be surprised to find

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       finding on Mars, but complex life, multicellular life, insects, plants, intelligence, I would guess will be very rare because it took so long on earth to get there and you just slime bag. Three billion years of slime. That was it. On what happened? How did it go from slime? Two giraffes. It's very quickly once he wanted to go in and it's one of the great unsolved mysteries in biology that one thing that is true is that we seem to be all complex creatures seemed to be and we were called. You carry it, writers yourselves with the cell nucleus and all that kind of stuff and they look like they're the merger between two simpler life forms of bacteria and a thing called an archaic and okay, and so it looks like somewhere in 2 billion years ago, whatever it was, in some ocean, the bacteria cell got inside the arcane and survived as, as a symbiotic organism essentially, and then somehow unbelievably managed to reproduce and replicate in that configuration and that does seem to be the origin of all complex, multicellular life on earth.

Speaker 3:          01:03:39       So it's called a fateful encounter hypothesis. And if that's true then it's just a bit of luck and it happened once. Right? And that's why we're here now when blind look considerably like how many billion earth like planets did you say exists just in our sources to the alone in the galaxy? 20 billion, something like that. So one in 10 styles. So the odds of complex life out of our incredibly fortunate situation, but the odds of that occurring on any of these billions of other planets that exist, we don't know, but let's say the earth is. Let's say it was under the fortunate side, so, so we're, we're, we're talking about give or take 4 billion years, right? And the origin of life to now, and we have a civilization now and we've had it. Our species has been around what, a quarter of a million years or something.

Speaker 3:          01:04:28       So it's just now basically. So let's say 4 billion is on the fortunate side, let's say that it was double that or triple that on the average. Suddenly that's the age of the universe, right? That's a third of the age of the universe. So how many of those worlds had been stable for three or 4 billion years? That's quite a tall order actually. It looks like our solar system might be quite unusual in that respect that because they had the planet, it's got to remain stable in a stable orbit. The stars got to remain stable. System stabilizes at Jupiter. Plays a big role. Takes of treatments. Yeah, socks and soap and that you know that there's a thing. There's a theory called the grand tack theory, which is very hard to explain the evolution of our solar system so that when you do compete a models of solar systems, you don't tend to get for rocky planets too close to the sun and for big gas giants.

Speaker 3:          01:05:27       Further out, and one of the current best theories, and this I say this because it shows you how lucky we might be, is that Jeff said that they tend to form these big gas Jane's and migrate inwards towards the Star. So in almost all the computer simulations, just because you got this big gas giant obits and all the dust around this star. They tend to drop in woods and it looks like Jupiter did that. So it looks like it formed and came in and came in almost to where Mars orbitz today and cleared out the region around Mars actually. Which is maybe the reason Mars is so small compared to the other to Venus and earth. But then Saturn was coming in as well. And in the computer models. The interaction between Jupiter and Saturn Stop Jupiter coming in before it gets to the earth.

Speaker 3:          01:06:14       And they both get dragged out again and so to where they are today and so, and that, that seems to be, it's one of the best theories for the evolution of our solar system. So what are the chances that the chances of that are so many skill? My tiny. So that's the thing I think about these rocky planets in order to get a civilization on them. I think you need, I guess you need quite unusual solar systems that will be a guest and you need quite unusual stability on the planet for, for billions of years. And that's why I think we might be quite lucky. Hmm. And how does bodes law work? Bodes laws, a method of detecting if you look at the mass of a planet, you can accurately detect how much mass and the size of a neighboring planet. I think it wasn't just the, um, the physicians of the obits I think we're in.

Speaker 3:          01:07:11       Yeah. And uh, it's one thing that is true, but our solar system is that you, if you get the computer simulations, you can't put more planets in to try and fill, put more planets. And they become, it becomes unstable very quickly. So the, the mass of like, if you measure Mars, you can accurately depict where the next planet close to it would be. It, it was, I mean it was, that's what was done was at 17th century or something. I can't remember his along yet. It was just one of those things where, you know, it's a pattern and they were just trying to figure out what the answer is. Just a pattern which is, um, you know, not, there's nothing to that really other than to say that most simulations of the solar system, if there are, if you put other planet saying they tend to get thrown out by gravitational interactions.

Speaker 3:          01:08:00       So there is a sense in which our solar system has got as much stuff in it as it could have. So the planets and nicely spaced and you're right, given the massive them, that depends on how close to the planet can be before the interaction goes wrong. And it gets thrown out into the intergalactic space. Something. Because planets do that, you know, we, we know that planets get thrown out of solar systems by gravitational interactions. So it, yeah. So again, it points to the fact that solar systems are not a not stable over long periods of time. They're not like clockwork. Things not like Newtonian clockwork and it just goes on forever. They're not like that, that they evolve and planets can shift orbitz and change and what we know, maybe look at the surface of the moon, for example, it covered in craters and that was, cause they all seem to hit about the same time and it's about three point 8 billion years ago or so.

Speaker 3:          01:08:55       Uh, and that's called the late heavy bombardment. So we know that if you look at cratering and rates on Mars or the moon, it all seemed to happen in this, not all, but a big peak around that time. And that seems to be correlated with Neptune moving outwards in the solar system and into Kuyper belt, basically our towards the Kuyper belt and causing all sorts of havoc and everything comes into the inner solar system. So those things happen and it didn't happen when life was established on the earth, so it's all extremely old stuff that shifting to explore. But how long, how long is the source system, but in this particular stable situation that's in it since about three point 8 billion years ago. So if it'd been unstable at any point since then, then we likely wouldn't be here. Right. Do you think that it's possible?

Speaker 3:          01:09:47       Do you ever entertain the idea that it's possible that we are the only intelligent life in the known universe? I, I, I tend to restrict myself to the galaxy. So I do think it's possible that at the moment there's one civilization in the Milky Way and that says, and I think that's important actually. It goes back to I was saying at the start about the astronomy and cosmology being part of the framework within which you have to think if you're looking for meaning or you're looking for how we should behave even politically. You know, the that has a bearing to me. I mean, imagine that we're the only place where there is intelligence in this galaxy and how should we behave, right? Should we actually not withstanding the fact that we're tiny and fragile things an insignificant physically should we consider ourselves extremely valuable in that respect because there's nowhere else where you know that I would go as far as to say there will be nowhere else where meaning exists in the Milky Way in because meeting.

Speaker 3:          01:10:54       It's one of those things that scientists don't talk about very much. Although Richard Fineman, one of my great heroes did talk about it. There's a quote where he says, well, is the meaning of it all? It's a great essay called the value of science, and so what is self evidently true is that meaning exists here because it means something to us. So that's kind of an obvious statement. Your life means something to you in May and so meaning exists, but I think it is a local and temporary phenomenon. I think it's. It emerges, meaning emerges from configurations of atoms, which is what we are. We are simply that. We're nothing more than that. We're very, very rare configuration of atoms I think, and so that means that we are, if you go all the way down that line of logic, we are the only island meaning in the galaxy.

Speaker 3:          01:11:47       I will meaning only to ourselves. Yeah. It means something to us because we're the only ones who can grasp the concept and we are finite. We are finite organism, we have this temporary existence while we're here and to us there is meaning. Yeah. And that's, I don't know any other way to define it. So I'll define it like that. Yes. I don't think there's a globe. Yeah. Otherwise you have to believe there's some kind of global meaning God type finger. Uh, I don't think that's. I think it's more wonderful and more challenging to us because we have to take responsibility for it to say we should operate such that we are it in this galaxy. There's nothing else. I'm sure. I'm just, I'm sure there are other civilizations out there in the universe because there are 2 trillion galaxies. I, I just can't believe this hasn't happened in other places.

Speaker 3:          01:12:41       The question is how often does it happen? And how widely spaced are the civilizations and I think they're very widely spaced and I think there may be one or two per galaxy on the average. I could put that as you said, that what you said it beautifully, that. What else can we think? Well, what else do you want? I mean, I think what it says is you have to take responsibility for all of those things or spiritual things that you think about and the emotional things you think about it, you, you, you are, you are responsible for that. You are that, that whatever that is, it exists in you and it will only exist for a short amount of time. And so what you know make the best of it will be my view. It's so unbelievably compelling though to consider the idea that somewhere out there there's another civilization that maybe even more advanced than us and this, this thought of it is just so attractive.

Speaker 3:          01:13:39       It's, it's incredible. That shit should be. If, if civilizations are common or even slightly common, then there should be civilizations ahead of us. Yes, because there's been so much time, but when you want to see what that's like, I mean, we've been so compelling. You imagined the timescales. We've been around a civilization, let's say 40,000 years. I don't know how long I civilization's been around. Let's say that the, the, the galaxy is pretty much as old as the universe. Thirteen billion years worth of time. So the idea that there are no, no civilization zeroes, you know, 100 million years ago, 200 million years ago, 1 billion years ago. And imagine what they'd be like if they'd survived. I mean, we've been, we've been around, we've had science for let's say since Newton or copernicus, 500 years at most we've had. And look what we've done. We've gone beyond the solar system with voyager.

Speaker 3:          01:14:37       We've walked on the moon and we were about to go to Mars, I would think. So we're about to begin colonizing our own solar system. And so we've done that in 500 years. So imagine a million years in the future. So I would. It's one of the arguments often used to say, there aren't any civilizations out there in the galaxy. It's called the Fermi paradox because if you imagine a civilization that's a million years ahead of us, they should have written their presence across the sky by now. They should use to see him. I mean, you'll see us if we survive in million years into the future. Actually even a few thousand years into the future, we will be exploring the galaxy. We will have spacecraft that are going to wear the stars. We will be doing it, so our signature will become visible. I'm sure if we last into the medium term,

Speaker 4:          01:15:28       we choose to not do that. Here's my thought on that is uncontacted tribes like do you know about the. The gentleman who was the missionary who visited North Sentinel Island and was killed by the natives, north central island, which is a really unusual place because they branched off from Africa 60,000 years ago and they've been living on this one small island the size of Manhattan and as well as we know there's only about 39 of them left somewhere around there and um, we can't, we're not supposed to contact them like people are not supposed we're supposed to like leave them alone and there are rare tribe when they find them in the Amazon, the uncontacted tribes, our initial instincts back off and leave them alone, leave them alone. Do you think that perhaps the universe, like if there is a civilization that's a million times more advanced than us have been around here for, you know, that millions of years of life as opposed to quarter million, why would they, why would they let us know? They look at us dropping bombs on each other and polluting the ocean, sucking all the fish out and putting clouds into the skies of dirt and particles. And why would they literally look at these crude monkey? So are there data there is so far beyond where they need to be before they could join the galactic civilization or whatever it is. True. It's an argument that the reason. Okay. No argument

Speaker 3:          01:16:49       as well. The IT technology so advanced would be difficult for us to detect. I mean we tend to think of know when you say written across the sky, I suppose it's trigger. I'm thinking of star ships and things like star wars, right? Big Energy. Things that you can see the signature of, but actually maybe the. The civilization just becomes a nano civilization. Tiny

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       little. None of us because that's more efficient. It's a better way to do things. So it's possible. I suppose that there are space probes all over the place. They're so small and it's so efficient and you sell it low energy that we just don't see them as far as that is possible. My other thought is that where we are headed, it seems to me that there's some sort of a strange symbiosis that's taking place. There's a, there's a strange connection that we have to electronics and ultimately to an artificial creation, artificial intelligence, whatever you want to call it, artificial light life, something that's created by carbon based beings. Stem cell, you are beings that isn't cellular, but also acts like life, that this may be the future of life, that we are so connected to the idea of flesh and blood and bone, but maybe this is just a temporary situation until we transition or not transition to, it surpasses us and this is the next stage of life, but this stage has no need for all the human and biological reward systems that are in place that made sure that we survive.

Speaker 2:          01:18:19       Whether it's ego or fear or emotions, no need for that, that it will just exist and maintain its equilibrium as this new form of life and that this is the future of life in the universe and that will get there. Maybe it'll only be 100, 200 years from now, but that, that that's what exists all throughout the cosmos. So there's no need to peacock. There's no need to show our sand on the sky and that it just exists in this form. Yeah, I, I agree. I wouldn't be surprised. Yeah. So that's the, that's the counter argument to the Fermi paradox argument that I talked about what a, exactly as you've just said, that basically you evolved to a point very rapidly where you just don't create a signature and you don't really get involved as you said. Maybe it just maintains, but it has no.

Speaker 2:          01:19:13       Well, there's no motivation, right? Like, it doesn't. Our motivations are so weird, right? We have these biological motivations to survive and uh, you know, there's motivation is to conquer and to innovate and to spread our genes and to move into new territories. But if you didn't have biology, if you were, you existed completely from manmade materials or from materials found on earth and that this new form of life is created out of that. I wouldn't have those unless you program them. And why would you do that? It is interesting, isn't it, to two because we don't know what consciousness is. It's often called the hard problem in science. We don't know. So it's a good question whether you can build, let's say you want to build a self replicating machine, which is what you're talking about, something that can go and maybe go to the moon or Mars and replicates itself and then carry on, which is a living thing.

Speaker 2:          01:20:06       I, yes, does he have to have a sufficient level of intelligence that he actually is conscious and all these things that we talked about, this, this word meaning that we used earlier that we all understand that you can't define, is that a emergent property that, that has to emerge if you've got something that's intelligent enough to replicate itself and live and said to be the, I don't know the answer, but it is worth considering that this thing, this what we emotion meaning love and fear and all those things are just the things that happen when you are intelligent. I don't know the answer to that, but it could possibly be. And does consciousness have to have our, uh, local origin? Like it doesn't have to come from a thing. Like if you think about cellular communication, the, if you send me, if you're in England and you send me a video from your phone and it reaches my phone, it's getting to meet through space.

Speaker 2:          01:21:10       It's going through the sky. It's like literally from a device not connected by any wires or anything. It's coming to me if, if there's a possibility to create some sort of global intelligence through electronics that's nonlocal. If one piece of it falls off this same is it just repairs itself or figures itself out, but it's the same consciousness existing on a global scale through some sort of an electronic network that instead of the. The idea that you and I have that Brian and Joe are, you have your mind. I have my mind and we, we exist as intelligent being separate from each other, but instead of that, that all of it is connected and that all of it is something that we can't even conceive of because our brains are too crude. Like trying to explain to, you know, Australia Pithy, kiss what a satellite is.

Speaker 2:          01:22:06       Yeah, I mean I, yeah. So many of you think about our brains, they are ultimately, what are they? They're just a distributed network of cells connected by neurons and they're very complicated, but they are a colony of things that are autonomous in a sense and the communicating with each other. So yeah, I don't, I don't see why you can't scale that up in principle. I mean, I should just add the caveat is always that we don't know this. It's just not understood. Well, I think there's something weird physical, but I'm damn sure it's physical. I'm damn sure that there's nothing going on in my head other than what is allowed by the laws of nature as we understand them. So eliminating show, you mean the idea of a soul being some sort of a divine thing that's inside the housing of the body? Yeah, I mean, I, I, I would say we can rule that out actually. I've argued in the past. How do you rule it out? I valued, we can rule that out in the following manner. So, so here's my arm, right? So

Speaker 3:          01:23:05       it's made of electrons and protons and neutrons. And, uh, if uh, if I have a soul in the, something that we don't understand, but it's a different kind of energy or whatever it is we don't have in physics at the moment, it interacts with matter because I'm moving my hand around. So whatever it is, it something that interact very strongly with matter. But if you look at the history of particle physics in particular, which is the study of matter, we spend, we spent decades making high precision measurements of how massive behaves and interacts and we look for, for example, for a fifth force of nature. So we know for forces the gravity, the two nuclear forces called the weak and strong nuclear forces and electromagnetism. And that's what we know exist. And we look for another one with ultra high precision and we don't see any evidence of it.

Speaker 3:          01:23:56       So I would claim that we know how matter interacts at these energies. So room temperature. Now these, Angie, we know how matter interacts very precisely and so if you want to suggest the something else that interacts with matter strongly, then I would say that it's ruled out. I would go as far to say it's ruled out by experiment or at least he sees extremely subtle and you would have to jump through a lot of hoops to come up with a theory of some stuff that we wouldn't have seen when we've observed how matter interacts that is present in our bodies and presumably be believing the soul. You want it to exist outside. When you die, you still want the thing to be there and you might believe in ghosts and things like that. We like a ghost. I mean it's a. It is something that carries the imprint of you.

Speaker 3:          01:24:44       Presumably it looks like you. So that means that interact strongly with the matter. That is you because it carries a pattern. It carries a pattern and it carries information. It carries information. There has to be an energy source that allows the information to assist in the pattern to persistence, so on. So again, you end up with a theory that is postulating. Something interacts with light because if you think a ghost is the soul, then it's something that people see sometimes. So that means it interacts with light. But we know how light interacts and we ruled out anything but the most subtle, uh, further interaction that we haven't seen. So I would, I claim that I started off as a joke, but it's actually, I wrote it in an infinite monkey cage book, this radio show that I do, but he ended up, when I'd written it down, I thought actually that it makes sense. And I read some news similar. Actually, I think I'm Sean Carroll. Lee, I don't know if you've had shown up a couple times. He's said something the same. I think in the book that he wrote the big picture. I think he has a similar argument actually, so it's occurred to him as well, is roughly the same argument. So if you. So this energy that's interacting with matter, even if you're not moving at all, if you're just thinking it's interacting with the matter encompasses your

Speaker 4:          01:26:03       mind or your brain or your nerves and your neurons. It's something in there that's interacting with matter whether you like it or not. So even just a simple thought process or a dream is still something it's interacting with Matt. Yeah. Well obviously because you know you, it's your will, isn't it? When you move it's presumably, but even if you're not moving the idea, like the year you're saying you're like your body's interacting with batteries, you're moving your arm, but even if you're not moving, if you're just thinking and you're completely still, which is not totally possible because your heart's beating and your breathing and all that stuff, but if somehow or another you were able to isolate just the thought, the thoughts themselves are still interacting with matter because they're interacting with the brain itself. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:26:48       So there's something in there that's something to interact with the physical structure of your body. And and now I would say there isn't. So that's

Speaker 4:          01:26:59       the woo woo version is that the brain itself and the body of the physical, the spiritual self, you are merely an antenna that's tuning in to the great consciousness of the universe.

Speaker 3:          01:27:15       But why? But then you have to answer what we know, what we're made of. So we know how those particles behave and interact. So. So why did the particles not a in any way interact with that stuff? Because we interact, we don't know if that's true. We don't only just interact with it, so we interact extremely strongly with it. We're interacting with it now. Yeah. Every movement I make is the interaction between that. Every man have. Yeah. Yes. When everything. If I moved my fingers or everything that I'm doing is an interaction between that stuff and me, so it's a very strong interaction with matter, but we don't see it in all our precision measurements. Well, the answer for that, the answer is because it's not there. The answer is Jesus and you can't measure God. That may be an answer, but the point is you as we'd sell it for earlier with absolute space, if you can't measure it, it's not there. Right? It's,

Speaker 4:          01:28:17       but for, for whatever reason, for people, there is some incredible motivation to find a divine something or another that's there's something greater than this physical being that there's something. What do you think that is? Like what is that compulsion?

Speaker 3:          01:28:36       We. We've already talked a bit of balance it. I think it goes to the the heart of this question of what it means to be human. So I would say that being human, the answer to that, I don't know the answer to the meaning grid, but the answer would be, uh, we are small finite beings, right? Which are just clusters of atoms as we said before, a very rare, but we understand roughly how they, how they came to be, and we have a limited amount of time, not actually unfortunately, but because of the laws of nature, the laws of nature for bidders to be immortal, they, they, they, they a mortalities ruled out by the laws of physics, but also actually what is it? What's interesting about if you look at the basic physics of the universe going from the Big Bang to where we are today, then the physics is driven by the fact that the universe began in extremely old state because it was a very highly ordered system and it is tending towards a more disordered system at the moment and that's called the second law of thermodynamics.

Speaker 3:          01:29:51       And it's that basic common sense thing that things go to shit. Basically it's the second law of thermodynamics. What we strongly suspect, and I would say no, is that in that process of going from order to disorder, complexity emerges naturally for a brief period of time, so it's a natural part of the evolution of the universe that you get a period in time when there's complexity in the universe, stars and planets and galaxies and life and civilizations, but they are. They exist because the universe is decaying, not in spite of the fact the universe is decaying, so our existence in that sort of picture is necessarily finite, unnecessarily time limited, and it is a remarkable thing that that complexity has got so far that there are things in the universe that can think and feel and explore it, and I think that is the answer. If you want an answer to the meaning of it all, it's that, that you are part of the universe because of the way the laws of nature work. You are allowed to exist, but you're allowed to exist for temporary for a small amount of time in a possibly infinite universe.

Speaker 4:          01:31:07       One of the biggest mind blowing moments, I think, of my limited comprehension of what it means to be a living being was when I found out that carbon and all the stuff that makes us has to come out of a dying star, like that alone, that there's this very strange cycle of these enormous fireballs that forge the material that makes Brian Cox like what? That, that one alone that there is some strange loop of of, of biological life that comes from stars, which is like the most elemental thing that we can observe. We see these things in the school. You see the sun in the sky. It's this all powerful ball fire and

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       that that is where the building blocks for a person come from and they will be from the carbon atoms in our body that you're right. They all got made in stars because there was just none of it at the big bang. There's only hydrogen and helium tiny bit lithium to be precise but nothing else, and so it was all made in stars and it's probably from different styles. You know the acids in your body. They're not all from one star that cooked it and then died. There'll be a mixture of stuff for many styles in your body now, and I agree with you. The what more do you want? You know, when, when I see people go, I want more than that. I wouldn't. Yeah, it must. There must be more to it. What do you mean the, the, the we, we had, we were the ingredients now voltage were assembled in the hearts of long dead stars over billions of years and they've assembled themselves spontaneously into temporary structures that can think and feel and explore and then their structures will decay away again at some point, and in the very far future there'll be no structures left.

Speaker 2:          01:33:01       So. So there we are. We exist in this little window when we can observe this magnificent universe. Why do you want any more? I think too, people will. I think a lot of people aren't aware of all the, all the information, right? And then I think on top of it, for some people it's just, it's so overwhelming this, this concept of 13 point 8 billion years of everything to get to this point that we're at right now. It's so overwhelming that they want to simplify it and want to put it into some sort of a fable structure. Something where it's something that's very common and similar and familiar. Yeah. I, I, I agree. Um, and, but I think that's the, the is the, the, the journey that we go on, the real treasure. I think it is in that journey of trying to face the incomprehensible.

Speaker 2:          01:33:57       It's in that realization that it's almost, it's almost impossible to believe that we exist. Right. That's, that's, that's a wonderful thing. Yeah. And I think that that's what I think you miss out. I think if you decide to simplify it because you don't want to face that, you don't want to face the infinity that's out there in front of us and you don't want to face those stories as you said, that you look at your finger and it's ingredients cooked in multiple styles over billions of years. That that's a. to me, it's a joyous and powerful thing to think about. Yes, and I think you're missing out if you don't want to face that. Why I think the distribution of information has changed so radically over the last couple of hundred years and particularly over the last 20 that you're seeing these trends now or more people are inclined to abandon a lot of the.

Speaker 2:          01:34:54       Even if you remain religious remain you. You keep a a thought or a belief in a higher power. People are more inclined to entertain these concepts of science and to take in the understanding of what has been observed and documented and written about amongst scholars and academics and there's more. There's more people accepting that. Have you looked at the number of agnostic people now as opposed to 20, 30 years ago? It's, it's, it's rising, it's changing and I think there's also because of you and because of Neil degrasse Tyson and Sean Carroll and all these other people that are public intellectuals that are discussing this kind of stuff, people like myself have a far greater understanding of this than I think people did 30, 40 years ago and that trend is continuing, I think in a very good direction. Yeah, I mean, you know, well we should say is that science, we don't know all the emphasis, so we don't know where the laws of nature came from.

Speaker 2:          01:35:57       We don't know why the universe began and the way that it did if indeed at the beginning, so it doesn't know why the Big Bang was very, very highly olded, which is ultimately a show. And Carol actually you mentioned him often points out it means right, that they. The whole difference. The only difference between the past and the future so-called called Arrow of time is that in the past the universe was really old and it's getting more disordered and that's that, that, that necessary state of older, at the start of the universe, which is really the reason that we exist. That's the reason cause the universe began in a particular form. We don't know why that was so we, we, we will probably find out at some point and it'll be something to do with the laws of nature, but so I'm always careful. I don't want to. Science can sometimes sound arrogant, right?

Speaker 2:          01:36:51       It can sometimes sound like it's the, it's the discipline of saying to people where you're not. Right, and it's not the discipline of saying you are not right. It's saying this is what we found out. Yeah. So it. I, I liked to say that it provides a framework within which if you want to philosophize or you want to do theology or you want to, you want to ask these deep questions about why we're here. You have to operate within that framework because it's just an observational framework. So everything we've said is stuff we've discovered, it's not stuff that someone made up, right? We, we, we, you know, we understand nuclear physics, we can build nuclear reactors for example, so we understand the physics of stars. So we understand that the styles built the carbon and oxygen and we know how they did it and we can see it because as I said before, we can, if you look far out into the universe, you're looking way back in time and as you look back in time, you see less carbon and less oxygen. So we have a direct observation that in the earliest universe there wasn't any because we can see it and now we see that there is some and we

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       know how it was made. So I think it's so. It's important to be humble when you're talking about science and you're not saying this is the way that it is. I mean you are in a sense, but it's not. It's not able to answer ultimate questions at the moment is not able to answer even whether the universe had a beginning or not. We don't even know that. And I gave it to, um, I was asked to give a talk to some bishops in the UK about cosmology and I said, yeah, that'd be great fun. And so I went and I gave him this talk and, and, and at the end I said, I've got some questions. So if the universe is eternal and it might be, it might not have had the beginning. If it's eternal, what place is there for a creator? You know, that's, that's a good question.

Speaker 3:          01:38:44       We didn't, they didn't have an answer of course and eternal creator, but yet. But I think that these, it might be eternal and we might discover that. So we don't, we don't know at the moment, but we might. So I think my point is that these other human, a decisive, very natural to religions and natural thing, right? People you see all across the world and all different cultures. But I think that in the 21st century it religion needs to operate within that framework. If it's going, it's going to operate. There are still great mysteries and it is appropriate to think about what it means to be human and are giving you my view of what it means, but, but I don't think the problem comes when you, when you're your theology or your philosophy forces you to deny some facts, some measurement. Now these things that measurements, we were not saying, it's not my opinion.

Speaker 3:          01:39:39       The Universe is 13 point 8 billion years old. We measured it. It's like having an opinion between the distance from La to New York that you can't have an opinion on that. What it is and it's the same decided that the three things you notice is that people say the earth is flat or whatever that is, or it isn't, and we've measured it so it's just stop it, you know, so, but that doesn't mean you can't be spiritual and you can't be really just, I would say it doesn't mean you can't believe in God or gods or a date that's not ruled out by signs, but some stuff's ruled out.

Speaker 4:          01:40:13       I love the way you communicate this because it takes into consideration human nature. And like, I love Dawkins, he's fantastic, I think he's very, very, very valuable, but he likes to call people idiots. And the problem with that is people go, fuck you. You're an idiot. Like is a natural inclination when you insult people to argue back and to sort of dig their heels in and uh, you don't do that. And I think that's very important and I think that a guy like doc has just gets frustrated from all these years of debates with people who are uneducated or saying ridiculous things and he's a bit of a curmudgeon, you know, when he seems to be softening as he's getting older. He's an evolutionary

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       biologist. That's the, the front line in some sense, isn't it? Yes, it is. To think about particle physics is that you don't get a lot of shit because people don't understand what you're talking about. Evolutionary biology is right there. So I understand his frustration. Oh, I do too. Having said that, you know, I've kind of softened a bit over the years actually because now I think at this point, both in the US actually and in Britain and in some of the countries we are a, an a point you've sort of alluded to it where everybody's angry with a lot of anger and a lot of it's justified by the way you maybe we could talk about that, you know, income inequality and all those things, so it's justified anger. But it seems to me that there are people of goodwill who need to band together to diffuse the anger.

Speaker 2:          01:41:40       Now Society's otherwise we won't have countries like the United States is the United States because it's united and everybody and you've got the United States, the American flag there. You know, that there's a sense of belonging and identity and togetherness in a country in which you've got to preserve. And so I've stopped. Actually I'm picking. I used to, for example, quite enjoy picking fights with Deepak Chopra on twitter and it's just fun to laugh, you know, I need to do some crazy stuff and he's not. But I've almost, I've stopped doing it going well, but relative to some of the other people, it is a, he's a, he's, he's someone who means he means well, I don't agree with virtually anything he says. However, he's a well meaning person and so I've started trying to seek common ground now. That's why I get, for example, gave a talk to the Bishop, asked me to come here.

Speaker 2:          01:42:32       I don't agree with them on the framework, their theological framework, but they mean well, most of them. Yeah. So I think seeking consensus and defeating anger as you said, is it, it is incumbent on all of us, especially people like us who have a public voice. We need to diffuse some of this anger because otherwise it will consume everyone. Yes. I've, I've tried very hard to evolve in that respect and just get better at communicating ideas and get better at understanding how people receive those ideas. And I think that's why it's easy to get lazy and consult and to. Yeah, it's fine. It's fun. Especially me. I mean I'm a comedian as well. What I do is insult people, but for humor, I want to entertain people. That's the whole idea behind it, but I think in terms of like discussing ideas especially that are so personal to people like religion. I've, I've, uh, I've reexamined the way I interpret these ideas and the way I talk about these things. Yeah, there's a, it's interesting. There's A. I did a BBC program at age 10. I was asked to do it on the single reith lectures at the BBC. The BBC had done it is 9:52, I think it was. Then Robert Oppenheimer did them in 53, I think it was.

Speaker 3:          01:43:51       It's fascinating. You can get the transcripts online. They're free and you can get one recording of the five they taped over the other four. Can you believe it? Why they raised them? Because they wanted to tape something believable, but one of them existed oftentimes are giving these lectures. Oh my God. But you can read it just from Katie and bedroom. Wrestled him. The types over them. Don't read Bertrand Russell's [inaudible] tape is so expensive, but he talks crazy, but he's brilliant. It's called science in the common understanding and they weren't very well received because he thought he was going to talk about the Manhattan project, so they thought he was going to talk about the atom bomb, you know, because he was. He ran it basically, but he didn't. He talks about how thinking like a scientist, which means thinking in the way that nature forces you to think can be valuable in other areas.

Speaker 3:          01:44:48       And it's a. that's an insight in itself. The great thing, the unique thing about science, there's nature forces you to think like that. You can't have an opinion. Can I have an opinion about gravity region with building. You can hit the ground. That's it. It doesn't matter what your opinion is. And, and he said, so if you think about, for example, quantum mechanics, so sometimes you think of as particles electron, sometimes it has to. It's a point like object may behave like a little billy, a ball thing. The pool ball bands is around, but sometimes it behaves like an extended thing, like a wavy thing and nature forces you to hold both ideas in your head at the same time in order to get a complete picture of the object, the description of an electron. And he said that's the valuable thing about quantum mechanics.

Speaker 3:          01:45:35       You know, unless you're doing electronics or inventing lasers and you don't need to know this stuff, but if you want to learn how to think you, it's valuable to be forced to hold different ideas in your head. At the same time. It's really teaching you not to be an absolutist straight teaching you the example he uses his because he was. I think he was, had problems with mccarthy and all those things. Didn't he say you think he's still. He's writing in the fifties. So he said you can either be, you can be a communist, which in his definition would be that you think the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Right. So say societies, all that matters. Or it could be a libertarian or right on the far conservative and where you think that the individual is the only thing that matters and that's it, but actually of course, to have a functioning society, you need a mixture of the two and we can wait it one way or the other, but you need to hold both ideas in your head at the same time. And that's he said that one of the most valuable things about science because it forces you into modes of thought that are valuable. And that's what we're talking about here is I'm an absolute. Physicians are always, uh, uh, uh, just a, a blinkered sort of subsets of what's actually happening. You can't understand the world by being an extremist. You've got to hold

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       all these views in your head. Well that I find that so often on this podcast because I talk with people I agree with and disagree with and I always try to put myself in the head of the person that I disagree with. I will always try to figure out how they're coming to those conclusions are, where they're coming from. And I think it's so, it's so important to not be married to ideas. I got a conversation with someone about this and they said sometimes you change your opinions a lot. I go, yeah, I do. I do. Because if it's a bad thing, like I'm flip flopping. I'm not a politician, I'm not flip flopping. I'm thinking, yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Like I, I will have one opinion on a thing, whether it's a controversial thing like universal basic income and I'll change my mind 100 percent, two weeks, I'll go there and now I think it's probably a good idea.

Speaker 2:          01:47:42       And then I'll go back and forth. No, no, no, no, no. People need eight is cruel as it seems. They need motivation. They need. And I don't know, I bounced around with these things. Yeah. But I've tried really hard as I've gotten older to have less absolute opinions. Yeah. Yeah. If Richard fineman another great physicist or a similar, a similar time to open timer. And he also went to the Manhattan project and it's called the value of science. I think that was 1955. And they both shared, actually a, a, a surprise, I think, that they were still alive because I thought that the power they'd given to the politicians, the atom bomb would destroy everything they didn't think that political system would control it. And it did. So that's an emergency. Malcolm will thing. We're still here. But in, in, in that essay, he said the, um, the, the, the most valuable thing about science is the realization that we don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:48:35       And he said, he said in that statement equals science. Satisfactory philosophy of ignorance. By the way, you said in that statement is the open door, the open channel. He called it. So if we want to make progress, we have to understand that we don't know everything and we have to leave things to future generations and we can be uncertain and we can change our minds. And he said that, that, that is a great last line. I can't exactly what he says, but he said something like, it's our duty as scientists to communicate the value of uncertainty and the value of freedom of thought to all future generations. That's the point. That's what freedom means. Freedom, it means the freedom to change your mind. In fact said, that's what democracy is. If you think about it, democracy is a trial and error system, so it's the.

Speaker 2:          01:49:21       It's the admission that we don't know how to do. It therefore will change. Every four years will change. The president over the eight years will change the president. Why? Because the president doesn't know how to do it. Someone better. There will be someone better that comes along and then someone worse and someone better, but it's a trial and error system and he's right and it is right that that is the open door. That's that. That's the road to progress is certainly better than humility. Yeah. One of the things that I love so much about Bertrand Russell and about five was how human they were. They were very human means fireman, like to play the Bongos and chasing girls and Bertrand Russell was addicted to tobacco. He would talk about how he wouldn't fly unless he could smoke. Like he had to get us back when they had smoking sections on airplanes and he had his pipe and he just refused to fly without tobacco and couldn't imagine being without tobacco and like that's so strange because just a brilliant guy to be addicted to such a gross thing.

Speaker 2:          01:50:19       Yeah, you're right. Because I think these. These are people that found existence. Joyous, right? Yeah. We'll need to know. They just wanted to know stuff. Yeah. I didn't want to know everything because you can't know everything. Right. And I suppose that's what you think about what the job of a scientist is. It's to. It's to stand on the edge of the known because you're a research scientist, so if there's nothing to note, then you've got no job. Right? So you have to be naturally comfortable with not knowing. And I, if there's one thing I really do think we. How do we begin to patch our countries back up again? One of the reasons I think in education is to teach people the value of uncertainty, of not knowing it is not weak to not know. It's actually natural not to know. And that's one of them is with religion, is to say that you know, when you do not hard to say that you have absolute truth and absolute knowledge of something.

Speaker 2:          01:51:16       Yeah. When it can't really exist. Yeah. I mean, history tells us, doesn't it, that anyone who thinks they've got absolute knowledge is a causes trouble. Yeah. Did you see x marketer? Yeah. Did you enjoy it? Yes. Yes. I know. I'm Alex Garland. Sunshine over. That was right in 28 days later. And the new movie, the Weird One, the alien movie, he wrote that as well. Right? Um, dilation and. Great. Sandra. Yeah. Yeah. Um, do you, are you scared of artificial life? Artificial intelligence. And Elan Musk scare the shit out of me. Yeah. When he talked about it. Like he, he talks about it like we're in the opening scene of a science fiction movie where he's trying to warn people and then they don't listen to the genius. And it goes south, sort of depends. I chaired a debate on this society in London a few weeks ago and uh, they.

Speaker 2:          01:52:15       So it's true now at the moment what people tend to be frightened of a general ai's or Agi, they called artificial general intelligence, which is like what we talked about earlier, a human like capability thing. Yes. Um, and we're miles away from that. We don't know how to do it. We haven't got them and we miles away. So at the moment artificial intelligence is expert systems and very focused systems that do particular things. You can be scared of them in a limited economic sense because they're going to displace people's jobs. And actually, interestingly in this panel discussion we had, it's going to be like what you might call middle class jobs in the UK, so white collar jobs because people are interested in universal basic income to sort of replace money that it's going to be lost because there will be no jobs for all these people.

Speaker 2:          01:53:01       Otherwise we have just a mask attached. Yeah, they're very good. Someone said that these systems, artificial intelligence systems at the moment are very good at doing things like law lawyers work. So they're very good at reading contracts and things like that. There's interesting. It's a revolution, it's not like the industrial revolution. Where is manual labor that gets hit necessarily? This is kind of interesting because it hits that kind of intermediate level that usually escapes. And so you're right, one of the answers is to tax. There was an example was a robot tax. So in a car factory you say to the manufacturer, well, okay, you can have a robot, what you pay the robot the same as you pay a person and then that money goes into funding universal basic income or something like that. So I think there's got to be an economic change because these systems will be there, but all the experts I spoke to agreed that the idea of a terminator style, General Intelligence taking over the world is miles away.

Speaker 2:          01:53:58       And um, so whilst we might start thinking about the regulation, it's not going to happen soon, is the general point. I think. So I would disagree with him on that. I think. I think it's too far in the future at the moment. I think it might be one of those people that's an ad. It's going to be all right. And then then, you know, my iphone takes me out on the way to the. Yeah, that's the thing. It's not like choice at the moment, isn't it? I mean, don't, don't give your phone a laser, for example. And it doesn't matter if it goes crazy and tries to take over the world. I know, I know that's a bit facetious because they can see. He would say they could take other power grids and all that kind of stuff. Well, it's these concepts that are really hard to visualize, like Sora Kurzweil's idea of the exponential increase of technology leading us to a point in the near future.

Speaker 2:          01:54:50       Where are you going to be able to download your consciousness into a computer? You talked to computer experts. It like this. No Way. We're miles away from that. Neuroscientists, scientists. So you knew one brain cell, probably we can't, but Kurzweil's convinced that what's going to happen is that as technology increases and increases in this wildly exponential way where we really can't visualize it, we can't even imagine how much advancement will take place over 50 years. But in those 50 years, something's going to happen that radically changes our idea of what's possible and I think Elon shares this idea as well that it's going to sneak up on us so quickly that when it does go live, it'll be too late. Yeah, I mean it's worth putting the framework in place. I think the regulatory framework, even as you said, for the more realistic problem, which is people's jobs are going to get displaced and that there's a great, um, was at a thing in some segments that I come in and it was, but they said that the, it was a politician that the job of the innovation system is to create jobs faster than it destroys them.

Speaker 2:          01:55:53       So you've always got to remember that as a government and as regulators, if you're going to allow technologies into the marketplace that destroy people's jobs, it is your responsibility to find a way of replacing those jobs or compensate in those people, as you said, for the breakdown, social, human being, those that people need some meaning, like they just giving them income I think is just gonna mean. It's just my speculation. But it's going to create massive spare even if provide them, you provide them with food and shelter, they need people need things to do, so there's going to be some sort of a demand to find meaning for people, give them occupations, give them something, some task, let's say. It seems to be one of the critical parts of being a person. So we need things to do that we find meaning in, you know, like you were talking about were the only things that we know of that have meaning, that find meaning and sharing meaning and believe in that we're gonna need something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:56:57       If universal basic income comes along, I don't think it's going to be enough to just feed people and house them. They're gonna want something to do. If a, you know, a person is a, you're, you're doing something for an occupation and this is your identity. And then all of a sudden that occupation becomes irrelevant because computer does it faster, cheaper, quicker. These people are going to have this incredible feeling of despair and just not being valuable. Yeah, I mean, uh, what? Well, the utopian. So the version of this is to everybody gets to do what we're doing, now she's make a living. So thinking and creating that kind of, you know, so that that's the Utopian ideal is you don't need to do the stuff. The job that you don't really want to do in the factory, right? You can do the thing that humans are best at that, but I agree.

Speaker 2:          01:57:45       That's a very utopian view. Does everybody want to do that? Or does everybody have their mindset will maybe goes to education if everybody had an interest like that, if everybody went on to make pottery and painting and doing all these different things they've always really wanted to do and their needs are met by the universal basic income money that they receive every month. But boy, there's a lot of people I don't think have those desires or needs and to sort of force them onto them at age 55 or whatever it's going to be. It seems to be very, very difficult. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. It's a big challenge, but I think that in concept at least it's inevitable that we do have some sort of an artificial intelligence that resembles us or that resembles something like x mark and if people choose to create that, we could choose create it in our own image.

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       But that's very godlike, isn't it? God created us in his own image. Yeah. And, and again, yeah. I don't know that when I talk to people in the field as you probably are, most of them say don't have to do it. Yes. It's really, it's going to be miles away, so maybe I'm hiding my head in the sand a bit, but I don't think so. I think it's. I think we'll know it when I don't think anyone's going to do it accidentally, so I don't think it's just suddenly going to be upon us. I, I, I think we will see it will, we will see ourselves getting, acquiring that capability. We'll see ourselves getting close. We'll see their systems beginning to emerge and then we will think about it. I think 200 years ago, if you wanted a photograph or something, you want a picture of something you had to draw. I mean,

Speaker 4:          01:59:34       there was no photography 200 years ago. Yeah, I mean just think of that is almost inconceivable. No automobiles, no photography. What was automobile? Maybe there was some sort of machines that drove people around. Right? Something close. There was earlier than that, right? You go back 500 years, you have almost nothing. Yeah, it's crazy. How are we being quick? So fast. It's so fast. I mean, and then this, what we're doing right now, there's people right now in their car that are streaming this, so they're in their car and they're listening as they're driving on the road. Maybe they have a tesla, maybe they have an electric car. They're driving down the road streaming to people talking where it's ones and Zeros that are broken down and there's some audible form and you can listen to it in your car. That is

Speaker 3:          02:00:24       bananas. Yeah, I agree. We've been quick so quick. Well, I think that they will, you know, the Internet. I mean, it's uh, it's uh, not long. I mean I remember it being invented. Well certainly the web, so the web, while it was very early for me because I was in the, in particle physics and of course the web comes from certain, the www bit, right. So it certainly in the early nineties I was involved in that, um, you know, in, in the university environment with email and all that kind of stuff. So I don't, I don't know when it kind of didn't really. You could have, you could have a web browser that just the only sites that were there and Nasa and uh, I think NASA edited one of the early sites and cern. It was very loud. When did you become involved with siren?

Speaker 3:          02:01:11       So that would be. I started doing particle physics in 95. And when was, when did the large Hadron collider go live? That was, um, I remember it was 2000 and 2007. I think he was 2008 is so long ago. That was about 10 years ago. But he started out, we started off and then we had a problem with it and then it took a while to fix. Um, so hasn't been taking data that long, but it's a tremendously successful thing now and it's, it's operating beyond this design capabilities. It's quite incredible. And so stunning is an incredible thing that this, I mean, how large is it? How long has the largest is 27 kilometers. So I'd say about 16 miles. Sixteen miles. And it's a circular. Yeah, sort of a building. Yeah. Well, I say it's a big tube and mean you think basically it's mainly under France and partly into Switzerland and he accelerates protons around in a circle both ways that won't.

Speaker 3:          02:02:08       One beam goes well. My one goes either way and they go round 11,000 times a second because that's the very close. The speed of light. 90 nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine percent. The speed of light. And then we crossed the beams and collide the particles. And in those collisions you're recreating the conditions that were present or less than a billionth of a second after the big bang. So we know that physics, so going back, reset about the carbon and the oxygen, we can trace that story back way beyond the time when they were protons and neutrons to when they were quarks and gluons around and go all the way back and the Higgs on doing its thing back then and so we can see all that physics in the lab. So that's why we have some, a lot of confidence in that story.

Speaker 3:          02:02:54       It's so fascinating that they were able to talk someone into funding that, that they got a bunch of people together and that you, you were able to explain to politicians and, and you know, regular people, what, what you're trying to do. He a great example of how you get something done. So it was the night in the fifties when certain was established, I think it was 53 or 54, can't quite remember it. Something like that. And um, it was bill from the Second World War, so at the end of the war and it was realized that the only way forward for Europe was collaboration to rebuild the scientific base and in, for peace for peaceful purposes. And so certain was set up as an international collaboration in Europe initially with that political ideal that it would, it would explore nature, uh, just for, for the, for freely and for peace, for peaceful means, peaceful reasons.

Speaker 3:          02:03:55       And so that was, uh, the, the politics was right. So we set it by international treaty so that the member states are bound together by a treaty and they pay a small amount, relatively small amount each into certain every year, which is a percentage of their GDP. And that's the money they used to build the experiments and build the accelerators. So it's very hard to get out of it. And you wouldn't really want to because it's a small amount of money per country and stern doesn't get extra money to build things. It just takes his money and basically saved up and plans itself. But because it's got a regular stream of money, it can do it so you can say we're going to build this machine and it will take eight years because that's how much money we've got now, mobility in eight years and we know how much money we've got so we can do it you.

Speaker 3:          02:04:40       It's less than. I mean the reason that the US collider, the SSC failed is because it's the problem you have in the us with the funding system as you've seen in the last few weeks, is that it's very arbitrary and it's open to political maneuvering and things can be shut down and take an uncertain is not like that. Cerner has got a guaranteed stream of funding small from each country and so you can do these projects. And the one in the US that was during the Clinton administration is. I would. It was a. yeah, it was. It was it Clinton. It was closed down by Congress and a very slim vote and it was in Texas, so it was. It was one of those things where you've got states vying for money and he was half built and everyone was there, you know, the thing, it was bigger than the LHC and it was Thursday.

Speaker 3:          02:05:31       So you waste a lot of money. Is that a huge disappointment for scientific community? Like where people very hopeful that this was going to go live. It was being built. So it doug, half the tunnel. What would it be able to do that? The LHC could. It was a higher energy accelerated in the LHC. So it would have discovered the higgs particle first. Uh, had it been running, but the, the half bill part, is it useless now or can they charge it up again now? I think they filled in. I think so. I mean it was just half a tunnel, you know, that's the thing. You can do these wonderful things for not a lot of money if you just do it over many years now. Stable funding. Yeah. Commit to doing it. The filling in, in part slurry. And you look at cern as well, and people.

Speaker 3:          02:06:16       Yeah. People ask me now, I think the UK pays about $100,000,000 a year. That's what the UK pays in and it's about St Germany, same two friends and so on. And so people say, what do we get for that? I mean, first of all, it's not the whole budget seven is about the same as a budget of a medium sized university. So it's not a lot. It's about a billion dollars a year or something, which is what a university has. So there's not a lot in the scheme of things. Um, what has it done though? Well, we invented the World Wide Web, as we've just said, a lot of the medical imaging technology that we use comes from cern, is pioneered the use of these very high field magnet switch is what it needed. So it's engineering at the edge and engineering at the edge generates spinoffs and expertise to get used in other fields.

Speaker 3:          02:07:02       So it's cancer treatment, so called Hadron beam therapy. So if you got a brain tumor now, it's quite likely that you'll have one of these targeted particle beam therapies, which is like very highly targeted sort of chemotherapy. It's not chemotherapy radiation you can target in a beam into your head and attack the tumor and those, those are particle accelerators. So most pathway accelerators today here in hospitals and in medicine, but they came from doing particle physics that. So the, the, the of these big experiments at the edge of our capability are always immense, which is why they're worth funding at these very low levels. But it's not just the knowledge, it's the engineering expertise that there is a practical application for every everyday. They're always, it's just finding out how to do hard things is usually useful. The moral, and it wasn't just the Higgs Boson particle that you guys had discovered.

Speaker 3:          02:08:00       What is cork glue on plasma? Yeah. So that, that's um, shortly after the billionth of a second, after the big bang. So you end up with a soup of quarks and gluons quarks are the building blocks of protons and neutrons and glue onto the things that stick them together. And so a proton as to up quarks and down quark and in each and stu down quarks and up quark and so on, so that the constituents, the protons and neutrons, which are their constituents of our atomic nuclei and savy go if you get to very high temperatures, are high energies, then the protons and neutrons falter bits. Then you end up with a soup of quarks and gluons that's acquired gluon plasma. And it's insanely dense, right? Yeah. Well, very high energy. So, um, so you get that. So we've been exploring that bite. Could we.

Speaker 3:          02:08:48       We don't only collide protons together, we can collide a lead nuclei together or silver nuclei together at the LHC and that's when you make these kind of suit, civil nuclear matter, if you like, very hot nuclear matter to explore that physics to that and that nuclear physics. And I was reading something about the weight of that stuff that like a sugar cube. Like what, what is the, what is the actual weight, where defends our density is. So don't they? I mean, the, the thing I remember is the sugar cube of a neutron star material, which is, I don't know how many hundred million tons I can, you know, it depends, but. So I don't know where the quite glum plasma. I don't know what number you're. There was something that was one of the things after the discovery they were talking about the massive weight of court gluon plasma in like almost incomprehensible.

Speaker 3:          02:09:46       Yeah. Yeah. I don't know the number but, but something crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Now one, once these, you got something. Oh, here it is. Forty billion million. Oh my God. A cubic centimeter would weigh 40 billion tons. Oh, good Lord. I didn't know that. I don't know David actually. Yeah. The dentist matter. Creating the big bang machine. What are they doing right now? It's clothes for engineering and upgrades and upgrades. Yeah. I mean, one thing we trying to do is one of the things in particle physics is that you want as many collisions per second as you can generate and um, they have a collision wherever. What's got a bunch crossing Lhc, we can vary, but it's something like 25 Nano seconds depending on what it's really. We get a lot of collisions per second and the more collisions per second you can get, the more chance you have a make an interest in things like higgs particles or whatever else may be out there waiting to be discovered.

Speaker 3:          02:10:49       I mean, it's possible there are other particles out there that we haven't yet discovered that could be within the reach of the LHC and if this one that was in Texas had gotten built and it was more powerful than the Lhc, you'd have even more opportunity to do something like that. Yeah. Now when these things are created by these collisions, how long do they last? Oh, fractions of a second. So that the general rule in physics and particle physics is that the more massive it is and the more things it can decay into, the faster it'll do that. And so basically the, the heavy things decay into light things and so the only. The stable particles, things like electrons and some of the quarks and the up quarks and down quarks is stable things. But uh, so, so everything tends to decay very fast. So we're talking fractioned billions of a second fractions.

Speaker 3:          02:11:43       And how are they less than that? How are they registering it's existence. Like what is, what is being used to measure it? So what you see if you collide the adhc we collide protons together, then president, I've got loads of stuff in them, loads of gluons quarks. So yeah, big mess. First of all. So most of it's a load of particles or spray now we should not interested in. But sometimes when you, when let's say a couple of the glue on was banging together and they can make something interesting like a top quark or a higgs particle. What's a top court? It's not quite, it's a very heavy. There's six quarks. So there's up and down chairman, strange bottom and top farm and strange. So strange was literally in the, was it the fifties I discovered them. Someone said that's really strange and strange and new kind of farcical.

Speaker 3:          02:12:34       And so yes, we have six quarks and they're in three families, so the up and down or one family, and then the chairman, stranger, another family in the top and bottom of the third family. And so we for some reason, so the only thing the only fast because we need to make up you and me are up quarks down quarks and electrons, but for some reason there are two further copies of those which are identical in every way except they're heavier. So there's the charm and the strange quark and if they're in a heavy electron called immune, and then there's a the top and the bottom quark and another heavy electron call the tail. And that's it. So that there's this weird pattern that we don't understand. So we don't. Seems like you only needed the first family to build a universe. Right? But for some reason there are two copies now when the heavy ones decay into the lighter ones is the point.

Speaker 3:          02:13:25       So when you make them, they're not around very long. And just answer your question, what happens is that when they decay, throw their decay products out into our detector. So we take a photograph of the cascade of particles that comes from these heavier particles decaying, and the trick is to patch it all, look to see, to try and work out where everything came from. Wow. Now when they finally find these unexpected particles, then what happens? Then there's the study of them. Then there's the and everybody gets together and go, okay, what the hell is that? Yeah, what does that, what do we do? So we want to know where the Higgs particle. We know what it does is it gives them access to everything. So it's fundamentally the thing that gives mass to all the other things in the universe at the most fundamental level.

Speaker 3:          02:14:13       So, so electrons for example, and the up and down quarks. And again, a mess from their interaction with the Higgs. That's why they're massive. That's another reason we exist. You know, we go way back. We wouldn't exist if there wasn't mass in the universe. And the Higgs is ultimately responsible for that mess. And I keep saying, I keep caveat in it because then you get other sorts of masks that are generated, but, but that the fundamental basic seed is it where is from is from the Higgs and so what we want to know is we want to know how that thing behaves and the way you want to study it. So you want to make a lot of them so you can take a lot of pictures of it and study it a lot and see exactly how it does that. And so that's what we're doing.

Speaker 3:          02:14:57       That's what we're engaged in at the moment. We're making high precision measurements of the way that particle behaves so we can understand the laws of nature. I mean that that is the laws of nature. How are those particles behave and what are they doing. But it is possible that some new form of some new form of particles, something else could be discovered. Yeah. The we know about yet because we know almost know that there, there are other particles out there in the universe. We almost. No, because I think called dark matter. Yes. So we look out into the universe and we see that there's a lot of stuff there that's interacting, gravitation Italy, but he's not interacting strongly with the matter out of which we are made and the stars are made. So it, it, it's almost certain that that some form of particle that that fits beautifully and we see lots of different observations the way galaxies rotate and interact and even the oldest light in the universe, the so called cosmic microwave background radiation, we see the signature of that stuff in that light as well.

Speaker 3:          02:15:59       So we think that there's some of the particle out there and to be honest, we thought we would have detected it. I think at Lhc we have lots of theories called supersymmetric theories that make predictions for all sorts of different particles that would interact weekly with normal matter. And I. Yeah, I think it's broadly seen as a surprise that we haven't seen them the LAC. So that just may well mean that either they're very, they're a bit too massive, so we need more energy to make them. And we just haven't quite got enough. Oh, we're not making enough of them often enough to see them, which is one of the reasons we're great in the LHC. So we also looked for them by the way, I'm directly, so we have experiments and the mountains, we bury them in the, in, so the cosmic rays from space don't interfere with them.

Speaker 3:          02:16:48       And we're looking for the rare occasions when these dark matter particles bumpin. So the particles of matter in the detector, so it, so the idea would be this room's full of them. I mean the galaxy is swimming with that matter as far as we can tell, but interacts very weakly with this matter so it doesn't bump into us very often. So we're looking for the direct detection of it and we're looking to make those particles lhc. So it's everywhere, but it doesn't interact with us very weakly. Um, so interacts with the gravity and the, the, the, the archetype or particle that's everywhere. That doesn't interact strongly as a neutrino. So we do know about neutrinos. We've detected those. And there there is something like 60 billion per centimeter squared per second passing through your head. Now from the sun, so they get made in nuclear reactions in the sun, but they go straight through your head and then straight through the earth, pretty much occasionally one of them bumps into something and we can detect those cars were so many of them are going through, but we only, you know, I don't know, one or two a day.

Speaker 3:          02:17:55       And the ideas that dark matter encompasses an enormous percentage of the universe. Yes, it's five times as much matter is dark matter than is normal matter and the number is 25 percent of the universe. So it's roughly speaking, but five percent of the university's normal matter stars in gas, 25 percent is dark matter. Yeah. So that. Yeah, five, no amount. About 25 dark matter and about 70 is dark energy. That's the other thing. The other thing, yeah. So what the hell is that? I don't know know what it does. So again, what we talked about Einstein's theory earlier. So Einstein's theory, which works spectacularly well, says that if you put stuff into the university, we said before, then he walks and deforms and stretches and it very precisely telogy given the stuff that you put in it, how much does it stretch and how does it stretch and the the measurement we have is how stretching.

Speaker 3:          02:18:57       So so we we observed the thing we observe is how the universe is expanding and how the expansion rate is changing and how excited and how it's changed over time. So we have very precise measurements of that. So then we can use this theory to tell us what's in it given that we know what, how it's responding to that stuff. And that's how we discovered dark energy. So we noticed that the university is expansion rate is increasing. So university accelerating in its expansion, which is exactly the opposite of what we thought and this is in the 19 nineties that we discovered that so we can work out what sort of stuff and how much of that stuff you need to put in the universe to make that happen. And that's where we get these numbers from. And was there resistance to that when that was first proposed?

Speaker 3:          02:19:44       Yeah, I'm in it. My, one of my friends that Brian Schmidt and got the Nobel prize for that. And um, I remember I talked to him and he said, uh, he was a Postdoc, I think at the time, so young researcher and he made it. He's making measurements of Supernova, the light from supernova explosions, which is so bright that you can see them, you know, hundreds of million, billions of light years away. And he noticed that if you look at the data, the light is stretched in the wrong way. So we look at the stretch of light as it travels across the universe and the universe is expanding. It stretches the lights so it changes the color. And he noticed that there was a discrepancy, which we said that the universe, that the expansion rate is speeding up. It's been speeding up from, I think something like 7 billion years old.

Speaker 3:          02:20:28       So it's been speeding up. Um, so he thought that he's done something wrong because it, you know, so, so he checked it and checked it and checked it and he couldn't find anything wrong, so he did what a good scientist does, which he published it so that somebody else could find out what he'd done wrong. And he said that he thought it would be the end of his career. He thought I'd be a laughing stock and he got the Nobel prize because he was right. It is stretch. Wow. It's a great lesson. Means that if you, if you're sure that you can't see what you've done wrong, then you publish. It goes back to that thing about humility we talked about earlier. You know what we ultimately, we're not trying to be right. We're trying to find out stuff and so they're a good scientists will be really happy if they set out to be wrong because they've learned something now.

Speaker 3:          02:21:12       That's the, that's the, it's good that you take that path because he got the Nobel prize now when he received the Nobel prize in this concept started being discussed, what was the initial reaction to it? Well, it's, it's interesting because it's allowed in Einstein's theory and it was in Einstein's original theory, so it's called, it's got a name, it's called the cosmological constant, and that's, um, it's, it just allowed in the equations. And Einstein actually introduced it, um, initially to, because Einstein's equations strongly suggests that the universe is expanding or contracting and not just sat there. So even before we'd observed anything, Einstein had a theory that suggested that the university just not static and actually really strongly suggest that there's a beginning, right? So the, the theory itself on its own suggests that you can see if the university is stretching today, that he must've been smaller in the past.

Speaker 3:          02:22:09       Right now, everything must have been closer together. Let's say that, um, so that, um, as a man magical George Lemaitre, who was a, who works independently of Einstein, but the same time in the early 19 twenties before we even knew there were other galaxies beyond the Milky Way. And they notice that the, the equation suggests the universe might be stretching. Um, and so he wrote to Einstein and said, your theory suggests there was a day without a yesterday because he thought if everything's expanding now, then it must've been closer together in the past and so there might be a time when it was all together and he was a priest. So it's a Belgian priest. So I think, I mean I wrote about this now it's kind of mindset a bit, but I think that he was more predisposed to accept what the equations were telling him because a beginning, an origin for priest is really a nice thing because it tells you the creation event, it's an Einstein try to dodge it and put this allowed term into his equation, which is the, almost the stretchy tube.

Speaker 3:          02:23:12       So say, well if it's old, if it's all kind of contract in or something, can I put something in to make it stretch a bit to balance it all out so it can be eternal and you can't, you can't make it eternal that way, but eat. So he tried it, they took it out and cold it. His biggest blunder, taking it, putting it in his biggest funder, or at least some people think what he'd done was missed the prediction of the big bang. Really. So by trying to fiddle around to have a static universe that stable, he missed what the equations were screaming. His own theory was screaming to him, which is that no, the universe expands or contracts and he missed it. Right? So I think that's probably what he meant by biggest blunder, but in any case he took it out and then later in the 19 nineties it turns out the notes there, but it's really small.

Speaker 3:          02:24:06       It's tiny, tiny effect, but it's still dominating the universe now and it will, it will dominate even more in the future. So we think that we're in the universe that will continue to expand essentially doubling in size, a fixed timescale in which is about 20 billion years. So within every 20 billion years into the future forever, unless something happens, the universe will continue to expand and double in size to you. And that's the dark energy is driving them, but nobody knows what it is. It's the, it's one of the cutting edge, massive problems in theoretical physics and what is being done to try to get a better grasp of what it is. Um, and it's theoretical. I mean we're making very precise observations of it, right? But it looks like this constant, so it looks like it's basically one a number, if you like, in Einstein's equations and just really simple.

Speaker 3:          02:25:03       So it looks like it's something that may be a property of space itself, I don't know, but it looks like a very simple thing that doesn't change over time and just stays there so, so it requires theoretical advance as well. And so people are trying very hard to, to do that. It's so crazy when you go from Galileo to modern theoretical physics that they're still in the midst of this understanding of what all this stuff is. Yeah, I mean these, uh, you know, these are fundamental and difficult problems and we're talking about the origin and evolution of the universe. That's what it is and it, and tell us a particle physics. I mean, the way that these things, this stuff, we keep talking about this stuff in the universe, that's what the lhc studies he studies had the stuff behaves right now. These are, it's very theoretical, right?

Speaker 3:          02:25:59       They're trying to wrap their minds around what this is and what the properties of it or do you envision a time where you can actually physically measure this and, and have a, a, a real clear understanding of what it is and what its properties. Dark energy and I don't know. Um, I mean, for example, there are theories, for example, which should probably not right, but they're not necessarily wrong here. There are theories that try to link it to the Higgs particle. So the Higgs particle which we've discovered and can measure has some properties that we think the dark energy would need. And I'll this inflation I mentioned way back at the start of the universe, it has some of the properties that can do that as well. So for example, there are faithfully tries to link them. So we do have an observation of the higgs.

Speaker 3:          02:26:48       We can study that. So are they linked? Don't know. Um, but so it could be that we can study it even though it's a very small weak effects and it could be web direct access. Food is great. I mean it's just these are big mysteries that there's something really profound we don't understand about the way that stuff in particular. The Higgs actually interacts with space and time. So very naively the higgs should blow the universe apart just very naively. It's loads of energy in a very small amount of space and huge amounts of energy and the higgs field, but it doesn't do anything apart from giving to things. It doesn't seem to me it doesn't directly affect space, but everything else that you put in space directly affects it. So, you know, there are, there are kind of issues there that we don't and it just says we don't get it.

Speaker 3:          02:27:47       We don't, we don't get it yet. It's just another one of those. They probably late there. I, if I was to guess, I'd say there's some link there, you know, there's something going on and solving one of them might solve the other two inflation higgs dark energy something. How many people worldwide would you estimate are trying to grasp this and, and working on this? A good question. I don't know. I mean it's a, it's probably tens if that is tens of thousands, if you count all the people who work at cern and the particle physicists and a theoretical physicists, it'd be tens of thousands because

Speaker 2:          02:28:23       it's, it's so important to, for us to get an understanding of what's going on, but yet so outside of the grasp of most people including me, like I'm listening to you talk about this and I'm like, thank God there's people like you thank whatever, thank quirks because people like you out there that are doing this, but it, it's almost like you're speaking another language. It's so strange to me. Well, it's very new stuff, you know, I mean, even when I was at school and so when I was at university, we hadn't discovered the top quark and we knew it was there. We thought the Higgs might be there, but we had no idea whether it was, you know, so, so we were moving in my career, we're moving quite fast. Um, and yet you're right, these are the most fundamental questions about what, why is there ultimately why is the universe the way it is and even possibly why is there a universe right where we were away from that yet, but if we're ever going to answer that, it will be by doing stuff like this and this is all addressed in this live show that you're doing this world live show and certainly the, they also the consequences of the not the country has had knowledge, but the cosmology is terrifying that as we've started with.

Speaker 2:          02:29:45       And so I think it, as we've said it, it raises questions. It makes quite vivid questions that we all have about, you know, what are, what are we doing here like this? So I try and I think this goes all the way back to me. I'm really been into Carl Sagan. He always used to try this. You try, you try to link it to things that people think about naturally. Then that's why people are fascinated by this stuff because they do actually think about it. It might not be with the right names, the right words or the right facts even, but they're thinking about how did I get here, how did I come to exist, what is the future? Do we have a future? What was our past year? These, these are universal questions. I think there certainly are and the way you're doing this with your live show, you were saying that you have an enormous visual aspect to it as well.

Speaker 2:          02:30:38       We have a. we, we have the biggest screen we can get in every venue and it's led. It's one of the state of the art modern led screen, so they're like Lego and you can build them so you fill the venue with it so you know at Wembley arena than it's 30 meters wide by eight meters high. It's enormous. You must have a huge crew carrying all this stuff for 16 or 18 people and it's like a rock and roll show. Some of the venues, we do it in North America that in Canada that there are a bit smaller venues, but we just fill it with screen as much as we can get. And then the graphics, a lot of the graphics I, I have were done by a day neg who did x Makena actually an interstellar. And the reason I chose, I chose them, I rang them up and goes, please, please will you do this.

Speaker 2:          02:31:24       And they said, which one have you got? And you know, because it's way lower than Chris Nolan. Yeah, they did it. They were really, they just liked the idea of these messages and these ideas. So they, they use the software that they use for interstellar to create images of black holes and they use general relativity. They coded it into the so that graphic software, so they can rate trace lights around black holes and you can move the camera around the black hole and it traces the way or the light moves around it. So if you remember those amazing, the Gargantua, the black hole interstellar, that's, that's a simulation. It's not an artist's impression, is a simulation of what Einstein's theory tells us a black coal will look like. And so I can use that to talk about what happens when you fall into a black hole.

Speaker 2:          02:32:09       What would you see watching someone fall in and you can explain all that using Einstein's theory now, the idea that it's kind of a well known idea. It's a bizarre idea that if, if I was to fall into a black hole and you were watching, you'd never seen me fall in. You'd see time slow down my time, slow down as you watched me. So in the end I just slow down, slow down, slow down, and then I get frozen on the event horizon and just fade away as an image or reddening image on the event horizon. So time passes at different rates as you move closer to the black hole and faraway because space and time of distorted by the mass of the black hole. And so I can I talk about all that, but I talk about all that with this incredible image which we had.

Speaker 2:          02:32:56       It's so high resolution by the way that they. It was higher resolution than they're used for interstellar cause my screen's so big so we need a special machine to play it. You can buy the most expensive Mac pro in the world and it will not play this stuff. I love that. From a Geek perspective, brilliant. You have to have a special video player to play the damn thing. It was just like a series of CPU is all attached together in some sort of a super cute. Yeah. It's one of those is a big sort of visualization graphics. Things were, but these files, like you know, they don't. Twenty gig video files because there's so many pixels. The pixels. This is really geeky in it. The fix the regulation. Six thousand 400 by 15, 36, seven screens. It's a lot. Yeah, it's a lot. They're huge files.

Speaker 2:          02:33:45       Are you coming to Los Angeles with this? When the Taliban theater in May, the end of May. I'm there if I'm here or there it. Oh yeah, no, you got to come 24th of May. Oh, you're in San Diego as well today. I got to see one of these. Go to one of the. It's going to be great fun and however much stuff we can fit into those two handsome devil, look at that. Nice jacket on. Looking good. So yeah, someone gave me that actually of. Well, it's cool because cool guy. Cool guy with space behind you. Yeah. Wow. That's awesome

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       man. Well listen, thank you so much for doing this. I really appreciate you. Appreciate everything you're doing so awesome. No, thank you. I always enjoy [inaudible]. I loved it last time and people still talk about it when I was on last time. The more people ask me about meeting you than virtually anybody else will say get rid of because it's like 100 times more popular than it was back then. It's going to be very strange now, but thank you again. Really appreciate it. I can't wait to see your show. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Bye everybody.
