Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       real good experience.

Speaker 1:          00:00:12       Joe Rogan podcast by night.

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       Roseanne Barr. So bad ass. We had to stop this podcast. Really? We to start early. We couldn't, we couldn't even wait till three. We had to get it rocking. She came here from a volcano. Ladies, gentlemen, she lives on a volcano in the middle of the ocean. That's as gangster as it gets. You and Terence Mckenna, do you know he was. Terence Mckenna was this crazy psychedelic guy who lived on the big island. He had this giant property and the big island where he grew all these psychedelic plants. Most of them were actually legal to grow because, uh, you know, the government didn't know about quite a few of them. You never heard of Terence Mckenna know. So keep going. I will, uh, give you a lot of stuff before you leave that tunes into this guy. But he was, um, this sort of psychedelic bard. That's the best way to describe it.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       Just a really good speaker who had a deep understanding of psychedelics and of, of botany and the biology of these plants. And he also had some crazy theories about human beings. And evolution and his biggest one was called the stoned ape theory. Now I know that theory, but I didn't know it was from that guy on Mckenna and he lived out the last part of his life on the big island. He had this cool compound and used to bring people up there and do Iowasca with them. Just those books. That's like the third time I've heard about that IOWASCA. That's only the third time you've heard it on the big island in the last little while talking about this spreading everywhere now. But I think Mckenna is a big reason why it spread all around Hawaii. You know, he came to Hawaii, I forget what year, got some property and built a house out there on Mauna Loa. In Kona. Kona. Yeah. He had like a complete self sufficient system up there, like collecting rain water and they're all crazy up there and they're the most genius genius inventors. They were just incredible over there. The stuff they've done is like incredible looking there. So there's like, you know, so futuristic in their design. It blows my mind. Their designs are like space, like, well that's where the, the observatory is to Keck observatory. So there's a bunch of jeans. Did you go up there?

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       How, how's it haunted? In what way? Oh No, no, no, no, no, no. That whole Mana, Mana, k a mountain, you know, that's a holy mountain, you know, Hawaiian. But where they were born out of is that mountain Monica. So where they were born, they were born. Yeah. Like they, there, they came on boats, didn't they?

Speaker 3:          00:03:05       Well, yeah, in the more kaizens yeah. But it's like all one big Ole mindmeld thing, but the native Hawaiian people who like, I don't know how they got there, some say they came on those boats and uh, but they have their, their myths and their very connected to that piece of ground and they are very connected to, you know, Monica the mountain and uh, you know, they still have their same mythology and everything, you know. So I love to listen to what they say about, um, you know, the island and Gmos and power and there's some interesting thinkers.

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       What's one of the last free place is really, if you stop and think about it, it's, it's, it's America, but it's not really, it's five hours away by plane and it's incredible paradise as far as like nature. You know what? All of the islands, Maui, the big island, all of them, they're just incredibly fascinating and gorgeous and beautiful and,

Speaker 3:          00:04:10       but all that. Everybody says all that, you know, that's one way of putting it I guess. But to me it's like whoa. It grabbed me in the naval, grabbed you in the naval lab, my navel and we're not let. We're not cease to grab my navel.

Speaker 2:          00:04:23       That's one of your shockers, right? Isn't it supposed to be. Naval is one of them.

Speaker 3:          00:04:27       There's something, there's something around there that it's like a magnet thing. It's to, to a certain place on earth. I don't know. And it's like an energy lay lance and you know, you know, I, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:04:40       I do. I've written some of my best things ever in Hawaii on vacation where I don't usually write. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:04:46       I can right there. That's why I like it there because I can really right there. It's like your head is clear and, and your, you got your, you have your, your creative idea and you can carry it out and finish it. I can't never finish it, you know, but I can finish things there

Speaker 2:          00:05:05       while you are more at peace. There are things because because everyone sort of knows it's isolating. You also know that you really are on a volcano. This beautiful natural volcano.

Speaker 3:          00:05:15       Well, I went there because they got a goddess named Pele and that's why the last place on earth where there's like a, you know, a goddess so that it is active in people's minds and act also active inside a volcano might erupt at any time, which is, you know, um, what happens, you know, it's very sufi adjust, you know what I mean? Because it's like somewhere there is that which occurred that which, uh, is thought before it occurs. You know what I mean? And I really feel that they are, that you get your, you get your thinking, um, all lined up, right? And it's like you're connected to the earth. They're like me trying to my nuts out there, joe. That's been the fucking mindblower. Macadamias. Thanks. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:03       You're growing them, right? You have like a plantation or something

Speaker 3:          00:06:06       on them. The trees are grown up. I just pick them up, but I try to fertilize my trees and get it so that you can perfect the net and this year was quite a good harvest and uh, these debts are like, they're not like nobody else. They're not like any other nuts. I'm serious.

Speaker 2:          00:06:26       I believe you. I think you were actually a part of it. I bet you affect it just, just in that way

Speaker 3:          00:06:32       do ship for it. But it was like owned by the Dole Pineapple, you know about it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       They own the entire, like an island of Lanai, didn't they?

Speaker 3:          00:06:43       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. At one point in time at least. Yeah. Them and the University of Hawaii, they're all hooked up, you know, and they do do your genetic modification studies and such, which is very interesting to me of how, how they do all that and then create a pineapple that has lower acidity and stuff like that. I think that's interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       It's very interesting, it's spooky and it's interesting at the same time because it the implications of genetically modifying plants or are huge, they're very profound and they shouldn't just affect the people that are creating them and putting them out there. They're really worldwide questions and when, when you have people that are just getting away with doing genetic modifications on plants, not really sure of the longterm ramifications to the environment, to bs too. There's a host of different things that are affected by these things. These things.

Speaker 3:          00:07:33       Well, I thought that I got. I thought I did a pretty good checkmate on on Monsanto, which I called him once eight and I thought I got them in a choke hold like that bitch. You're talking about that fighting Ronda Rousey. Nothing compared to me. Wow. How dare I tell you? I put them in quite a nice headlock over there. What were they trying to do? Well, they were trying to pass a law or to get rid of a law which took a lot of work getting there to make law, which was to, you know, that the people, they're not want the GMO studies to continue on the island and uh, you know, so it was like you got to vote yes, but it really means now, and I mean it was like layer after layer of ridiculousness to protect public health and home. So I just started studying it and I realized that there they, they kept on doing that fake science thing that they do, but it's like, hey, science last more than 90 days. Genetic studies, proper scientific genetic studies they have follow through and they also have a control group and he don't, you come to a conclusion, you don't stop studying after 90 days. And then like actually like pay lobbyists to pass a law saying you only have to do

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       90 days. I mean gas, that's Satan, that's friggin crazy ass. Satan.

Speaker 2:          00:09:01       It's money. It's pure money. People wanting money over humanity. People wanting money over the possibility of damage. You know, we got to be really careful with nature, it's just there's been a million diseases that have occurred throughout the history of people and they come from a variety of reasons that come from a variety of sources that come from all sorts of different contagions. But we can create shit. We could accidentally fuck up and create something horrible and we could also, if we haven't already,

Speaker 4:          00:09:27       fucking atomic weaponry, there's the biggest fucking mistake anybody's ever heard of and make it and then they make it and then give every everybody 50 or 60 of them. Fuck, you know, I mean, the truth is that horrifying truth of my opinion. Why I don't go to parties because I do bump people out of certain fucking point, you know, I do because it's like, it, it, it's not a popular thing to say. It's all fucking over.

Speaker 2:          00:09:58       It's totally over. It's too late to a human beings have ruined the planet. Fuck yeah. See, I'm not convinced. I think we've definitely fucked a lot of things up and there's definitely a lot of hubris going on and there's a lot of scary shit going on. Like Fukushima, Fukushima is bad and it started at the, they just had a new um, studies showing that a lot of radiation started to reach San Francisco, you know, they've found a three percent increase in some of the tune of the radiation and tuna. It's scary shit, but there's also people eat fish out of there and yeah, I don't know who they are, but I think

Speaker 4:          00:10:30       we're all poison. Banged out over. Everything's fucking rotten. Poison. Fucking it's all dead. Is Dead. Isn't fucking doornail and too motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          00:10:40       It's not. It's time to let that thing go really serious. It's time to get real and do what fucking needs to be done. What needs to be done? Well, you got you gotTa fucking get busy. I've trying to turn it back so you've got to keep on rolling over yet it's not going to get better by you mean capitalist society, corporations, people destroying the earth, polluting all that shit. Nuclear waste. Is that what you're saying? By Roll it back?

Speaker 4:          00:11:07       Oh, everything that's lemming. It's time for months. Say, tend to become of used to the human race. That's just my opinion. They've got to come up with some kind of. They're going to do genetic studies. Okay, get rid of that. Get rid of that one. [inaudible], come up with some kind of an implant for people's teeth are brain that blocks that horrendous lemming fucking impulse. Do fucking humanity of favor and figuring out how we're supposed to get rid of that shit that we keep going along with what's killing us because we're too fucking confused to know what the fuck is really good.

Speaker 2:          00:11:47       Real, isn't it? Just that there's just too much to be paying attention to their own lives. They have their own problems, their own bills on family, and

Speaker 5:          00:11:53       then each try paying attention to global issues like genetically modified foods and farmers suing all across the world. The farmers in Brazil recently, one billions of dollars from Monsanto farm is in India. Commit suicide on an almost daily basis. I mean they have. They have farmers in India that are committing suicide left and right because of the debt that they get into these crazy deals. Bullshit. It's all been pyramid. They can't get out of it and they can't afford it, and that the whole thing is just a disaster. It's a disaster. It's a disaster that clearly has its roots in money. I mean, it's, it's just about heres the roads.

Speaker 4:          00:12:29       They're getting a payoff for the different various ways that people can get killed. They're getting fucking insurance pay off for killing people. Uh, you know, and taking bets on how long it'll take for them to die.

Speaker 5:          00:12:43       But on the other side, on the other hand, I think like the idea of genetically modifying food in order to help people nutritious food like golden rice and there's been a bunch of innovation as far as. Absolutely. I think that there's a lot of beauty in the science behind it, but I think we're going to be really, really, really fucking careful when you're playing around with nature to the money part is disgusting. The pollution of the environment. Disgusting. But when you started about talking about declining bee populations due to the pesticides they using in their plants, it's scary shit because if the bees go, there's a chain reaction to this whole thing. We might not like the end result of it. You got it.

Speaker 4:          00:13:17       Read up on that be shit. That's. That's a really interesting micro world stuff, but it's like all the stop. The African Queens, the invading African queens. Have you ever gone on there? Read them

Speaker 5:          00:13:30       kind of language. That was like really? Yeah. No, they were definitely afraid of African killer bees. They're afraid of that. That's not why they're killing these fucking piece. They're killing these bees because the pesticides are given them. Just killed everything. Not only that, there. There's a lot of patients are in business together. Work on both side of the street. You think they're actively trying to kill babies. I think it's just a side effect. Your solutions

Speaker 4:          00:13:50       kill a whole populations for a fucking kick back. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:13:55       You think they're actively trying to kill whole populations of bees, of humans, of humans, of life mentality. I don't think that. I think they're just trying to profit. I'm very positive. See, I told you guys bomber, you just very strong and very opinionated and it's all bullshit

Speaker 4:          00:14:12       and people better, you know, figure out how to make everything work for people. And everything could really work for all people. All the mechanism is in place. It's just like the, the, the crazy Trans Trans and bots that seat that are seated in, in those positions of power. They're not for like, you know, humanity. Yeah. Yeah. I agree.

Speaker 5:          00:14:38       I hundred percent agree. It does. Uh, the real problem is the idea of a corporation itself where you value the bottom line, the numbers over the humans that work there over the humans you affect with your work and because you can do it like that because you can send to place and shoot

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       mrs out of the sky because you can just sort of does choose to fuck over some country that you never have to visit and take, take away a lot of their natural resources and make them, force them into using your product because you have deals with politicians and kings and monarchs there. You know, just because you could do that doesn't mean that's the way you're supposed to be living your life. You have one life here and you could choose to be an evil fuck. Or you can choose to be a good person.

Speaker 3:          00:15:16       I always try to appeal to them to go, you know, you could rejoin the human race at any point. They all could. They could. They could like actually like make stuff, all that technology, all that. Everything that it took to create the science, the actual science of like a increasing food for people and all and like a desalinization of water and all these things that are so possible. Yeah. Just wasn't for just a few greedy Fox and they're and they're trons.

Speaker 2:          00:15:47       Absolutely. I've always said that if you could just take the amount of money that the United States gave to Halliburton to rebuild Iraq after we destroyed it and put that money in the inner cities in America and not have the ward not destroy anything in the first place, the amount of positive work that could have been done and the same amount of contracts could have been dealt out. We could. We could have all easily convinced the money that's been spent. It could effect on work. It still can. I think we have a better chance today than ever before. I think because today you have inflammation, you have information. It's being distributed in a way that no one can stop. You can't stop so far, but they stopped it. It doesn't matter if the people that are interested, they can. They are not big enough. There's not enough of them that would agree with that because they would turn against each other.

Speaker 2:          00:16:34       It's not like there's a cabal of three dudes that have ultimate power. There's thousands and thousands of people that are making decisions. Whether or not this gets censored, that gets censored and they're in cahoots against each other. That's a problem by the FBI and the CIA. The reason why portray us got kicked removed from office is the CIA was being spied on by the fucking FBI. They can't even. That's what all NSA spying on each other. For sure. Find out if he knows the shit. I Bet Poland exactly. We're caught up kind of runs on black male like, okay,

Speaker 3:          00:17:05       what is like? They fucking think they're like James Bond or something, but it's all like they all have to be dirty in order to blackmail the other side.

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       They're all fun. Crux, every goddamn blast. Fucking one of them will. There's certainly quite a few of them that are crooks and inside the system, I don't know any of them, I don't know them, so I don't know if they're crooks are not crooks, but I think if you were growing up in that system, people imitate their atmosphere, you get caught up in that wacky system and that becomes your reality and you think you're doing it, you know, also the side effects. No, I didn't see that.

Speaker 6:          00:17:39       I did what that insane.

Speaker 3:          00:17:42       Yeah. Well isn't it? That's uh, that's, that's like,

Speaker 6:          00:17:45       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:17:47       That was like fucking an unreal.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       But that's what, that's what they, they've just gone crazy ended jackal land. They left a human race. So it's people trying to do something, you know, they try to, when they try to succeed, they tried to get past this marker. They have a marker of 10 million. They want to get to 100. You want to get to a billion like that. They keep snorting coke to keep it up. You know, you ain't got to go farther and farther when the stock market. Well, don't be telling them about adderall because I got on adderall and it's the best fucking thing. Not saying there's anything wrong with it. I have. My good friend is on a. He a, a patch that he keeps on his leg. PROZAC. Yeah. It's got a PROZAC patch. Yeah, there's, yeah, exactly. Taking the adderall but they won't enter. You can't get. I asked what I'd love from us taking the adderall, but uh, the dropoff at the end of the day was too much for them. It was really starting to drive him crazy because he would feel great throughout the day and be very productive. And then you'd have this big dropoff well that's when you start your drinking. That's cocktail hour. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with adderall, but I am saying a lot of people that are getting a lot of shit done or taken adderall. No, she had cleaned out. Listen, I am sad.

Speaker 4:          00:18:58       I just cleaned out my closet, which I have never done in my whole fucking life because I can't focus to do that, you know? But like I said, fuck it. I'm, I might add plenty of fucking closet. I'm have shared in there from 25 fucking years that I was afraid to throw out. I counted. I had something like 1700 black plain black tee shirts.

Speaker 2:          00:19:23       Wow. How did you count those all? I woulda gave up after the first couple of hundred

Speaker 4:          00:19:31       because I was donating them. Wow. That's incredible. Wow. I'm, I'm not gonna do that again. That's when I. That was pre adderall behavior. That was pre adderall. Adderall made me see. Oh Shit. I had enough fucking black tee shirt.

Speaker 2:          00:19:53       So adderall gave you clarity on that because my kids are trying to get me off and why are you like math?

Speaker 4:          00:20:02       My fucking kids like that. I put through Rehab. He shared about my fucking. I'll tell me. He's like, no, it's not like I've never done math except for, you know, two times I was married to Tom Arnold. But aside from that, you know, I've never, I would never get into math. I think it's nothing like adderall.

Speaker 2:          00:20:22       I think they've got it down to where it's very effective for a lot of people.

Speaker 4:          00:20:26       I'll tell you one thing, it's real effective because I got the back and forth of everything, two way mirror thing going on all the time. It made me. I used to bite my nails so bad, you know, like a down to nothing because my dad, he did it too. And uh, and uh, uh, but I quit for a long time. Then I went on adderall and um, I started biting my nails and then I had to keep it down to only two nails that I could allow myself to buy it only tune, but it perfected my fucking nail biting

Speaker 2:          00:21:02       because there's like no nail left at all at all. They're really good at it. So good at it now. But you give yourself two nails. Do you have specific nails? Yeah, these two are my biters. So adderall let you save your other eight fingers essentially.

Speaker 4:          00:21:20       But it kind of forced me to do these two though. So it's got its good and bad, but I have clean closets

Speaker 2:          00:21:28       and you know,

Speaker 4:          00:21:32       to write scripts I was able to fly a fucking focus software. Yeah, that adderall stuff. Did you know Robert Schimmel? I did know Robert Shaw, I'm a great guy

Speaker 2:          00:21:44       who's a really, really, really good guy. Very, very funny guy. Very good guy. He was so funny. He had a heart condition and when he had his heart condition, when he was recovering from it, he accidentally took adderall and called his doctor up. I guess it was somebody else's and he mistook the bottle, wasn't paying attention and took the wrong medication. It took someone else's medication and so he calls his doctor up in a panic. Hey, I fucked up. I thought it was taking my heart medication. I took adderall. What am I gonna be okay, Doctor. Just like don't worry about it was the dosage. He tells me the dosage, you're gonna be fine. He goes, just prepare to get a lot of shit done. Robert said, he goes, I organize my notes in a way I've never done before when over stacks of paper and wrote them all down into categories. Totally fucked

Speaker 4:          00:22:27       I guess. I mean, it's so good like you can, you can write a script instead of like getting 50 ideas on page 10 and 10 scripts and then just fucking throwing them all in the garbage, you know, just the obsessive thing. You can focus it so that it, it's uh, you know, constructive.

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       I've heard people say that it doesn't make you very creative that it makes you get work done, but it's more like busy work done or things not creative. Things like that. Writing on it was not good.

Speaker 4:          00:22:58       This is just obviously a secondhand, but that could be, I don't know. It could be. Yeah. I can never say because things affect people differently anyway. Like I know people that smoke pot and they want to go work out and I didn't know people that smoke pot and they don't want to do anything, you know, and I don't know what that is. They get smoked the same pod and they have the one person has a sense of adventure and wants to put boots on and go to the top of a mountain and the other person doesn't want to do a thing ever. They want to play video games. It's who knows, you know, neural pathways. They're all different. We're so different. People seek some relief. And I, I, you know, I'm sure we agree. They, they, uh, they should have the right to, to the relief that they seek, uh, you know, uh, everybody, they should just legalize pot and like then I think all the troubles

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       would end pot and ham.

Speaker 5:          00:23:47       I really agree with you 100 percent. I think that especially people started eating it, they started eating, getting that self objective, self analytical experience, really intense experiences. People will be a lot less prone to continue a lot of their shitty behavior that I does. Mckenna's theory of evolution in the first theory. Yeah. It was all about psilocybin mushrooms and the rain forests of Africa, how the rain forest has had receded into grasslands and all this is proved by climatological studies, core samples and stuff like that. The time has been debated, but essentially what happened was the rainforest receded monkeys came down from the trees and started experimenting with different food sources and one of them was the mushrooms growing on calpads. Oh yeah. I've heard that you started eating psilocybin mushrooms and started having these intense ideas. I mean, it only makes sense if we get intense ideas from them and we're having advanced brain and a monkey gets intense and experiences from.

Speaker 5:          00:24:39       They obviously have intelligent brains mean. We've seen chimps do a lot of really crazy creative things. We know that the act impacts. We only hunt in packs were talking about like lower hominids getting a dose of psilocybin mushrooms on a daily basis. Of course it's going to have a crazy effect on their evolution. Of course it's. That's a, that's a big factor. It's a big factor in, in terms of thinking, you know, I and I completely agree with you that and Hampton, all these different things. If they were made available, I think we are lacking in self analysis and we're lacking as a society and our feeling of being responsible for the actions of the group and those are two things that you feel.

Speaker 3:          00:25:17       It's so arrogant too because it's like we just like ignore what everything means to other people. We, we don't want to know what anything means to other people.

Speaker 5:          00:25:30       We don't care as long as we can make money, like if you're going to go to the rain forest and chopped down these people, sacred trees and villages and force them to work in factories instead, if they'll. If they're willing to do it, then we're going to get them to do it because we want those trees. When we want that oil and whatever the fuck else is there that we can make medicine out of mean what they're doing is just stealing resources and we're letting them. We're letting them say, oh, this stuff, yeah, they don't live here. This is so what they've been in. These people have been there for thousands of years and say anybody who has eminent domain, tribal rights, that's what they're really after. It's crazy. They're trying to get rid of that separate. All people from like from nature. You can't stop people from having the ability to live a natural life just because you have guns just because you have tanks that stealing and if we're going to just let people steal shit.

Speaker 5:          00:26:15       If these people were there in the middle of the Amazon, that's their fucking home. That's their home. You have to be able to take into context. Their culture is culture of hunting and gathering. They're living in these, these cultures, the same way they've been living in some places like in the Congo and the in the, in the Amazon thousands of years it had been untouched. You can't do anything about that. You got to leave that alone. You know you have to because just as far as like for the sake of our understanding of ourselves, having like that with these ancient, ancient untouched cultures is so important. It's so fascinating. We can learn so much about the origins of certain behaviors, about group thinking when you were in small tribes that counter each other about how they dealt with injuries and medicine. I mean these are fascinating, fascinating discoveries to be had and instead people just want money. They just want to be able to chop the trees down. Fuck these weird people, take their shit and throw them in a cage.

Speaker 4:          00:27:08       You know, capitalism is like that. That's how it works. Unless you know, unless, unless human beings would brains, you know, get it under control as a tool of people and not its master, it'll continue to go that way because it requires that it requires gluttonous quarterly growth and there's nothing left but invest in people dying fast.

Speaker 5:          00:27:34       Yeah. They don't want to maintain, they want growth, which is ridiculous. Like at a certain point in time, have everybody kept growing. The world would be full. Like there's, there's no room, there's no room for everybody to keep growing a business in that regard. Like that being your primary goal. Not to be profitable, not to make money.

Speaker 4:          00:27:49       Well, I think these guys are stupid. Let me tell you why, because it makes no sense to me because, okay, I accept that they're greedy fucking pigs and um, I just think why can't they make that work for them and everyone else, why can't they be a greedy fucking pig? Because they're going to get like 10 times the fucking pay off. They will get even richer if they'll just listen to me make all the bats because like Wall Street and all that shit. That's just going to the casino, make all the bets about how fast you can turn a place, a green and sustainable, and how fast could that happen. A village, how fast could that happen and you know, they they could like use the same fucking ridiculous infrastructure that already exists to like make things better for everybody and could get the food to the hungry people because there's really. That's all it is, is the roads that get the food to the hungry people. That's 90 percent of everybody who's dying is dying because of waste and stupidity. Now, if they fixed that, they're going to get 10 times fucking richer, but they're not greedy fucking pigs enough. That's the problem.

Speaker 5:          00:29:10       All avenues as being a way to make money. Even avenues that hurt people, as long as they profit, that's the real problem. They're mad, they're lacking in humanity and that's why when you talk about pot being what could fix everything or psychedelics being what could fix things, that's the only thing that's going to bring humanity to a giant group. Think that thinks that it's okay to be completely diffused of responsibilities because you're a part of some gigantic machine that apparently no one can control now, so if you're a giant machine like Monsanto, this has been fucking over farmers for 100,000 years or however long they've been around for to that

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       to stop that whole thing. They're going to have to get the whole team high on mushrooms now, but it worked. Did it? Didn't you hear this that Monsanto said they were going to. Now they're going into pot. Did you not hear that? They're fucking good. They're changing their thing and and they have another name for it. Center just or some shit. You have another name for pot? Our new company. Yeah. They're going to own the patent on pockets where it gets really creepy. They tried to own patent on pigs. They tried to own pigs because pigs. I was totally involved in that argument. I was wondering because I was like, can you can, can we create a kosher pig that. That's an actual thing. There was an actual studies about that idea of patenting and then owning a life form is fucking ridiculous. Kosher pig though.

Speaker 3:          00:30:33       I think it would be really cute. It would be. You'd have to. Was Nicer, nicer stuff would look better. It wouldn't be clothing. What would it be? The genetically altered? What would be the other options? You want to keep it like they'd make a pig into a chow or something. I guess like they made a fish out of a tomato, you know that, right? I mean a tomato out of a fish. They put fish genes in the tomato to make it shiny in the grocery store. Yeah. No, they're doing a lot of weird shit like that. They've always been doing that. That's what I was saying about my farm, that Dole pineapple that my farm is where they did a lot of shit like that and here it is. Like I don't know how many generations later, but my fucking nuts are like, they're like walnuts. I'm telling you. You think it's because of the genetically modified dirt or something, whatever these fucking things. Three of them is a meal really? Is the perfect protein. How did you get involved in macadamia nuts? How this whole thing gets started?

Speaker 3:          00:31:41       God, well, I tried to look for a school to put for my kid because my kid, he's 18 now, but he was little and he needed to go to a school that had focused because I don't have any focus so I wasn't able to teach him how to focus or else he was born that way or some shit. But uh, I can't tell so I put them in that school. So then I went out, I went over and I found this school, so I went over there and I bought this farm site unseen. Really moved into it. What island? A big island. So there was a really good school. I knew it was elvis favorite island. I went there. And you know that that's where Elvis was. That's where Elvis? Yes. That's the spot though. If you've never been to the observatory up there. No.

Speaker 3:          00:32:32       They said don't go up there. No, because it could erupt at any fucking time. Really? Yeah. That an active, active Montello is active, right? Monica Monica is active. Yeah. I guess I think they give you a little bit of warning before it blows, but a return and a I just returned in the corner in my car just as it happened when it hit, I know it. I tweeted a picture today of a bridge falling apart of a, a road actually falling apart. Just some cracks in the road. A landslide. This gigantic. That's one thing you do have to think about. If you live in Hawaii, do you have to think about the fact that you're living on a volcano? Do you know? I'm not making this up. You won't fucking believe this is the kind of shit the atms to me and I'm not making it up. I believe you. I was sitting at my desk here where I live, you know, in the, in the marina

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       and uh,

Speaker 3:          00:33:30       I just hit send on something incendiary thing that I'd worked on all day. Fucking incendiary tweet that had z. was that perfect zero. You know what I mean? Right. When you get to the numbers, 140 characters, it's 1:30 fucking seven shit. Now I have to alter the top of it, like it for obsessive people, but I just hit sand and right then I felt an earthquake right on my fucking desk and I went on line and it was, it had hit Marina del Rey right where I was sitting where I sit and I'm like, don't fucking go crazy because I was alone. I'm like, don't fucking free cow. Run into the street screaming, knocking on their neighbors. Don't fucking do that. Stay in here. Get some emotional control. You've just lived through a fucking, you know, whatever it's called. The earth moving. Yeah. Earthquake. So I calm myself down. So I go back to Hawaii the first night there. There's another one.

Speaker 3:          00:34:35       I almost lost my shit. It was just beginning finding. Yeah. It's so terrifying. You think of all these people like you know, they're, they're just there and here comes a tidal wave and here comes a tsunami. I mean how, how vulnerable we are to all of these elements and why and stuff and people don't think about it. It's terrifying. Shit. You can have a fucking nervous breakdown over that when you definitely can. I mean, there's always going to be the problem that human beings die. They were very finite and whether or not we get hit with an earthquake or a tsunami or hurricane, we're going to die anyway. I know. That's really the terrifying part. Yeah. That's the one. That's the big one. And then you're sitting there all the time wondering how you're going to die, you know, like, are you upset? Are you scared of that at all? Do you think of that? No, not that much. No. The only, what I think about the big worry for me would be leaving behind my kids. Yeah. That would be the big worry, you know, making them sad. But uh, we're going to die. I mean, I don't want to. Right now I'm enjoying life. I'm pretty sure it's inevitable

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       unless something crazy comes along technologically over the next hundred years when that'd be cool. They say that it's there. I don't know if it would be cool because I don't know what's next. I'm not convinced that this is the, a one stop shop. Like we land in life and this is it, and this is, this is where our soul is, where energy is. This is the ultimate stop of our existence. Convinced why do you think you'd go after this? I don't know, but just the fact that this exists. Just the fact that this life that we live in where we can communicate with our mouth, where we can see with our eyes where we walk around and drive around flying planes. This life is so fucking insane and so crazy and bizarre and fantastic. Just this. The idea that this existence exists where we shut off every night for eight hours and completely vanished from the reality that we live in, and then we do it willingly and then we'd come back in the morning and we start all over again.

Speaker 5:          00:36:30       That alone is fucking fantastic and bizarre and strange. I'm not convinced that when we die, this ends. I'm not convinced. I'm not convinced that anybody dies. I'm not convinced that this whole thing is in just one series of wake ups and goes and sleeps and wakes up and go and while your conscious and while you're alive, I'm not convinced that you're in the same timeline that you were on before. I think we're Sam's. We could be. I mean that's what a lot of people far smarter than me are arguing. You could almost prove that we are part of some sort of a crazy gigantic computer simulation, but that might be what the universe is in the first place. The whole thing might be. I mean that might be with nature as we try to look at nature as being something that's, you know, this is rock and this is dirt and these are one.

Speaker 5:          00:37:13       Yeah, shorter until you break it down to molecules, the tear breakup time summit, atomic particles that exist everywhere. Patterns. When you break it down to like a genetic fibonacci sequence and things along those lines like that. You don't need any bigger mystery than this now as well. I know today, Charlie Helen, great comic. He died. He left the earth. I was just talking about him the other day with Jamie Masada, even aside from the laugh factory, was telling me how sick you have no idea. Yeah, he just went last night and boy, he was like a comic and a great person. Very, very good person. I've known that guy for a long time. It was always a very, very nice guy. Yeah, he was. He was. He's a good comic. Funny Dude. Native American to lug jokes about white people steal his land. He said. He Goes, God damn, I'm so glad you called because he's of here. Diane and all. I'm only here from a b list convicts. That's hilarious. Who's hyper you stopped in for guests at that he got. He goes, not because he said Jane and David and everybody had already called them, but he was still writing jokes, you know? Right in the very

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       end of it. Right enough. I can joke. Yeah. That was the way that guy was. He was fun guy. Very, very nice guy. Fun Guy to be around. Well, look at this again. Uh, what's happening with that? You know, the native, the native, the first nations people that otherwise people can't hear you. I'm sorry for drag it to you. You could drag it back to take a look at like first nations stuff in the United States and how that's just. It's very fascinating to be come more informed on that subject.

Speaker 2:          00:39:05       Yes. Essentially genocide. I mean that's essentially what happened to the native Americans. Their culture was wiped out. There were stuck into these small camps and fenced in and given these areas and those areas eventually became casinos in some spots. I mean, it's the weirdest absorption of a concert. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:39:20       They don't get any of that money. There's only a couple tribes that got any of that money. I believe it. Remember why that Jack Abramoff walked off with about $30 million from it at the bureau of Indian affairs.

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       No, I didn't know about this. Who is that guy? He's one of those banks, jurors that got caught and I think he got four years yet still all that. The bureau of Indian affairs money, $30 million of those casinos are fucking. The whole situation is crazy because it's not like it's all native Americans that own and operate those places. Other people are involved too that are profiting off of these casinos that are in places where it's supposed to be illegal. But in native American ones, because

Speaker 4:          00:39:59       they had me meet some of their, uh, native council or something. Yeah. You got in trouble. Yeah, because I go. I know you're, you're Italian, you're Jewish. I know you're, I know you're Jewish. I'm, I could tell that they were Italians and Jews. They weren't frigging native Americans. Native American. Did he have to be, do you have to be 100 percent 50 50 by the Roseanne Barr scale scale to scale of each tribe makes their own thing. It's mostly 50. Mostly 50 or it could be your grandparents to 25, but it has to be pretty 50 slash 50 like in Hawaii. One thing I think so cool is that they do have a lot of affordable housing for the first nations people there. You know, the Hawaiian people and they get, they're like guarantee of school and like they got, you know, Hawaii, the big island, Hawaii has a fantastic socialist state and you know, um, I think that it's just going to make the big turnaround real quick because China's just said no gmos, so we kicked their ass out. So now I think we're going to like have a boom, but we do need some of that technology because I think we want to grow organic seeds with help. We don't want to reinvent the organic seed. We want to grow organics with technology. So it's an incredible new, odd time of, you know, mixing the best everything.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       So what you're talking about is not genetically modifying the foods but using technology to more efficiently till the soil more officially irrigate the crops more efficiently, put nutrients into the ground, things along those lines, right? Yeah. That's stuff that works well. Not only that, the stuff that we know the cause and effect of, we know it's healthy. We know it's a part of the ecosystem. We know that there's just a rich biodiversity when it comes to any place where something's growing. There's bugs involved in rodents, evolved and BS. There's a lot of things involved. It's not just the plant itself. When you alter the plant, the real issue seems to be that you alter a lot of other shit too. And then of course, I don't know how much of this is true or not, but the idea of cross pollenization and people being sued because they have genetically modified foods growing in their, in their farms because of inadvertent cross pollinization.

Speaker 4:          00:42:26       I mean honestly, there's very few people who have only organic's really? Yeah. Most farmers there have a mix, but I think now it's been tilted to where it's going to become more and more, uh, you know, moving towards a 100 percent organic, no pesticides and this and that and the other. But in order to do that, you've got to reverse a lot of things. Like you can't let them be spraying overhead anymore. They can't be spraying aluminum and Barium all day if you're going to grow.

Speaker 5:          00:42:56       Do you, are you seeing you saying chem trails, the aluminum barium shit. You know, I did a whole Saifai special on the Scifi channel, a whole episode dedicated to chem trails and the more attention to it, the more I think that people are very confused as to what's going on. The government, I guarantee without a doubt has sprayed things on people. They've proven it. They've proven it. They did it. I believe it was Detroit. There was a recent thing they talked about doing it in the 19 fifties. They did tests to see what would happen if a, the Communists said came over here and did some sort of a nuclear attack on the population or poisonous gas attack. I, if they. They sprayed particles so they could track them. They don't know what the fuck that's going to do to people. They've done things where they've done done experiments on the. Whether they've done. They figured out how to cloud seeding by just doing it. I mean, they knew the science behind it, but it's not like they had a vote on the entire world and ask people, Hey, can we see clouds or what do you, what do you guys think? You know, no, fuck it. They just did it. The government has done things along those lines for a long time.

Speaker 4:          00:43:54       People think that they bring on earthquakes too and

Speaker 5:          00:43:58       yeah, we talked about that as well and aside fi show, but here's the problem. There is science behind those trails. There's a. You can track when it's gonna happen and when it's not going to happen and it's all based on the humidity in the atmosphere. That's what it's all based on. When you have a jet engine and it burns jet fuel and it's going through the atmosphere, it's creating moisture and in conditions where it's almost cloud like, like very hazy when a jet engine pass through this change of atmosphere and adding moisture creates a cloud. So when you see those patterns and people go, oh, they're spraying us. No, they're actually creating a cloud with the natural effect of a jet engine passing through a certain amount of humidity. That's why you see them in some days, but other days you don't see. No. It's just a natural side effect of jet travel.

Speaker 5:          00:44:45       Not only that, they've known about it since the 19 forties. In the 19 forties, there was a paper written by the army where they were asking what? What about these things that you see behind planes? They called them consistent condensation trails, persistent rather persistent condensation trails. They didn't call him contrary. I was back then, so they were trying to figure out what those things are and they realized that this is just what happens if you get an engine the past through the environment, burn fuel and create moisture that in certain conditions it creates clouds. See when people start talking about aluminum and Barium and all that different Shit, look, there's aluminum in everything. Not only that, the ground is filled with fucking aluminum and a lot of these guys that are doing these tests locally found aluminum in the water. When you look at their test, it actually says sludge, like what in the world are they spraying?

Speaker 5:          00:45:32       This is a conversation I had with the guy on the air. It says sludge sludges, dirt, dirt and water, and he's saying, look, there's all this aluminum in this water, and I'm like, that's not water. That's water with dirt. So what you're telling me is you did a scientific test that showed that dirt tested positive for being dirt because that's what it is. Dirt has seven, 10 percent aluminum in it, sometimes less, sometimes more. Aluminum is one of the most common things you can find in dirt. So when someone does a test and says, look, this aluminum is proof, they're spraying this guy's no fucking aluminum is a part of nature. It's everywhere. It's in the ground or not. If they were spraying it, why would they be spraying? Hey, what would it look like? Well, here's what it wouldn't look like. Clouds aluminum's heavy. If you spray it, it's much heavier than moisture.

Speaker 5:          00:46:18       Will you seen in those things in the clouds? Well, there's real chem trails. You know, one of the real chemistry. Let's hold on a second. They're burning fucking millions of gallons of fuel in the atmosphere that's real. Forget about this craziness of them spraying shit. Honest. It's going to alter our personalities. They're burning fuel in the sky and we all take part of this. You did to get here from Hawaii I did to get here from Vegas this past weekend. We're all a part of it, but what it is for sure is not good. You're burning fucking fuel in the sky. That's the real camp trail where you're seeing those cloud things. They're not spraying chemicals at a cloud. It's not some gigantic conspiracy that the whole world is in the dark about and all these politicians are in on and knowledge. Do you know how many fucking people would have to be quiet everyday on a daily basis? If they really were spraying aluminum on people and if they were spraying aluminum on people, it wouldn't look like clouds. Those are. They look like clouds because they are clouds. I've asked scientists, they said if you had aluminum dust, he sprayed. It wouldn't look anything like those clouds. Even Monsanto says that they are are they need to have a radio engineering

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       they need. They need a reflection because of what's in the soil. A reflection. Yeah. They need like to create a mirror. What do you mean? Oh, that's what it is. It's a mirror. Oh, you. You're talking about spraying the sky that Monsanto said that? No, they didn't. They did. No, it's a mirror. It's a mirror effect. People say this. I said, I know. I don't know. Those people are fucking. They can project the movie that they planned on fucking putting us all through the war. You're on an island. Too long going crazy. He goes nuts. That was crazy. Nuts and got your fucking mind warped. I know people say that, but people also say that all the leaders of the free world or actually reptiles, they also say that. Go that far. I'm glad. I'm glad you have a fucking. Aliens are common to those with the planet and a felon and all that. Whatever it's called. I don't go there neither. It's Nibiru is the planet and it's the Annunaki. No, no, no. I don't know. They do know

Speaker 5:          00:48:38       that there's something out way, way out far past Jupiter and past Pluto and they think that a bigger actually in Jupiter, they think it might be actually four times the size of Jupiter at least, so they think it might be a brown star, a star that's died out and they think that this source system where might actually be a binary source system. So it's a brown dwarf star and I'm apparently there's as many binary star systems as there are, um, with, with a single star. There's a lot of them. It's like super common. And if that's the case, that makes sense for a lot of things including pluto because Pluto's a small, it's not really a planet, like that's why they stopped having it be a plant anymore. They realize it's a part of the Kuyper belt was this huge belt of, of objects way out at the edge of the solar system.

Speaker 5:          00:49:23       But that there's a thing called the galactic shelf. This is big dropoff afterwards, which would indicate there's something absolutely massive just outside of it. This is all butchered science, but I'm not a scientist obviously, but so they think if there is a planet out there as something out there that these people you know or trying to describe that more likely, it's like a brown dwarf star, but it's no people on it. It's just a giant mass of something. I think there might be people, well, there couldn't be somewhere. If there is us, if there's us, there could be somewhere. The real problem with the alien thing is that everyone you talked to that says they've met aliens or they know aliens real. They're almost all fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:50:05       Almost. Almost 100 percent. So hard. Weird. It's like, I don't believe I don't not believe in aliens. I absolutely believe that aliens could be real. Just like I believe in spiders, spiders, spiders are fucking crazy. You ever met an alien though?

Speaker 5:          00:50:20       No, I don't believe so. I mean I might've. I think if you're smart enough to come here and be an alien, you're smart enough to also take a human. I mean we have fucking camouflage that we put on jets where you can't see them on radar. You know, we have hunters that were clothes that looked like trees. They stand in the. No one even sees them. Look, it's real obvious. They could pretend to be a person if you're so smart, you could get here from the planet. Fuck yourself a billion, trillion light years away. Why can't tend to be made on what if they're less than less than than me. They're called

Speaker 4:          00:50:52       now they are bought and they are created and programmed and set upon innocent people from our government and this government from the the government of the beast,

Speaker 5:          00:51:04       the government of the beast, so the money behind the whole wholesale. The other problem with that is they're not smart enough to make that, so you'd have to get people smart enough to make that. And the consensus science right now is not capable. A Bot like that, the consensus science right now, it's not a fake person. That's bullshit. No sex dolls. They're close, but it's not going to trick me. Well, that's just what they're showing you, but they're 50 years ahead of that shit. They. The problem with that kind of thinking is the people that are in control, so they have the whole Republican think sewed up forever, the people that are in control or not smart enough to create all this stuff. This stuff has to be created by scientists, the scientists. It's all documented stuff like everything that's being done. All the stuff that's being done today is all based on the technology that's been created by geniuses over the past hundred years from Tesla, Edison on down the line, all these different people have added their campaign contributions and is a very clear line between how these things get created, so when you have all this fantastic stuff like giant televisions and satellite Internet and all this, there's a direct line that shows how all this stuff came about, but yet they can't sell gay, clean water or food to the hungry.

Speaker 5:          00:52:14       Not that they can't, it's just that they haven't figured out a way to make it so profitable that it's more profitable than than destroying the environment and stealing people's resources and leaving behind horrible pollution because that's profitable. That's the way they're doing it. The real problem is that the corporations are allowed to act like this, that individuals become a part of the corporations. And then what is it?

Speaker 4:          00:52:36       No, I really want to say this is how you're going to be at, you know, jump in there. But uh, you know, uh, oh. I think I lost the thought.

Speaker 5:          00:52:46       No, I did. I lost the fuck fucking what you were saying was that what I was saying that you reacted to was that they need to figure out how to still remain human and that the problem is when you have a corporation, you have this big giant group of people that's allowed to act in and make money without any consideration mentioned. Didn't say

Speaker 4:          00:53:06       yeah, because it's government. The government that they hate and they all talk about, oh, well we out have a big government and they're all on government money. While they're saying that the replay. Oh, all of them. Everybody who hates the big government is sucking on the t to big government and that's their job. They're getting paid to go out there and say, we hate big government.

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       We need to keep government in check. But government is the thing that keeps that shit in Czech government is the only power that people have. Government is the way, and there's no, there's no loss and it has to be a bunch of corrupt fuck fucking people that are for sale and whores and shit. There's that. Eat the law. It could actually be people who understood what being a true representative of the American people means. I think we should start a, um, America. Here's my solution because I like to think of solutions rather than just yap about problems like the left and the right because they're fucking idiots who can invent anything. But, um, you know, I, I think we could fix everything, uh, in a real big fat fucking hurry. We could fix the economic system if we want it to. Well, we just put fucking regulations on it. All the things that existed, you know, before Reagan took them away and sold down the fucking river, just put them back.

Speaker 5:          00:54:23       Did you ever watch that documentary inside job? Yes. Fantastic. Because wasn't it great? Yeah. Terrifying. Terrifying and fantastic. And the guy who got on coke, they're the fucking guys in the wolf of Wall Street. Yeah, exactly. And the guy who created actually give him some credit right now I'm Charles h dot Ferguson. And he's, he's awesome. It was a really fantastic job. He did. It was just a brilliant and insightful view on how these problems occur. Who Profits, how these people that start out as people who are the educators who are recommending the economic, uh, professors that are recommending certain standards and those standards get passed and these guys wind up getting giant jobs with the banks that profited from them changing the regulations. It's fucking madness. It's just shelving. It's on everybody's face. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:55:13       Well they get off on that now for the, they, they, you know, they used to like hide net with their secret organizations. But then they made a big change once they started on that cocaine, then they like to put it in people's face and they kept coming with it and it's like not just put in their face but bend over and spread their ass cheeks and rub it right on your nose. A vacation house. They are, they are just like, sure they can get away with anything and they have been allowed to get away with anything. Not Wireless fucking ever been arrested.

Speaker 5:          00:55:43       I think that's what's going to change and I think it's going to change because of the Internet because this information was all hidden before we use this same type of behavior. It's not new. It's not that it just erupted in 2000, whatever. It's been around forever. You know? We have the direct line that we learned about the kind of regulations that Reagan had stopped and what, what happened from then to the Bush administration. We know all that stuff now, but they just moved while it was all going on a private

Speaker 3:          00:56:10       pockets, so that's the short of it. They made laws that made it possible for them to do that, but this is so incredible about it is that it seems that, and this is why I ran for president because it was like when are they going to put a a, a, a, an American person, like a working American person in a seat at those tables where money is apportioned. Well, that ever happened,

Speaker 5:          00:56:41       you mean a person that represents the average person, the average,

Speaker 3:          00:56:44       the of the public of John and Joan q public. So I think we should start a, I think that should be the name of our corporation of Americans ink and that we should apply for a privatized contracts like everybody else is doing.

Speaker 5:          00:57:05       So America, ANC being, you know, there's a friend of mine that's starting a business, a more of an avenue rather for, for people to fund politicians the way corporations have been funny politicians and to encourage politicians that are responsible and ethical and that you could profit from that just as much as you could profit from having worked for some evil corporation. And that if you got like sort of almost like a kickstarter type thing to, uh, to represent like strong ethical position.

Speaker 3:          00:57:34       But anytime you put money into it's going to be wrong and suck ass.

Speaker 5:          00:57:38       But if it's all transparent, the idea being, if they're not representing a corporation that's going to profit instead, they're representing people that want more activity and ethics. See the money, there's profit. You see what I'm saying? But you see what I'm saying though, like people would be willing to contribute and then someone else will control your system though. But I don't think it would be their system anymore. It'll be our system if it was done correctly. What I'm saying is that our system would be different than the system right now because there wouldn't be a need for profit. So the need for profit exists now where you, you get the politicians take the money from the corporations, the corporations give them money because they want profit. This would be people giving them money because they want ethics and morality and a healthy society. So I think the, so much money comes from taxpayers as it is to have that be an option instead to have it. People donate, people that really care about it, donate a certain amount. If everybody donates a little, it would be a staggering amount of money out of 300 million people, right?

Speaker 3:          00:58:33       I, yes. And See, I've gone to therapy, um, you know, there, there, there is the public common wealth and uh, you know, for people who do pay taxes and they should get something back for the taxes they pay, that's the whole point. Right? And it should be in the form of hospitals, schools, uh, clinics, free legal advice. I mean, that's what you pay your fucking taxes for healthcare. That's why I get paid for roads and other things too. You certainly don't pay your taxes to subsidize somebody whose statement from you

Speaker 5:          00:59:14       100 percent. I agree. I not only that, I would take it a step further and say community centers should be mandatory in almost community where kids can go with they're protected, where they can learn things, where they can learn sports and skills and games and places where they can, you know, we can educate in inside of communities. I think that will be just like a gas station should be a normal part of every sort of, uh, any sort of city or town. And it should be funded, should be funded by the government because it's there to improve kids. And did there to improve people, but education free as fuck across the board, straight through the university all the way to the end. We should pay for that. We should make it, we should make it tough to get into. You have to work hard. But it's fucking free.

Speaker 3:          00:59:59       Education. College education was free in California before. And that's a first thing. Reagan got rid, of course. Yeah. He was governor.

Speaker 5:          01:00:07       I'm not shocked and that should be free. Um, college mean we can't encourage laziness, but we can certainly support people that want to learn and make it so that it's less of a thing. I mean, one of the reasons why good doctors get so God damn greedy is because they got a fucking huge bill behind them from La, from medical school. So many people go into by the time they're into office, they have these giant fucking. All these kids that are

Speaker 3:          01:00:30       getting out now, they're in a big old financial hole. You know, they're in a whole. And what it means is, I mean this is just part of the scam and all that was like, as their parents signed, you know, where their house is, houses away for the education, then they come and take the house. Hello. It's just a big frigging Ponzi scam. It's the shell game times a million.

Speaker 5:          01:00:49       Well, it's even more of the shell game when it's obvious that when you find out that the banks actually banked on people faulting on their loans. Yeah. Defaulting people falling apart and being held their homes repossessed. They actually banked on that, profited off of it.

Speaker 3:          01:01:03       That really pissed me off because it was like, you know, you know, then what that means is like, you know, what that means in terms of cost, real cost, not bullshit paper cost, but real customer community. That means a lot more little kids are getting going to get beaten to death. And it means a lot more little kids are going to get trafficked. And you know, uh, I do think the poverty, just putting that on people. So you can have a, you know, gambier fourth mistress and another, uh, you know, it. Endangered Species. Kate.

Speaker 5:          01:01:37       Yeah. Said she saved the best content in the history of the Internet. Give you a fourth mistress it endangered species. K, what kind of Cape would you make? Like, like a human skulls to stitched all together as a class when you walk in virgin blood vials dangling around your neck with clocks. Tramp. That's a real baller though. If he's got four mistresses, guys responded. But until you see, um, like my boyfriend always says whenever we see a,

Speaker 3:          01:02:09       you know, when we're here in California originally a rich old fucker and is, you know, strip or wife. And Johnny always says, that is

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       proof that our currency is sound.

Speaker 2:          01:02:25       That's funny. Proof that our currency is sound. That was actually very funny,

Speaker 4:          01:02:31       but you know, I mean, when you make everything for sale, you know, pretty soon. Yeah. Money doesn't mean anything. That's why I think they're such fucking geniuses. Here's how fucking stupid they are. But they think they're smart. The Financial Wizards,

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       the smart guy, the smart guy, the money guy, the money guys.

Speaker 4:          01:02:54       Yeah. They're so fucking stupid. They, they make everything at a certain point it's going to hit a wall and end and they put that right in there too. It can't go on. It's not sustainable. It's going to crash and you're going to fucking get caught. But I think that's what they like because they're so sociopath's. They liked the fucking people over parts so much. You know, they just keep denying that there's going to be a reckoning, but of course there is, and that's already happening. I fucking reckoning right now on Wall Street and everybody knows it, but nobody talks about it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:30       Well, I think that's just what people do. Norton or ordinarily without logic and without, without enlightenment. That's what we do as far as what we do as far as the pollution of the environment as far as global warming. You're right, you're right. People would not do that. You're right, because they will factor in the true cost. Not the. Not the one in the books that you have to cook. Oh, I'm 100 percent agreement with you, but I think that the consequences of their actions or just something that like, Eh, I'll deal with that eventually. Yeah. They don't think they're like engineering this, this idea of infinite growth. Hit the wall.

Speaker 4:          01:04:03       Yeah. And, and they fuck over like all the old people and everything. They fuck over every and then right away, what's the first thing they do? They start working on the other side of the street. They go to Rehab, right. And they, then they come out, you know, I've been sober for 14 days and then you have, I have

Speaker 2:          01:04:21       to like say Goddamn fucking is such a hypocritical. And then they go and they, they work to try to stop corruption. That's my favorite. Expose corruption and write books on this is. It's all like so crazy. I think though that the. See what I'm saying is that I think people do shit when they think that. It's like why do people smoke cigarettes? They know the consequences or cancer. They know they're going to get it. But then eventually, but the smoke right now is better for me than not having a smoke. So I want to write down the consequences. Fuck it. I'll deal with them later. And I think that's a lot of times when people are saying when they're, when they're creating these sort of laws that allow them to. The concept of infinite growth doesn't make any sense. It doesn't work on paper. There's only a certain amount of resources, a certain amount of space on earth. Like if you just keep counting numbers, you're going to run out of space. I think they're going like, this is shit is over now. As much

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       as I can grab that advanced, I think what people are doing is just doing what people have always done. Acting without that much concern for the consequences because they don't have to deal with the consequences right now. It's like when, when you get up in the morning and you know, and you look at, this is a cake from last night that looks so delicious and it's right next to like all your fresh vegetables that you were thinking about making a hemp protein shake with. I, I get a lot of times to go for that cake. You know why? Because fuck it. It's right there. You know, I know it's bad for you. I know it's sugar. I know I'm going to feel like shit later, but right now I'm going to feel good to feel good when I eat that red velvet, own yummy, yummy, yummy.

Speaker 5:          01:05:54       And I think that's what these folks are doing that we're not gonna do that. If your intent is to, you know, lose two pounds by three days from now, you're going to fuck. You know, you need adderall. But I don't really go for the cake. I'm pretty healthy. But what I'm saying is it's an instinct if, well it's a lower instincts based on the Peter Principle and all that shit and the peanut peanut. What's that one penis principles. That one, I can't think of. Whatever can go wrong will go wrong. Whatever. Is that one? I can't remember. Um, what is it called? You know what I mean? Yes. Maybe it's broken my brain. I normally have that right there. It could with a slight alternative. Murphy's law, Murphy's law, Monsanto could fix murphy's law I was using. It can be confusing it with Moore's law. Um, I wonder, Monsanto could come up with a chip, a chip or wherever, but you know what they would do with that chip?

Speaker 5:          01:07:02       They would just fucking deload your brain and turn you into a robot. That's what they would do. They've already need to be turned into robot. The NSA came out today. There was an article that said the NSA has 100 percent access to iphones. They can look at your camera, read your texts, listened to your microphone, like, keep your microphone on. Even if your phone is off. Is that a surprise to people? Um, that 100 percent access? That's pretty fascinating. The thing about, and this is one of the reasons why our podcast sponsors sponsored by Ting tings, a company that uses android phones and what I like to get an android. What I like about android phones. Yeah, you've got an android. You can take the battery out so you can shut it off. Not saying that the government is really listening to you, but the idea that that's possible that anybody can just turn your microphone on it anytime or turn your camera on at anytime.

Speaker 5:          01:07:52       To me sounds ridiculous, but we know that the NSA has that capability. If you have an android phone and you just take the battery out, can't do that with an iphone. I found some weird, a lot of weird shit about the iphone. The memory is all in there. You can't get it out. The fucking the batteries in there and can't get it out. No accidents are dying. Know people are dying. Making those killing themselves. You know what's hilarious about that? I had this conversation with guy who was trying. I have a friend than not a good friend, but this guy that I know that always tries to give me the republican point of view on things like he's a sensible logical guy, know we were talking about this factory in China where people are jumping off the roof and he goes, well, do you know how many people are working at that factory?

Speaker 5:          01:08:30       And uh, I said, yeah, I just like about half a million people or something crazy. And he goes, and if you look at the average population of a half a million people, the amount of suicides is pretty standard. And I said, yeah, but they're killing themselves at work. How many fucking people killed themselves at work? Like that's not standard is nothing standard about that. That's ridiculous that that concept is ridiculous. Idiot talk or say it's like a fucking a tower of bullshit. There's a lot of people that don't want to be silly though. You know what I mean? They want to be sensible. Come on.

Speaker 4:          01:09:04       We have enough fact and data now that we can make informed decisions. W W we have enough stuff to make informed intelligence, intelligent decisions that work for the, you know, the p for everyone, not just the few at the expense of the many but for everyone and um, you know, that I feel like, hey, you know, yeah, we're on our way out and everything's fucked up and dying and over, but I think it's our Karma to fucking do it right this time because, uh, you know, helping each other and such, you know, trying to, um, take a step back from needing so much and being more into sharing and new thoughts, new solutions, solution based thinking and stuff. I think this is a great time for that and we're, we're really evolving into that and people can't back away from it anymore. So it's not over. Well, I, I think that, you know, I do think it's over first humans, but I think that when people get that in their head, it's going to make them really mutate quickly and go, oh my God, uh, I better get right with my maker and actually start fucking doing some of the shit that I know is, you know, the right thing to do just because I'm a human being. Right. I think that's happening.

Speaker 5:          01:10:23       I think that's happening as well. That's why I have hope. I think that's evident in what I read online. I mean even points that I don't agree with the extreme left points, the extreme progressive positions, which a lot of times I don't take those positions, but I liked the fact that those positions are really public now. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:10:41       what I like is how the left. Uh, I like how I like to watch it on twitter, you know, I like how the left light goes, right for character assassination, but then, you know, that's what people do when they've lost the argument.

Speaker 5:          01:10:55       Add homonyms. Yeah. Well, you know, sometimes it's, they're good points though. It's a good to consider how fucked up someone else before you listen to their point of view on something. If you know that they're kicking babies in their spare time, it's probably something to pay attention to. I know what you mean though.

Speaker 4:          01:11:07       Yeah. Like, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm just trying to say like, just because somebody, you know, they're trying to. The real thing is that they want the monopoly of definition. That's what they're after. That's the real war. They want things to mean what they want them. That's a very good try to censor people who are saying something else.

Speaker 5:          01:11:27       That's a very powerful statement. What you said, the monopoly of, of definition. That's so, so true. And I've never

Speaker 4:          01:11:33       tried to censor that debate in a free society. We have debate which has more than one opinion. Yes. Your mindset. I'm like Monsanto Science. It's the same mental thing and uh, you know, uh, it's a rigid ideology. Yeah. And it makes no sense. It doesn't, it doesn't apply data and fact as it, it doesn't directly apply data and facts.

Speaker 5:          01:11:57       What's also, I think there's a lot of these people that are involved in both sides, whether it's the conservative movement for sure, or the really progressive movement that are really just assholes that want to get heard. I really just love giving their opinion and they love the attention that even if they have a point,

Speaker 4:          01:12:14       well that's part of MK Ultra mind control. You say it is what I liked that. How many times do you use the word binary because that it is a binary. And uh, what Mk ultra does is it's like these two groups there, they're like, you know, they both work for the same people. They both get paid from the same people, the Democrats and the Republicans. And what they do is they use monopoly. They tried to monopolize the definition so they can fundraise. And I say it's like the fundraising. Those parties are the fundraising arm of the prison, military media, wedding, industrial complex, you know, I mean, they just want to confuse people so that people vote against their own better judgment and their own best interests. And that's their strategy. That's their whole mk alter strategy. How they get people to stop thinking that they deserve an answer and a solution for the tax monies they pay. That is what the tea party was originally about before it got waylaid by punk ass hoes.

Speaker 5:          01:13:21       Well, isn't that what always happens? So occupy Wall Street, they said at one point in time they think that one of the three people in occupy Wall Street was really like FBI. They're really like some undercover agents. They infiltrate and doesn't that happen with everything that happened with the tea party as well. The people that thought that the tea party was like, look, we're gonna demand a responsible government and a government that follows the constitution. Then all of a sudden these crazy Fox got involved in racism and nuttiness yeah. What better way to diffuse a movement then to make to marginalize them by making them look ridiculous? Well, they do send in their people and I'm always have always will

Speaker 4:          01:13:57       monopoly of definition again. And it is that. Then they can control their own opposition and you know, you know, that works at that work. That's how power does it.

Speaker 5:          01:14:08       That's what ideologies due to the monopoly of definition that you described, which is such a great phrase again. Um, but that, that's, that is the issue with the left. That's the issue with the right. That's the issue with having teams is like you decide that this is how we look at things and how we look at things is how they are.

Speaker 4:          01:14:26       Well, uh, the left does it for a certain reason because that's how they fundraise out of like the, like the leather bags, like the Democrats begged for money. It's like we need $3 by midnight. Have you gotten those emails are not a part of that list. And uh, you know, they're begging for money and the Republicans, like they begged for money too, but they demand it, like they have the right to it because its sovereignty that they're defending but they're not. They're frigging yanking people to get their money. That's all they're doing. Both of them. They work together. They are a system of mind control that helps them move public money into private pockets. It's so fucking ridiculous. I mean, I feel sorry for people that they have been so manipulated and you know, all the time they're losing everything.

Speaker 5:          01:15:22       Yeah, no, it's horrible that it's. It is, it's a, it's a disgusting aspect of human beings and a weird thing where we're tribal people and I think ultimately we have that instinct to be a part of a group and when people are part of that group, you see this group think is so strong. It's so prevalent. I've had conversations with people about anything. I had a conversation with a guy who I, you know, before this conversation I respected them online will about um, abortion where the Richard Dawkins it said that a, um, a fetus inside a woman's body is like less human than, uh, than, than a pig is, you know, I go just as human as a peer, that Dale Carnegie Book, it was just a weird. It's a weird statement. And I, I, I took, I tweeted, well, that's silly because everyone knows that a fetus can become a human being.

Speaker 5:          01:16:09       All right? That's the idea behind the abortion. Like you're being very disingenuous if you pretended the idea behind the abortion isn't that what you're doing is you're stopping a potential human being. A pig is not, you're not going to stop. It's going to become a person. It's not. It doesn't turn into a carriage or a fucking pumpkin. Alright? It's a pig of a fetus is a part of a person that has nothing to do with a woman's right. To choose the woman's right to choose as a completely different time. So he starts calling me a Republican and saying like, you know that I, I don't respect. Isn't this all about controlling a woman's body? Like. Absolutely. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:16:40       No, they want you to say what they are saying. Yay. They had a bunch of fucking.

Speaker 5:          01:16:46       And they want to diffuse anything that you're saying that might be logical. Their economies to. There's a lot of that. It is

Speaker 4:          01:16:52       like, um, you know, you know it. It's just like, it's going to go my way or the highway. We don't allow you. To me, it's like this. We don't allow old women or open their fucking mouth and in the general theater. Excuse me, bitch. That's what it feels like to me. So that's why I just go, well, you wait a minute, wait a minute.

Speaker 5:          01:17:13       Well, with this guy that I was talking to, I don't think it was that. I think it was he was just following the ideology. You, you're always supposed to support a woman's right to choose and you're always supposed to marginalize any, uh, anything that would point to the idea of abortion being a bad thing. And I'm saying they're not mutually exclusive. Like I think a woman should be. We'll do whatever she wants to do with our body. I can't control that, but it does get crazy when you're talking about a boarding, an eight month old fetus. I mean, at what point in time, when does it get crazy? It's not crazy when it's a group of cells. I agree. You're pulling out a group of cells. Is it crazy ones that big? Is it crazy when it's that big? Is it crazy one? It can exist outside of your body is. I mean, I don't know

Speaker 4:          01:17:51       this, but to say that this is not a discussion for today. Huge, a huge subject. It needs a lot of debate and you know, you have to look at what's being censored and there's a reason why it's being censored.

Speaker 5:          01:18:02       People are uncomfortable with it. There are also uncomfortable with their decision that, you know, they want to be able to have an abortion. Then if you say, well, okay, you know, you're killing a potential human being. Like, oh no, no, no, I'm getting ringing some cells. Okay. At what point in time has it become a person is that's an actual conversation. I think that's a real conversation to, to pretend that it's not, is a part of that whole ideology thing. It's a part of that thing where people as your fucking phone going off your kids going, mom, the CIA's at the house.

Speaker 4:          01:18:30       Wait a minute, I just got to say I'm on the radio. I'll call you. Are you okay?

Speaker 1:          01:18:40       Wait,

Speaker 4:          01:18:42       I told him I was going on here anyway. Sorry. It tells a fucking stupid and it could like. It has a simple solution like for people like me, like we we think different than other people, but we can see that there's a simple and much cheaper solution to all of these problems. You know, if if logic, data and fact are applied,

Speaker 5:          01:19:06       I think there are being applied now more than ever before and that's why I have hope. And then also I think this idea of teams of a Republican left wing Democrat or Democrat, left wing Republican, right wing that's looking more and more silly every day, especially when you look at Obama, there's so many people that fucking support Obama and don't say God damn thing about the shit that he's done in comparison to the shit that we're on Bush about the same stuff, same stuff, and all these liberals have proven to be massive cowards by not coming out against him the way they came out against Bush on

Speaker 4:          01:19:38       million different things. They may be. You have to look at what happens to you when you do that. You know how it works. Twitter activism as it's called, it's just character assassination. You ruined fucking people's lives because their opinion isn't in line with your sanction opinion that you were paid to get out there and lobby. You know, I mean, seriously, people's lives are ruined if they stand up against power. Let's not forget that.

Speaker 2:          01:20:06       Oh, for sure. If it's a massive amount of pallets after whistleblowers. Now isn't that fascinating that he, in his case, the campaign website, there was a whole thing about giving whistleblowers relief and, and helping them expose injustices and then they yanked all that shit out. What to say though? They knew who they knew, you know? What do you think does, what do you think that is? Do you think that once you get into office they just, they let you know what the real deal is. You can talk all that shit you want while you're campaigning, but once you get into office then you find out what the fuck's up.

Speaker 4:          01:20:42       You know, I think it's the system. The system is what's corrupt, that people are just stuck in the system. I think if the system were changed, if you know, and it would have to be changed by the people and the People's government, the people's application of there. Well that would result in accurate government, you know, for the people. I think, you know, I think, I think without that it will continue to replicate no matter who's there because it's stupid and it doesn't work. It's fucking passe. It's obsolete as time for fucking, you know, to stop defending what's already fucking dead so you can yank people and get them to send you fucking money. You know, I think we should just be done with money. Serious W we don't fucking need money. And you know what? People don't need gold either. They need water. So let's make water the new fucking currency or something. Oh, let's move away from it. It ain't that hard. It's not that hard to create a fucking just economic money system. It's still have rich fucking people too. How do you have rich people have this no money? Well, you know, you know, you would have other means to create Commonwealth and so some people would accrue more,

Speaker 2:          01:22:07       but it wasn't about the money when that would be necessarily. I completely agree with you that the system is fucked and I think that patching it up is like taking a, a windows 95 computer and trying to make it work in today's Internet and fucking adding a bunch of shit to it and tweaking. It's a broken system. Throw it out and get a new one. We're smart enough. We get enough smart fucking people that they can put something better together. We could do a lot better in a big fat fucking hurry if we shut the fuck up and mind our own God damn business. Stay home once in a while and uh, you know, clean up your own back fucking yard. What do you think is the best example of a working government in this, in this planet? Is there one country that really stands out as really having their shit together? Norway or Sweden. I'm like an Iceland because I'm always like, what the fuck am I going to go look around? But I sign, yeah, because because

Speaker 4:          01:22:59       they, they dumped the Fed and then they started arresting bankers and doing something different and they got richer for doing it because they're not imposing a system of dead on people there are doing something smarter and you know, I mean, you know, I just have hope that that would happen here because we could, we could nationalize the Federal Reserve and solve, solve all our problems was saved the dollar. But I mean nobody will frigging do it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:26       Yeah, I know. I agree with you about Iceland as well. I think that is also, if there's an example of a one country that can do it, those are people. And so that's a better. That's a clear example that your, what your statement is, that the system is corrupt. Well that's proof right there because you're seeing a system that's not corrupt and the people are benefiting from it and it's a healthy society.

Speaker 4:          01:23:45       People, everything will work just fine. Everything knows what it's supposed to do already. If you just get the fucking people that are, you know, fucking it up out of the way. And the best way to get them out of the way, in my opinion, is to remind them that they can rejoin the human race. They don't have to be on that other side. And you know, in that limbo exile thing that I know they live in because I've seen it, they can rejoin it and then fucking come up with a solution that actually works. It ain't that fucking hard. I think people are doing shit like grandmas, all of this world. They're fixing their community with a rubber band and a paperclip. It's not that fucking hard to have everything work. Well, the default position of the universe is to the positive. Everything fucking already knows what to do except for, you know, criminals at the top, a small group of criminals at the top.

Speaker 2:          01:24:36       I think you're a hundred percent right. And I think that I like in our society that have like an alcoholics personality, someone who's trapped in a terrible pattern keeps repeating the same problems over and over again and drinking and driving and know just fucking killing their body. I think that that probably is how our society is, that we've got addicted to the idea of extracting money out of this broken system to the point where people are so addicted to money and so addicted to the benefits of having it, that they're not willing to say, hey, you know, I'm a part of something that's ultimately destructive even to me and to my children.

Speaker 4:          01:25:07       That gambling mentality, this people think they're. If people think they're getting something for nothing, that's like the greatest frigging drug. They, they disguise what it is, but it's thinking you're going to get more than everybody else.

Speaker 2:          01:25:22       That's so true that they'd love. People love getting over, don't they? They love it. They love getting over. I have a friend that will like try to get bargains on fucking everything and I'm like, dude, you have money. Like why are you haggling over, you know, an extra $20 off or something or $5 off or whatever the fuck it is. Because I like getting over. I just like getting over. He goes, if I can get it for free, I'd want to get it for free. Like people want to get free and they're rich. They do. They want that thrill of figuring out how I got rich. So I know firsthand how it works on you. I know exactly how it works on you, I'm sure. Yeah. Well, and it works on you. It does tell there's, you know, there's nothing left of you. And that's a

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       hard. That's a hard thing. That's hard when you can't fucking stomach get no more, but then you can let go, oh, I'm going to not do that no more.

Speaker 5:          01:26:12       You was, it hard going from like not having money to be in like one of the richest women in the history of Hollywood over a period the world over a period of how many years?

Speaker 3:          01:26:23       Uh, three years. That's insane isn't it? Was fucking charging right away. When I first came to La, my first night there, like they saw me that I got a TV show the first night there. Then I got the tonight show, then I got a Julio Iglesias tour that was 10 times the money my husband worked in the Boston office ever made. So, you know, I mean, it was chaching right from the get go in La dream come true, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:26:55       Wow. And you were one of the old school comedy store gangsters till you came up in the era where things were probably one of the most powerful errors in the history of standup comedy. If you go back and look at like the origins from Lenny Bruce Harland, to what have you, your era of the comedy store is one of the most powerful areas ever.

Speaker 3:          01:27:16       Yeah, it has. But there was one that proceeded me that, that was the one where, um, you know, they had the strike and all the comics. I mean, there was a like, oh, David Steinberg and you know, those guys, they're like in their seventies, late seventies now. But a whole bunch of guys like that. Um, Oh God, I'm so bad on names. I remember us. But you know, I'm a whole Elayne boosler just a little bit before me. They, they were the ones that created it broke down, you know? So they did great work.

Speaker 5:          01:27:48       Great. Yeah. For folks who don't know, the way La Works is, for the longest time nobody got paid. You would go up and you would do spots and the clubs, would it be packed every night and the comedians will be starving to death, especially the local ones that are just sorta start now, but they would be providing, providing all this entertainment but not sharing any of the profit. And this, the comedy clubs weren't willing to budge. They, they were like, look, this is the way it is. There was a book that is written on it, right? Irish should fear was reading it recently. I forget what it's called. See what you find that Jimmy. Um, but the, uh, the strike itself was, was very important and now comedians get paid for their sets. It's kind of weird that they would think that it would be okay to have people perform and you profit off them performing, but you keep all the money.

Speaker 3:          01:28:34       Well, we saw that in Denver too. We had a, we had a little club there and everybody worked for free. And the owner's like, start buying second homes and you know, I'm dying up here. That's the name of the book. Oh yeah, I have that. You know, when you see the owner who's another comic and he's buying a second house and uh, you know, adding on to the club, you're like any still doing time on Monday

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       on. He's still working in the club, you know, I mean they think they're doing you some good by letting you performed. That's what they said to us. More like, you know what you're going to pay. And because they won in La, they did. So it went all across. It went all across the country that, that ripple of that. But the idea behind is pretty fucking gross. And you know the adjust because the comics are benefiting from it. What you're not like that is your whole business. Well that's profit sharing again and commonwealth and all that same stuff at any club owner that will do, that's a piece of shit. And he club owner that wouldn't want to compensate the comedians that are performing from. I actually think that you're going to get them to work for free while you have your place packed every fucking night.

Speaker 2:          01:29:41       It's disgusting. Like you don't feel they're going to get a lot out or they're going to get famous, you know, that's like all artists in Hollywood know. I mean anybody who can put two words together, you know, they, they'd rather not pay you a dime of writers, musicians, songwriters, you know, they want to own everything now. They got their copyright laws, they want on everything. Some people do, but there's one of the beautiful things about small clubs that I've always loved to, you know, if I'll do like xannies in Nashville or something like that. It's like the club owners, if you go to these places, like they actually liked the art form. They will. It's a good exchange. They enjoy it, you know, the, the, the enjoy the idea of having performers on the stage and the people have a good time and that their business flourishes.

Speaker 2:          01:30:25       They're happy to pay you. Well, you know, there's a lot of great comics out there getting old now and you know, they don't have any money and there's a bunch of shit like that. They gave their whole lives for comedy and they didn't get rich like I did, you know, and a few of us, but they're just as you know, they're great writers, great comics, but you know, you get broke down by that system, like all artists and creative people do well. I think we're a lot of these guys too though. They're also very, woe is me as a quote. Quite a few of those guys that never figured out social media, they never figured out how to promote themselves. They stop writing new material and then they, they feel like I've been doing standup for 30 years. I can't sell at a club. Well, well, what did you do?

Speaker 2:          01:31:03       I mean like what did you do with your time? Like how much of your time did you actually invest in continuing your career? How much of your time did you actually invest in writing and how much did you just think that it was just due to you? Because you've been around for 30 years. I thought it was just due to me. You sound like my representatives now. Well, for you, you know you. I've said it before the show, but I'll say it afterwards so other people could hear. We were talking recently about 10 of the most influential comedians of all time and you are our list and I appreciate that. Thank you. It's 100 percent true. It's an honor to have you on the show. In fact, I think that you came along and you were this new type of woman stand up in the ways. Even more powerful than kinison was as a male standup. You came along and you had this whole new thing going on and you were a woman who didn't give a fuck. Like you don't give a fuck what anybody says. You gotTa fucking tell him and he's going to say like, shut the fuck up. This is what I feel. This is my fucking

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       husband. And you would. You were slaying with this material because nobody had ever seen that before. I remember thing was my mom who told me about you pretty sure. I'm pretty sure it was my mom because my mom, she likes to stay in her sixties. Yes. And she likes stand up and uh, I think she was, I'm almost positive it was her, but she's like, you gotta see this woman? Oh my God. She made me laugh like no woman has ever made me laugh. But that statement, like it was a different kind of a thing. Like she said it that way. I mean she was just, just trying to say how much he enjoyed it, but that was a true statement. Like she made you laugh in a way that you never laughed at a woman comic before you just, you owned it. Were a lot of these women who came before you. Although we're very funny. They wanted people to like them and you were like, fuck you guys.

Speaker 3:          01:32:49       I learned it. I mean, you know, I learned that on stage. I'll tell Ya. I did learn a lot of it from my dad because my dad was just like that. He was like one of the funniest ones ever. Really? Yeah. But he had to get a job, you know, because he had kids. So, but uh, and he did some funny, funny, did you stand up nowhere near the house and when people called Israel always had the mormons. We lived in Salt Lake in the Mormons always came to our house to teach us about, you know, the book of Mormon and my mom was a nice woman so she always let a man and I guess you want somebody to talk to or whatever it plus they were handsome as hell. And my mom's like that pretty girl always. So she's like, when she was 70 she like, I can still get a man. Whoa man. Whoa. So that's why I'm so neurotic because. So she would invite a man. And so my dad, he didn't like him because he was an atheist. So he used to go down the basement and scream up a bar. The better thing he did was when they knock on the door after they'd been there a couple times. He goes, Mrs Barr in? And he goes, Mrs Barr, Mrs Barr is in jail for 28 days.

Speaker 3:          01:34:09       We have nothing to discuss it and we ask kids are just wouldn't be pee in our pants.

Speaker 5:          01:34:16       So who does do that to fuck with people to entertain? He, uh, the heart of a standup, right?

Speaker 3:          01:34:21       Yeah. Plus his lines were pretty good too. Yeah, he was funny. My whole family was funny. It was all slams. Every slamming, everybody. I got the first slam when I was four. My uncle Sherman was sitting there eating my grandma's soup and he always called her a greenhorn, the self care. She was an immigrant and so he's like, you know, in America they don't put an inch of chicken fat on top of their soap. I was like four and I think he's talking about by grandma and I really want to film this too because I felt like wonder woman and I knew I was going to deliver the. It

Speaker 2:          01:34:57       came to me and I was going to do it, you know, that thing you get when you a comic. And I'm like, then how come you eat two bowls of it? Boom. And, and everyone laughed and he got really pissed that I was only four, but he got pissed. So then I was like, oh boy, I can own this room. So you remember the first time you ever killed? Yeah, I do. I do. I remember every section you just knocked out of the park and you had the feeling that you get when you go on stage and you have an idea because he was fat and no one could say he was fat. They couldn't say, hey, you're a tub or anything like that to him because he was sensitive. But he was a bully. Like a lot of fat people are bullies, you know, they're not all jolly well there's a lot of fat people that are uncomfortable, right?

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       Yeah. Whatever. But they're mean and he's the one of them. So I was like, you're eating too much. UHM, it was like double and I knew it was fucking Delta because it was like I was, I was penetrating the shield of bullshit. We don't tell him he fucking is a big fat pig. The best comedy law. It's so fun. Missile. A hell fire missile that penetrates the shield of bullshit. The bad thing is when you are like that, like me and my dad given it back. Then you have kids and they give it to you and the God damn it. It's awful. My kid already gives it to her. How long have a five and a three. The five year olds already like talk shit. It's so you're covering. It's totally. I told her she had to go to bed. She goes, well, I don't have a job.

Speaker 2:          01:36:33       She just looked at me, was say daddy has to get up in the morning. That has a job. I got to go to sleep zone. So when I tell her she got to go to sleep. She was like, well, I don't know what job being just looking at me. I was like, Oh snap. This is before she was even going to preschool. She was four when she said that, I know it's happening. I know it's coming, but that's no way around it. Karma and no parent escapes it. I enjoy it. I wanted to be. I want her to be strong. I want her to have her own opinions and I mean the arguing about whether or not she should have to go to bed is the beginning of arguing whether or not she should have a terrible job arguing whether she should have an existence that she doesn't enjoy, whether she should have been in a relationship that you think sucks to said. Got a good point. I said, well, yeah. I mean I told her go to bed. No, no. I made her watch one more half hour of Max and Ruby and then go to bed. Give her 30 minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:37:32       I didn't tell her that the line deserves reward because I didn't want her to be encouraged to continue it, but I just had explained it to her. I said, it's so important when you're young to get your sleep. I go, because you're a growing organism, you know, so I tried to explain like, showed her some pictures when she was a baby. I said, you see what you look like now or you don't look like that anymore. That's all from sleep. That sleep turns you from a baby into this four year old girl. Can Talk to me. She was like, really? I go, Yup. I go, it's thinking and it's learning. That's all important too. But sleep is big. It's really important. I go, but it's not going to hurt you if you watch one more show. So we'll watch one more. Good Dad. It's so. It's so important that girls have a good dad that they can talk to. Girls need that more. More than anything. I think so. And it's important for God to have a good mom. You know, something funny. My Dad said, I, we are Jews, you know, in Salt Lake. And I said, I was like, how come Santa doesn't come to our house? I was like, I was about eight, maybe six. How come? How come it doesn't come over our house? Because Santa is an antisemite.

Speaker 2:          01:38:41       It was so funny. Horrible thing for a kid to hear. It was hilarious. You already knew you enjoyed it. You were like, are raised to be a comic essentially. He used to watch Ed Sullivan with me, you know, and he'd go, this guy is a, he's a comic. He says, you know, he's, he goes, this guy's a comedian. He, he says things funny. This guy is a comic. He says, funny things. He told me, he broke it all down for me. He goes, this guy is actively resisting. This guy has a resistor. This guy is a, um, what do you call it, where you collude because he has, you know, he was like a big fucking commy. Your Dad was a big comedy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:39:30       Well, you know, he grew up during the McCarthy era, which, I mean, you want it to be a comic because you didn't want to be the fucking government usually thought that was good. The opposite side when you've got these people that are getting arrested because they went to a meeting and talk to people about socialism. So they're getting arrested and they're getting blacklisted from Hollywood. They getting their fucking jobs taken away from them for going to meetings and talking to people about ideas. That blacklisting thing and the left joins in on it. If you'll notice that the left joins in on the, on, like I was pretty shocked that they were coming after him. You know, the Times that they've come after me because you didn't understand a couple of times I've said stupid things and uh, oh, I'm not getting into it. You don't get into it.

Speaker 2:          01:40:15       Why would I do that? Just as an example. So if people don't know that are listening to this, they would like to know what you mean by. Well, because me, I don't know. I got in a fight with the transgenders, the transgenders. What was it about all of them? Not all of them. The majority of them are, are Nice, wonderful people. They really are. And I know a lot of them, but you know, assholes are in every group. What you were talking about tribalism. Here's no family. Say when they pervert tribalism and here's what they do too. They make him defend everybody who's like you, but that's not good because you're the Predator right

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       there. Sure. The Predator is the one every group should be against. It is time to read every community, every type, every, every street of predators who liked aid people taking people's money, taking public money and putting it in private pockets, right?

Speaker 5:          01:41:10       Yes. I agree. One hundred percent is saying that all people have this nationality, those are my people or all people with this gender. Those are my people or all people that are transgender are my people. It's all equally ridiculous. Everybody's got households in their group. Just be anti asshole would be. I could not agree more and that has always been my problem with the idea of feminism. You know, like I'm 100 percent for equality for and I think that we should look down on men who were abusing women the same way we look down on women abusing men the same way we look at men abusing men the same way we look at women abusing women. It's a gross thing that humans do where they victimize each other.

Speaker 4:          01:41:49       That's exactly right. And there should be one fucking way to go. One law for everybody that gets rid of all that, rest of that shit. They just fundraising again that these fucking people, they're fundraising.

Speaker 5:          01:42:00       Well, it could be that. It's also the need to be, you know, you're not on my team. Fuck you. This people that are only team, att and t, what are you going with? Rosen. Oh, you're using a windows computer. You push. You need to get a Mac. You know, people are crazy. They're crazy with that. They're getting paid to do that though. That's a natural. Oh, they absolutely do. They have, I think almost all do this fucking Chevy. People that have a car, they have the Calvin and Hobbes of a, uh, Calvin pissing on a Ford logo because they don't like for

Speaker 4:          01:42:34       people retarded. They just go with these stupid team. I'm from Milwaukee. We don't give a fuck about being from Chicago. That's a statement that a person in Milwaukee is likely to say. If you bring up Chicago Patrick mentality, it's, it's, it's a natural thing. It's being taught. I'm not going to agree with you. That's why I don't have any. You do have hope? I do, but I have a different kind of hope because my hopes based on my helping other human beings. So as is mine, as his mom, I don't have like any umbrella fucking hope that the right thing is going to happen as people are fucking stupid. That's what they are. They're stupid in their followers and they are too busy to think, but they're also beautiful and brilliant. The reason why we're having this conversation at all is because someone figured out a way to put all this electronics shit into this tube that's only like six inches long and then it's attached to this wire that's attached to a fucking computer as a distribution vehicle for information than I would have never been able to figure out on my.

Speaker 4:          01:43:39       Okay, wait a minute. I want to say you're changing the subject. I want to say this. I don't believe that people are fucked up. I don't believe that they have, that they are a slave to their worst impulses. I don't. I think some are more, but I think the majority of people are not like that. I think the majority of people are actually good, but they are for people kept away from the seats of power and if we could just get one. One of them somewhere, anywhere, Yemen, anywhere one of them will will, will change it. Everything. Just one intelligent person. I, I, I think one intelligent person can reach all intelligence, even in the greediest lowest a backward bastard on earth.

Speaker 2:          01:44:28       I think you're 100 percent right. I also think that that noise is going to drive people crazy. What is that? Is that you banging on this thing? Someone next door to someone next door. What are they doing? They're making something that's loud as fuck. They're probably are listening to the podcast and they hate me banging on my door because they know it's next door. They have cake. Maybe it's a CIA, setting up a listening station. How many good people there are in our government and people report this to me. I just want to say this to people. They do report to me that there,

Speaker 4:          01:45:00       there are good people everywhere. I'm sure there's good people in our government and they're like, right now they're proving that because of they had solutions that made common sense to people. They're being promoted and getting closer to a logical seats of power. So I think that

Speaker 2:          01:45:21       good to, well I think that this is what I was saying when I did the Internet and that the, the transparency of information that we have today is going to sort of reinforce those ideas. If you're going to represent people, you have to represent them in a way that benefits the people and that's possible. It's possible to do so. Uh, we're, we're both on the same page. Just a little more extreme than me. Yeah. Chem trails and stuff. And Mk Ultra and aliens. That's where you draw the line I think. I think there might be row. I think there might be robots. I think the news might all be manufactured outside, that's pretty sure in a studio. And. And they probably have lookalikes playing the party.

Speaker 2:          01:46:07       Did you see wag the dog? Yes, I did. It was. And that was a long time ago, by the way, before they had the kind of CGI that they have today. Well, I think they're definitely fake some stuff. The CIA printed in the paper during the beginning of the Iraq invasion that they were going to release fake stories. It was on CNN, they were going to release fake stories for the good of, you know, uh, the troops or whatever the fuck it was, you know, like that's it when you're admitting them, destroying their records, that's what people who believe the tower seven thing was the tower seven confusion or I'm a conspiracy rather, is that there was so much evidence inside that building that could have fucked them bank stuff and Ron and ron stuff and it was the

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       CIA had offices in that building. The NSA had offices in that building. That building was a crazy fucking building of information and shit. That was the black male center maybe. I don't know what the fuck it was, but I know that that building imploded. Lucky it was detonated those, those other two buildings to me look like buildings. I got hit by a plane and horrible structural damage and everything fell because they failed the way something would fall. It was collapsing and falling apart. That tower seven thing felt like it was a controlled demolition. Now, obviously I'm not an engineer, nor I'm an architect or a construction expert, so I don't know if a fire could make a building do that. It might be able to because look, the things or weird things, it's. It's weird to be able to detonate a building in the first place. It's weird when you see, you know, sometimes shit happens. Sometimes things don't go the way you would think they would go through lack of management.

Speaker 4:          01:47:42       There is a of what they think it is. It's like people are swimming in theory.

Speaker 5:          01:47:46       Yeah. Well, it's one of those things. It's so. It's, it's also so enticing to believe that tower seven was the place where they were holding all this information and they detonated in front of everybody's eyes on television. Like Holy Shit. They got away with it because it's, you know, if you were inclined to lean towards that, that would be one of the possibilities. The reality is, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:48:06       I, here's what I got out of it. Okay, well get here. We can watch it. We get to watch it fall. Okay, I'll get that five seconds.

Speaker 5:          01:48:13       Watch it again. Play that, play that again, because it's, it's anybody that says it's not weird. Is hilarious. Office is that seven, whatever it is, it's free fall speed. That's one of the things that they did prove and they tried to argue it, which is hilarious. The nist guys tried to argue that it wasn't free fall speed. They tried to say that, uh, it was like a second slower than free. False. Be like you're talking about the collapse of a building. Like even if it's a second flow is slower than free fall speed. That's fucking crazy. That thing just imploded into its own base. Watch it one more time. Look at that. Ooh, look how it does that. Anybody that doesn't think that's nuts. Your nut.

Speaker 4:          01:48:53       That's the set there. You know how when they go like this on the side and they take it down?

Speaker 5:          01:49:01       Yeah. Like the, the, yeah, the set and uh, on a screen or a stage for a play people,

Speaker 4:          01:49:07       except for the people who survived on the streets. The horror of that. That's really what it was about. I thought. But also the thing I knew it was the fucking end of the world when I say that because it was like I couldn't believe it because all these guys in suits, they were lined up on the sides of the roads and they were applauding for the firemen and the workers who do the actual work and they were like handing them water and I went, this is the fucking end of the world. Americans are actually like applauding the way things actually work. The guys in the suits or actually applauding the first responders and stuff. I thought this has got

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       to be that. This is the hand of the bullshit. Just bullshit. Met the touch, you know the. What do they say meets the road?

Speaker 5:          01:49:57       Do you remember those days? Like right after nine slash 11.

Speaker 3:          01:50:00       Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:50:01       Those are crazy days. There's a weird feeling in the air, wasn't it? It was like. It was also a weird comradery between Americans. Like everywhere you go, everybody had American flags on their cars. It was nuts,

Speaker 3:          01:50:12       but it was for the right stuff. At first it was like they were taking know they were bringing water and they were bringing supplies and it was like, we're gonna fucking, we're going. It was like really amazing because it's like we're going to win out of goodness and, and that's how it felt then. And it was like, you know, that people were like, they were so good and they were so caring and they were coming together against a common foe. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:50:40       And the, the, the love of the first responders to. That was a big thing when I was in New York in 2002 and I couldn't believe how nice people were being the cops and firemen like yelling out to him, waving to him, honking their horns, saying we love you. Just, it was crazy. It was like you could feel the tangible result of them realizing like, wow, like we're in a situation where we were, we got attacked like, and these are the people that saved people and you know, there's this weird feeling of mortality now and a real risk

Speaker 3:          01:51:10       New York when I was driving down the street, because I'm always watching people, you know. And uh, it was watching people walking down the street after that for quite some time, maybe six months, a few times I checked it. They were actually making eye contact with other people and smiling. And then like a few years later, you know, after the Bush, the whole thing there, they were back to just the looking straight down thing and avoiding eye contact. But it was like, wow, that was a mind meld going on. It was like a positive love mindmeld thing.

Speaker 5:          01:51:42       Yeah. It only lasted for a little while. Right. How long did it last? Last few years

Speaker 3:          01:51:45       lasted until Bush got up there and, you know, what did that act, you know, that sketch? Yeah. One where he went on the boat.

Speaker 5:          01:51:54       Mission accomplished. Yeah. I think people also realize that this was a, that the powers that be had capitalized on all this, you know, this, this sort of patriotism and all this, uh, there's this enthusiasm and America had for revenge and

Speaker 3:          01:52:10       yeah, first thing they cut the benefits of the street. It's like, wow, that's why I thought, well, last did Wall Street and do it, do you think?

Speaker 5:          01:52:21       But nine slash 11, I think that nine slash 11 more likely than not was the result of a bunch of terrorists that attacked America. And why did they do it? Most likely because of what America has been doing overseas, you know, we create enemies. We do it from the beginning. We've done it from the beginning of time. Every nation that's been in power has always tried to steal the natural resources of other nations. As A. I've always tried to influence the governments of other nations and there's a blowback from that shit. You know, the people think that they know that was the most embarrassing and I'm in enraging thing about what the Bush administration, the way they would flavor it, they hate us for our freedom. But he actually said that on TV once. They hate us for our freedom. But who is he talking to? You talking about the terrorists?

Speaker 4:          01:53:04       No, he's talking to the people he represents, which are they investor classes? He said it himself and they and people do hate their freedom because it's their freedom to be predators.

Speaker 5:          01:53:14       I think he was talking, I was talking to. I think he was talking to the duck dynasty fans are fucking stupid and they were Rah Rah, and they didn't want to put any thought to it though he hate us for our freedom and they're like, let's go get some. That's what he was doing. I think he was just patronizing knuckleheads and that this idea that somehow or another people wouldn't like that people are having a good time somewhere. So they're willing to kill themselves by flying fucking planes into buildings. This, it's insulting.

Speaker 4:          01:53:41       Well, I mean that's one way of looking at it. You know, I've heard a lot of opinion, another band, Jesus, you know, now what has happened all over the world is now happening in our country. You know, you know, there was a lot of that. Or people were like, well, you know, this, this can't happen here or anywhere else. So, you know, they got to go win over there so they don't come here

Speaker 5:          01:54:06       thing. But it's a weird feeling that people have years later after the fact that not only have we not capitalized on the situation and used it as a, uh, as, as the potential to sort of rectify some of the problems that we have. But instead we ruined the way the rest of the world looks at America. We destroyed all the goodwill, all the praise and happiness that people had for America responding to this horrible tragedy, all the love that people had sent to America from all across the world within five, six years, America to become the Great Satan again. Half the fucking world. They squandered a squad they don't under. They capitalized on it. That's the big thing to capitalize on it.

Speaker 4:          01:54:44       They get their money off the top, you know, and then they let you know, they sell the weapons, they get their money. They're not around when the war start, when we go back and have to get smart and hip to that shit and just go, you know, we're not gonna you know what we're gonna do, we're gonna do what we did after nine slash 11. We're going to like do the right thing and the good thing for each other. We're not going to do what you fucking, you know, we're not going to be tools in your useless, obsolete wars where you make the stock markets go up because poverty increased amongst workers in the world. That's not gonna happen anymore. I think that's slowly happening. Yeah, I do too. So you agree everything's going to be. I do agree, but I also agree and my daughter says, oh mother, just because you are getting old enough to die doesn't mean that any tire world as a die with you. That's what baby boomers think because you guys are so fucking narcissistic. Not only have we run the world and blah, blah blah, but you know, maybe it. Maybe it's because I'm

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       getting old, but a boy. I'd like to see a big fucking dent and the bullshit and machine this bullshit system. I think we've already had a big dent. We just haven't realized it yet. You know what I was going to say is that in when we look back in history and we look at the Iraq war and thing, they find out that a guy who's a ceo of Halliburton, somehow or another got to be the vice president of the United States. We went into a war under dubious pretenses that there are some weapons of mass destruction in some assholes, shitty fucking country in the middle of nowhere a million people die when they look at the profits that were distributed to Halliburton and all these different companies that profited from the rebuilding, it's going to be so fucking transparent. When they stop and they step back and they look at it, and then I think the other thing is going to be this Edward Snowden thing.

Speaker 2:          01:56:30       People just made it possible for the survivors of the nine slash 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia that that just passed last week. Did you know that there's a big admission for people to look at. People need to read about that. Well, the Saudis, the hostages were. Excuse me, the hijackers were Saudis. Most of them, right, but there are. They're the ones who did it, I mean, they're dead if they, if, if that's the story. People say that it was just a regular move, a vampire, you know, you know, the whole, uh, the whole banking empire that runs through the whole thing that they set it up, they did it theater. Doesn't that seem like that would be a really fucking difficult thing to arrange and that would be really hard to pull off, pull off getting people to commit suicide by flying planes into buildings. Oh, you mean getting operatives, getting people to do that, getting people to commit suicide by taking a little plane and flying them right into a building.

Speaker 2:          01:57:28       It's easy. If you had like, you know, again, enough whores and drugs and money and then they sat their family up, people will do it. I think it's incredibly difficult to arrange that plan that I'm saying that Saudi Arabia had anything to do with it. What do, you certainly did? I think that the idea that the bankers organized it and set it up in order to rob people more that the government set up in order to use it as a pretest, Iveta invade Iraq. I think it's much more likely that the capitalized on a situation and look for an opening that they had been looking for in the first place. They were practicing it for a while. Always have been, always have been, always will be. You know, they're always. They're always, they're all connected. We're all connected. All the people who do that kind of stuff all around the world, you know their arms merchants and you know their operatives well, there's certainly people that are connected like that all around the world. There's certainly people that profit from from war all around the world. I think much more likely though this was the consequence of our actions overseas. People say that, but I'm not sure. I didn't. People say it was Silverstein getting insurance payout out more sense to me. Tower

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       seven as well. Right. That was the thing that he said. Pull it. Yeah. He told them to pull it.

Speaker 4:          01:58:45       It's like the. It's the whole thing, you know, it's um, you know, you have to burn your building down to get the insurance money

Speaker 5:          01:58:53       [inaudible] it wasn't getting rented. Yeah, no, that's true. I mean, look, that's, that is something we've seen on smaller levels. You know, we've seeded on lower levels. The homeowners like their house on fire. There was a guy recently who was indicted for murder because he opened up his gas line and then set a timer and for a spark to go off. Uh, but he had no idea how much of an explosion of create and he blew up the neighbor's house to and killed a couple people. I mean, it's just some crazy asshole that wanted. He wanted some money. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:59:26       Here's how they fix the world.

Speaker 5:          01:59:29       I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:59:30       No, they have to get rid of insurance because it's the biggest. It's just a fucking scam. Especially life insurance. Gambling. You're gonna fucking die. You don't need to have an insurance policy saying you're not, you know, because you are so already. It's a fucking scam. And everything in this country is run by insurance. Ha Hack insurance salesman. Basically a bunch of guys that used to be in prison and then, you know, they couldn't get a real fucking job, so they started in insurance sales.

Speaker 5:          02:00:00       So a guy like Larry Silverstein who would have in the conspiracy model to have those buildings destroyed, he would have no incentive to do that because he couldn't be able to get, get money from it. So it stopped things like that from happening.

Speaker 4:          02:00:13       Well, I'm not saying that. I'm saying people are saying that. I'm saying these are things I've heard. Of course. Well, if you go on those fucking customer, they're all, they all make as much sense to the other thing.

Speaker 5:          02:00:26       No, I don't think that they make as much sense. I think that, uh, there's a lot of chaos in, in, in horrible tragedies. And a lot of people look for order in that chaos. And one of the things they look for is conspiracy. I think it's a natural.

Speaker 4:          02:00:38       I don't think it's any conspiracy that a bunch of rich guys get together who own everything on earth, get together and hang out. That's not any conspiracy. And they do. They all fucking know each other. They have carlyle group, so the whole thing, they know what they're doing, you know, and uh, and uh, they make money from the shit they, they set up like going to the roulette wheel. I'm gonna bet. Read on 22.

Speaker 5:          02:01:04       Well, here's another thing that, uh, someone said I repeated a wish I could credit the original person, but a might actually been awesome. Were stoned as fuck, I don't even remember. But the original quote was that September 11th when, when people talk about conspiracy theories, that's one of the big ones. And people always go, do you believe? What do you think about September 11th? I always ask people, do you believe the September 11th happened? And they were like, what do you mean? Do you believe that planes were, were hijacked? And they flew them into buildings and they killed a bunch of people. Do you believe that that happened? It, most people say yes. And I say, well then you believe in conspiracies because

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       they conspired to do that. They'd have to be a conspiracy. The only way you get planes to fly into buildings show it's fake where they show it to all fake. That's probably CIA shit right there. That's probably to diffuse the architects and engineers for nine slash 11 truth and pink along those lines that are asking for for answers because even if they're wrong, they're still stirring the pot so much that it makes it hot for anybody who's in public office. It makes it difficult. So this is a natural inclination. That's the other conspiracy that everybody talks about. That's a fascinating one that people have been wanting more and more lately to pin on Lee Harvey Oswald as being the lone gunman. And I think that's hilarious because people are moving away from that. No, no, no, no. There's a lot of people. What was that guy that wrote that book?

Speaker 2:          02:02:29       Cape Vincent Bugliosi, however you say his last name, he wrote a book called case closed, which is fucking retarded. It's not closed at all. Like the idea that there's a lot of people that, uh, that were witness to, that, that wound up murdered a wound up dying in very strange ways. More than a hundred over 10 years and they said that the odds of those people all dying like that, but some fucking astronomical number. It's fascinating to follow it. It is. All these years. I remember I was in about the fifth grade when they came in and they said that we're were Latin school out early on account of our president has just been set. His Dad being shot. That was freaky. That's one of those you never forget where you were moments, right? I was so mad because that night I was having my first slumber party and we're going to have the scary movies and there's only like three channels and it was all about the president in that.

Speaker 2:          02:03:24       So they preempted all the scary movies. So cancel my party was. That sucks because back then do you have a VCR? Didn't have anything. You have to deal with it, but it was the movie I wanted to see it. Was that one about the clay to burrata? Nick tell. Oh yeah, yeah, you'll hit the fuck. Was that, uh, the guy with the spaceship and from came from outer space? Is that what it was, that it wasn't more of worlds? Was it more of worlds? It was war of worlds. I think somebody that claimed to know. I wanted to say that when I was running for president so bad on a stage, how many war of worlds have there been? Those are the 2005. One which was full. People were screaming in the streets and they thought we really had been invaded. They say they're going to do another one like that, a fake alien invasion movie and I'm. I'm projected onto the stuff that is in the chem trails and that people are going to see a fault and artificial reality right before their eyes. Jamie's got it the day the earth stood still. That was it. That was awesome. I watched that the other day actually. I just said though, yes I did. I see people like

Speaker 4:          02:04:41       are programmed in America that they can't hear that they can't hear it.

Speaker 2:          02:04:45       Do you think that they would actually do that? Like if there was something like a war of worlds type thing? Again, remember winning the Orson Welles did that on the radio and freak the pop population out. You could get sued if he did something like that today, wouldn't you? If you had like a fake news story and people are committing suicide because they thought the aliens were attacking, they say they're going to do it to get people that run to the fema camps. I've got one place where there's water and food, so they'll go, I have one piece of advice. Whoever they are, don't listen to them anymore. They're. They're telling you some crazy shit. It's all day. That's what they say. That's a base a say. He gets to the FEMA camps. Yeah. Doesn't make any sense. I'll tell you what doesn't make any sense. You can't get a straight answer anywhere on the Internet.

Speaker 2:          02:05:30       It's all fucking bullshit on both sides. The where's the real news, but here's the problem with the Fema camp thing. Here's the number one problem. You got to feed this fucking people. You gotta take care of either going to kill them, which costs money because you're gonna have to get rid of the bodies and shoot them and all that shit, and then they're not going to contribute any money to tax dollars anymore. That's what I said. You don't lock up your own tax base and yet that's what they're doing. Started locking everybody up for pot. Really locking up though. A lot of kids that work a little bit of that, but there's also they're profiting off of putting people in prison. A lot of them young black men and they're putting people that are a part of this disenfranchised system. Yeah, and Latino and they're profiting off of them.

Speaker 2:          02:06:13       They're just using them to make profit, but they're not. They're not taking like the biggest, baddest tax donators in the world. They're not doing that. They're going after people that are in poverty. That's why, because those people oftentimes are contributing to the system as far as tax money anyway. They might buy like sales tax and things along those lines, but they're probably not making enough money declared to pay a significant amount of income tax. There's nothing left to be robbed. Yes. Well, there are other also the got a fucking terrible. Roll the dice by life threatening. They start out in massive debt from the jump because they're born into some terrible society. They're born into a horrible neighborhood. Terrible parents, terrible crime filled streets around the system that exploits the many for the benefit of the few. It certainly is. Yeah, but that can easily be changed. It can be changed by some people have some fucking brains in their head. They'd go, Geez, I don't want to have to live on top of a mountain behind 18 sets of gates. Yeah. Helicopter over the fucking a.

Speaker 4:          02:07:13       what's it called?

Speaker 2:          02:07:16       Grand Canyon Grocery still. What's it called? Ralph's. Yeah, something like that. It's like I got to have bodyguards in the helicopter over the roof of Ralph's.

Speaker 4:          02:07:27       You can't. You can't divorce. You can't like take that may steps back from humanity. You can't. They I'll go nuts to do you see the shit they do because they're so fucking crazy.

Speaker 5:          02:07:39       You. One thing that's consistent in this conversation is the word day and I think in a bad way and in a good way, and I say get the good way is that it's always a va, which corporation. It's a bunch of people acting together doing terrible things and I think that where we're wrong as a culture is not that we don't think of ourselves as individuals, but we don't think of giant groups as individuals, as being a bunch of different individuals together. You become a part of this corporation then you become a va.

Speaker 4:          02:08:08       I know I can get away with shady. FIne. No, you're right with that stupid fuckers. Maybe real definitive here. Stupid backward, lemming, motherfucking idiots that are in control of everything.

Speaker 5:          02:08:25       Um, but are they just a part of this fucked up system that we're talkIng about? Like if you, if you come along, like say if you're going to work for some guy who's a fucking crazy control freak and you're working in his office and know they have specific rules to company rules that you have over the coffee machine and the way he wants you to dress, the way he wants you to talk. if you're trying to advance inside that system, you behave the way that

Speaker 4:          02:08:46       system is, that we got to get rid of all corporations. They're the enemy. Everything, decent government and everything. But, um, you know, they're bullshit. They're also where we get laptops democratic. There's no democracy and a Fucking corporation. It's corporate feudalism. That's what's forced it oN a, on all of us. And you have to do what your boss says. He might be on coke. Of course he is on there all fucking uncle and he might be answering on godly. Well, he'll be on adderall. Well, some people are not meant for him, but I mean, and it's at his whim that you live and die. That ain't right. That's what corporations do. And, and these fucking, uh, you know, uh, servants that they put on the supreme court to make a corporation, a human. I think we should take advantage of that and do just the opposite and get all the american people together, not to, to never vote, never cast another fucking boat and incorporate. And then we'll build the fucking government for the money they fucking stole from us in the first god damn place. We'll get our money back.

Speaker 5:          02:09:52       strong words from roseanne barr, ladies and gentlemen, strong words or not or not. You know, one of the things that I thought was fascinating that you were talking about, one of your reasons why you love Hawaii is because they still have a goddess. You still have an active goddess. I think it's a, it's a fascinating thing in our culture that somewhere along the line of being a woman or respecting the idea of a goddess, you know, is completely eliminated from, from the whole structure of the culture. It's kinda gone. There's women, there's mothers as wives. Is that the strong feMinine power structure that you know, like, or power position of the goddess doesn't exist in the feminine. All these fucked up cultures.

Speaker 3:          02:10:36       Well, that's what they get. I gotta get rid of first because it makes too much sense to women when they got to try to fuck with women's minds that that's what they spend 99 percent of their lives doing. That the idiots because they got to get women to continue to, um, you know, bear bear, bear kids for them to send off to wars and molest.

Speaker 5:          02:10:57       Oh, what ended thinking? the things that like the, the, the standard of feminine or the, uh, the, the, the philosophy of feminine though they're just a natural instinct and inclination is to take care of things. Nurturing things, be loving to thing.

Speaker 3:          02:11:13       That's a little bit. That's not exactly. Everyone says that the yang and the union of things, women, it's the correct thing. You, when you See your kids going to chew on an electric cord, like they'll do these fucking idiot. You say, get the fat down. That's it to every. All parents say that, but that's out of love that you are doing that. So that's what feminine is.

Speaker 5:          02:11:39       And well, you would also say that there's, there's a yin and a yang. The masculine is more aggressive and more, and if you look at like a society that's spiraling out of control, it'll go one way or the other. It'll go too far one way or too far the other way. And the, you know, the amazons or fucking kidnapping man and cutting their dicks off amazon women. Where's that a book? I'm just making it. That would be a society like shit, man. The women have taken control. That would be awful.

Speaker 3:          02:12:07       Of course they do. They don't want to cut it off. I mean, being a women like men who have erections, that's the bottom of fucking line. Of course they do. That's what you're seeking. However, you know that there are so intelligent systems and it seems that women are the ones who actually think of them because they have to like, in what way? What intelligence systems? Oh, well, like, you know, uh, a lot of, you know, social change comes one. Women start doing it also, social change really? Yeah, and community social and start implementing a smarter system that changes things right away and there's all kinds of evidence out there that you can read about like right now in africa, a whole bunch of new systems, you know, and women are the ones who are like thinking them up because like I said, a lot of these women, myself included in the old days, you had to fix a whole lot of shit with gestures and a rubber band and a paperclip.

Speaker 3:          02:13:10       You had to like organize the fucking shit load of people around you to do what needed to be done for the group. it's like hive mind and we were trained for that. So it's like, you know, if we're all going to survive in this family, this is what I need you to do. If we need to make our common goal visible and all work towards it. Not against it. And that's what the mother brings to a family and the father too. But the mother is the one who's there every day. But in general, I'm speaking in generalities, but she's there and she implements that system of sharing. And commonwealth,

Speaker 5:          02:13:47       do you know dr chris ryan is. Have you ever heard of. Haven't heard of the book sex at dawn [inaudible]. He's a good friend and we've had them on the podcast several times and he's a really, really brilliant guy and one of the things that he talked about was that in hunter gatherer cultures, the relationship between the man and the woman was much, much, much more equal because the women did a huge amount of that work. A hUge amount of the reason why everybody was surviving and taking care of their children and feeding themselves was because of the gathering part. It wasn't so much the hunting. The men would be out doing the hunting. They would be successful occasionally, but it wasn't all the time. So they relied on crops. they relied on the things that they grew in, the things that they picked. And that because of that, the women had a prominent position of power and in those cultures. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:14:30       because we, we, we got our, our thinking is a little more circular, not always, but in generalities, a little more connected, a little more, you know, we're men seems to be um, a equals b, it seems this way. What do you call that? Hierarchal or something and they're trained to do that. I, I don't doubt that it could be switched at any point if you're training people, but after you've been doing something for a couple thousand years, it kinda comes into your dna and nine it gets like it's your default because you, you've been while bread or program for that, you know, but I don't think that is who we are. I think were much smarter than what we're allowed to be. And I think that, you know, if we had ultimate freedom and small groups of communities of self rule where it was the goal of each community to be sustainable and justice and trade with your neighbor, I think we'd be a lot better because that is who we are before we all got fucked up with this shit.

Speaker 5:          02:15:33       I think you're right. and I think that one of the things that these things represent what you started talking about, like an ancient culture that you know, favored women more or culture over here that favors men more or get weirdness like papau new Guinea where they sexually molest young boys from the time they're young. They take them away from their parents and they, they make them ingest men, semen, they call them semen warriors. It's crazy. But what is that? Well that represents this, this crazy range that we have of, of behavior patterns. So people tend to follow. And I think that discussion and communication and things like these, these conversations are what lead people to start analyzing the behavior structure and the conversation makes people look at the way things are and compare them to whether it's passive realizations or civilizations like Iceland or whatever it is. And they start thinking about reorganizing and reengineering the system because the system is just that. It's something that people create and it might be good and, but people

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       have accepted because they've been brainwashed into it. They've been brainwashed into thinking that it's our master, but it's our tool. And you know, it take it, it is a government that makes that happen. Just efficient, you know, efficient government. It's like we've never, we've never really had that here.

Speaker 5:          02:16:50       You're right. And it's so corrupt now at this point that I agree with what you said earlier before that thing.

Speaker 3:          02:16:57       Well, I think it is. And uh, I have, you know, I have hope in my fellow humans, not in, not in any fairy tale way, but um, you know, there's a movement now and starting in, uh, in, in Italy and it's going to go everywhere. It's called the five star movement. And it has a, you know, new systems of law, the international tribunal of common law of a, and I'm saying it wrong, but it's like common commonwealth common law and uh, you know, it's like taking the idea of sovereignty on, on behalf of, you know, the regular people of this planet, all the citizens of this planet. And um, you know, judging the people who have caused an imposed misery for no reason by profit. And you know, the people, they do have that power and it is coming in. It is because of the internet and it is because the shows like this, because we can talk this way, you know, I have faith in my menu or generation, younger people might. My kids are your age, little bit younger, probably just your age, but uh, you know, y'all are getting smarter and you, you will, um, you know, you're going to solve a lot of stuff because you're smart and you have the, you have the technology and the tools at your disposal to do so.

Speaker 5:          02:18:17       I think it's really the people far younger than me that are, I think it's the people that are listening to people like us having these conversations and these are the first first exposures. They've had these ideas and he'll shape them and change them while they're still young. I think the rigid people that get into their thirties with mortgages and forties and what have you, those are the really hard ones to fucking change. But you get a hold of some 18 year old kid is just out of high school and knows whose parents are retarded. And you know, he goes to college and he listens to a podcast where rosanne breaks down what's wrong that that plants a seed in his head or her head and then from there they go on and they improve the, the structure from where they can access it as at the beginning, at any point it can be, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:18:57       even one small change

Speaker 5:          02:18:59       right out of college not being saddled down with mortgages and kids and all this different stuff that makes it really, really hard to change. But be free from the jump and then engineer your life and in turn affect a lot. I think

Speaker 3:          02:19:14       it's really scary. Awesome. Cool. Is that, it's far younger than even them because like I have a lot of. I don't know if you looked into it, there's a lot of hope for autistic people think

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       because they are very solution driven and I'm on that spectrum, you know, but, but they're able to conceive of the idea of actual solutions, actual problems instead of how am I going to make money off this problem, which is like my generation and and disappearing. But kids as young as nine years old are implementing incredible systems on the, on the internet that actually like, you know, uh, um, what do you call it for battering, battering and fuel batteries and fuel and all kinds of new things. Sure. These guys, these people are unbelievable. These young, really young and especially the ones who have intense focus. Their focus is so intense that they can only do one thing. But when applied, I mean they're, these are like some of the greatest thinkers as per solutions that have ever existed. And now this is like the time of magic as I really like.

Speaker 4:          02:20:25       Because one time I want to tell you the story, but you finished and then. Oh no, no, please do. Oh, this was like a thing that really fucked up my mind. I was at this party in, there was all these people, you know, from all over the place. And there was this guy there and he had done all the satellite work for ted turner at the time, you know, when they started cable news and everything. And he, he was telling me what his opinion of the impact of technology and, and freedom of information for people to be able to. And, and here's what he said, because I think of it everyday. So for the first time in history, human history information reaches the people without any state, without any church stopping it. He said this, this is going to give birth to something that the people in the who look at the renaissance as like a great time, that's not, it's going to be a million times.

Speaker 4:          02:21:20       But he said this is going to be the time of great freedom. And he said in the greatest thing about it is that, you know, the ills of the world will begin to disappear because people will be smart enough when we won't want to walk over dead bodies anymore because they'll realize that what they do, it is who they are and anyone into this whole thing. And I think I think of it every day. And uh, and I, I look for evidence that it's true and I find it everywhere, all over the internet. Smart people, they know the right thing to do. They know that this at the time were they know us just deciding that we're going to do the right thing for the right reason at the right time. It's never been done and now it's possible in this the first time that it's really been possible for people to like really get together and um, demand and bring change and a whole, a whole new world, a whole new world. And we can do it all with everything that already exists. We don't have to have any wars and we don't have to reinvent the wheel either. It all exists. What we need is the right intelligence, intelligence

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       and philosophy at the top, driving it. And that exists to.

Speaker 5:          02:22:31       You're so much more positive than you were two hours ago.

Speaker 3:          02:22:34       Well, here's why I'm positive because he is as positive vr. You know about zen and stuff for as much, you got to stay in balance. The reason that you can be that positive as you are aware of how negative it is, you need what? You got to have both. You've got to have both because you have to see how fucking stupid shit is.

Speaker 5:          02:22:54       I often think that that's one of the things that motivates good things, is it seeing eviL in the world and it's almost like it has to exist in order to motivate good because we're so. We're so far from perfect. We're so far from finished. you know, if we used to be monkeys and now we're at this, we're not done. It's not. We're not stopping right here. Whatever we're going to be a million years from now is going to be very difficult to do. It's going to be very difficult to compare to what we are today. We're gonna. We're going gonna change. We're gonna evolve. We have to this point, we're going to continue to do so. Whether we evolve or they don't like the word evolve, they elect to use the word have only evolved with genetics, advanced, advanced, culturally advanced, biologically advancing our understanding of each other and advance even further in our ability to spread information. We're not done. So the evil almost motivates that work. It almost motivates that positive work to get things done.

Speaker 3:          02:23:48       yeah, because like the evil thing, after it's done killing everything good. It like cancer, the cancer cell, and this is genetics. It doesn't stop killing until the host is dead [inaudible] and then it, you know, it becomes the host and updates itself. It eats its own tail

Speaker 5:          02:24:07       well and even on a different way of looking at it, what we're talking about earlier about New York, about people experiencing that horrible evil of this attack and thousands of people dead and then millions of people being friendly to each other. There's this burst in the other direction

Speaker 3:          02:24:21       that was like, to me that was like, this is the messiah moment that first of all that wall street appreciated the work that people who do the actual work that makes things go. Like when they go to the wall and flip that switch. The people that make the electricity come, you know the people that raise their kids and put the food on their tables and grow it. Those people that do the actual work that they were being very appreciative and I thought this is a mind blowing fucking revolutionary moment in the United States. History were bullshit is not walking and bullshit is not talking, but reality and reality is being honored and people are so fucking happy. Matt, they were all smiling at each other. They were tripping over themselves to give somebody a hand. It was intense and I never will forget it neither.

Speaker 5:          02:25:11       I won't forget it either. I remember that feeling. It was a very, very, very strange time and it didn't last, but it let me know that that that time is possible, that things like that can take place where people do wake up and kind of realize and think. One of the big things

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       was that it happened here. We've been so lucky when you consider how much war the United States has been involved in and how little of it has been on the United States soil outside of pearl harbor, which is barely on United States soil. It's like it's in the middle of the ocean. It's Hawaii, Hawaii. I think it should be its own nation. I just do. I think it is a totally unique thing. I think it should have its own, you know, its own rules, its own government. I think they need the United States money for certain things because of that, but fuck that. It's moved to where it's like the leader of the United States because it's the only place where either they've outlawed gmos and China just said, we're not going to buy any gmo, so there you go. There's a whole market there that Hawaii is a very set up to be able to fulfill.

Speaker 2:          02:26:11       It's a paradise nation. It's a paradise in the middle of the ocean. The idea that it's a part of the United States, it's crazy, but they've been attacked. Pearl harbor thing was the only time, so we didn't have a point of reference, so we're involved in all this shit that's going on over the globe where we are involved in Iraq. We are involved in Afghanistan, but you and I and everybody that's here in America, we don't feel that. We don't. Unless you have friends or loved ones that are over there, you don't feel it. I don't know. I think people have send their children over there. Those people feel like there's a bunch of people who, who felt it and what's really sickening to me is that those people who sent their kids over there to fight for what, you know, an idea that they agreed with and that everybody agrees with, that's what they were sold.

Speaker 2:          02:26:55       And that's what they did. And then they come home to find that their pr, their parents, that class of people who've lost their homes. I mean, when people put that one together, I always hope, you know, of course I want, uh, the, the american people deserve healthcare. And if they had given us healthcare, they wouldn't had any war in Iraq. I want somebody to put that together too. That was all bankster bullshit to avoid paying for medicare for all because they needed to get away from what they call a socialist model. So they start breaking it down and it was all around healthcare and it would have been a whole fuck of a lot cheaper to just give people healthcare. But it wasn't, it. It paid off those private contractors who go over to other countries and not only do they blow everything up, but then they rebuild it.

Speaker 2:          02:27:48       Then they blow it up again and then they rebuild it. They're getting paid four times of doing that because it's just a fucking scam. When you say it's about healthcare, meaning that they shifted where the money would go, that it would have to go to war. so there wouldn't be money for health care. It was up there because they didn't want any socialist solution. I just say socialist solution, they call it, you know, they, they've got people thinking that socialism means you're behind barbed wire with a gun to your head or that you're weak and lazy and you don't want to do any work. But that's how you fucking a middle class. You take

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       the shit from the top and move it to the middle. So they just bullshitted everybody and you know, they, they use the way they always use. They use a lot of racism and they use an absolute classes, um, to divide people against each other and do their fundraising shit or you know, they and, and all the laws that they changed since reagan were deregulation laws and it was so that there were, they deregulated the insurance company, so like bosses can take peasant insurance out on their employees and so if they die, they get a kickback, judges get a kickback, you know, they took public money and put it in private pockets and they did it all through their lobbyists who sit in congress and have nothing to do with serving the needs of the people who sent them there. Now that is some bullshit. That's fucking hilarious. What it is. Sometimes you can write comedy like that.

Speaker 2:          02:29:10       Well, it's, it's, I don't think it's hilarious. I think it's disgusting, but I agree with you that it's hilarious. I'll fucking transparent it is. And I think that you breaking it down like that is going to let people sort of look at it from that point of view. They got everybody fired by boat flagged by both bible facts because you made me forget to verado nickname used to fucking catch phrases of bullshit

Speaker 4:          02:29:37       against it doesn't mean shit. You're not going to get shit for it. Right? Your kid ain't going to get nowhere. He's not getting any school. But like I have made my family was like, well, we need to be able to. This was like it in Hawaii to where this old lady gets up there. It made me so fucking mad. She goes, I'm 82 years old and I'm a I a, I may a gmo farmer. And um, you know, uh, I made it to. And if I didn't have my gmo crops, I wouldn't be able to send my grandkids, my children to college. And they get up there, their testimony. I want to go to college.

Speaker 2:          02:30:12       No, but I go up there and go,

Speaker 4:          02:30:15       I don't care how old you are, you don't have the right to give my grandkids asthma. Hello? But they don't, they don't commit to anything because there are fucking on dope for one thing. They're on all that fucking. They're depressed as fuck. America takes two thirds of the world's antidepressants and then they got to antidepressant booster on top of every year. If it doesn't make you forget reality quick enough and you know, they're just drowning in bullshit, but they, they, they want bullshit more than they want anything else. It's like a fucking incredible addiction.

Speaker 2:          02:30:54       Give us our bullshit. Give us our fucking bullshit. But it's all fucking bullshit. It's all fucking bullshit because it's. Truth is scary

Speaker 4:          02:31:04       because it's simple and they can't stand simple because they don't feel smart and less. It's all convoluted labyrinths of bullshit. The, the, the simple truth is fucking overwhelming to them because they're fucking liars. So they're like, hi, how am I going to stand here? Have something to come

Speaker 3:          02:31:19       out of my mouth. How am I going to do that? Um, I won't be getting paid for that. I mean, the people themselves that are addicted to the bullshit, like, what? What is, what's feasible? And that's why I say I don't use it. They, they have convoluted hope until people, oh, you, there's hope that you're gonna make it. There's hope you're going to climb out of that hole. There's hope, there's a payoff, there's hope you're going to win in the casino. There isn't any fucking hope. All there is is just, you know, united with other people helping each other to get rid of fucking criminals that are robbing us. That's certainly the best hope. So I hope that people will fucking wake the fuck up. That's where I hope. I think they are. I think. I think they are. I think that helped. That'll become an internet meme.

Speaker 3:          02:32:02       What you just said. Someone will take that and turn it into a clip. It'll be a video and people say roseanne barr brick shit down. Going to say I liked doing it for people because you know, they, you know, because I can and I like to just go and I'll read all the shit for you and I'll tell you what it means to. Because I feel like, hey, you know, uh, that's the service I can provide. Maybe I'm full of shit on some topics. Look it up for yourself and then come back and tell me if I am or not. I'll listen. But I mean, somebody's got to put this complete system of obsolete bullshit. They start laughing at to scorn and fucking replace it with something that fucking makes sense. I agree. I just don't know how it's going to happen. I wonder what's going to be the trigger.

Speaker 3:          02:32:44       I hope it's not something catastrophic. Some some sort of big event that has to take place in order for them to rebuild the whole thing and try to do it in some sort of ethical and moral way. But I to do is write down the debt. Like fdr did move the zero. It's easy. It's a fucking. It's a pen on paper. That's all they have to do. If they want, you know, things to get better in a fucking hurry. They can write down the debt of the american people. They can have a debt jubilee. They can forgive the debt. student loan debt. They can do that or if they want to, it's totally possible. Obama could like say, you know what? I'm kicking the federal. Reserve the fuck out of here. As a matter of fact, I've been a nationalize it and I'm going to nationalize monsanto too while I'm at it because I have that kind of power under the theater.

Speaker 3:          02:33:32       You going to do what you gotta do. Well, isn't that what happened to kennedy? I think so, but you got end lincoln and you gotta do what you gotta do and those guys are frigging, you know, they did what they had to do and they, you're going to get that fucking clothes. You know, it's not like you're going to top that. It's not like you're going to be, you know, after you know, nationalizing the federal reserve and monsanto. You're never going to top that. Did you think that getting a second fucking sitcom number one thing, you only get that once he's there with the chance he could do it. He could do something. Did you think that it was going to be different when he got into office now? I hate. I don't like him. I knew, I knew he was. I ran against him. I came in fifth. I spent $0. I came in fifth. I spent, I raised no money and spent no money. I came in fifTh. Wow. But uh, yeah, I ran against him because I knew he was a lobbyist. Like they all are. There was no real leaders. I mean, I think he's a smart lobbyists and I don't think he has any chance to, to do what he does because he's in that system, that system of, of banksters who runs it

Speaker 5:          02:34:37       against him in 2008. Is that what it was? TwElve. Twelve. Well, when he was coming out in 2008, did you have any belief in him?

Speaker 3:          02:34:45       No, I never have any belief in any republican nor democrat. I know they're just fucking lobbyists. You know, they're not real. Even politicians, you know, they're just liars. So basically it's fucking liars. Politicians make bridges between communities and people for, for, you know, money to come into that community. These guys don't fucking do any of that. They just take people's money and put it in their friends pocket. Like they know everything they do, that they're not a, nothing they do is in the public interest or, or for american citizens.

Speaker 5:          02:35:24       I hope your optimism in people figuring it out is founded.

Speaker 3:          02:35:28       Well, I pray that they will because I want to use that word because as long as there's an old crabby, whatever, I am, women like me, you know, that are there, that are able to come on anywheres and say, I'm praying that people will wake up and rejoin the human race. I think that's a pretty free society that you're living in

Speaker 5:          02:35:50       free as you can get in today's climate and and, But you know, they're working very hard to restrict those freedoms and that's what's scary about the nsa holding things on over people, digging into your email, being able to have things that they can pull on you. Like you were saying before that they're all a bunch of fucking people that have done shady shit and they know that they have secrets out there and they want to have your secrets as well and they want to hold them over your head and keep you from trying to change the system. So when a person like you comes along, that doesn't give a fuck, that's, that's when the truth gets hurt. When a person that doesn't have anything to lose,

Speaker 3:          02:36:21       you have comic. You got to tell you you can't get up here and then you can't fucking bullshit. You can'T live if you're just bullshitting people, you know, you, you want to hit them right fucking between the eyes and for me and like my idol, dick gregory and other ones. It's like I'm not even fucking make it funny. I'm just going to say it to you because it's like you have people. We have the power, right? We, we have the power, we have all the power that it takes to, uh, ensure that a better system is implemented with the least amount of cruelty possible. That's a great way you have it.

Speaker 5:          02:37:03       I believe we do. Dick gregory was the guy for a lot of folks. Don't know who put the zapruder film on television and made people. Yeah, he was the guy in 1970. Actually. It was a long after a 70. Something might not be me. It might have been 71. It was right after, um, uh, it was on the geraldo rivera show actually. They showed the zapruder film live on television, and back then geraldo was this antigovernment guy who's just like really controversial character. Look, we can waTch it right here. What year was it,

Speaker 7:          02:37:32       jamie? Back that up real quick. Just put on the back it up to the beginning. Okay. Straight out that if you are at all sensitive, uh, if your idol queasy then don't watch this film. Just putting on the late night.

Speaker 5:          02:37:51       They're going to show this film. This is geraldo rivera back when he was super slick with a beautiful mustache and lovely hair. And it was called good night America. And it was geraldo show. He was the most radical did he was a young man and he was a wild fuck. He was very different than he is now. His little fox news.

Speaker 7:          02:38:11       Bruter film.

Speaker 5:          02:38:12       Dick gregory got ahold of this video. Time magazine owned it from 1963 on zapruder. Submitted it to them in 1963. They bought it and then no one released it until 1970. What was it? Seventy what? Seventy five. So think about that. You're talking about eight years after the murder was the first time it gets on tv, and here it is. This is the first time people see kennedy's head explode on television and go back into the left. They'd never seen that before and

Speaker 7:          02:38:42       that all of the shots were fired from behind by lee harvey oswald alone, assassin firing at the president, and as you could see clearly the head is thrown violently backwards. Can completely.

Speaker 5:          02:38:54       That's a dIck. Gregory. Dick gregory. Put that on television. So your hero was responsible for something you didn't even know about. That was one of the big moments where people in the United States started going, what? The kennedy assassination was the one for me when I was. I was living in New York and my friend john, he had this buddy who was over the house who had this book that was a fucking wave it around talking all this crazy shit about this book. It was called best evidence by this guy david lifton. David liftin was an accountant start going over the warren commission reports and he was one of the only guys that was anal enough to go through all fucking who knows how many hundreds and hundreds of pages and find all these inconsistencies and contradictions and all this hypocrisy and craziness and all incorrect shit, and he. He made like a long list of what it was and explained and then went on this lifelong quest to get to the bottom of what happened during the kennedy assassination and the result was this book called best evidence that is one of the most analytical books ever and analytical about the crime in a way that was not emotional.

Speaker 5:          02:39:54       IT wasn't theatrical, wasn't trying to lead you in one direction or the other. It was just simply stating the facts like the reason why the single bullet theory was concocted in the first place. The single bullet itself appearing on connelly's gurney magically at the hospital and being responsible for going through to people's bodies and leaving more in residue of the bullets and connally's body. Then was missing from the actual bullet itself. So much horseshit involved in the concoction of the single bullet theory in the first place because they only did it because they had a. They had a makeup for a guy getting hit with a ricochet and the underpass. A guy went to the hospital and he got hit and he was doing interviews and talking about it. He got hit with a bullet that hit the curb stone and the ricochet hit him in the head so he.

Speaker 5:          02:40:35       This guy had to be treated so they had to account for that bullet and one of the ways the accounted for that bullet, it was all these different wounds on two different people. They attributed in the one bullet. Instead of saying, hey man, maybe they're getting shot from all over the place. We were getting shot from the front and shot from the back. They tied it all together. The first bullet hole and kennedy's neck. They turned thAt into a trake wound. It's a different wound in the protest. The Maryland hospital as it is, and the dallas hospital. The way it was described in the dallas hospital was an entry wound. The way it was described in bethesda, Maryland, by the time they got ahold of the body and fluid across the country, they turned it into a tracheotomy. You don't do a tracheotomy and a guy who doesn't have a head, the guy's dead, never heard any of this. They had to make something. They had to account for the fact that he had a hole in his neck, so they turned it into a trake wound. You've got shot from a bunch of different angles. There's probably several people shooting at them. One of them might've been lee harvey oswald. It's not an either or. You know, people say lee harvey oswald acted alone. I don't know. He might've acted that either or thing.

Speaker 3:          02:41:34       That's that binary mind control thing. so you'd go back and forth like you're getting all bipolar, you know, going back and forth, but you don't see the real truths. Right? Right there in your face. Here's the, here's some real facts of it. Not that those aren't real facts, but that Gerald Ford was the head of the warren commission that you know, came out with a, a certain report and then became the analects and president of the United States for a lot

Speaker 5:          02:42:01       the creep, arlen specter, he was on the warrant commission. THe warren commission was filled with criminals and crazy people, mad men that were designed to disseminate propaganda and dress it up as the truth. Whoever killed kennedy, whether it was lee harvey oswald delivered the shot or the idea that what we're getting is the truth, the whole truth and nothing, but that's the most hilarious thing ever. Why would they ever do that?

Speaker 3:          02:42:23       I don't know, but I agree with you, but did you see obama shaking raul castro's hand at mandela's funeral though? No. Did you hear about that?

Speaker 5:          02:42:31       No, but did you see the guy who was doing the fucking translation, the sign language at mandela's funeral? Just making shit up. TO me, that shows where there's a problem with conspiracy theory that most of the time it's in competence. It's human and competence more than anything else. And when you got a guy that's just making up sign language, shit standing three feet away from the president who, oh, by the way, when you go back in his past, turns out that he was arrested for murder and he might've been also responsible for rape. So it's like all these crazy accusations about this guy, he's a violence, gets a frantic. He'd already been arrested at one other time for doing that. Very same thing. He got in trouble rather for doing that very same thing. He did it before. I don't know how he got there. I don't know who hired him, but he had done that before we had gone up and pretended to be a sign language guy.

Speaker 3:          02:43:16       He's like, maybe they're given all, maybe they're telling obama something. Because remember when you went to south America and his guys got busted for the prostitutes.

Speaker 5:          02:43:25       Well that was actually secret service people.

Speaker 3:          02:43:28       But I mean, well maybe some of the people that get next to them, they're not really being vetted very well.

Speaker 5:          02:43:34       I certainly think so. I think it's incompetence. Like, like I was saying, I think there's more than competence in government than we would ever imagine and when you see that, because you can tell that the smart guide, the wizards there, dumb, well they're smart in some ways, but I think in order to fuck people over, you have to be a liar in order to be a lawyer. You got a lot of yourself. I don't think there's any people, any people that are dishonest, that are honest with themselves because if they're honest with themselves, they would recognize the terrible feeling that comes along with leaving, leaving a legacy of of sadness and destruction behind you. leaving a legacy of people upset about your, your personal actions. That's not a Way to be in harmony with life. That's not a way to be happy and that's why people,

Speaker 3:          02:44:15       but it is for those people. Like you said earlier, that are like, I just want to get over. That is a joy for them. I don't think so. In that way, I think those people are either die that way. I just ride that bitch right into the beach. I got my fuck you. That's all there is,

Speaker 5:          02:44:33       I think. I think even those people are not optimally happy and they they probably in some way in the back of the head realized that maybe they drank it away, maybe they pill it away, but the way to be happy is to make people around you feel happy and that's not the way to do it. Just by fucking people over and when you have a million dollars or a billion dollars and you got so much money in the bank that you can't even spend it all. You're not going to notice the victories. What you're doing is just continuing to play the game. Damn, that's really true. When you became super wealthy, do you mean you went from being this person who struggled with and you know, we're, we're really fucking in in poverty and then all of a sudden, boom, insane, incredible wealth. Once the dust settles you still, roseanne is still rosanna. You got to deal with new bullshit, but you're still, you.

Speaker 3:          02:45:16       I don't know if I'm still me. You don't know if he's still doing it. Destroyed my nervous system. I know that. I love to charge a harrison said that one time, but they said the beetle thing and he's like, well, the cost was our nervous system because of the fame. The pressure. Yeah. It's a lot of pressure. It's a lot of fame and you know, I couldn't handle it. I didn't know if I can even know what the fuck it was. And um, it just seemed like another bullshit thing.

Speaker 5:          02:45:42       How old were you when you, when you hit, when it really got crazy. So that's the same thing

Speaker 3:          02:45:47       saying I did. I was like, uh, you know. Yeah, I did go all the way. fucking nuts. First thing I did, I started like a given. I started giving away the fucking money because I have like basic beliefs. Of course they were all sold out and compromise now I was like, okay, you know, you gotta you do this, set this up. But I set up all of these crazy fucking nonprofit organizations. I used my money to like, you know, uh, try, try to do what I, what I really thought I could, you know, blows against the empire shit. And that was so fun because it's lIke being a pirate or something, but yeah, of course there's a certain time where it's like, you know what, I'm getting a face lift. And then it was like, then I got all gm mode like that. I get, I got fucking gem mode. It was exciting and especially because the pills I gave you, they give you these fucking awesome painkillers and shit. So I just kept having more and more surgery and you know, there, there was a lot of uh, psychotropic drugs and like I used fucking three or four. I about 15 nervous breakdowns. Luckily no one noticed.

Speaker 3:          02:47:06       Don't worry my fucking family around me noticing any difference. Wow. But you categorize that miss nervous breakdowns? Yeah, they were a shitload of them. It's a lot of pressure. A lot. It's, it's not fun. I mean, I, I admire people who are handling it well, but why don't you get up to that certain level. I mean, you know, I'm just saying a lot of people, they don't survive that level. And I would see that, you know, that

Speaker 5:          02:47:32       like when you see a miley cyrus going crazy or a justin bieber going crazy and everybody has their own criticisms of them, you have a particular way of looking at it. We like god, you know, you don't know what the fuck they're dealing with. No one knows. No one undersTands. You understand in a way that most people,

Speaker 3:          02:47:45       yeah, they, they, they can't trust anybody.

Speaker 5:          02:47:48       Everyone's crazy and their life is crazy. The reality is crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:47:51       Well, you know, they're just around so many vultures in and a crepe zoids um, you know, they don't know what the way, I don't know if they're coming or going,

Speaker 5:          02:48:02       plus the amount of fucking, just the impact of all those people staring at you all the time. And everywhere you go, you goT, especially now the paparazzi and their face everywhere. Like justin bieber can take a shit without someone having a camera in the toilet. And that's just the way it is with that life. And most people can't handle that.

Speaker 3:          02:48:18       That's like a stocking, like the media they want to stock yet because they want, they want to destroy you on camera, cause that'd be some good ratings.

Speaker 5:          02:48:26       Well they also feel like they're allowed to. They're allowed to just shove cameras in your face because you're the famous person.

Speaker 3:          02:48:31       Yeah. I wasn't first star that, uh, you know, I mean I had to pay a large amount of money in settlement, but I did make the mistake of hiring some fucking guns to beat the fuck out of some paparazzi and how much you have to pay for that. Oh, I hAd to pay them all. A few thousand. That's worth it. All the pop razzies kind of cash you got. That's worth. While. This was way back when, way back when, the good old days when I had to pay some money. I was like, yeah, these fucking people just fucking. They're jumping on my. I mean, you, you don't know what it's like when you were like panicked because you know, you're trying to leave a crowd and you're in your car and they're fucking jumping on your car and they're being encouraged to jump on your car and shit. It's like, you know, and uh, you know, some farm boys knocked on my window and I roll it down and then they're like, do you want us to beat the fuck out of them were from fucking Iowa?

Speaker 2:          02:49:29       Yes, I do, sir. They got that hay bale and strength and they just moved them out of the way so I could leave, but I was a sitting duck, you know, that kind of shit was weird. how often are you in California? You know, I, I come here every now and then. Will you, will you come back? We do this again? Yeah, it was fun. I enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed being with you.
