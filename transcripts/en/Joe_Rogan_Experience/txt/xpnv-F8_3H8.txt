They were sensitive about it, but it's festival people though, right? Once you go back to conquering hero, they'll forget about all that. You'll have a 10 minute aboriginal baby chunk open right over with that. Yeah. Just something again, something. Did you let it go? And I look on Australia, but the trip is, the flight is horrifying. Terrible your body too, right? I'm still not over the return. Really? Dude, I'm waking up at seven 30 and eight you last time I got up at seven get a job.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Sometimes I, sometimes I can edit things in the morning because my talent, my and impatient. So sometimes like man, too wordy. I'm good at editing things. Yeah. Cause I want to cut to the quick, you know, I just can't, I find sometimes I'm like whatever, some thoughts and boost of inspiration after I've laid down, I'll lay down.

Speaker 2:          02:15          It was great. A lot of wine tastings, romantic, romantic. But the only weird thing is like the whole city is based on wine. So everyone's ever getting wasted and drunk and it's all couples. But at 10 o'clock it's a ghost town. So we want, would you want swingers clubs? I thought there'd be like, you know, people hanging out on the street. No, not one car. Not One person. Every hotel though. No vacancy. No vacancy.

So you have to be every year that's conflict and paste that on top of top of the actual conflict and painted life would normally give. Do you think you create some just for material or did you take that you just so happened to be lucky in that you're blessed with a fucked up chaotic life that lends itself to a good comment. I say that you probably create more than anything you create more than any therapy world is exactly how you want it to be. That's right. Yes. This is like the secret we're giving you like two minutes. We explain the power of positive thinking, the law of attraction. All right. Yeah.
