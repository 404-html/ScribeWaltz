Speaker 1:          00:01          Freak bitches if you care about what you do, that's just part of the program. Absolutely. And that's it. There's a healthy part to that. And then like moving on from it is, it's easier now than it used to be. It would just, it would live in me for a while, like, oh dude, you forgot the words of that song. And then it becomes a mental block to get up there and you go, oh shit. Like, uh, you know, like a kicker or something, you know, a guy going to kick a field goal. It's like, Oh, I missed that one. I can't believe I did. Then the next one, oh my God, now it's a thing, you know? Oh, so getting over those mental blocks. Fighters lose a fight and then they come back and then you see the discomfort. You can see the confusion and the fear and that's, uh, that's one of the side, I think, psychological issues or some of the hardest issues that people ever overcome.

Speaker 1:          00:50          And it's just literally like a pattern of thought in your mind or if you just decide that you're not as good as you used to be, you can manifest that and they're like, physically you can do all the same things. That is so crazy. The power of thought. The power of my mind is it's pretty dangerous at times and being creative and make up all kinds of crap. You know, like a large was doing that just to fuck with me. I know it. And then you'd talk to them later. It's like, what are you talking about?

Speaker 1:          01:23          Yeah, that's, that's pretty. It's, it's, it's a curse and a gift that creativity, you know, how hard was it for you to get. So Uber a fear was a big motivator in that for me, you know, losing my family was. That was, that was the thing that scared me so much. That was the bottom. I hit that my family is going to go away because of my behaviors that I brought home from the road. I got kicked out of the house by my wife. I was living on my own somewhere and I, you know, I did not want that and maybe as part of my upbringing, you know, um, my family Kinda desitin graded when I was a kid, you know, father left my mother pass away, I live with my brother and then Kinda just all like the family, you know, where'd my stuff go, where, where it just kind of floated away and I do not want that happening, you know, no matter what's going on, we're going to talk this stuff out and make it work, you know, and my wife's have the same, uh, same idea, same thought that, you know, her, her family, she was the invisible kid too, you know, so we relate a lot.

Speaker 1:          02:32          So there's no way we're going to let you know, any argument, get in the way or just, you know, we're survivors, we're survivors and we're gonna. We're gonna talk through it no matter how much and you know, she, she did the right thing. She kicked my ass, right the hell out of the house, you know, and um, that scared the shit out of me. So. And she said, hey, you're not just going to the therapist now in nuts talking about this. You got to go and sort this shit out. So that's what I did. So Rehab did Rehab really worked for me. Helen, Jeff, to go for a while. What worked for me was a seven weeks someplace like basically tearing you down to bones, ripping your life apart. Anything you thought about yourself or what it was, anything you thought you had, your family, your career, your, anything gone strip you down to just, okay, you're born.

Speaker 1:          03:35          Here's how you were when you were born. You were okay, you're a good, good person. Let's get back to that again. And then they slowly rebuild you. And then I went to a, uh, another they call them aftercare places. I went there, uh, to a couple different ones and they fine tune stuff and get integrated back into life. Because when you're in this cocoon and your, your frigging raw, I mean, I was raw meat when I came out. And you can see it in that some kind of monster movie. I was pretty raw still. I didn't know what I could or what I should or shouldn't do, you know. Um, so the, the last place we went to was a place that helps relationships, so they got me and my wife together and we'd see people separately and then come together and talk about what we did and communication frigging saved my life, saved our family.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Um, and working through that stuff. So very grateful for my wife. She's the one that didn't ask for this shit. She walked through fire with me and we walked out together stronger, way stronger than we ever would have been before. And you know, my kids know my story, my kids know my struggles and they respect that. They respect me and a different way. I don't have to tell them what to do all the time or just be like, I'm this. I can say sorry. I can tell them, hey, here's what happened when I did that. And you know, I don't need to preach to them. They got their own stuff, but now they, now they goof with me. I ruined my trust with my family. And now by some miracle they are goofing with me. It's like, Dad, shut up. What do you get them like, come on, you know, your overblowing this your way out of dad, you're taken up way too much space here. Okay. So they helped me and I realized that there is help in a loving way. How long have you been sober now? 15. Fifteen years.

Speaker 2:          05:38          Did it start out when you, when you first started doing it, did it feel like as you broke through and you, you, you know, you went to therapy and you got out of Rehab and you, you're going through this whole thing. Was there a, like a shaky leg period where you're like, man, do I know who I am anymore? Oh, absolutely. That was, it was.

Speaker 1:          05:58          That is the power of the mind and how, you know, here's how my life works. And to actually just completely throw that away and start over, it's like, well, wait a minute, who am I without this? Um, uh, I can't talk to people. I'm like, I'm anxious, I'm shy. I'm all of the stuff that I thought booze was helping me with or you know, you know, booze, drugs, women, a shopping, eating, gambling, you know, there's so many things that can manifest out there that it's, it all goes back to one core thing. It's like I don't, I don't really know who I am. So it took years and years and years to figure out, okay, I like that. That's part of me and this is part of me. The anger, the, the, the, you know, the quirkiness, the dark part of me, all these little things that make me, I got to hug him, I to accept him, you know, and quit running from him and pretending like I am some immovable object on stage.

Speaker 1:          07:01          That's tough and you know, nothing can do, you know, nothing going to hurt me. But inside, yeah, it's kind of a cliche saying that, you know, the harder that external shield, the softer the inside and the more vulnerable and, and balancing that, you know, almost like you're concentrating so much on the outside that you ignore the inside. Totally. Totally. And then forget what I really want. And then you lose yourself in that other, that other person and yeah, being in a band certainly accelerated that, you know, there's, there was drink and drug and all kinds of stuff just thrown at you all the time and it's starts off as a fun little thing and then it turns into whiskey and escape and then all of a sudden you don't really, you don't remember why you're out there doing stuff. I went on tour just so I could go to the Strip club, you know, hey, we're going to this place, you know, and over going to drink here.

Speaker 1:          07:56          And you know, knew all that stuff. But the actual playing onstage, it kind of got forgotten about a little bit, you know, it was. We get caught up in the rockstar stuff and there's a, there's a song on this album, moth into flame that directly talks about the how fame can be this crazy drug. And it can completely take you over if you let it, you know, you're searching for that thing that's going to save you. And it's, it's you, it's in your, it's already there. You just gotta you just gotTa find it and accept it.
