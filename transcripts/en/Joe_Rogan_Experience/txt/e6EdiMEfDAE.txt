Speaker 1:          00:05:14       Ladies and gentlemen, powerful war machine. Let's go buddy. How are you man? Good man. I'm happy to be here. Happy to have you man. We, you and I have been friends for a long time. Know you from when you first entered into the UFC and all through your various legal difficulties in troubles. We've always remained friendly. So, uh, I was happy to have you on here man. And sit down and talk to you. And I think people have a fucked up opinion of you. That's, it's hard to form an opinion on someone based on them getting arrested based on internet battle. No, Amanda, I get all the time. I get. I get it. We're all be out somewhere at an after party and meeting people and they'll be like, hey, you know what man? Like I feel bad man. You know, I'm one of those. I'm one of those guys that always talking shit about you online and act. I feel guilty, you know, nobody, I don't worry about it. You, we're just, just, right now I'm,

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       I'm trying to anchor towards Jim and the new coach or there's Robert Follis and I'd never met him before. He's a great guy. I liked him. He, nobody. When I first got there before I was coming, someone said, hey, why don't you start coming? He's like, oh, well we'll see about that. Like, you know, I'll give them a trial run, you know, and like, you know, because you believe the rumors in him. He met me now every day he's like, I'm so glad to have you here, man. You train hard. You're a good guy. You know, like, but he doesn't know that. I know that he used to not like me. No, but I get a lot of flack for my shenanigans and uh, because it's blown out of proportion in a lot of things, you know? Well, it's definitely, some of it's blown out of proportion, but then, you know, you actually did some shit.

Speaker 3:          00:06:32       You did wind up going to jail for beating the fuck out of. Some people got a little crazy a few times, but I mean that's normal human stuff. You know, like everyone gets in fights. I mean I'm driving here today and an old lady was flipped me off on the side, you know, cutting me off. You know, people are violent, you know, it's, it does happen. It's a natural thing to get into a fight. You know, it does happen, but I'm, what I'm saying is like, it's not just, you definitely are a good marketer. You definitely put your shenanigans out there to get people excited about it and a lot of talk. I mean it's, it works. You mean your twitter feeds very active, you know, whether it's people hating on you or not. Yeah. I have no filter, you know, and it works good.

Speaker 3:          00:07:09       Like people know who I am and I have a fan fans gives it, but also I'm, I'm kind of on the black edge, but you know what I mean? Uh, some people won't touch me. Yeah, I'm sure like sponsors and stuff. Yeah. That. Or even if I was in the UFC right now, I'd be fired everyday probably. I was thinking that when I started the blowjob tweet think they would let you get away with. I'd be fired every single day. Why? Not Really? In my opinion, who cares? As long as you're not hurting anybody. It's one thing. We were also talking before the show started about Tiago Silva. You where you got a really good point. Like Tiago Silva should've never left Brazil. Yeah. Because you could act like that out of Brazil. Well, you know what? Here's the way I see it. Bring a man from 19 thirties a, not a criminal, a regular guy, you know, a lawful citizens and let him live today.

Speaker 3:          00:07:54       Guess what? He's gonna go to jail because there's so many strict laws now and everything's different, so you can't. You can't be raised with one set of morals and guidelines and then come live now when you can't do anything and we don't want to give the wrong impression about Brazil because I love Brazil and I'm a. I'm a huge fan of Brazil. I think Rio is like one of the greatest cities in the world, Annapolis, but I've never been. But the bottom line is Brazilian people didn't more relaxed about the way they do business. They're more relaxed about the. I mean, they're very aggressive men too. I mean there's a reason why the UFC and mma, like all of it originated Valley Tudo originated out of Brazil. Sure. There was fights going on all over the world. There always has been. But Brazil has a very special relationship with violence.

Speaker 3:          00:08:39       It's a third world country. Yeah. So, I mean, the police, I don't know if it is anymore. No, no. Uh, the, the economy of Brazil has boomed so much over the last decade. Apparently they discovered oil offshore and resale and. Yeah. And there's a bunch of other economic factors that have led their economies like very strong right now. It's actually, they're probably, you know, they, they, they're probably one of the biggest growth countries over the past few years based on the United States is made with this treatise country of own violence. Like did a, like fights when I was in England, people were getting into bar fights and the cops came and broke it up. No one to jail. It was like, oh, Paul daily, what do you beat that guy up? And he got what? What happens if he's not in jail? Right. I went to jail. Who did Paul Bailey daily beat up some guy in a bar fight.

Speaker 3:          00:09:21       Remember he lost, he lost his visa. He couldn't fight in Bellatore. Oh, I didn't know. That's why he lost his visa and me like, I got a bar fight with the 300 pound guy a year in jail. Four times, you know, he's in. It wasn't his first offense. He had multiple offenses and no jail time, you know. Well, you know, they look at, you got a hand grenade tattooed on your neck. You got, what does it say on your knuckles? Dga. I don't give a fuck. I mean, come on man. Hey, if, if I didn't know you, I would assume like this guys are paid, but if you watch problem he watched on youtube the first case. It's on the screens. Cameras. They're my best friends. Navy seal. He starts the whole fight. He beats up everybody. I don't jump into. He gets jumped and I'm the only one they even got arrested.

Speaker 3:          00:10:02       So you got arrested just because it would make publicity and I think because. All right, are we going to charge a navy seal that just won a bronze medal? Bronze Star or just wild maniac warmer sheet who did porn and I kicked out of the use and that is don't give a fuck. Tattooing. It's like they're not going to get the war hero because my friend's mom was like, Hey Ryan, how come John is going to jail? You did everything. That's not fair. And Ryan's like, we don't know. You know, whatever it happens, you know? But that's. Well listen man, you know, because I know if you're in the wrong place, the wrong time, anything can happen. That's why I don't go out anymore. Do period smart. I can't. I can't risk it, which is smart and we're also not trying to make light of what happened with Tiago Silva.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       I don't know the specifics. I don't know the rules. I don't. I don't know. I mean or rather the facts. I don't know if he had a weapon. I don't know what the fuck happened. I don't even remember much different rumors. Yeah, but I liked that guy. The way he fights. He's, he's a bad motherfucker. He said dangerous too. It's tough. But you know what the. I know the one thing for sure it was a woman was involved and people go crazy with their wife, women's involved so that anyone is acceptable. Susceptible to going crazy when the white one, the one that loves involved so it doesn't excuse it, but who knows what happened, you know, who knows? Yeah. It's apparently it's his ex wife and I don't know what the story was, but apparently there was an armed standoff that was with the take the papers and all the press was reporting.

Speaker 3:          00:11:18       I don't know if there was any weapons involved. I really have no idea. But it sucks, that guy's gone now, you know, he was a great fighter in the UFC there. He's never going to fight in the UFC again. And uh, it, it sucks if whatever he did actually happen, it sucks way more for the people that were as victims of, of course. But it just sucks that a guy like that, I can't keep it together, you know, especially if you're a fan of the sport and you're like watching them fight their guys. You always know you're going to have a fun fight with. That guy was in there. I was, I enjoyed watching them because I was. Yeah, but that your point about like a guy like that growing up in Brazil, you know, growing up, kind of wild coming over here and everybody is so conservative, so much.

Speaker 3:          00:11:57       So many laws and so much buttoned down on behavior. You read about England to man, they, they, Doug Stanhope has a whole bit about it. A lot of countries, man. I mean a lot of countries fight as long as it's one on one. Hey, that's cool. You know, there's no, nothing can happen, but America is strict. It's no joke with that stuff. Yeah. It's rarely hear about UFC fighters getting in fights though. If you look at, it's really pretty, pretty amazing in comparison. Like, like, you know, Badr Hari that motherfuckers always getting in trouble, you know, which is another terrible situation because he's like one of the most exciting kickboxers on the planet. Love watching that guy fight. But he's always in trouble. He, you know, he had to go to Morocco for awhile and, and, and, and hide. And then he came back and he had to deal with this issue and then a new issue came up.

Speaker 3:          00:12:39       Some dude got his legs stomped at a club. You know, I think it happens more than we think. I think that, uh, people don't, they just get lucky to get away with it. I'm the worst because I have, I've had two twins, tattoos. I'm screwed. Is that what it is? Yeah. Because they're like, oh, what happened? There was a fight. A guy had a grenade on his neck. All this, punch that into the computer. You know what I'm going to do, it doesn't matter, you know, but uh, you know, someone else maybe no tattoos. It was a white guy. He was kind of most, I don't know, unless you, unless you recognize them, you know? Yeah. And well, I'm glad you're deciding to stay in now. I have to keep away. Jail Sucks. I'm sure dude was. I was in the whole, you know, it was boring.

Speaker 3:          00:13:16       Did they put you in solitary while the, uh, the first year I did, my first six months was in the regular and then uh, after that I got in an argument with, with the sergeant and then one of the cops, hey man, that guy's a UFC fighter, whatever. If it's a walk my, he should be, he shouldn't be in general population. They put me in the holding the last six months. Why? It's just because you're a UFC there saying like, well, how come I know that he could have ordered people to attack me or another inmate? So he put me in the hole. Then the second year when I went to jail, the whole year in Vegas, I was in the whole the whole time because they already knew I wasn't just stuck me in there. Wow. For how long were you in the hall? The whole year?

Speaker 3:          00:13:47       The second year. The whole year by yourself. What? You know, what, it sounds bad, but it's kind of better because there's no chance to get in trouble for me at least. I don't know, like after a whole, you know, you get aggravated one day and then there's those guys in our fake tough guys and they want to be jerks and there's always a little politics. You get in one little fight and next thing you know, I'm back in jail for, for who knows how long, you know. So especially depending upon what happens because I was in jail in San Diego when I was in the mainland still. And these guys were playing chess or pushups and uh, it was a little Asian guy looked at him. He was actually from mom, Burma. Nice old man. He was only in there because him and he had a wife and three kids and a tow truck driver was towing his car and he was like, no, no, no.

Speaker 3:          00:14:30       Try and stop them until the car. He pushed the driver so they put them in jail for assault. Right. While she was in there, he's playing chess with a, with another guy and they bet 100 pushups. The Burmese guy, he won and he goes, Oh, you pushups pushups? And the guy's like, Nah, I ain't do shit. And like, oh no, it's not fair. You know, like what? What are you gonna do? And starts punching the Burmese guy. He hit him like three, four times in the guy who a, he closed his eyes, one overhand right, knocked the guy out, the guy died, the guy fell down, hit his head. They charged him with. They charged him with murder and it's on camera like, you know damn well that was held fence charged him with murder. I don't know what happened to that guy he was in.

Speaker 3:          00:15:07       He was in when I saw him in the hole, he was there every day meditating. He was the nicest old, like he was probably like 45, such a nice guy and that's a sad, sad story, you know, and like, and you know that that can happen. And then he's, he's, you know, he's Buddhist. So he's brainwashed. This is my Karma. It's okay. This is the plan for Godly accepting it, man. This is bullshit man. Like I felt so bad. It made me want to cry. I felt bad for that guy. Yeah. There should be room in the system for reason. Like with a guy like that. It should be a guy like that. You should be able to pull the guy side and go, what? Tell me what happened, man. What's your version of the story? See that? And they should be like this. No, just don't do this again.

Speaker 3:          00:15:44       And we're cool. You just don't hit anybody, you know, call the authorities if you have to toe, toe, toe touch people. And the guy would probably be like, it'll never happen again. And then you're good. You don't have to put a guy like that in a cage. Well, you know, I was reading, reading like all these surveys and stuff and articles, but they were saying that like we, we have more people in jail than any country by far by far. Like we incarcerate people five times more than England and then end a second, second place. We have more prisoners in California and the whole country of Canada and the crime rates are the same. So why is everyone in jail? You know, I don't understand it. It's a business, but will, that is the thing that is, that's a crazy thing to admit and it's a crazy thing to talk about because most people, it sounds so unreasonable.

Speaker 3:          00:16:23       It sounds like conspiracy theory. It sounds like you're saying that. Oh, I can George Bush plan nine slash 11 and almost sounds the same thing. The prisons, they make profit off of putting people in jail. What do you want to charge me for a stamped envelope? It was like eighty nine cents for stamped envelope. Do stats forty four cents. And how much does the envelope? They're taxed you and everything. Everything's taxed a lot. It's like selling drugs better than drugs. Well, that's just what's going on for that, but the actually the private prisons are getting paid. You get paid by the government, by the government to the amount of prisoners that they have is directly proportionate to what they get paid. Yeah. And then I was reading, um, that's crazy. I was reading an old stats, right? So they said, okay, a, a year in jail, cost to the state, $55,000 something dollars for a year, right.

Speaker 3:          00:17:06       A year. And um, uh, what's called house arrest costs $5,000. House arrest your half is likely to receive, to do new crime. Right. So they know that it's a fact. So why wouldn't you put the gun on house arrest if it's only for a year and save space in jail, you know, because, because you know, what happens, is that a year in jail, it was like, oh, it's only a year. Yeah. But guess what, you lost your job. You lost your credit. He lost her house, she lost her car. So you come out with nothing and then you're like, all right man, I wanted to do good, but I'm going to do one more crime to get some money and then I'll. Then I'll be straight again. But when you on house arrest, it's like a year. You're still jail. You can't do nothing. Fun. Jail to work or no home work, home to work.

Speaker 3:          00:17:46       But at the end of that year you didn't lose your credit. You didn't lose your house, you didn't lose your car. So you're like, fuck, I don't want to get in trouble again. And, but you, you don't have to start from zero. You still where you were, you know, but the government doesn't get paid when you under house arrest, 25 grand, you know, instead of 55. But it should work on what works better, you know, I don't know man. It was jacked up system that was in there. Well it's, it's, it's for profit system and any for profit system becomes an organism. An organism is protect themselves. And that's what they do. I mean, when you find out that prison guards lobby and the prison guard unions and they lobby to make sure that certain drug laws are in place, they want certain drug laws in place to ensure that there's a certain amount of prisoners.

Speaker 3:          00:18:25       That's crazy, man. That's slavery. That is, that is fucking slave. It is dude. And, and just like the same thing all across the, you know, the inner cities, they're canceling afterschool programs and, and all this stuff and they're building more juvenile halls. What a coincidence. So you're going to fuck in these inner city kids. They're going to, they're going to gang bang or they're gonna play sports. You know what I mean? That's a lot. You hear the stories of these kids and why I play sports, stay out of trouble. Well now there's no sports. When I'm a gang, Bang, now there's more juvenile halls and they want that. It's fucked up, man. Right? If you were, if you were trying to follow a conspiracy, that would be the exact correct thing to do to make sure there's more crime. If you were going to try to prevent crime, save lives, you would do the exact opposite thing.

Speaker 3:          00:19:05       You wouldn't spend the money on juvenile halls. He had spent it on community centers. You spend it on counselors spending on people. Look, I saw your story on pellets about your father dying when you were young and I grew up without my dad. I haven't spoken to my dad since I was seven and I think that um, a lot of young men, especially growing up without any sort of father figure, I can get it into a fuck load of trouble. You can get so distorted and twisted. It's like one of the easiest ways for a young man grew up fucked up to not have an example for sure. We somehow or another we need, we, we like identifying, we sort of like, we connect with these examples. Positive examples or negative examples. Yeah. And there's also the issue that a lot of people deal with where, you know, yeah, they're fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:19:54       Yeah. They're in trouble yet either. But they grew up in a piece of shit household. They grew up with an asshole for a dad. They know we're not all starting from scratch, like everybody's not starting on the same level. Some people start the game at fucking homebase. They're already done their one. Their parents are rich, everyone's friendly, they're done. And some people from the jump. Your life has challenged from the jump. It's this food, there's poverty, there's a, there's a salt, there's all sorts of shit that you're dealing with in your house on a regular basis. Like, you know, people say that, you know, I'm, I'm a maniac, right? I'm more out there than most people. But like, I mean, I don't like to complain about my life, but for I turned out pretty good for considering, you know what I mean? And if it wasn't for me finding an outlet and weight lifting and sports and all that stuff, I would have been a maniac. Well, for sure, you know? Yeah. I mean, because you, you, you know, you went through a lot of crazy shit for sure,

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       but you've always been a good dude to talk to and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to have you on the podcast because that's where I think that people get the wrong impression of you. It's like a lot of people in the same circumstances have, you would have turned out even worse and that's the reality of life about knots. We don't start off in the same place. We don't even know what. I was actually on a pretty good track. My Dad died when I was 13. I gave him CPR. He died, right? So I went to live with my mom and she was a drug addict and my step dad's a drug addict. The losers, right? It was a mess and I had no rules, man. I could do anything. I wanted no rules, but I want. I found a gym I went to.

Speaker 4:          00:21:23       It was a little hole in the wall. Jim's called mips gym and seeing value. That's where I grew up, but it was all like cops and firefighters and ex military. And there's an old crusty navy seal, his name's Jim Taylor. He was like 55 x Vietnam Guy. Right. And he came be. He became kind of like my dad. So I was actually, I pictured when I was in, I was Jackson. I was a kid bro. Like I was like this in high school because I lifted weights, I played sports, I had all a's and b's, you know, I didn't get into. I got in fights, but that was it. All good grades a all always sports. I want to be a navy seal. I went to the citadel for college. I was a biology major and now you know, I was doing everything good now sucked it up.

Speaker 4:          00:21:58       I did everything right. And then after my sophomore year I go to the guidance counselor's office and they're like, hey, you go with $15,000 from, from, from this year. I was like, wow. My mom gets my dad's pension. He was a cop. They get that money every month. It turns out my mom spent all the money on drugs that's been on drugs and my stepdad's attorney, because he did have a fraud case, right? So as, hey, they said, well, the navy wanted to give me a scholarship for my last few years and commissioned me afterwards, but they weren't going to back pay what I already over the 15 grand. Right. So they said we gotta either you've got to pay this or we got to freeze your credits. And, and I, I couldn't even transfer my credits. So I did. I went into meltdown psychomotor because I mean I sucked it up all that time and like didn't drink, didn't do drugs, trained, did community service, all that stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:22:46       Good grades. And I went home, dude. And I beat my stepdad almost to death. Almost killed him. I beat him bad, like there's blood on the ceiling. I smacked him so bad. And then like, then I got arrested for like mayhem, attempted murder, all this stuff because I beat him so bad. But I told the cop straight up, I say, man, I said, I told them. The truth is my dad was an lapd cop. I said he died and I was 13. I started freaking busted my ass, went to a military college of citadel. I have all a's and b's, biology major. These fuckers spend my dad's money on drugs. You know what I mean? I came home and I asked him why he did it and we got in a fight and I said I couldn't stop eating them. That's what happened, you know, and the cop was there. Sounds like self defense to me. Saved my ass. I would have been when you were 17 that then I was 20 or 20 points you. I'm sorry. You were, you were, you were when you went to college, you were 17 or 18? I was 18 when I went to freshman year. So we use, we stand at home during this time or Carolina at college, but I'll come back to summers. So they were out here? Yeah, they're out here in Simi Valley. So you had no idea that they were spending your money? They were paying for the

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       tuition

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       for sure. What happened was when I was, my dad died, we all got his money every month after that when we were kids. When I turned 18 kid in my name, so my freshman year I paid the bills, but it's a base. It's like a college, but it's a base. You can't, you can't really. It's hard to handle the bills. Say Mama, I'm going to put it back into your name because you know, just send the check every month. Oh boy. She fucked me over. You know what I mean? So I got out, I was so pissed and I went, I just went berserk mode. I beat him up, got in trouble, and then that's when I packed my bags. I moved to San Diego, I went to the lion's den. I said, hey, can I say I want to try out for the for you guys as team?

Speaker 4:          00:24:21       And he's like, you, you know, I heard they have tryouts. Tells Tony Glendo days running. Yeah. Well Ken was there, Tony Vernon, white, all those guys. They said, well the next trial is now for three months. So I got a job. I actually, I got a job at a strip club, pure platinum with a fake id. I was only 20 and I had a 21 year Id. I got a job, was bounced down the Strip club and I was just going to bally's and running and lifting weights. I don't know really how to train really, you know what I mean? And I went and tried out for the team and I made the team and that's how I started fighting. Really? Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:24:49       So you basically, you were an angry dude but you were keeping it together and trying to do good and trying to stay positive and this one event sent you into this fucking crazy spiral because that happened.

Speaker 4:          00:25:00       And then um, actually when I first got home I still sucked it up. I didn't beat him up yet. I got home and I was just like, furious. And I was like trying to figure out a solution. Right. And actually, uh, my, my brother's Po was, he was on probation for, for weed. My little brother, he came to the house and he's like, hey, we're sharing a room because I want to ask you some questions. He's like, is this yours? Is his. I said, that's mine. That's mine. And there was like a plate with a knife on it, like a kitchen plate was death. And I said, I want to do this. Almost somebody was eating due to sign knife. I was like, it's my house was eating. He goes, all right. And like, and the cop goes, uh, you kind of have an attitude.

Speaker 4:          00:25:35       I said, yeah man, I, I don't really want to talk to right now. You know what I mean? What in your house? Yeah, what do you guys want? I'm not on probation. My brother is because you don't. I'm gonna Search you. I was like, no, no, you're not. He's like, yeah, animals are not me, bro. And he grabbed my wrist and I pull my wrist back and the all four jumped on me did. He jumped on me Bro. And I was like holding my hands together and they couldn't get me down. They're pissed because I was jack that I was struggling. I could wrestle too, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:25:57       and the dog down and I was like, are you guys fucking serious? You have to fucking pussies. They're fucking pitch. Just clench your hands. Gave me their fucking freaking out. And it was wood floor and it was slippery. Take down defense for dudes. Even if they suck at wrestling because they are counteracting each other. Um, you know, there's like, you know what I mean? They're helping me and really so funding. I slipped and as you can have them, you want to fucking. They cuffed me and then they beat the fuck out of me. Dude. Once they cuffed to beat the shit, I'm was like, what are you guys doing? That's Jonathan, not Michael. So

Speaker 4:          00:26:39       they knew I wasn't in, so I still think nothing's going to happen. They're gonna let me right, fuck no. They arrested me for assault. Two counts of assault on a police officer resisting arrest. They, their story was that I came downstairs and said, I'm Michael Down the Po knows my brother. Like they lied. Right. So they scared me. They scared me. A didn't, Diego's, Oh, we'll just plead guilty to a misdemeanor resisting arrest and nothing will happen. I said, fine, I'm fuck you. Whatever. I did it and then I get home and then I was just like, good explore. The whole time. My Dad was a cop. I was raised Republican. Cops are good governments. Good. I wanted to be a navy seal. I want to. I love the country. I said, I never believed stories. The cops fuck you up. I thought my dad said, that's a lie. You know what I mean? That's a lie. The cops are the good guys. My whole life is flipped upside down. I said, fuck this, and I beat my step. Dad's death. That's what I find. That's what I it the cops. It was dirty cops for she to beat your Stepdad's head and that, that, that right there changed me. If you, if I knew myself as a kid, I would hate myself. I'll be like, well, she's a piece of shit. He's an antiemetic. I was so down for the country down for cops done for

Speaker 3:          00:27:48       if you knew yourself when you were 18 years old, when you knew you knew yourself of today. Oh, it hit me. Wow. I think I'm a piece of shit. You know what I mean? Wow. I totally changed my whole thing, but isn't that incredible that just a few events like that can. Especially when you're a young man can just steer your life in one way or another can stick to you. Are you down a road? Like if you, if you're, if you'd never put that money in your mom's name and you continued paying your bills and you dealt with all your tuition, who knows? You would have probably been a fucking war hero or something. I'd be, I'd be Brian, Stan, you know, one of those characters. I'd be super brainwashed. I was maybe, maybe not. I mean, you know, as you get older, you're, you're smart. You're not. You want to start questioning shit.

Speaker 4:          00:28:31       My two best friends are seals, right? There's got out. But like, uh, they, they question, you know what I mean? Like they're not the same. When they came in, there were not.

Speaker 3:          00:28:40       It's kind of bullshit. I have friends who not only served but went on and worked for Blackwater and they question everything they do. They do for the money. Well, they do it because look, my buddy who went to black powder, he was getting like 30 grand a month started. Jim bought a mustang

Speaker 4:          00:28:55       boy fucking. He was guarding the oil ships for the pirates, so it was four be four x. He was on the ship and the pirates come and they blast them doing.

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       Yeah. I see videos on the head. Cam said, well, the crazy thing about the pirate situation and people don't even know why those poor poor fucking people because another fucked up situation. Somalia had never had a history of violence like that. They weren't like people that would kidnap. They were doing it because they were kidnapping these European captains of these boats that were dumping toxic waste off their shores. So is that why your fishermen to Somalians were fishermen and so all these fish were dying and they're fucking starving and then people getting birth defects. All this pollution in the water, the fish are polluted. It's like really bad. They dumped nuclear waste often, so the Somalian start kidnap the captains to these boats and holding them ransom for crimes against the environment. So when they did that, they were making millions of dollars so then they'd be like, fuck fishing, fishing.

Speaker 3:          00:29:52       But they're like, look, there's no fish left. I mean the Fisher, they don't untold tons of toxic waste off the shore of Somalia. See, I didn't know that. That's supposed to know. You don't even know all of these things. We think we think these assholes are just. They're just pirates. They want to. You know what I mean? I don't know the story of my friends don't know the story. I bet my name is Cielo friends. I don't know if they had that in that Tom Hanks movie. I didn't see that movie, but that's an important part of why those fucking deal. It's not like you just fell upon a village of [inaudible] and they all machine guns. They're hopping into boats now. These poor fishermen for thousands of years and we ruined their fish in like that for thousands of years. These people live the exact same way. Fishing, living off the land, having a good time, you know, getting by and all of a sudden some assets to dunk nuclear waste off duty.

Speaker 3:          00:30:39       I said, I always say technology is the great evil dude. Well, some humans are evil. Who's technology mean before technology? You know, Gingiss con was evil as fuck. I mean there was, there was people that would be, I guess both our technology. There's technology for back then people were, you know, do we have a great propensity for evil and for good, but I mean now, I mean like as far as like the world was. I mean as it was all of history as far as in the last hundred years with technology, we polluted. Everything's fucked up. That is true. You know what I mean? So I'm seeing that technology. I know in my. My thing is, is that because I believe that the Michigan Lincoln Shit, all that shit was really alien to know. Do you really believe that? I've written. I read the best books. I've read a ball to the twelfth plants series.

Speaker 3:          00:31:24       Yeah, yeah. Zechariah stitching fucking good at it. Makes more sense than anything else you've got to go to. Situation is wrong. Dot Com and then they prove them wrong thing. Well, the. Here's the deal. A lot of what he, based on his, his interpretation of some really bizarre old tax, but what's really incredible about the Sumerians was how much they absolutely did know. There was many, many first came out of that area as far as we know. First we'll first written language, first agriculture, first, mathematics, first written language that we're aware of it, and they had a Godfrey's thing. That's why I was thinking it made sense that, Oh God, for math, because that was the elite and the thought of math. You know what I mean? The God for fucking I'll culture. Well, that guy showed me how to fucking make a farm. It could be.

Speaker 3:          00:32:09       It could be. We had no way to prove either way, but I figured like, look at this, look at the. Look at the earth. We're the only thing that doesn't belong here. We're the only thing on this earth that doesn't live on the earth, were wearing clothes with live in the buildings. Everything else is living on it for real. We're all like, we're like, we don't belong here. Like, like we're out of place with the only thing that's out of place. It's kind of like, like we're half fucking alien, half human. We don't belong here. You know what I mean? Like us as dogs, dogs are like us, but they live. They live off the earth. Yeah. But you know what I'm saying? How they're very. Like, it could be like me and Shaquille o'neal

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       are the same species. We could buy the same woman pregnant. It doesn't make sense. You know, it's like a giraffe and a horse being able to get a cow pregnant, you know? It doesn't make any sense. Like we don't look anything alike. They'll bridge it to midget and Michael Jordan. They're the same species. How the fuck is that possible? That's not the same. Just like dogs. Dogs are the only animal that we're aware of that have that kind of arrogance that can interbreed like that. It's, it's a very strange thing because we know that dogs were human manipulated and then the whole argument with people that were the reason why there's a quote unquote missing link, which are I guess apparently when you talk to people really understand biology, there really isn't a missing link. It's just a matter of the fossil record been very difficult for all the pieces.

Speaker 1:          00:33:21       See the fossil record, the issue with fossils is if you die or I die right here. So like say if there's a gas leak in this building and explode, we're not gonna leave. A fossil man has stuck. It has to be stuck in mud or something. So it's real hard to make a fossil. So there's probably. And not only that, humans are smart, so the odds of them getting fossilized are probably less likely than a dumb ass. Buffalo falls into a pit and all his buddies fall right in after them cause they're all fucking stupid. Nobody figures out how to get the book makes such good sense because it's like how they said that they came here and we were like, the in between links, like the monkey is Kinda guy like, well these things were fucking smart, but they're not smart enough to do what we would want them to do.

Speaker 1:          00:34:00       They're kind of, they're still like animals, you know, always put some, put some our genes and I'm smart and I'm up. Well, you know, possible. Who knows? It's sexy. It is, but you know what? Because you know, like the Old Testament or the, all those stories, if you read them in the terms of not God but aliens. That makes way more sense. Well, that's the switch and said he's a nephew, limb. He said he got in trouble when he was in school because he said that their translations were incorrect. He said that the Nephilim, uh, you know, they would call them giants amongst men. He was, he was saying that isn't, it isn't the eggs. The actual translation shouldn't be those who came down, meaning those came from above. And then the Annunaki, the literal translation. Apparently as those from heaven to earth came, the idea that they came from some guys.

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       Yeah, look, if we put a fucking robot on Mars in 2014 and we could watch realtime video that moving around, that's a fact that things up there. Humans are just one form of intelligence. If the universe is filled with intelligence, I guarantee you they're going to want to check out what's on other planets. Why wouldn't they? Why wouldn't they send things? We're trying to go places course and we would definitely visit if we could, if we could visit Mars, we haven't been able to figure out how to do it yet, but they're trying to figure it out there. We might be 20 years away from a person going to Mars, so if that's the case, why wouldn't someone come from another planet? The real problem is nobody agrees with that. Guys, translations. That's one one problem and the other problem is that all these people want to believe in. It's so bad. It's so sexy that they don't look it at it as a. maybe they gravitate towards it and they run with it like this is the aliens came and they work with our

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       DA. Are you sure bitch you're not. You're not sure, but it makes more sense than the Bible. It definitely makes more sense to the Bible, but it's probably related. If I could pick, I'd rather of the Bible to be true. I want to go to fucking heaven. Just such thing. You know what I mean? I'd rather have that true. I'd rather have Santa Claus all the fairytale fairytales. True, but I just think it makes more sense if there's an option Bible aliens. I'm picking the aliens. I don't think it's an either or option. I mean, first of all, the real problem with the Bible is like that telephone game. You know, you tell your friends story, he tells time, it gets back to you. It's fucked the stories. Fuck. And they told the stories of the Bible for over a thousand years before they ever wrote them down.

Speaker 3:          00:36:14       The oldest version of the Bible they have is in Aramaic and it's founded in these, these clay pots in a place called Qumran and it's called the Dead Sea Scrolls. Yes. That's the oldest version of the Nag. Hammadi scrolls wherever. The other ones. Yeah. There's, there's quite a few ancient animal skins. Actually. Even the Samaritans had almost the same story. It's just different names. It's an old story. From what? From what? Who's taught, who taught us that? Well, it could be a bunch of different things, man. I mean, you stop and think about the variance in how far cultures of advanced today. Like you could today. You could go to the Amazon and find some marine forest people that never seen people. You show them your watch, they'd be freaking out. You show them a laptop, they think you're a fucking wizard. I mean, just think about that today.

Speaker 3:          00:36:58       But that happened in World War Two, right? Yes, it did. Island, they're from, um, chariots of the gods, a Erich von Daniken documentary. Like we gave them candies and shit. And like they thought we were a. and they built fake airplanes. The worship, they want us to come back and whenever he came back and we want to. God, that's exactly. Exactly. Yeah, that's exactly what it's like. I think that if you're a superintelligent race or a super intelligent civilization rather, and you run into someone of your own race that just happens to be trapped in the outback of Australia and living off the land, they would have no idea that within a thousand years they had been living like this. Which cultures exist in the same static state for a thousand years all the time, but look what's happened in this country. Just 200 fucking years crazy. There's no America. Three hundred years ago it didn't exist.

Speaker 3:          00:37:46       There was nothing here. There was no buildings. There's no roads and in 300 years you got la, Chicago, New Orleans, and fucking fucking chaos all over the place. That's a blip in time. So for these people living in a static state for a thousand years, all of a sudden people come in. Then they tell stories about these people. Those people are fucking alien span. They came, they had chariots. Horses drove them around like when the ink is first saw, the uh, um, the Spaniards, they thought they were fucking God's people on horses. They thought they were a part of the horse. They didn't even know what the fuck was going on. They thought it was quite so quantile returning. They had no idea was happening. They were freaking out. So I think that those stories, when you, you, you're dealing with over a thousand years of them telling them back and forth before anybody writes them down. Then they write them down. They write them down an era man, they

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       write them down in ancient Hebrew and meech and Hebrew. They, they only know like three out of four words today in ancient Hebrew and letters were numbers like the word God and the word love. They had the same numeric value like words like war machine would have a specific numeric value that would not just represent your name but also like what you are and like a person who your lover or your mother would represent. We have a certain number to it and that was important in the waist sentence, was translating information. They lost all that shit when they translated it to to Greek, into Latin, and they did all that's missing and say you get this flat interpretation of this really bizarre, ancient language. That was a language that it was also numbers. It was a math and a language together. It's hard for us to even wrap our heads around, which is crazy that people fucking really, really believing kill for it like they want to believe because if you don't believe, then you have this open ended questions. Everybody likes to be fucking comfortable. I'm pretty wants to retire. Everybody wants to run the win. The lottery. What they don't understand is the beauty's in the struggle. The beauty is in the struggle. Really appreciate life. You've got to know you're going to die. You've got to know it could be all over. That's how you really appreciate it.

Speaker 4:          00:39:48       That's true. It's just like fighting, you know, like, uh, when I was brand new you, you envision or when I feel like I'm in Tj fighting in Tijuana, right? And like when I be in the UFC was gonna be this way. I get to doc and it ain't that way. It's Tj. It's the same thing. It's the same fight, but just struggle. It's just dominick Cruz, you guys live with them, you know, he's been wanting buddies all like, now you're the champion. He's a champion. It's not real for him. Like people that don't know him seeing me as the champion, but for him he's still him and like he's fighting for the belt. He has the boat but it's not real. It's like the first time I ever saw like my meat myself fight in the UFC. I foughtj rock and I got home and I googled it or whatever and I found it and it was like, it didn't seem right. Like I was in the, in there like with Joe Rogan's interviewed me after the fight, you know, it doesn't seem. It seems like I like photoshop that in today.

Speaker 1:          00:40:37       Yeah, because you're still, you your. But now you're seeing you as other people see you. Yeah. So would you envision something in a way it's going to be in an ever that way? Well, isn't that also one of the things that happens when people start attacking you online? It's like people, they're attacking like a celebrity. They're attacking adjusted Bieber, they're attacking whoever the fuck it is that they see that as the object of their attention, but that person who they're attacking, you don't even know them. Like you don't know any of these people and yet they, they, they feel, they feel that you're like a free target.

Speaker 4:          00:41:08       They want to kill me, dude. People, hey, people say fucked up. Like just like last week, someone's like, like, yeah, you suck. And Cpr, like motherfuckers be referring to my dad. I get that all the time. People say, I'm like, dude, you don't like, I don't, I don't get obsessed too long. Like I almost had to laugh. Like, what a fucking Dick. Like what? You don't even know. Why would you say that? Like that's addicting. You don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:41:30       It's the Internet man. The problem is that people could say shit the Internet and there's

Speaker 3:          00:41:33       no social accountability. Now Accountability and you don't feel it. Like if you say something mean to somebody, how many. I can tell you, me personally, I've said Shit where I might've been just joking around, but I said something mean and then I saw the look on a person's face and I'm like, I'm sorry. I was just fucking around. I didn't even mean you don't mean it to come off that way sometimes, but you do so when you just get a free ride and he just, he's fucking war machine, second CPR and they send that out there. It's like, it's bad for people. It's unhealthy. Sucks. And creates sociopath's. Yeah. You know what it's like whenever I go out, I've never had one person to be mean to me. Of course not. They're always nice to me and, and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm cool man.

Speaker 3:          00:42:13       As long as you have to do something dumb for me to be mad at, you know what I mean? I'm cool. But like, where are you guys when I'm out, you guys want to recall it being said to me when I'm out. You want to do it on here? Why do you do that? You know, I'm glad because I don't know. It's probably different people, but if you met them, it probably be the same thing, man. I mean people are asking me about that all the time. Like do you ever get hassled people? Wanna fight you already? Never. People were nice to me everywhere, everywhere, everywhere wanting to me, man, I'm going to give you a hug. I'm friend that you know, and once they realize that, but it's, you know, you're just become an object when you're on a computer screen or on television when you're fighting, you know, like your focus is guards bullshitted sort come up with some reason that fight that you had with Jay rock.

Speaker 3:          00:42:50       Dude, that was a important fight for me for two reasons. One because I realized how much damage you can do from the guard with your elbows. Me Up, dude. That was a, that was a big moment for me because I never saw anybody deliver elbows like he did from the golf. I don't even know how he practiced that. I mean I asked them pass tech. He told me, he told me that he was like a tire, like a tire in between his legs. Like even the Guardian smashing it, but I mean like, dude I have this day. No one's done it like that. I like that he was good. Um, I was dizzy for a concussion for like a week and half that I thought I was dizzy. I believe you, man. I mean that that night I had this chick. Oh she was so hot. Dudes try and I was going go smash words at the palms that night and I took her home board. I was doing. I was so dizzy trying to fuck her going to throw up. I laid down and I was asked if he did come and throw up at the same time I laid down bro. I was, hey, you just got to ride me. But I couldn't lay flat. The room was spinning. Did you call her bro?

Speaker 3:          00:43:49       Fucking hammered. You were. But I had to sit up. I had to stood up like upright and have a riding because I laid down the room was spinning. That's crazy. Yeah. But he jacked me up with those elbows. Dude. That was one of the most effective uses of elbows from the guard. I've ever seen the only other time I've seen something really crazy from the guard looked at as you're Brian Hall. Stop that dude from his guard on the last issue, the last version of tough and you have to guard. He was on top. He got reversed. He had to do, I think, I forget how he got into his car, but anyway, in his guard, knocks the guy out with punches from the car. That doesn't seem that crazy. I've never seen that before. But that mother fucker hits hard. But that Jay rock fight was also intense because you guys were really good friends.

Speaker 3:          00:44:28       You guys have become real close in the house and you were hitting him and then you were saying, I'm sorry. I love you. I'm sorry. I love it. Yeah, we were talking. Yeah, we talk and during the fight and you were doing it like a couple feet from me and I remember thinking like, Whoa, this is some heavy shit and I'm trying to do the commentary. I would like to have just been able to just say nothing and just watch it because it was a great fight. But it was also like, there was a crazy interpersonal situation. It was weird, man, after the fight when you're going to do me A. I cried because I was happy. I cry because I was sad because I ruined his. His dreams. Yeah. It was genuine. It was very genuine. I was like fuck, like was I want to win it because at the end of the day is my, my life has to succeed, but I don't want to kick with my friend's dreams.

Speaker 3:          00:45:08       Like, you know what I mean? And that's the hard thing about mma is that if we were making, if we're all making maybe with her money dude, like oh just go joe, 20 million. She gives a fuck. But like when you know that the person that they lose, they might not, they might not have a job anymore. It's different doing, you know, especially if you like the Guy George said it best, he said he would never fight a friend. He said because there's things that he does to Apollo. He would never do to a friend. He said I just couldn't. I couldn't not do it if I was on top of him, I could not deliver elbows to his head. Concussive damage. Yeah. He was just talking about like the viciousness of dropping elbows on someone's head. You just wouldn't do that to your friend. You wouldn't be able to do that to your friend.

Speaker 3:          00:45:47       Yeah. But more than that, because I mean, I spoil my buddies and we'd beat the shit out of each other. You know, there's a little different, right? It's different, but trying to kill him. It's, there's, there's the fee thing in competition where it's fucking real. This is real. This is, this is not just competing in the gym. This is, this is ready. Ready, go. Ding. The bell rings. The cameras are on you. There's no take backs. There's no redos. The hard part would be, uh, would be finishing in front enough ones that hurt. Like say if you're going to knock him out and then that has happened. Right? But if you rock him and he's like, you know, trying to put them out that, that'd be like fuck, you know. And he's like, you'd want the rep to stop it. It'd be different, you know, like Mochida Munoz, perfect example, real good friends, Machita head kicks him and moved into close the show and decided not to.

Speaker 3:          00:46:33       Whereas anybody else, he would have hit him with seven punches before that referee kill mode. You know, he gets into those fucking karate punches. He throws those rapid fire, right hands. Yeah. Machida's a closer. And you know, that was a perfect example of the difference between fighting a friend. And he was crazy. That was crazy. Head kicked too because he knocked them out through his. He had his guard up. He went through his hand. Sometimes that's not enough. Not enough for a head. There's some power in the dude like that is so fucking hard. That's why the Thai guys, they both hands and away from their head. Yeah. This, it'll still at the Andrew transfers through, through your army. Is it hard to make that transition though to the smaller gloves? Because you know, the problem with the smaller gloves too is when dudes try to do like that k one styled Dutch thing like this.

Speaker 3:          00:47:19       There's all these openings that don't exist with those exact. This is exactly why since two years ago I refused the spoiler. Big Loss and I don't do it ever again. I don't want to do it. Smart could just be and people say and dangerous, man, I'll tell you what, watching UFC, knowing from punches, it's mostly elbows, headbutts, accident needs, whatever I'm that happens, but it's rare and they're going all out. Punches usually don't get cut that much and in practice I've never cut normal little gloves. When you grease your face up to the fight and fight a lot of grease and they sell the puffy sparring gloves and I tell you what mean. We go hard with those and I've never been cut, not cut anybody, but then when I was sparring j Romley foster and pure long time ago, headgear ambig gloves. I cut the shit out of him.

Speaker 3:          00:48:08       I just a wild party. This is what's happening. If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen, but like you said, the big loves you can get used to blocking way differently. It's a big old thing, but you can't block that way, so I don't. I only probably a little gloves now. Yeah, you see that a lot from like the real high level kickboxer guys. They'd go into mma when they realized how many openings are left, where they're so used to like if you find like a nicky hold sand in one of those type guys that like fights, that classic Amsterdam style, they, they, they, they have that hands up high, which is fantastic for kickboxing. But when guys like that enter to mma like alister, like it's. It's a weird thing because there's all these openings there now and say, I think that you want good, good.

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       Boxers are, they can, they can, they can block always punches. That was a little bit ain't gonna Happen. It's not going it. And what happens is if your defense, if you're not comfortable in your defense, then it ruined everything because you start panicking like why am I, how's it? How's it hitting me? You know what I mean? Such a difference in the impact as well. If even if you do catch a punch, like say if you catch a guys right hand and you know you have it in front of your face with that little glove, there's not much protecting. You enhance that big ass glove. The boxing glove, it's like a big pillow hitting you in the face. I mean obviously you know, it's still fucking hurts and dudes get. But there's such a difference in those four rounds to eight ounce gloves to an enormous difference and most of them are fighting with 10 ounce gloves.

Speaker 3:          00:49:26       Yeah. You know, the last two years, man, I don't it, like right now I could towards him like tours and they do Tuesday is little gloves and there's this big lifts. I don't go to Thursday really. And they say, well it's good to do both. I don't think is good is my opinion, but I'm stubborn and you know, that's the way I don't believe in it. You know, it's definitely different and it's interesting to see even though the court what, what year you were, what year was your year of the ultimate fighter? Two thousand seven. Two thousand seven. Even from 2007 to today, thinking about how much things have changed, there was no we'll kicks back then no front kicks to the face and what it was doing. The karate kids were coming in. They were starting to now, so like ufc one people thought quite.

Speaker 3:          00:50:08       It was disapproved because they got only one thing. Then everyone went to like wrestling Jiu Jitsu and now cried. He keeps coming back because I figured if you can box and wrestling Jiu Jitsu and a cool credit kick acute, it could work. You got to mix a little bit of everything because like even Bruni, you don't fucking meathead Bruni. Well last year, so I'm gonna start doing like shut up bitch. I swear dude. No, I'm serious dude. Peter was doing it and he's like, man, I think it's good to know. I just want to like three of those good kicks. And I said, well, I said, well it won't hurt, but you know what I mean. I know I can't really picture Brian doing that. I can picture him doing it. Could you? You got a bad ass kicked. I was watching some videos of you kicking the bag with St Pierre.

Speaker 3:          00:50:45       Yeah, Dude. I was a kid. That's all I did was taekwondo, taekwondo fan type one was all kicks, kicks, but the problem was I transitioned into kickboxing when I was 21 and my fucking hands were terrible. I was getting lit up in the gym, but I just couldn't believe it. I thought my hands were way better and then I, I, I cut out like maybe 60 percent of all taekwondo techniques and I concentrated on like a core fundamental techniques and started learning how to box and then I started doing more Tine. I realized, oh, then there's leg kicks. God Damn it. It was a. those are lots of things. Like everyone was so stubborn. You can't. There's good things and everything. The thing about learning the taekwondo is you because there's no punches to the face and there's no leg kicks. You get really good at doing shit that's super risky.

Speaker 3:          00:51:33       If guys are throwing leg kicks and punches you in the face, whereas you might not really get good at those techniques because you wouldn't put as much care to throw. Um, yeah, exactly. So you get real good at. Um, and then when you learn those other things, you already have that crazy dexterity. You know, my boy has bad ass kicks at Radcliffe, the black kid and I'm living here. Yeah. Yeah. He has nasty, nasty kicks. His actually, his mom taught him about it. Karate Pedis, the both of the brothers, brothers, they have nasty taekwondo. They started out and taekwondo and then they learned from Duke Roufus all the other fundamentals of kickboxing and mma. I think that's a good combination. It's a good way to do it because otherwise it's hard to learn those kicks. It's hard unless you're feet to her. How the fuck that kind of like downloaded a black belt to his brain.

Speaker 3:          00:52:14       That's what Joe Silva said. Yeah. Well that's like he's a freak of nature. But I was like St Pierre, his first fight, if you watch it in like second Canada ring, he can't wrestle were shit. Nothing, now he's like, no one can do that, but wasn't a fascinating. Now when you saw him lock up with Johnny Hendricks, he couldn't take Hendrix down. Yeah, I mean that's, that's the difference between, you know, you catch a guy, especially not in the transition, not in between punches, but actually just just trying to take him down. Good luck. Henry's hopping around on one leg, punched him in the face, nothing. And George couldn't take them down. Which is crazy when you think about how good George's wrestling is in a lot of his other fights. Not that was a johnny did a. he's a burden. I thought, dude, it was funny when the fight.

Speaker 3:          00:52:59       No, he wanted to fight. No, he won the fight. He got robbed. But I think almost everybody that I've talked to that watch that fight, he said, I want to say a period of when they don't really know what. I didn't want him to fight Johnny Hendricks, in my opinion, college tech beat Hendrix. That was a bad decision. I don't think. I think Katrin won that fight. I was ready for Hendrix because I didn't like how strict. I thought it was a very close fight. That's for sure. I thought that if I was seeing pure man, I would say fuck

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       that. I would fight Anderson and retire. I think it could be the Anderson who's actually can't wrestle.

Speaker 1:          00:53:31       He's had headaches for the last couple of years, George. Oh really? Yeah. Freddie Roach was just talking about it. George has had some migraines. He's been talking to them about it over the last two years has been suffering from Migraines, so that was the personal problems we was talking about. Well that was one of them. I think there was some other stuff that he doesn't want to talk about, but the physical problems are legit. When he was on the podcast, man, he was talking to me about aliens and he was talking about like I was. I was pushing him. I was like, you believe in aliens, you believe? Like apparently when they filmed the countdown show with him primetime show, there was a whole segment that they filmed while he was talking about like worrying, like has nightmares about being abducted by aliens and then he has it in his mind what he would do if, if aliens came. And Anthony Junior, Donald told me about this, I go, why didn't they put that in the show? Like the UFC didn't want to have that in. And I was like that's crazy. So I asked him about it on the podcast and one of the things he was talking about though was about missing time. Sometime I'm in my car and then all of a sudden I'm at the gym and I don't know how it got there. And like, okay dude, like that is not aliens

Speaker 4:          00:54:32       that's called we had too much and it's a fact because I'm not that. I don't think I punched drunk, but I lose my car all the time. Now. Eric Jensen, j rock fight. Actually I lose my car, look like if I go through them all, my car's gone. I literally do. I have to fucking get a flag. And put it on his roof. I got to put A. I put a little note in my phone like level four, like I had to put a note. I'll lose my car if I park like memento for parking. I do, but like a Broan is worse than me though. Even if you forgets things I can. You asked me that same question like five times in a day. No, but this is just, I mean everyone who fights noses, dangerous sport. That's why I get pissed off when the football players are suing the NFL motherfucker. You guys made millions. It's a violent sport. You knew you're going to get a head injury like you got paid what you could do. You know what I mean? And we, we, we don't get paid. I don't think what we do and we're getting the same injuries when nothing's gonna happen to us. We're going back to the wrestler. The rest of the movie is gonna Happen to 80 percent of fighters. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:55:36       I'm hoping that they're going to figure out some sort of a medical solution. I feel like if you look at the advancements in science and medicine and what they've been able to figure out about how to fix all sorts of injuries that fixing traumatic brain injuries probably next, and I know that the, uh, this uh, thing called the intrepid center for excellence and they work with soldiers coming back from the war that have brain injuries to big issue and they've made some big improvements and helping people. Um, but I, I'm, I'm with you. Um, I would way rather see a fighter retired too soon and too late and it bums me out when I see a guy that's been in too long and I see them struggling

Speaker 4:          00:56:14       and you know, the worst part is, is if you, they're doing it just because they need money. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, like, you know, some guys like they didn't even retire, but these don't, they needed for their money when they take

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       fights, they shouldn't take short notice. Whatever, when they're not prepared against a dangerous guy too. And they get more damaged, you know? Exactly. Well, that's a real, that's a real issue. You know, nobody wants to fight this guy, well, why do you think nobody wants to fight this guy because they're not the same level as him and because if they do finally going to get knocked the fuck out, and then they say they're scared that they're gonna get fired and that's not like you can't say that a guy scared because nobody, everyone entering into the UFC is not a perfect finished product. They're just not. It's, it's a development cycle that goes through the entirety of your career and one of the things about boxing is they know where their fighter is at and they try to match them up well before they give them a title shot.

Speaker 1:          00:57:01       If you look at boxing, you'll see a lot of guys challenging for the title that only have like maybe one last two losses in their entire career and a lot of them happen early because they get a manager and they slowly build them up and then they start testing them and they do test them, but they test them once they develop some serious worldclass skills. Boxing, you fight nothing but chumps pretty much like you. You, you, you get a lot of work, easy, easy, easy guys. Step up a little bit. So he did. If he didn't do good, pull them back the next time. Make it easier, you know what I mean? They have so many fights. I thought that's how the guys get like 30, you know, you know what I mean? Because they didn't fight it. No 1:30, you know, they realize also that that's the way to make the money, the way to make the money to build up a manny Pacquiao to build up a ricky Hatton to build up a floyd mayweather.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       You gotta have a lot of fights like floyd made. They're made, whether it's the only one has been able to go through the fire over and over and over again and come on undefeated. See and there's a special athlete and then the thing like, I don't want to knock on the UFC because that's your boss. Whatever. What you work for them, but like you, she doesn't want to. Margaret Carter was one of the market, the UFC. Well, it's smart. If you were a business, we're a business. It's smart to market fighters as well. Look, Ronda Rousey, I know how much Ronda Rousey's making. She's making incredible money. If you're a paper view draw, if you're a George St Pierre, if you're someone that's making a ton of money, you make you make money based on how many paper views you sell, so they're. They're making shitloads of money, so there's what people read online as far as like how much the UFC pays.

Speaker 1:          00:58:24       It's like these are the disclosed revenue. They disclosed incomes, but that's not what they get paid. There's a bunch of other shit involved as well. There's there's bonuses and then on top of the bonuses there's what they get for each paper view sale, so they don't disclose and a lot of is because a lot of fighters don't want people to disclose, but if you're a guy who's start now and you want to eventually work your way up to to get to championship status, like it's a fucking minefield. Like look at Brock Lesnar is a perfect example. I was talking to Dana about this last night. Is there ever been a guy, whereas fucking second fight and he's fighting the former UFC heavyweight champion is who mirror was in his prime. I mean mayor was, you know, as good as he's ever been. When brock fought him, know that his problem was that he was famous.

Speaker 1:          00:59:10       He had to be thrown in there and you know what Kim was last, I think at the same kind of problem. Kimbo slice it when he sucks. He's only been training a couple of years, dude, but he doesn't suck. You just inexperienced. He has potential, but he was too famous, too fast and he had a fight to go to guys too fast and got washed out. You know what I mean? It was like his own a marketing, you know, guerrilla marketing on the Internet stuff worked for him and against them, you know? Did you ever see the Sean Gannon fight, the old old, old, old, old, old way back in the day before. That is one of the great. Pull that shit up, Shawn Garrett versus Kimbo slice. That is one of the greatest displays of heart ever. For folks who don't know, Kimbo slice became famous on the Internet for all these crazy knockouts in his backyard fights.

Speaker 1:          00:59:53       He'd fight dudes, bare knuckle boxing, backyard fights, beat the shit out of them, make all this money, and he was just cool looking cat with big, big giant tub knuckles and really nice guy. Super Nice, Super Nice Guy. He look at his image, you think one thing and you meet him. He's so friendly, ready to throw down. He's just ready to throw it down. So he became famous and there's a cop from Boston named Sharon Gannon. This motherfucker has a head, like a fire hydrant and this is when they were in the middle of it. This is like the. Everybody broke it up. They got on. There was a lot of money. No wrestling. Yeah. He said it had to be a stand up fight. Well, he got him in a standing good team and he's putting them to sleep and all these people are jumping in and saying, no wrestling, no wrestling there.

Speaker 1:          01:00:32       Literally pry in the two of them apart and Kimbo if you tuned it to begin, Kimbo was tuning them up in the beginning of the fight, but that guillotine, man, if a guy's good and he gets you in a good tune, you're fucked because he's gonna. He's gonna. He held onto that good team for about 30 or 40, so yeah. Kimbos tired as fuck that. Yeah. No one's saying anything when Kimbo shot for example, but that was because Sean was battering him by this point. It was just cardio. Couldn't hang with the Cardio Kimbo shot on him, which is crazy. And then, you know, see him there. Everybody's freaking out. He couldn't hang with the cardio and you also couldn't have ganas. Just an animal. That motherfucker could take punishment. That, that was a tough jump. That was a tough fight. I remember watching that back in the day. Well, gannon started posting on the underground from the hospital after this fight.

Speaker 1:          01:01:14       Over the day, man, I watched this shit live on the Internet. It was like a paper view street. He lost his job because he did something happened. He got demoted or he got in trouble something, but he was a cop. That is the last motherfucker you want to rest in you. He's just so tough man. Because Kimbo slice hit him with some bombs. His face was completely swollen and bloody by the end of the fight. But that dude had just no give up in him. And plus he had been used to MMA. You know, he had been used to fighting with better plugs and not only that, pacing himself, like Kimbo Kimbo just fighting dudes national. He just jumped out of the gate. I mean Kimbo obviously had some good punching skills, but as far as like his defense and as far as like his, his ability to pace himself, like he was really way outclassed and Gannon started tuning them up with body shots and slowly but surely he starts beating them down and by the end it's absolutely brutal because they're giving them these crazy counts to the game, like a 30 count or some shit like that.

Speaker 1:          01:02:13       And they, when the guy goes down, you don't follow him. Like in mma, you got to let them get back up. But I mean, he could have died easily. Kimma was absolutely exhausted and he's getting just force fed knuckle sandwiches. But this was a, this was a perfect indication that although he became famous on the Internet, like he had a lot of growth to be fighting guys in the UFC. You know, guys like Brandon Lee Hinkle, like national class wrestlers. You been not getting up off your backside. He got the guy gets you down. You're, yeah, you're not getting up. That's a terrible a type of match up. And so Gannon went in there against those guys too. He, he fought permanently hinkle in, uh, in the octagon. And kimbo fought. He fought quite a few guys who actually did well. He, he, he got better.

Speaker 4:          01:02:59       He got better. We still do. These guys have so many years on him. He had some bad,

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       nice to hae a Kimbo. Had some serious arthritis in his knees.

Speaker 4:          01:03:08       It goes crazy. Band people never died on the wars. Like I remember. I remember I was backstage members. Do you ever go to Draca? Yeah, I went to the Olympic Auditorium. I was like in high school, but I'll go there and like Kennedy with fight, I was at one one time and the guy from France fought and like of that until he died. Whoa. It was like, what the fuck? Nothing happened. It was like a, you know what I mean? Like it wasn't like that where you think, oh, someone dies. You wouldn't be surprised. Nothing happened. You know? It's always those kind of weird fights. People just die. There's die, but the war is like, they're fine, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:03:36       Well, they say that most of the people who die cut weight really say that. Yeah. Most of the serious issues of brain death and, and real serious brain damage from a fight happens and the weight classes below heavyweight. But there was a recent fight on hbo were a guy wound up in the hospital with swelling and the blend some Russian dude. It was a ferocious beating and it was a heavyweight fight. It was a heavyweight fight. This Cuban Olympian and he, he just beat the fucking shit out of this Russian dude. And the Russian dude was just unbelievably tough. Just kept coming. And his face was swollen out to here by the end of the fight and apparently he had some serious brain swelling after the fight in his career is done. Yeah. This shotgun. And after that I was crazy. Oh God. That's nuts. That face. It's nuts. And that's the winner,

Speaker 4:          01:04:22       dude. That's our share. Might look like after the first time. Yeah. I was there because I was. I was feeding him ice cream in the hotel room. Yeah, because I drove with them and he was fucking

Speaker 1:          01:04:31       up man. He got beat up. He fought that fight with a torn acl too, right? Yeah. I mean fighting a guy like tito with a torn acl. And Tito was Tito back then to now the tables on fire yet dude, Tito had, in my opinion, still to this day has some of the best ground and pound from inside a guard because he didn't even bother passing the guard. You weren't going to control his posture. He wasn't going to let you. And he was just dropping elbows on you, smashing you from the top. He battered can afford. He had a lot of people could learn, like there was a lot of people that thought they had good guards and they had fight Tito and you get stuck in between, you know, he, he was smashing guys from their guard. The guard didn't mean shit to Tito. He never even got close to getting caught. I remember getting caught ever. He doesn't get enough credit. That guy, you know, a lot of it's because of things he says, you know, a lot of it is a little fuck ups here and there that he's done. But like as a fighter,

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       you know, just because he couldn't beat chuck. Tito. Tito was still a great fighter. Tina. He doesn't, he doesn't get nearly enough credit. Especially. I think he has some of the best ground and pound ever. Everyone wants you to lose it. Ain't no suck. It sucks. It sucks. It's just easy. It's easy to shit on them, eh? You know, that's the thing that's like sports shit to sports radio. They love to shit on players. The guy drops the ball, he's a fucking bomb. They love to do that, but in the end it, they apply it. They try to apply that shit to fighting and then you're dealing with a way more personal subject. You know, the guy's a pussy. He's scared of junior dos Santos. Let's just say it will just come out and say it. Like, why you talking like that? Like what do you know? What are you saying? You know what? How about you getting their stupid? You wouldn't be scared for junior dos Santos to punch in the face. You'd have to be crazy to not be scared. Dude. I can't even. I can't watch mma around civilians. You know what I mean? Like they're fucking, they say the craziest shit. You know what I mean? Do you find it like drunk? Especially drunk white guys try to talk extra tough if they're watching MMA around you. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:06:25       Oh No. And then drunk guys sober. People don't do as much drunk. They'll come with you right away. But it's always in wanting to tell stories of fights and fights. There's been no. I did not want to talk about fighting. Not give a fuck about fighting. I guess they feel like that's all you can relate to. It's like, dude, I fucking train all day. I don't care about fighting. I don't want to watch the fight. I want to talk about fighting like this. Talk about that girl's ass. I have a friend, I have a friend and her boyfriend doesn't know anything about martial arts. He's never trained a day in his life and he likes to watch fights, but when he watched his fights, he, he starts like getting all aggressive and saying crazy shit and she gets mad. Know she's like, this guy's a fucking pussy.

Speaker 3:          01:07:06       I kicked this fucking guys. That's guys push and she's like, will you shut the fuck up? You ain't kicking. Nobody's asked like, why are you saying that? You know how annoying that is? It is the word I'll give you this fucking guy. He's going to. So are you saying that it doesn't suck man? That's the perspective. Get up the fuckers like you don't think he wants to get up just laying there for you. He wants to get up. You can't. Fuck man. Why isn't this knock him out? He's trying to knock them out. What did he advise you to knock him out? It's so frustrating here. And people critique fights when they have no idea what they're talking about. No, he's ever hit them. You know, if there was enough and punched like what, what are you looking to punch you? Knock. Like someone was telling me about the Chris Weidman.

Speaker 3:          01:07:45       Chris Weidman. Anderson Silva looked like a fixed fight to me, bro. There was nothing punch. He caught him perfectly on the end of the chin. Like, has anybody ever hit you in the end of your chin? Let me tell you what happens. Your legs just go. We, we, they just give it a, you know, knock out. So weird. Like you remember when um, lawler lawler, India's. Yes. There were slugging it out and he knocked him out. It was a week. I mean it was like a little tip. Like it was a weird right hook. Yeah, it was like a softer one. It looks like nothing but it knocked him out. I've been hit hardest elbow head. The weights in the gym. Fine. And I've been dropped by a little guys because if it hits you in the right spot, you're just done. Yeah, it's weird. Sometimes were punched. Doesn't look like it should knock out. Like remember when Henzel gracie fought Dan Henderson.

Speaker 3:          01:08:26       Hanzo is trying to shoot in on dance, try to take him to the ground. And Dan uppercut him. He hits somebody. It's like a upper cut, almost like his wrist and, and hence went out and like, so could you versus a little knock. Same Shit. He hit him with a punch but he didn't even land the punch. He hit him with his wrist and he knocked him out. You know. That's why I like people like I use the term lucky punch. I don't call it, use it. People say it was because you through it. Yeah. Guess what though? He through 65 hard ones that didn't do shit and those software knocked them out. It's a lucky punch. You know? I've seen guys were like, I'm beating up the whole fight as a last minute left. And you close your eyes and overhand right. Knocked me out.

Speaker 3:          01:09:04       So lucky punch. Do you know what I mean? Like the sex thing sort of, but then again, okay, here's a perfect example. Like Marcus Davis and Jeremy Stevens. Marcus Davis was outbox and Jeremy Stevens, but Jeremy Stevens landed a few good shots but not enough to put them away and then finally in the third round hit him with just his haymaker from Jupiter and landed right on his chin and Marcus was stretched. He was out cold, but I mean he hit him with all these punches before it didn't do it, but he was looking for that perfect punch. That's not a, that's not a lucky, but you know, but sometimes there are a few. Yeah. And just like fuck, like weird shit happens. When Matt Hughes Fought Matt Serra, they collided heads and Matt Hughes went down. He thought he got punched but it was like a head. But that dropped and he went to the corner.

Speaker 3:          01:09:46       It's like, what hit me? Did I get, did I get dropped? And like they thought he got hit by a punch, but we watched it in the replay. You could see they'd collide heads and he, he, he, he gets dropped from that. Yeah. You know, there's a. and that's why I think standup a little more shaky because there's, there's more luck than standup. Yeah. Then there isn't wrestling and Jujitsu. There's also more. What's important is like things that you're physically born with, like reach and athleticism and fast twitch muscle fibers that come into play way more with standup. Whereas a guy can get real good once you. If you teach a guy the fundamentals of striking and he's a long tall guy, you know, he could get real good, real effective real quick as opposed to a short, fat white guy who's good short ass arms and you're fucked man.

Speaker 3:          01:10:27       You the physical. But that short guy, if they were just rolling, if that guy was a wicked black belt in Jujitsu, just knows positioning. He could just run around that dude time up in a knot and do whatever he wants to them. Yeah. So you can get like a black belt in striking. You don't have to be as athletic. Yeah, I mean, but that's the weird thing too, like with me and Brian were talking about it, about like uh, the end of the day, everything's genetics. Like we know right away the race horses, bloodline, the fighting dogs, bloodline, [inaudible] fighting, roosters, bloodline, it's all blurred. Those are the best animals were a fucking animal. So like it comes a lot. Like some guys are freaks while they fixed because genetically they're just, they're magic, you know what I mean? So it's like Bj Penn. Yeah, he's, I don't know, George Foreman. Yeah. These guys are just fucking freaks. So you know, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:11:15       you can want to get so good dude. It's like, It's like, to me like Jeremy Horn is an example of someone that's a great fighter really tight. The, he went as far as you could go off skill and an effort, but he'd never had the athleticism. You know what I mean? Where if you put that skill into st pierre or pg pan, they would kill everyone. You know what I mean? Genetics is a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:11:37       That's why the perfect storm is a guy like gsp. You has the genetics and works like a motherFucker and is smart and most guys that had the genetics, you're lazy like bj. Yeah, and I mean, well it's interesting seeing bj come back now because bj is going to fight at 1:45 and he's already down to like 1:55 and he's already in the fifties. I've seen pictures on me skinnY as shit. It's crazy. It's just, I don't know, like those last few fights like the nick diaz fight and the Roy Macdonald fight, like what kind of a beating he took in those fights. FighTs were like first round effort and then shut down and then it was like he was trying to win, but it was basically on survival mode for rounds two and three. There were two fights. He should have never taken against one seventies. I mean the fact that he's now at 1:45 is just so crazy that he just is so extreme goes from I'm not going to cut weight, I'm just going to fight anybody at one 70 and then I'm fighting at 1:45. That's a giant difference.

Speaker 4:          01:12:30       Yeah. Yeah. But he's one guy that I think maybe should be lighter, other other guys cut weight and it's like, dude, it's not. The answer was like, why don't you go to 50 fives? Because I don't think I'm gonna do. But if 55 to 87, I'm fucking lean. Fifty five. Can I make it? Yeah, I could. But am I going be better that? I don't think so. I think it's always the curious, like really weak. I was just talking to john, alyssa, we started yesterday and I said, man, you can stay at 55. He waS like, fuck, I don't know man. He said that at one 70 was always small. Like alessio in shape is like one 75, like perfectly in shape. But he was like, I'm smaller one the 50 fives. He said 70. No one ever muscled me around and $55 I told them to get manhandled. So it gives is weak. It isn't always the cure. Like everybody wants to go lower, lower, lower, lower, lower. But I don't think it's.

Speaker 1:          01:13:20       Look at cane. Yeah, 40 but a little fat on him and he be the best headwinds for small look at federal with small gains. Small. Randy was tiny.

Speaker 4:          01:13:30       Yup. And they're fighting giants. So like if I want, if I find one 70 and the guys 10, 12 pounds heavier than me, it ain't heavyweights lift 30 pounds heavier, they're fine.

Speaker 1:          01:13:38       Well the thing about those really big heavyweights is they can't keep the pace. They just can't keep that kind of a pace. You saw with shane carwyn, so brock lesnar see with allister they can't keep that pace. There's too much muscle to feed. You can't keep that cain velasquez pain because people,

Speaker 4:          01:13:51       people think our hearts and lungs are kinda all the same size. Your body might be bigger, but you're the same size, heart and lung. We got to feed that muscle.

Speaker 1:          01:14:00       Yeah, that's a weird thing that people don't really understand. They see a guy, they go, well, you know, he's just got to get In better shape. You know, he's got a fucking 500 horsepower engine. He's got three gallons of gas. That's just what you got. Your heart

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       and lungs are or uniform. You don't. Yeah, because no matter how big words that it's like, it's like you're like a weaned dude. Like john doesn't have a huge dick guaranteed. You know, this is true. It doesn't go. It would be giant in comparison. Most likely. Maybe like shaquille o'neal. Someone told me he had a little deck. I told him to shut the fuck up. First of all, you've got to show me a picture. You can't talk shit like that. Second of all, little dick. Compared to what? What is he like, Jay? So imagine if shaquille o'neal is so humongous. Like say you had eight inch dick, big dick. It's kinda like tanya, I should feel like he has to have like a 15 inch dick to make it look normal. It's true. You know what I mean? So, but you know, tHe lungs, lungs, hearts and dick's the big.

Speaker 3:          01:14:48       Well big guys have bigger lungs. Don't think. I mean you must, you must have a larger heart too. I don't think it's that much bigger. I don't know. Like I like shaquille o'neal. I mean, because think about your heart, tony hinchcliffe say they say the size of your fist, right? Right. Well your fist came with that much bigger. Maybe it's a little bigger, but 50, 60 pounds heavier. Well that sucks for people with little hands and they got little last hearts because you know, you know some dudes he likes to see their face and you're like, wow, this is crazy. That's always what I hear. I don't know if it's true, but it can't. I think they're about the same size of the heart. Well either way there's not that much of a variation and the amount of variation in muscle mass that people put on, it's pretty huge.

Speaker 3:          01:15:25       Like if I'm, if I'm one 75 makoto, is gonna be better than if I'm fucking 2:35, I'll be able to like see guys that carry muscle mass and then they use it though. Like hector lombard. He's a scary motherfucker with a lot of mass. There's a few guys that like break those rules. Even mountain has good cardio. Not bad. We saw so, so [inaudible] been in the game so long he can relax and that's a big part of of fighting. It's just being able to relax. It's brain brains the most of your cardio, keeping your mind like for example, my name is right. He has the obstacle course record at bud's. He's. He can do any snowshoe marathons. He can do crazy. All kinds of circuits beat everybody right, but I'm one of five minute round. He's going To die like a funny. Yeah. I'm like, dude, we could wrestle.

Speaker 3:          01:16:13       he could run. He could wrestle all day, but as soon as he's punching involved, five minutes tightens up. He's bed. Dude, you can run a marathon yet you can't fucking spot dead brain is everything that nick diaz had the press style for that getting guys exhausted because he wouldn't let him breathe, and that's what people say. Nightmare. When when someone's punching you, even if there's a little punches, you can't relax. You need to relax so you're holding your breath all the time. He's hitting you cleansing. Within 30 seconds of that, you're fucking exhausted and all those little 50 percent punches start adding up to nick diaz is a is a nightmare. Yeah. Nick is one of the biggest nightmares ever. He's probably the last person I want to fight, like if I want to fight the same period. Yes. Same here all day. Really? Yeah. Diaz. Just for my style at least it's a nightmare because he don't know. Man. I don't. I don't. I don't go. I don't have to go backwards to go forward with him. He goes forward too much. He's too good at it. He's a nightmare to me. I don't

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       know. He's. He revolutionized in my opinion that like that style striking. You never saw that before. Like guys are throwing like 50 percent punches and just staying on you and just hitting you with volume. It's crazy like that. That was the style that didn't exist before. It looks. It looks like gum. Yeah. It looks weird but it kicks ass when you saw like guys melt, like, like frank shamrock, frank shamrock melted. He just melted under that barrage and he's talking shit and frank can't breathe. And he's punched him in the face, what bitch, what pitch? Eat that bitch and he's knuckle sandwich and I'm kicking his ass and then frank can't believe that he's getting his ass kicked and he's getting talked shit to like this on tv and he realized I'm not going to beat this fucking guy and he can't breathe because he's not getting any breath because nick's hitting them with 30, 40 fucking punches a minute.

Speaker 1:          01:17:55       Just not that type. He has a difficult style to deal with. Yeah. He's throwing 150 punches. Hitting you with 31 thing with nick is like, like period them easier because nick's weaknesses. Wrestling. Yeah. As long as you can. Especially it'd be fine. I can wrestle him down, you know? Yeah. Uh, but on the feet man, nightmare. Nasty potty shots too. I was going to say is that 30 of his punches are going to be hard punches to the body and he, he throws those fishes, hooks to the body and lulls you to sleep. But a few pitty pat and then boom, uhm, the hooks to the body, the paul daily fights. Another perfect example of that. Oh yeah. And he can. That's the other thing about nick is that he'd take a fucking serious punch. Do you see him? He'll be pitter pattering Whack it cracked.

Speaker 1:          01:18:40       Go right back. Because he was just right back there. Just lets you know. So what, so what bitch. So you hit me bitch, you know, and then you see them extending their hands to like when he fought cause content and he, he literally bitch slapped him. He just opened palm, slapped him in the face. I mean, who does that? Who talks so much shit. I love nick diaz is one of my favorites of all time. One of my favorites. It just uh, it's interesting to see different styles and how those styles play out and see if people could find a solution. You know, george found a solution to that style but never came close to finishing them. Never, never really put them in danger. It was like a very safety first version of that. Yeah. Know what I'm happy about is lawler. Dude. What a resurgence.

Speaker 1:          01:19:20       I'm happy him for him to come back. It's awesome. Like, I don't know where like I thought I haven't even, I never thought I waS going to come back with that. He's smashing everyone to see if you can find online robbie lawler versus melvin manhoef. That's my favorite robbie lawler fight. That was in strikeforce. I know. It's a scary dude. Oh, first of all, the dudes, the blackest man on the Planet. Okay. He's black as coal. He's built like a fucking superhero. He throws the nastiest kicks and punches. Nasty. He's the only guy to ever knocked Mark Hunt out in the first round with one Punch and he's a 100 and eiGhty five Pounds, which is fucking crazy. They fought in mma. Mark hunt shot in on him. I mean, that's the tells you how fucking scary. Melvin manhoef is he just a spring, just a steel spring.

Speaker 1:          01:20:02       Just coiled back. Ready to fucking explode on you. So anyway, he's teeing off robbie lawler fucking up his legs. Got robbie's not checking any of these kicks and he's sitting in with these inside low kicks, had got robbed. His legs literally flying up in the air. And then robbie uncorked haymaker losing every minute of the fight up until the moment he uncorked punch and melvin's eyes just roll way back into his head. And that's the end of it. Yeah. This is the fight right here. This is one of my all time favorite robbie lawler fights because he was getting. See how his legs are flying up in the air. And melvin manhoef is one of the best kickboxer boom there. It is. One of the best kick boxers to come out of one of the best gyms. He was one of the guys from mike's gym, whereas that's where alastaIr started training recently when he rebuilt himself. Mike. Mike is responsible for badr hari. He's got coconut saki over there. A lot of those high level high level guys from holland, lola, go con socrates, go contact your golden glory. No, I don't know either way. Badass fighters over there, but robbie lawler, he always has that one punch power, durable and tough. And he doesn't give a fuck who literally legitimate doesn't give a fuck. Dana told me, they called robbie lawler, told him you got a title shot against johny hendricks is for the welterweight title. He goes, cool.

Speaker 4:          01:21:27       That's it, you know, do a, he's a nice guy. I like him, but to me it's kind of like a bimbo, like he's like, he's like simple and so nice and like he's like a bimbo, like arrowhead, you know, it's funny. I don't know, that's what I always got off. Um, you know, uh, I've had conversations with them. He's not stupid but he's just like, like real, like, I don't know, you just like quiet and like he's kinda like kinda like a bimbo. I never talked to him that much. I know what you're saying, but that's just perception. So I know I talked to him for a long time because he was on, he was one of the coaches fault or fighter when I was on there. Oh, real other team. So he was like real nice and like he just seemed like, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:22:04       Yeah. Who, what team were you on? I was on sarah, sarah, and he was on here, but he's like, because he would always tell me back, tell me, uh, the lord isn't spar. I'm like, yeah, riGht dude, laura's probably only, there's this boy, he's a striker. So I asked him on the shoulder. He was like, nah man, why would. I was like, I know how to fight. I just like, what? You serious dude? So yeah man, I wrestled when I run, I lift weights, but it was like I don't spot, I know how to fight already. Like wow, that's part of said it was just funny. I was like, it just seemed like a, just like a, like a rock, like just like, you know, like seeing her. I was like, but pretty, you know, he's a nice guy but he just tough faster. BuT you don't it as a spark.

Speaker 1:          01:22:42       What do you think about that? Because is that maybe a way to do it? Like you don't take any damage so you go into a fight and you haven't been hit at all, you know how to hit people and you know how to get hit. You've been doing it for years. If you just stop now, how much timing would you lose if you did like a lot of work and you just concentrated on drills with a real good striking coach?

Speaker 4:          01:23:03       I wouldn't do it because I know one way from the judges

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       by jail when he came on a jail like the first couple of weeks, few weeks of sparring. I like. I'm like flinchy and like I'm like flexing and he didn't get to do anything in jail though, right? Yeah. All in all I could do there with shadowboxing, like pushups and squats. I couldn't really work out. I know that's crazy. I wouldn't do it like me. I only once a week just just, just tuesdays and like with a little bit like I said, and that's it, you know, put ice, do three days a week, three days a week, but it's too much I think. I don't think you need to do that much. Yeah. This is a point of diminishinG returnS, esPecially with taking shots. EverYone who gets hurt in practice, you know what I mean? so I would spend more time doing other stuff that's less dangerous and um, you know, running and stuff like that because I think in the beginning when you're new, I think it's important to spar because you can get comfortable once you get comfortable is less important because you're relaxed and you're not, you're not nervous no more and stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:23:59       So much of it is also dependent upon finding people that you could trust a spar with. Like there was a, when I first moved to hollywood in [inaudible] 94, I was training at the jet center and a bunch of real cool guys there and there was a bunch of real cool guys to spar with. Was this one dude in particular? I forget his name. I think his name was ed, I forget, but he was an older dude, me and that duty spar all the time because I knew that he would never try to tee off on me and he knew that I'd never tried tee off on him. Everything was like 50 percent always. He never, he was never, you know, some dudes will 50 percent you and then hit you with some shit and be like, come on man, what are we doing here? Are we fight and we spark and the next thing that you try to get them back.

Speaker 3:          01:24:36       next thing you know, you're in a wall in berlin and you know, in your brain up, you know, I don't believe that you need a spar hard. I don't think so either. What I was going to say is this, I got better with this guy. my sparring got sharper, my reflexes has got sharper because I was constantly sparring with this dude where I wasn't worried about getting knocked out in, in our training sessions. You know, it's uh, you know, either you're tough, you're not dude, so you didn't get hit and you're gonna be a poster, you're going to get hit and you're going to take it. And by that standard and you think robbie lawler has got a point. Do you think maybe his style of, of not sparring it all, it'll be a good idea for him, for him? Yeah. Well that's it, right?

Speaker 3:          01:25:10       Find what works for you, you know, like some guys, I think you could get away with it more than others, but uh, I wouldn't feel comfortable confident doing it. I've never heard the one I was doing that except for him. Yeah, I wonder. I mean, who knows, he might just be bullshitting. He might like to spread rumors, but he, he was living with me for a little bit in vegas like million back in the day. so bernie, that didn't spark and I was like, fucking bullshit dude. He asked us was probably only wants to do a spoiler, but. So he needed confirmed it. So I don't know, dude, I got to ask him, but that's really interesting man. That's really interesting. But uh, he's a scary fucking finisher though. The check and he fought koscheck. I mean, the way he fights, he doesn't, he doesn't need this part obviously.

Speaker 3:          01:25:48       And maybe that'll save his brand in the long run. That's what I'm saying. You get hit. That's the problem with boxers is that they only punch. So they're getting hit in the head all the time and practice and the fight. So they get more brain damage than us, you know, I was probably once a week and I through come dipping a hard. When you see guys like, um, like meldrick taylor, does that freak you out? It's scary dude. It freaked me out man. I stopped sparring when I was in my twenties. I haven't done any sparring. I'm 46 years old now and I still wonder if what I did when I was younger, like maybe it would have been smarter, maybe I wouldn't have been so weird. Like, you know, it can't be good at hitting the head. Can't be, you know what I mean? That's why you got to accept the fact you got to be careful with yourself and you got to be smart.

Speaker 3:          01:26:33       Like for example, um, last week I was sparring with evan dunham and I shot at the exact same time he kicked. It was like a fluke accident. Super common though. Yeah. And boom, dude, I was on my, I'm gonna ask like I was like pretty much almost out, you know. And he's like, sorry, bad timing. Oh, what was this? When did this happen last week? Now what do you do when, when something like that happens, how much time do you take off as barn? Depending on how I feel afterwards, but like I took the whole week out, but I was the only tuesdays anyway. But um, if I would've been dizzy like that night still afterwards and the next day I wouldn't have spotted for a couple of weeks Because that's how you lose your chin. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. But then it sucked because then like I, like I said I was fine.

Speaker 3:          01:27:21       It was that that night I was already fine. It was a big deal. But um, then on tuesday we got this fucking silver medalist olympic, a guy from Denmark, from martin cameron's buddy, he's a silver medalist and he's, he's, he's officer no quicker, ruined wrestler. So it was probably with this guy yesterday and he stand up, isn't that good yet? So I'm going to software and I don't want to be a dick, you know, but then he took me down double leg and I was good up on the fence and that motherfucker suplex me on my head, dude. And uh, I got, I got rocked pretty good but not, you know, it was like a, I was like, that's what people don't realize this, this shit is happening all day, but you got to be able to judge like saved at that. SaY if a evan dunham that happened in my last round last tuesday, if that was my first round, I would always stop for today.

Speaker 3:          01:28:08       If you get, if you get dropped or knocked out a rock, don't or don't be tough. Fucking take the day off because you're gonna do more damage. Your brain has to recover a little bit, you know. Not only that, I mean you really need more than a day. You probably need a long time. A while. I'm just kind of fucking crazy and at least a week. But I've seen like some guys will get dropped and they'll take like a man often despised the next round. Done for the day. Blacks. It ain't gonna benefit you, you, I've seen guys get knocked out cold in boxing gym. They spar him later and he's like you to do it now? Fuck you. Get Back on the horse. Don't be scared to get back on the horse and you see him spar and they're like, yeah, and then they get jazzed to get going on and get jobs in Iraq. Well that there's been a couple instances in the ufc where guys get knocked out in training camp and they completed their camp and fought travis luder when he knocked out, um, a marvin eastman. Remember that fight? Marvin eastman got knocked out twice in camp. He was trained with tito

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       and he got knocked out by a knee during the takedown and another time that was something else, like during a take down, he got knocked out. So you've been concussed out. Cold twice in camp and then fought. And travis luder caught him with the end of this punch. It was kind of crazy. It was one of the weirdest knock on saturday. Yeah. It caught him like pull. Pull that up. Travis luder versus martin king never knocked the other one in his life. And he's a digital guy. Travis luder versus marvin eastman and these east. Well, you know, louis luder could punch. He's a strong dude. I mean. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, he's a guy and these ones that striker. So you thought he was gonna take him down to try. You know, he's one of, in my opinion, look, the guys that like didn't reach his potential. That makes me go. He's fucking lazy. Lazy, lazy, like wouldn't leave his gym like trained with the students and shit like that. He was smashing anderson silva. Yeah. And he gassed. Yeah. Here's travis right here.

Speaker 5:          01:29:51       I mean, that's crazy. We'll show that one more time Because it doesn't even make sense, but it's not like people. You might think it was fake. Watch this. He hits him with this punch. Here it is. That's crazy. It barely hits. It's like a grazed. Him at the very end of the punch. And marvin eastman had just been

Speaker 1:          01:30:15       so damaged and training. He just went out cold. But travis luder was a wicked jujitsu guy, dominated everybody in the house. When you see, when he was fighting on the ultimate fighter dude, his fucking takedowns, his jujitsu is laser sharp and he fucked up and he fought anderson silva. He lost so much weight. Dude. I never seen a guys I lost so closer to death than the weigh ins for travis luder. He never made the weight. He never made the way to miss the way was a non title fight when he fought anderson and when he got on that scale, man, his lips were cracked and bleeding he's faced was completely sucked in. There was no water in his body and he was shuffled and I'll never forget that he couldn't even walk. He was shuffling towards a scale for a second time. This was after he missed weight on the, on the stage.

Speaker 1:          01:31:00       They weighed him backstage afterwards. He couldn't make the weight. He was off by like a couple pounds to it, so it was a mess. There was no way he was going to lose any more weight. He was going to die and so they changed it to a non title fight, but when if that guy had just earlier in his career, had moved to a bigger camp and gone like the jacksons or american top team or something like that and really gotten shape, he would have been a motherfucker shit who was so strong. Obviously diet and cardio, you need a better training guys. And it's cardio. Yeah, it was like guy medgar was the best ever first round fighter in the world. Guy was anyone the first finger dead, but after that it's a wrap. He would get tired, you know? Yeah. Well gosh guy metzger, he's, he's another guy that had a real problem.

Speaker 1:          01:31:44       He was taking vioxx. He was taking some shit for his knees and it was like an arthritis shit. The turnout, it would give people strokes. She had a fucking stroke from this medication. Did he? Yeah, dude. Yeah. He never fought again. But he, like his friends started noticing. He was like slurring his words like crazy and you know, it was like out of nowhere. And so they, they urged them to go to a doctor and you went to a doctor and found out that he had a stroke. I'm pretty sure it was via. I'm going to pull this up because I don't want to speak at usc, but I remember they pulled that shit. A guy medsker one of the. When they make it illegal, but all these drugs. Fuck everybody. Oh yeah, no kidding man. Yeah, man. He did? Yeah. Okay. that was, it was vioxx. Yeah. And he, he got a fucking stroke he took to uh, they took him to the hospital. funky. Crazy. Yeah. I ain't know that. Yeah, you gotta be careful. All of those medications that they can give you for things like arthritis and extreme anti inflammatory medications like that, they can have extreme effect on your blood, especially these like pharmaceutical ones. They pulled that shIt off the market. I try to stay away from most all medication. You eat really healthy man. I watched your, your twitter feed for what you eat. You eat almost totally vegan. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:33:02       Well, ever since I got out of jail I started eating. Um, I never, not like 90 percent vegan. This what happens. I read the China study and I already had a friend that was vegan and I started reading a lot and it just made sense to me and I, I believe this, the study, like a lot of stats and stuff and that documentary forks over knives and stuff. So I gave it a shot. I'll try it out, you know, and, and I mean I'm still a strong, muscular whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:33:26       What are you getting your protein from? You say 90 percent vegan. So it's 10 percent animal protein.

Speaker 4:          01:33:31       Yeah, basically what I do. So my protein and there's a lot of from I get a supplement, a lot of powder from. I like sponsored garden of life. That's a great company. Yeah, well I got good stuff. I liked their in jail and I was taking that stuff and I was like fuck, it was expensive. I thought there are two main stream to sponsor me. you're like I'm a maniac, you know, x, y, zed, that's why I want. so I'm gonna email them and I was like hey, you know, and they're like sure. And I was like, really? I'll say just let you know like a jail. I did porn and be like, oh yeah, we already googled you. And I was like all right, cool. That's awesome. But they're a great company. But anyway, I'm in the daytime mostly I make smoothies just old like bananas, spinach, strawberries and the protein.

Speaker 4:          01:34:13       So do you avoid a big meal until like later? Are you doing that right now? I'm doing this. I'll try and his warrior, the warrior diet. I never read the book but I know the, the, the, I know a little bit about it but I like it because here's what happens is that my whole life, you know, uh, I did the regular body building diet, eat every two or three hours and it was always easy in the daytime and nighttime, I'm starving and I want to cheat. It was always the problem, you know, at nighttime was like, fuck man, I want to eat this or that and you can't, you can't cheat. Right. So then I read the warrior diet, the theory behind it and I said, well it makes sense man. Like all day long, I'm not hungry anyway. So I did a little bit during the day and then I'll pig out at night. I have big, big dinner. So the last, just just the last few months I've been doing this warrior diet thing, but basically all I do is only eat this. I'll make a smoothie an hour before practice. And then I one right after practice.

Speaker 1:          01:35:02       One hour, huh? Yeah. That's all you need is an hour. Yeah. I feel like it's good for me. That's probably because it's a vegetable base smoothie, right? Yeah. It's all fruit and I've tried to do that with like whey protein. You start shitting your pants. I wear it

Speaker 4:          01:35:15       brains out, you know, like way it comes from milk and it tastes better than whey protein taste better and stuff. But I don't know, I think, I think it's bad from what I've read, I try to stay away from all dairy animal stuff, especially dairy. But then like what I usually do is like, I'll eat vegan all week and sunday. You're like a fucking pig. I don't care. You give a one cheat day, like pizza, like anything. I don't care anything like nothing, nothing forbidding but sometimes say like a flight to go to sushi, I'll get sushi tonight. Big deal. But in my house I only eat vegan. That's interesting. So most of my protein comes from mostly beans, rice, a stash fields. Um, and then, uh, the protein. But mostly I eat a boring diet. Did the same thing every day. Same time today. That's smart because it freedom makes me. If I don't have a schedule, I'm fucked. I can't even if I have any freedom in my schedule, I'll screw it all up. So I had that written down. Eat this now. Otherwise I'm screwed. Like same thing. Like if I even get woke up early, I like, my schedule is so exact. Like today, like I'm here, right? Uh, if this ended early, I wouldn't trade after this. My skin is ruined already. And on the way here I had the, I already ate junk food. I fucking went the jak inhibitor.

Speaker 1:          01:36:28       so you sort of manage yourself against your own impulses?

Speaker 4:          01:36:31       Yeah, because I know that like, I had this, but I don't. If I have a schedule in front of me, I'll follow it to a t. If I don't have one, I'm,

Speaker 1:          01:36:39       I can't trust myself. You're too impulsive. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I can do it. But at least you understand that, you know, if that's a trial and error thing, you know, and I think that's probably, you know, if you think about like your life and all the circumstances that you've had in your life, those develop like paths they developed, like behavior paths and those behavior paths. When you, once you already go down that impulsive road, it becomes very difficult to break those paths. That's why people are like gambling junkies. They'll fucking fall off the wagon. Just fucking let me just play one hand, one hand a black chair and next thing you know, they're fucking sweating their collars oN dawn. Their fucking hair is crazy. I, I've, I forbiD myself with a gamble. Yeah. I'm not a gambler either.

Speaker 4:          01:37:18       Uh, yeah. But this right now my diet, I like to do, don't. I don't think we need to eat them that much. Animals and stuff. You know, the child studies shows like in the ras and stuff that if the rats that ate a more than 10 percent animal products, the cancer that would turn on and then they'd take them to a 90 percent of their diet and they would turn off the cancers.

Speaker 1:          01:37:40       Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm an american and I'm not a fucking rat. I'm a human being top of the food chain. I'll eat a rat if I'm hungry, but I don't like to base my died of some shitty road and said eat themselves.

Speaker 4:          01:37:51       Yeah. Well, here's the thing too, when you think about it. All right, so we're in tribes. Okay. So those guys are the hunters. We're going to go out all day and hunt along the way when we're going to be eating fucking apples and wherever we find. Right. Whatever we could find. We gonna getting along the way. The chicks are going to be at home, you know, hunting or gathering and a clean shit up and w we, we get a pig, we bring it home at nighttime and we have a feast, but it's one pig we caught maybe and there's a whole fucking village so we're all gonna get a small amount of meat and mostly we're going to eat vegetables and plants and stuff, but just to let you know,

Speaker 1:          01:38:21       I mean I don't know how much you've done online. I don't think there's anything wrong with eating a vegan diet and I'm a big proponent in eating a lot of vegetables. I eat a lot of vegetables. I think I feel better when I drink kale shakes and eat a lot of fresh vegetables, but the China study has been debunked by many different scientists. There's been a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It has. There's been a lot of different work. One of the things they accused the China study, I was cherry picking data in order to match their conclusions that they wanted to make. Like there's this, if you just google China study debunked. There's a bunch of different articles about it like here, here's one rest in peace China study, and it's all about a guy who wrote a story. I started analyzing the, the original, trying to study data.

Speaker 1:          01:39:05       He said, I had no intention of writing and actual critique of a campbell's much lauded work. I'm a data junkie numbers along with strawberries and audrey hepburn films, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But after spending a solid month and a half reading, gRaphing, sticky noting and passing out at 3:00 AM from studious exhaustion upon my copy of the raw China study data, I've decided that it's tiMe to voice all my criticisms and there are many and this guy just goes into all these different points where there's like the. He said, campbell was influenced by his own expectations about animal protein and disease, leading him to seek out specific correlations in the China study data and elsewhere to confirm his prediction, which means that he didn't use real science. What he did was he used confirmation bias and he tried to go towards a lot of vegans do that, man. Like, I tried, I had this. Uh, what's the, the endurance runner that we had on

Speaker 4:          01:39:53       the dude talking about? Anyway,

Speaker 1:          01:39:57       cat was a vegan, really good guy. And we were, we were talking about, uh, about v rick roll. We were talking about ritual, we're talking about veganism and you know, and he was saying that it had nothing to do with not wanting to eat animals. It just all about health. So I started talking to him about the benefits of fish oil and you know, and he was like agreeing that there's a lot of health benefits officials. I do supplement with fish oil. Well,

Speaker 4:          01:40:20       he's like, no, no I don't. I'm like, well why wouldn't you, if you know all the benefits official because it becomes a thing where you want to say you don't eat any animals. Here's the thing, like my old buddies or my old roommate was a vegan real deacon, like reading labels and shit. I will never do that. And I don't believe in the whole hundred percent vegan diet. I believe that. I think I, my opinion is we're meant to eat some meat but mostly plants. That's what I think we are probably meant to eat naturally, but uh, like I'll eat whatever I want to grow a great deal of benefit to eating animal protein. Now a lot, especially

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       animal protein that's grass fed. You start looking into a wild game and grass Fed animal protein and the difference between like the essential fats, there's like way more, uh, that was like the salmon essential fatty acids are way more than the wild game, much more, much more. Well, you know, the problem is most people, when you're judging diets, here's one gigantic thumb. The sore thumb that sticks out. Most people have sedentary lifestyles. So if you start judging the diet of the average american, what the fuck is the average american doing with their on their shit? Yeah. So you can't even compare the average american to an athlete. But when you start talking to athletes, talk, talking about the specific nutritional demands of your red line and your fucking body every day when you're training, when you're doing strength and conditioning. I've seen the videos you were, you're doing chin ups would fucking weight belts on and 90 pound dumbbells on in between your legs, your red line and your body all the time, but you need as much protein, nutrients, essential fatty acids, vitamins you need all the good shit.

Speaker 3:          01:41:57       You can't afford to have a deficiency in any area you should look into if you're not opposed to it from a moral standpoint. Look into the benefits of grass fed proteins. That's why I like the way I'm doing. I do both, but mostly the plants. I think as long as I'm. My energy's high and my muscles staying the same strength, the saying like I could judge you by that kind of. I feel I feel good. You know what I mean? It's definitely better than the average diet. Yeah, and the thing is too, this is why in jail I stopped reading fucking fiction fiction is the real shit, right? Books. Fiction is fake over the nonfiction. So now he's. The reason why in jail I stopped reading nonfiction was because oh fucking read one book written by four phds and they're telling me this right and not read another book by four phds and they told me the opposite.

Speaker 3:          01:42:44       No one knows shit and it pisses me off. So the after awhile I started reading only fixing just stories. I don't give a shit, you know, because I got sick and tired of reading them, contradict each other and no one knows nothing. We'll see what's going on is that there's not enough. It's not that no one knows anything. It's just like people are still learning and they're still learning about the body. I mean if you just look at training methods that people used to use just 100 years ago in comparison to training methods today, you ever watched like those old training camps like Jack Johnson and jack and jack dempsey and all these guys just doing all this crazy like old school training methods. It's silly. Their bodies look different like athletes or just different. Today we understand tabata methods, we understand different protocols for endurance training. You understand heart rate monitors. We understand overtraining, who understand like hydration, electrolytes. There's just so much they understand today. They did. They didn't know. Then. It's constantly growing. It's not. It's not. I think the main problem is though is like if me and you are a scientist and we figured out this thing like we think that we're right, but then we like the design since they fucking. They refuse to believe they're wrong and they,

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       they, they'll push this even though now they know it might be wrong with them. They don't. They wasted so much time to fucking make this right. Now they're scared it. Same thing with the flat earth and around with all that bullshit. Same type of theory. You know what I mean? We're like, you know, they get committed to their idea. They didn't want to budge. they would rather preach their idea even though it's not right. Then let go, and then that's the problem too with the sign shit. Well, that's an issue with people that study ancient civilizations. There's a guy that we've had on this podcast several times, so a good friend of mine named graham hancock, gregg guy who wrote this amazing book called fingerprints of the gods and it's all about ancient structures and they. THey've taken geologists, man, they had this guy, robert schoch from boston university.

Speaker 1:          01:44:35       They studied the erosion marks on the sphinx and they're trying to backdate the. The enclosure for the sphinx and trying to say rain, right? Yeah. They say it's from thousands of years of rain. Problem was the last time they had that kind of rainfall in the river. It's like 9,000 bc, so like we're talking about thousands of years before that because back then they used to be a rain forest denial. We used to be like, it's rich reinforce. So what he's saying is that just based on geological evidence, you're dealing with something that was constructed a long time ago, much longer than anybody thinks, but these egyptologists did not want to believe they were digging their heels in the sand and they were saying there's no way. It's impossible. Whereas this, they were laughing like, oh, here's this culture from 12,000 plus years ago you talk about, and they didn't even know that anybody had built anything like that from 12,000 years ago until recently they found this structure in Turkey called gold beckley tappy without a doubt.

Speaker 1:          01:45:30       12,000 plus years old because someone 12,000 years ago covered It because they've proven by doing carbon testing on the soil that it was all put at the same time. So they know the 12,000 years ago for sure someone was making big crazy chinese shit, but they don't want to talk about that because they've been teaching college courses in university and forever and they gave a timeline because this timeline has been established and that's how they base their phds at today based on their studies and their words don't want to let it go. And that's the problem. You know, there's a problem, you know? Uh, uh, I don't know. It's a problem with ancient civilizations for sure, but it's a little bit of a problem with health and a lot of these fucking people that are talking about, oh, you don't need vitamins, you don't need this.

Speaker 1:          01:46:11       Let me, when we find out what you do with your body, because I have a feeling you're a fat fuck, can you just sit around doing nothing mean telling people they don't need vitamins, they don't need nutrients. I just thought I should. That day on dr oz. Dr was trying to tell them that you don't need to take vitamins. Bullshit. And then dr. Oz was saying, well you need to take your daily recommended allowance. Fucked the daily recommended allowance. Guys don't know shit. I don't. I don't believe none of that I take. I take. You know what I mean? I don't, I don't think it's going to hurt you to mega doses of vitamins, you know? Well, it's also they love to make these these headlines like, I don't know if you saw this recent story that where this research is st case closed vitamins don't work, but they based it on two things.

Speaker 1:          01:46:47       I've talked about this before, folks who listened and they like, you got to fucking talk about it again. One more time is the last time I promise. Just for war machine, they based it on six people over 65 that had had heart attacks, that vitamins didn't keep them alive any longer and people that were over 65 that had already had mental decline. They were already experiencing alzheimer's. It didn't slow their mental declines. The likable, but that's not. Vitamin doesn't work. you're dealing with old people that are already there already. A dead almost. Yeah, exactly. Your heart attacks, your brain stopped working and you having a heart attack. Oh, fucking centrum one didn't work. It didn't fix that. That's crazy. Unbelievable. But this is a. This is a headline to get press, so they put these headlines out to get their study, to get people to read it and pay attention to it.

Speaker 1:          01:47:29       It gets hits all these websites, everybody gets excited about it, they inflame the results because the more you inflaming more people are going to share them on twitter and the next thing you know, people were arguing that you don't need vitamins. There's just a study that released why even taking vitamins? These had study and there's no fucking studies that tell you don't need vitamins. This the stupidity. Yeah, it was the same thing. What's up with the soy milk? I hear people say that it raises estrogen, but people say it doesn't. Is there a real study? Is soy? Most definitely can have effects on your hormone levels for men or just women or men or men in the study? Cause I hear both and I don't. I don't know which one. I'm pretty sure soy can affect your hormone. Well, let's. Let's just google it right now.

Speaker 1:          01:48:06       Can affect hormone levels, hormone levels. There's a lot of shit. They're gonna affect hormone levels. You got to be careful about having added nami. Nami, he cries like a girl. He grows milk when he eats soybeans. That our drinking water though is so full of a birth control pills when they like, when they cleaned it out, the hormone staying in it's lauren testosterone to. Well, there is some. There's also antidepressants that make their way into our tricky water from people processing. Like when people flush them down the toilet was like when you drink water, like in some places you're drinking water that's been processed, they'll process sewage water back into the drinking and then somehow or another micro doses of these antidepressants and antibiotics and all kinds of shit can make it into that water, but the levels are so low address, it'd be almost impossible to.

Speaker 1:          01:48:58       It's impossible to feel. I think it's just. It's just detectable. Does soy. Does eating soy increase estrogen? Estrogen production? Let's find out. Yes it does. Soy beans are a complete protein source and a dietary staple of many cultures. Store can. Soy contains phytoestrogen is called isol. Flay isoflavones owns that may mimic the activity of hormone estrogen in your body. The effects of soy isoflavones on human estrogen levels are complex, so it's safe for everyone to consume in moderation and can have a modest effect on estrogen levels, so that means it can have an effect, so don't get crazy and drink a lot of soy mIlk or dick would go soft, grow some titties, or if you're a girl, you need some extra estrogen. Men. Imagine if girls can eat like certain foods and their tips. We grow bigger. There be none of that shit at whole foods.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       Try finding soybeans and hopefully it will be out. Yeah, soy. So it's always an interesting one, but it's not the best protein. Like keen was one of the best. Yeah, that's real high in protein and all. All of a sudden amino acids. Hampshire real good. One to mcz digest to. Yeah, the one that I think that the garden of life one and it's like a blend I think. Yeah, but you can get a lot of protein. Maybe mac danzig pulls it off. You can do a lot of protein in a vegan diet. You just gotta know what the fuck you're doing. The real issue is healthy fats too. You got to eat avocados and shit. You got to get a lot of fats or just like a flax oil shake because I'm the boss. I'm not against. I would take the fish oils. I don't bother me.

Speaker 1:          01:50:32       Like mac wouldn't know. He's a real, real hardcore vegan. Yeah, he's an anImal. He told me like, fuck that. That's bullshit. Like you don't like. And I, I figured that he's been a deacon salon. maybe he knows. So I believed them. He, what did he say? It was bullshit. The soy shit. Like that's bullshit. There's no study that getting emotional. That's the woman in them. And the estrogen is making them emotional. Tell him to back off the beans back. Yeah. Well mac is, uh, he's, he's, he's an interesting dude because his, uh, he's got a real strong character. I really liked that guy. He's a very smart dude and he's a strong believer. Excuse me, in character. That's why he chooses not to have a, of any animal protein. He started for some reason I started was, was from like a sinus infections. Strep throat.

Speaker 1:          01:51:16       Really? Dairy man, a lot of people have issues, ice strep throat and sinus infections like three times a year, every fucking year since, after, since forever. Right. And then, um, I heard a rumor that if you stop drinking milk, it can go away. I was like, bullshit. I tried it and it stopped. Fucking I don't get it anymore. Yeah. Friend tony hinchcliffe for the same issue. Right. He stopped drinking milk, need cleared up a lot and my dad told me this. That's why he started to. And then he, after that he started researching more and that's why he became a vegan and plus the animal stuff. But yeah, you're not supposed to drink milk that's been homogenized and pasteurized. And the problem with drinking raw milk is, unless you know who's milking that cow, that cow, you don't know what the fuck you're getting, how they're dealing and handling the milk right afterwards.

Speaker 1:          01:51:54       If you can get a good source though, if you get a real good farm that's reputable, that knows how to deal with their, their, their, um, the raw milk some. There was a recent study also, they try to discredit wall milk saying one out of six people who drink raw milk and get sick, but then in the article itself it shows that you can't prove that what happened to them came from the raw milk and it could have been from the only had raw milk. They weren't controlling the rest of their. Their input and their input varied. Everybody's input varied and people get sick all the time. So it's real sketchy. It's not like a double blind placebo test taken raw milk because of rose to homogenized or pasteurized milk and then they both eat the same diet and it's controlled st portions. Living lab.

Speaker 1:          01:52:35       Yeah. You, you have to live in the same info. You know, it's, it's hard, but you've got to be careful. You got to be careful whenever anything's wrong. You know you've got gotta have really fresh stuff, but that's what we're supposed to eat. We're not speed, speed, old rotten. So those refrigerators and all, you know what I mean, like. Yeah, but you know, for, for most people they're not going to be able to afford to just buy milk every day. I mean that's really what we're not supposed to live in societies where you've keep up a steak for a month, you know, it takes not supposed to sit in your refrigerator and the only way meet can sit in your refrigerator. It has to be like some fucking bologna thing that's barely a meat, you know? It's just been filled with all kinds of shit to the point where it can't.

Speaker 1:          01:53:16       Right. She's hot dogs, cheese, hot dogs. That's the worst. What are those like meet with fake cheese in it. Oh god, yeah. That's terrible for you. All that stuff just makes you feel awful. Just makes you, your, your body just goes into shutdown mode. Even on my cheat day, like I do, just because a, I'm a pig, I want to have my pig day. I always feel like shit. Do you eat gluten? Yeah. See, I don't know nothing about gluten. I'd never really read up on it. So like the real science behind my cousin is a lawyer in Washington. She has a bag gluten allergy where she'll like be in bedridden for gluten. She was telling me blah, blah, blah. I mean, I don't really know nothing about gluten. I have no gluten allergy. I've eaten pasta all my life. I'm italian. I grew up eating bread and pasta, but when I cut it out, I noticed a big difference.

Speaker 1:          01:54:06       My face got skinnier, first of all, I felt like less, less soreness in the areas that I usually get inflammation. Like my back. I went to it because of, um, a therapist told me that she told me they have good results with helping people out back injuries by getting off of gluten, getting off gluten and sugar. She's like, anything bad for sure. Terrible for you. She's like, these things, they're not just bad for you. She's like, they're inflammatory. And she goes, and that's what the issue is. The issue is inflammation. And if you have foods that cause inflammation, it makes injuries more difficult to heal. Yeah, iT was. I was reading about all that shit, like sugar and stuff. It taxes your kidneys and your liver and that they can't do their jobs right? So your body has more toxins and this should have and it makes your body inflamed and blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 1:          01:54:50       Sugar's not good for it. Too bad. It's fucking delicious though. God dammit. Everything good for you is fucking boring and bland. everything delicious. It's fucking terrible for you. It's true. That's where we are, where we are as a person. We haven't to figure out how to make. They've got a genetically engineered food to just be unbelievably delicious but nutritious it. What's that gmo? That's the devil. It's the devil or what? Well, here's what's up with gmos. Some of it is good and some of it is bad. Just like everYthing else. I mean, there's things like golden rice, they figured, figured out a way to engineer proteins to rice and make a rice that's more easy to, to, to process. And a lot of people have benefited from it greatlY. And then there's also shit that they designed that they want to make so that, uh, uh, a plant, certain plants can deal with pesticides.

Speaker 1:          01:55:42       There's that too. But there's a, but they've always done that with selective breeding, but they've, they've, they've messed with things so that they deal wIth pesticides better and unfortunately like a lot of times that fucks up the environment like bs, like they've, they've connected the drop of dropoff in the population of bees to a couple of different things. They say that cell phones are not good for them. They're not digging the fact that there's all these cell phone signals everywhere that fucks with bees apparently. But they can deal with that I guess. but what's fucking them up is there's certain pesticides that just wreck havoc on b communities and if you get a genetically modified plant and in these chemicals are involved in that process and these bees get ahold of these chemicals or they come into contact with these chemicals, it can be deadly to them.

Speaker 1:          01:56:28       There's, you know, this is a real issue with fucking, with nature, with we don't know the ultimate consequences because the world that we live in is an ecosystem. It's like everything affects everything. They say that if aunts died, if we killed all the aunts and the planet, we will be fucked. Like the whole world would go into chaos. It. Who knows these two? yeah, it was. We need everything. It's all here for a reason. You know, it's all connected and when you have something that you know, well it can absorb chemicals better so we can kill off all these bugs and we don't have to worry about and we get a big yield and we can sell that yield, but it's killing bees like that's. There's a yin and a yang to everything. There's a push and a pull to everything and the more you you dabble with nature, you're dealing with this unbelievably complex structure.

Speaker 1:          01:57:11       The structure of nature so intertwined and so, so broad that when you fuck around with it, hopefully it has a good effect, but there's also, there's going to be the potential for negative downsides. That's what I think about gmo. I think it's. Look, if we could figure out a way to make food that all these poor people would have nutritious food, it's super easy to grow and everybody benefits from it. Hey, I'm all for it, but most of the time when they're involved in genetically modified foods are doing it for profit. They do other things for money. It's a big part of what it is. Fucked up. Yeah. Because I was like, we think about money now this now with dealing carrier. What's gonna happen next? You know what I mean? Well, there's a lot of people that definitely don't think about the future. They just fucking ride that bitch.

Speaker 1:          01:57:59       Right? It's like, why the fuck do we do still use oil? It a bunch of reasons. One because we know how to do it and we'd have the whole systems in place for oil to change the system and change it to like solar. Like everybody, like la could probably run on solar if we have. So it's really a shame that we don't have solar panels everywhere in la. The motherfucker is constantly and they work and it's sunny constantly mean. It would be definitely more expensive. It would take awhile to then you also have to get batteries and the batteries have to have minerals and those batteries. A lot of those minerals come from conflict areas like the Congo or Afghanistan, so it's not all simple, sweet and clean to have electric power from, from solar because you have to have batteries to store that power.

Speaker 1:          01:58:41       Otherwise it goes off at night. You know what about, what about that nikola tesla? Dude, we Buy them. Yeah, sure. Yeah. She got fucked. You know, we never learned about him, but he meant that all the, all the best electrIc electric stuff, he invented a lot of cool shit, but he also fell in love with a pigeon. He was in love with the pigeon before he died and here's, I likes to fly pigeon. I don't think he fucked hIm. I don't think he fucked anything. He actually, one of the quotes, I can't find this anywhere else, but I read it once. I know for sure that he destroyed his sexuality was the quotes because yeah, you had some issue with some woman and it didn't work out and it just destroyed him. He couldn't concentrate, so he's like, you know what, I'm done with these balls and just she's,

Speaker 4:          01:59:21       hey did. There's a guy in my gym, he's a, he's from New York. Actually we a scientist, right? It looks like a normal guy, but he's a scientist and he, he, he invented this thing, do I? Now this company is in the works for that. It's like a $20,000,000 deal. Huge thing, right? It's a, it's a magnet assisted generator. So, so once it gets going, it's perpetual, not perpetual, But 10,000 years is how long a magnet last until the energy to magnet dies. So it'll, it'll spend 10,000 years. Jesus christ. It's like a fucking huge fucking deal. It's like, you know, twitter is three, a million or a huge deal and it's. He says it'll, it'll, it'll, it'll boost any power plant anywhere from 70 to 100 percent more power production, but it's like a pretty much like the modern tesla coil. Like it's like the newest thing. I actually told him I, I want to see if we can call them or somewhere. He said he would come down and talk to you, but it's a, it's a, it's a bad ass.

Speaker 1:          02:00:15       Yeah. Give me his email address and I'll email them. We'll figure it out, find out what it is. He told him about it at the gym that are.

Speaker 4:          02:00:22       But it's like it's gonna be a real deal man. And he says something like that. There's no. Because right now we use turbans. No, the windmill was created electricity. The turbines on the waterfall. Let's tricity the nuclear energy, but this thing is just fucking magnets and they spend by themselves and that's it and it makes electricity

Speaker 1:          02:00:36       so it just needs something to start it up. And then once it starts up they repel each other and I just keep on moving, you know, If it's that easy, why hasn't someone else figure that out? Petro emotion and supposedly not supposed to ever been solved. It's not perpetual motion. If you get something to start it up, if something starts it up, you know you're gonna need something. It only last 10,000 years, which is fucking long enough, but you got to get it going. But then once it goes, it just keeps. Keeps on moving. Boom, boom, boom. That's crazy. So this dude is easy figuring out a way to sell this. What would they think? They're in negotiations with? Huge, huge companies. Be better Fucking be careful. I was that dude. I'd hide where I live. They'll fucking kill him. Like they shit. That dude who invented the water card? The guy who rented the car power. That was powered by water. Yeah. He died in a meeting he had with these people. Sid Caesar. Since caesar. Just If the guy who invented the water car died in a meeting with these two people that were supposed to be government agents and he was screaming, they poisoned me, poisoned me. That was his last words for you. Had a attack fucked up, dude.

Speaker 3:          02:01:41       That might be a fake room or by the way sounds fake. It sounds fake. It sounds like that other one there. There you olympics. Won the olympics. One was totally fake. They like to do that lately. Like to have these websites and just write fake stories and then not even funny. They just fake. Yeah. There's a website where people, you could just add somebody's name to the last part of it and it will be a fake, a hoax death. Like it looks like a news site and it just replaces photos. There's too much on the internet. The internet, too much freedom on the government. When I was at the citadel at the college I was at because I was a biology major, so they had some scientists were touring the country and they were like coming around to schools and uh, trying to like tell us stuff, you know, what will make us aware.

Speaker 3:          02:02:20       It was like a team of four scientists and it was just them and their adventures. They're saying these are our inventions that the government is fucking canned. We're only four guys, you know, imagine how many other things are out there, but one guy, he said, he invented a carburetor that you can hook on any car and you're, I think it's 80 miles a gallon. Like instantly. He's like, oh fuck, I'm fucking. He was saying, well we went for like jam or what? He couldn't saY. It was like he thought I saved all this money. I'm going to be rich, blah, blah, blah. He says, the fuckIng government got the patent candidate, right? There's this lady, she made a clear enamel coat. He put her teeth one time, the dentist puts it on the clear coat, and keith are invincible. They'll never get a caBbie. Nothing.

Speaker 3:          02:02:56       They're like, it's like a seal. It seals your teeth. They bought the patent through the way away. Really know the guy invented. So you know, cigarettes are addicting, you know, but it causes fucking cancer. One dies. He invented a molecule that It addicts. You like nicotine still, but you just have no cancer. So the cigarette, you smoke and you're hooked on it, but you won't die. He's like, oh, this is the best invention ever. I'm gonna save all these lives. And the company that he worked for bought it and shoved it. That doesn't sound right. How is it possible that you could smoke and not get sick? Because the, the, the, the, the molecule event that was just like nicotine or whatever it was. It was addictive, but it was a car. It wouldn't kill you. I believe he said that to you, but I also believe he's full of shit.

Speaker 3:          02:03:41       I dunno. Some pretty complicated medicine right there. They people would know about the possibility of that. These guys were, there were a team of scientists and they're coming around like telling us like we're four guys and like we've invented this shit. It's hard when you're dealing with something that's so long ago too. And then like, you know, you try to like recant the story, tell the story, but that was adjusted. But you know what I mean. But, but it's like wait a while. If you had an enamel coat in her teeth, you cannot get a cavity then most answers out of work, you know, you know they that the car didn't. She doesn't want 80 mile per gallon cars. You know what I mean? They don't want that. Yeah, yeah. You know, back then you hook It on your car and you're, you're set. Well, the definitely would be a blow back. There was, it was definitely a lot of people. If they're losing money, if they would lose money, if something came along that made cars unbelievably more efficient, they would need less gasoline. That would be a fuckload less money. The amount of money that's spent every day In this country on fossil fuels. We can't even wrap our head around that number. Crazy. It's an insane number. So to get

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       that out, it's going to take many generations. It's going to take a long window of change or it's going to take one spectacular invention. Like the electric car. Electric cars are cool, but fuck, they take a long time to charge up. They could only go like 300 miles. It takes like you gotta charge them, like even if you need rapid charge, it's a half hour, so you have to sit in a gas station for half hour. Your fucking car charges. Talked to doing it for my gym. That guy, the scientist guy about the cars. I was like, yeah man. Like he says it's a scam though. He says that the whole car was pretty much a battery and he says that all the lead in the shit and the battery is, it actually ends up being just as bad or worse for the environment than, than if you just would have had a car with gas.

Speaker 1:          02:05:19       Really. That's what he says. But I was like, fuck. I thought that was all propaganda dude. But he says, no, it's fucking, it's not as good as you think it is going. Well. You definitely need minerals. Knew the same thing is with the um, with the batteries that you need for solar generators. You need minerals to put into the mean at least in the current technology that they had used lithium ion. And that's one of the big discoveries they found. Afghanistan was lithium. Lithium is pretty valuable stuff and then when they converted it into batteries like you to get that out of the ground, you got to get it out of the ground and that's so anybody thinks that you got this completely green, clean thing because it's made out of batteries now it's just not using as much fossil fuel every day. That's what he was saying.

Speaker 1:          02:05:57       He said that when you add it up, but it really isn't all you think is going to be. It takes fossil fuel to make a car too. That's another thing that people aren't taken into consideration and there's no tires other than rubber tires. I mean, you get, you gotta use synthetic materials to make tires. They haven't come up with a hemp tire yet. You know, until they come up with something that's absolutely green and biodegradable as a tire, you're always going to deal with you ever see a tire when it gets lit on fire forever. Disgusting. I mean, that is toxic waste. That's one of the things they do to people in Brazil. There was a thing, um, they, they do what they call microwave you, they put you inside a row of tires burning and burn you. It's because your dna, it becomes almost impossible to identify you because you Just get intermingled with these tires.

Speaker 1:          02:06:42       It's just a mess. Yeah. Gasoline and tires. It's like a fucked up way to get rid of a body. Oh, that, that's what people go destroy vehicles that they want insurance to be destroyed because the tire's melts so hot. That will actually bend the whole frame of the car. So that way you can do to get your car. So people are so silly. Yeah. So tell me, mAn, we were, we were talking about this, but we got off the subject. What did you do the entire year that you were in solitary? Like what was your day? Did you wake up [inaudible]? Because it was weird. They were fetus like at um, for him was breakfast, right? So they wake you up, feed you breakfast, eating past black guy, right. And then you get up again like nine or 10. Now 10:00 will be lunch. That's when you use a lot of weird schedule pick up lunch and then from that point on I will just read, I would read from 10:00 AM

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       until like 11 at night and I take an hour break to workout. Wow. Wow. I mean I read the second year I kept tracking with 117 books. Wow. But um, I mean there's nothing I could have read way more, but you will not of books, you know, you're out of books. It's so boring. I want to come out of myself every other day for an hour, you know what I mean? And then just like a just fucking board dude. What is it like to not talk to people for so long? I mean, you, you talked to. I mean it's just weird dude. It's like a to neighborhood. It's like a fucking time warp because when you're in there, the day goes by real slow with like the months go by quick and then when you get out it's just like, it was like, it was all a dream.

Speaker 4:          02:08:15       He didn't. Even if you weren't even in there, it's weirdly folks through your head. And then like, uh, it was whoa man, the underfed is so bad. Do they fucking underfed is bad. Yeah. And las vegas real bad. UH, I was trying to calculate how much protein I thought that was getting today. And it was like 20, 30 grams did. Whoa. And here's, here's, I know it was bullshit because this is vegas. Especially if it's ending. He goes better in vegas. We only got a piece of fruit like twice a week. So like we got like an orange like twice or three times a week. That's it. But we're just made with her. Was it right? So maybe with a got there, do hIs, his two months ends fucking he started bitching at the, at the judge, like they're not feeding me enough to give me shit free, blah blah blah, blah.

Speaker 4:          02:08:56       All of a sudden, bam fruit everyday. Big portions. All this shit for all of you. Everyone. Right? Because I know why. I know why. Because they were scared me. Whether it's camp was going to have the, the people that feed us, you know, investigating. Yeah. You know. And guess what, the second he left went away. Wow. No shit. I swear to god. And I told the, I told one of the cool god's name and come here. I said, you notice motHerfucker that as soon as me with her started bitching at court, now we've got bigger trades and we got fruit every day. And then he started chuckling and he laughed. He walked away. But it's like they knew, they knew what was up. They were undefeated in the fuck out of us. So what it like, how many calories do you think you get a day did?

Speaker 4:          02:09:33       It was, it was shit I hard to say, but no more than. Less than $1,500. Wow. It was bad dude. It was fucking starving all the time. So it must have been. Everyone was skinny then? yeah, unless you get. If you had money in the commissary, you can buy junk food. They sell chips and bullshit like that. But that said they don't sound like healthy options. Peanuts was the best. Well, I, I love on peanuts, but um, and, but then if the food was bad, man it was real bad. That was the worst part is so for a year, just bad food by yourself. Reading books. Daddy just going crazy in there. What about, um, what does it feel like to not talk to people for so long?

Speaker 4:          02:10:13       It's one, it's a, it's weird. You don't know untiL you get out when you get out of here, like culture shocked becAuse you know, you go from no interaction with nothing to like cars going by, you know what I mean? Just like whoa, you know, like me, I take, I take a medicine for anxiety and depression. I take lexapro because got, I have panic attacks and anxiety. I'll be honest. It was like 2006 lexa pros and antidepressants. Ssri. Yeah. Mostly I take it for anxiety, [inaudible] I would get panic attacks. It was just my dad died out. I would get them and then like I just battled them all my whole life and try to like, oh, you know, like I don't want to go to doctor doctors for postseason. No medicines for pussies, you know, and finally, actually when avenue was on ultra and fighter house in the ultimate fighter house, like the, the lack of a, I was so isolated, nothing, do nothing.

Speaker 4:          02:11:03       It really got me bad and I was having anxiety attacks on the show and it was just like I was a mess. Right. So when I got the ultimate fighter house I find say fuck this man, I'm not, I'm not gonna pretend to be tough anymore. I'm going to go try to get help, you know. And that shit made me 95 percent better, you know, in a lot of ways. But when I was in san diego that gave it to me and they just, they wouldn't give it to me really? Yeah. They fucking want give it to me. They're dicks. So the whole year we admitted degas was worse because I had none. I had a lot of anxiety in there. And did you, when is there like a um, like a wean off period or did you just cold cold Turkey? Cold Turkey. Me and you get withdrawals.

Speaker 4:          02:11:37       So like the first, the first three weeks I was miserable. Real, real bad. Like I don't know, it was bad. Then I, then I, then I settled down and that was kind of good. But I was just, it was shitty. It was shitty. Wow. So just a year of reading books and being by yourself. What about like hugging people and shit? Yeah. You see you get no, no interaction like that. And even the visits in san diego, the visits were behind glass so you can actually see you, which was a lot better in vegas. The videos were on like a computer, like a skype kind of thing, you know? So they would come there and they be there but you couldn't see them on skype kind of thing and half the time the phone didn't work good. Or the screens in orchid it was, it was really like after a while I just told the guards I don't want no visits canceled my visits Because it made it harder for me.

Speaker 4:          02:12:22       Like you know, you watch movies, like people were like in Vietnam movies, they're lIke, like why don't you write me back? You know, like, like I was in the war, I want to focus on the ward. I did write back and other families or whatever I can understand because when I was there I didn't want any fucking business. I didn't want, I didn't call anybody, I didn't, I just sat there and read my books and I did my, my jail blogs every, every week. Yeah. I've read those, had those and I just, I decided there and just you're in a bubble man. It was hard for me because when I was in jail, like my, I was married and my wife got deported back to Hungary and all this shit. So like I didn't even get to say goodbye. My grandma died when I was in jail and it was like my grandma was living, my grandma was living in vegas like fucking 10 minutes from the jail and I could even say bias.

Speaker 4:          02:13:04       SHe was dying of cancer. She died, you know? And it was like, it was, it was rough. It was a rough year last year. So do you get young kids who might like look up to you and they might be kind of going down the same path, the. Do you get guys like that coming up to you for advice and you tell them just don't go to jail, man. Whatever you do, figure out a way to get out of trouble, figure out a way to avoid violence. Yeah. You kNow, I do that even in jail, you know, I would talk to guys I'm, I'm not as there for a fight. And I've talked to other guys like, you know, especially the first year I was there when I was in general population. Now I try to help them. Like amen. You're not going to fucking quit the drugs if you go get back out and handled the same friends.

Speaker 4:          02:13:44       Like this is the bottom line. You got to quit your friends, you've got to get new friends and new environment or you're going to go back. I don't give a fuck. So you know what I mean? Like these guys, I will say this, seeing that's my problem is fighting, right? If I go to a bar, you're drunk. It's not, I'm not going to look for a fight, but guess what, if something happens, I know it's a bad recipe, you know, you're trying your problems, cocaine, but when you get out you better not be around your friends with the cocaine. So I would tell the guys like, you know, it ain't worth it motherfucker. And these gangs gang bullshit. I see like young kids who were 17, they brought state from juvenile hall fighting a murder case and he was like 17 old kid. He didn't even do it. His friend did it, but he's not going to rack rack. Do you know he's, he's in a gang and shit. But I said many of your friends, a piece of shit. He doesn't mean he did it cause you guys are both. They both get life, you know, because life's ruined. so I'll tell you. Oh you young kids, man, it ain't worth it man. Talk to the older guys. Know I got to tell you, the older guys always like, man, this is bullshit. I wish I could take my life back, but it's too late. So.

Speaker 1:          02:14:41       And when you're in the wrong environment, man, especially with alcohol, it's so easy to get in trouble. I mean that story that you told about the old man that pushed the tow truck driver. And then next thing you know he'S in jail. The next thing you know he murdered a guy in jail and next thing you know he's probably in jail for life. Who knows what happened to him because he couldn't afford a good lawyer. He was poor. You know, we've got a real problem with. That is a real problem with that situation, that particular story that's like this hard by the book shit. we, they don't look at each individual case as being a separate entity and say, oh, these are circumstances that are pretty unusual. I see what's going on here. This guy's not a criminal. He just overreacted. You can overreact like that

Speaker 4:          02:15:19       dude, you got to go. I've been in court because we go to court, you know, like they bring the whole bus of us to go to court sometimes. And like you watch the judges, men given out 15 years, 10 years, like not, not even looking at but from the paper 10 years. Like it's like what the fuck. Like this guy has given out years. like they don't understand how long that is, that they don't care. They don't care. They have no. And sometimes sometimes the guy who deserve a dude, but sometimes it's like fuck.

Speaker 1:          02:15:43       When you heard about that judge in Pennsylvania that was putting kids in juvenile detention centers and getting paid for it, he was doing it for years. He just went to jaiL. They sentenced him to 25 plus years. He's a fucking judge man. And he was getting payoffs because of the same thing we talked about about privatized prisons, about prisons making profit off of the amount of people that they have in them. Dude, fucking madness man. It's fucking so you get out. All right. You're, you're there for a year. Shit. Diet. Fucking no human interaction. What is your first week like?

Speaker 4:          02:16:16       So I get out. And then how long before you get some pussy? Well that's the thing. So I, when I first got out I was, I was so like, oh man, like I'm like a, what's it called? Conceited or whatever. I had to look good. I, my whole life I've been in shape whole life, been working out. so when I got out of jail, like I feel like insecure. Like I, I'm skinny, I'm like skinny fat, I just have a shitty body, a pale, I feel ugly. Right? So I, I didn't go, I didn't push it for a month because I was trying to get decent schaefer's because I thought I just felt like insecurity plus the first, both towns I got out of jail. The first two weeks were hard man. Like my anxiety is bad. Like, like, like I didn't get on the lexapro right away when you got out?

Speaker 4:          02:16:55       Uh, yeah. When I got out I tried it, I got it right away. So the first like ngo, I didn't cry or in jail, not because I'm tough, I just didn't cry. I don't know why even my grandpa died. I didn't cry and I just sat there and numb. Right. But when I got out the first two weeks I would cry every night in bed. What the fuck, like getting out is so much shit's hitting at the same time. And just like, like when I first walked into the gym and I started crying, like, just like too much emotion, too much weird from going from no interaction to bam, like on the freeway, this, that is that going crazy. It's too much to, to any sensory overload and I can't even explain it. It was just fucking weird. Really weird. And I'm like, dude, you didn't expect that.

Speaker 4:          02:17:33       And suicidal too. Like I was gonna kill me. Like I want to kill myself. Really? Yeah. And what was, what was the motivation to kill yourself? Like what were you, what was so upset aBout It? Just the uh, your, your, you get overloaded with, with emotion to the. I don't know, it's weird that you can't go out. You can't go from like being in a box to real life. They should like gradually, like adjusting to a halfway house. I don't know, something, something because just it's too much, too much at one time. Like now everything's real. When I was in jail, nothing's real. When you're in jail, it's like a, it's a fake world man. It doesn't seem real. And you get out and it's like that was a dream and now all of a sudden your wife really got the port at your grandma's really did.

Speaker 4:          02:18:14       Your grandpa was really miserable as fuck. Dan wants to die, you know, like you got to pay bills now. TheY want me to find paul daily right off the bat in three months. What the fuck? You know, I'm like too much stress and I use, you know, you, you started going crazy dude. And like you just feel like miserable. The hardest part about jail for me was getting out the first few, few weeks. That's a crazy thing is. So this is the door. This is your beltour contract. They wanted you to fight daily. Three weeks, three months after you got out of jail. Yeah. Because what they did was they did a fan fight vote when I was in jail. Me daily, saunders and lima and like the fans vote and whoever wins the top two bolts is going to win. I said, if you want to say I'm going to limit the dumb ass, I'm going to win.

Speaker 4:          02:18:56       So no you're not. I said, I'm going to fucking win the vote, dude. No one else is gonna. Get more posts, man. I'm telling you dude, I don't want to. I don't want to fight. I don't wanna fight. None of those guys. My first fight after three months, three months ago, you're not going to win and do fucking. I wouldn't buy like 10 times as many opposed to anyone else. It was like me versus daily was number one. Then we didn't meet her honors meters, lima. I was like, fuck. Okay. So don't find daily first. Like whatever. Right? Then what do they say to you when you bring that up? Like I told you, pitch. I was like, told you. They're like, fuck man. Like you, you killed it. Yeah. I'm like, but it wasn't like, it wasn't even a. And then was a tournament.

Speaker 4:          02:19:27       So trauma is three fights. So I was like, it was the first finance. So fucked man. I'm getting the first. It's like basically you got your number two top seeds. Most popular guys fighting in the first fight for at least amount of money because you know, graduate, it's like 77, the first bite, 50 and 15. Then the rest. So it's like we're losing the first round. I make seven grand. It's like neither one of us want to make seven grand. Like fuck, that's so crazy. Seven grand for a professional mma fight on television. Yeah. But I'm glad. Was the standard the same thing in ufc too, you know, with everyone for lower. But yeah, for anyone, you know. But either way like put the tournaments good because a tournament should be seated. So the two guys, the two best guys should fight at the end is not in the beginning.

Speaker 4:          02:20:07       No. So it was like fuck. Anyway, I'm training, getting back in shape and a month until I tore my acl. So I teaR my acl. not a, not a bad thing all the way through, but the tear partial and I fractured my tibia tibia plateau. It's like, fuck, so I just got out and now this happens and I blamed on the nutrition. I think my body, my bones were still leached from, from that whole year of starving and bad nutrition in it. I've never been hurt before. You know it right away. Bam. My tee shirt. It didn't help. It didn't help being out of shApe like that and force yourself to get trained in a high level. I tear that then. No, no, no. I started at a fixer. Really? How bad is it? Buckle. Not as buckle. It's pretty strong. It was a partial tear. It's partially.

Speaker 4:          02:20:54       Yeah, it wasn't bad. It wasn't habit in any way to do prolotherapy poor. I'm poor, you know, a guy got really poor, you know, like when I got out of jail was living in my students garage, like the garage, like, you know, and I was driving this piece of shit car and like I was broke as fuck, you know, so I just sucked it up and uh, you know, I feel it. How do you make money then? I don't remember. That made money. So how you been fighting for? How long have you been fighting for beltour now? Um, since, since the last year. So then after I fixed my knee, I went and filed a blossom aina first fight back. It killed in a Second round with crucifix. Then, um, then I went to the tournament and I fought a skype on anderson who's from China? White guy.

Speaker 4:          02:21:39       The guy beat him jailbird it was dick. She has things like me, like I don't ever talk shit about my opponents like outside, like mannequins, but usually when I fIght I come, I'll fight, I'll fight your hardest. I can, but I don't, I'm not gonna say shit. But if you started the nightmare personally and I don't have, to me you cross land, cross land and that's it. I don't play the fucking bullshit game of like, oh, it's for sure for sure. That motherfucker like if you want to play the game, it's really for me. What do you thInk about the situation of bell tour? That I thought was really strange was the chandler situation, the chandler and alvarez situation and then the aspirin thing. Like how did they let him go when he's the champ? You know what a like bellow tour. It is awesome.

Speaker 4:          02:22:25       The creamy good. Yeah. I liked him a lot, right? I think an aspirin, I think really. He's a nightmare dude. He's a fucking nightmare. He's invincible. He's boring and no one wants to see him fight the truth and they created a monster. You know what I mean? So he wanted to go good. Get the fuck out of here. It was like, it was almost like they let alvarez go. Right. Why is marketable? Because he fights wild asking. No one wants it. He's done so many fans and the ufc didn't want him either because he's one of you would have asked. She goes in and beats everyone. I'm I want to see it. Yeah, he won't. He has no hands. But what if we did. Then you got this fucking guy, that women prior to that, when lynn was invincible, right. He lost one time to fucking dave trail.

Speaker 4:          02:23:08       They fired him because they're like, thank god we got rid of matt lindland because he was. He was not marketable. Found eco vitaly too. And knocked himself out. Remember he went to lateral, dropped him still. He didn't deserve yet fired yet. But they wanted rid of them. You know what I mean? Suplex. They want to rid of them. Yeah, no, for sure. So like not as koreans didn't know. Massland asking fucked up. he should have stayed in builder. Now what's he gonna do now is going to fight in China. Nfc, right? Yeah. But is there any more? I think they're paying them good though. They have to be, but like he's out of the most exposure is obviously the fight in the ufc belt was the second most exposure that you can get. What else? You. No one's gonna watch. Who's going to watch?

Speaker 3:          02:23:45       Man? Me personally, I'm a purist and I feel like if there's a guy like ben asking that can hold you down and dry hump you for five rounds, that's what he can do. Like if that guy should be able to fight and if he could take guys down and give them the buggies and elbow him and punch him in the head and, and hold everybody down for five rounds, then that's reality. That's reality. You can't. You can't hide that. You can't not have that guy fight because you're worried he's going to be boring. He's doing everything according to the rules. Like you can't like penalize a guy because you don't particularly like his style and that's my issue that I have with every organization does. I think they're crazy. I would never do it. If I was running bella tour, I would have given the guy who's fucking money.

Speaker 3:          02:24:25       He's the champ. Nobody could beat him. It's kind of interesting. It's kind of interesting. you've got a boring champ. You've got a guy like douglas lema who's just fucking beast. Smashing people. Then was fish too. Vicious, vicious dude. Takes him down like nothing. Cookie sandwiches, bitch pizzas. That lean was a huge giant ashlyn. Small farewell walter, and they asked her to take some down. No problem man, handle them, but it all comes down to to the ratings. Dude. I don't give a fuck. I really think that the ratings are very important, but the product has to be pure. As soon as you. You fuck with things like you remember what elite ecc was? Standing people out. They'd go down for like 15 seconds. Stand the most bullshit. They stood up. Big country. He had andre arlovski inside control and he's Working on komora and they stood him up.

Speaker 3:          02:25:08       He had this, he had the double wrist lock. He had the whole thing up there and they stood them up, but I was like, out is this side control. You're standing. The guy up, they still dudes up from the mount guys are full mountain. They stood them up. It's crazy. They wanted to be almost no ground time. They want almost no ground time, but when you do that, you change in what mma really is. Mma is a fight and in those five minutes you have some specific rules. You can't kick in the groin. Camp poke in the eyes can pull guys here go. I mean, you know what the rules are. Don't kick it down upon it. Everything else you could do and if a guy like asking could just take dudes down and get on top of him and punch him in the face and they can't do shit about it.

Speaker 3:          02:25:45       I mean he's winning within the rules. He was winning. you got to let them win. You got to let them win. You got to let them try to win this. The only, the only reason I could think why they didn't keep them and why the use of why didn't you want them? Listen. If the ufc took him and then he fights johny hendricks and gets put into night-night land. That's fantastic. That's interesting. Will see. I think a scared. Maybe he won't. He could. It's possible. It's totally possible. If you look at his record. Well one guy gave him a hard time. Jay here on game. A real hard Time with this. We can wrestle inbox. He could wrestle any. I don't think. I think hendrix would would have killed them at cost check. I think we're killing anyone that anyone's going to wrestle and punch, but I want to see it.

Speaker 3:          02:26:20       I want to see it too. I want to see a guy be effective until he can't be effective anymore. Like when people said like they asked me like, were you sad when anderson silva got beat? I was like, no, I'm never sad when anybody gets beat. I'm sad if someone gets hurt. I was more sad the second fight to see a dude fuck his leg up like that. But I want to see a guy like anderson silva who looks invincible, get a guy, figured that out. That's the evolution of the game. It's all about that. And if it was, you know, whoever it was, whether it was vittorio was chris weidman, whoever it is. I like to see these guys figure it out. I like to see a guy salva guy, but I mean that's the only reason that I can say why you sit in silence.

Speaker 3:          02:26:58       I don't see it. I mean, I don't understand what it is. I think it was also the issue that they felt that a bell tour was playing games and like bella tour was, you know, like they might know, oh we we cast off are. We didn't even want them anymore. The ufc took them, ha ha, they're dummies. That guy's boring. And when bjorn was saying that, I'm not a fan of his style, you know, like the guys affected. But he's kind of boring. Like I don't find them boring as a person who grapples. I get fascinated by how the fuck he does it. I don't know why I want to roll with the guy because I want to feel it because I don't get it. I mean I see him manhandled dudes and I've, I've wrestled dudes that are real. You know what Eric Bradley is, but high level wrestler.

Speaker 3:          02:27:35       He was trading at 10th planet once we were doing these neon belly drills. That dude threw me off him like I was a fucking pillow like this. There's certain dudes are that creepy wrestling strength, you know? And when I was on the bottom when he was doing neon belly on me, I wasn't going nowhere. Man. That's where I was staying. And he wasn't any bigger than me. Like maybe 10 pounds bigger than me. There's something weird that those who like olympic level, high level grapplers have fucker was with yesterday, the olympian, silver medalist dude, he was on top of me, bro. He's smaller than me first of all, and I'm strong. He felt strongly as fuck. Retarded, like just so strong, like a rock. It was something else. It's Your whole life. Just grappling. Those guys develop freaky strain. He just like, he just went out there so he could hold me there,

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       but I couldn't. I'm good at getting up. I was like, fuck thiS guy off me, dude.

Speaker 1:          02:28:26       Yes. Stuck. I mean, you know. Yeah. There's some freaky dudes like that man that have that freaky grapplers trying to. Obviously aspirin has it beCause if you look at his body, I mean, he doesn't look like a bodybuilder. Oh, it doesn't look strong and he looks like an athlete, but he doesn't look like your guy who even does as much strength and conditioning. He's, he's, uh, he's uh, one of them freaks, you know, he just ragdoll people. It's weird to watch. I was really looking forward to him when they, when they said that that bell toward was not going to sign them. I was looking forward to that guy beat in the ufc champion, the ufc, him and robbie lawler. I would want to see if robbie gets stopped that tank down. I want to see what the fuck. What happens to him when he gets hit by a demon.

Speaker 1:          02:29:03       You know what if he gets in there with carlos condit and you know, and he can't. If conduct could stop the shot and he's got to stand up with them. I want to see him against like the real high level guys. Now there's going to be fighting dudes you never heard of in China, you know? Yeah. Maybe. Okay. You'll fight it. Okay, so he's over there, right? Yeah. Without it was wrestling to death. Do you feel like there's enough options? I mean there's bella tour this ufc and then there's not this world series of fighting and then is a wfa. There's a few other ones or what is the rfa rfa ad sources organization.

Speaker 4:          02:29:34       I mean, to me the only legit organizations as you've seen bill her, like roaches fridays is legit, but I hasn't been, I don't think it's going to last. How long is gonna be around, you know, these things pop up and then he disappeared and I heard the pain kind of too much and I don't know, I just don't know if they haven't really going to last. You know whaT I'm saying? They're on nbc late at night, but I heard they, they pay for their spot and shit. I don't know if it's true though because the nbc is not promoting it, you know what I mean? To me, if you're not, you got to be in belt or a ufc one. Bad ass too. But you get no exposure. You can't get sponsors because no one's going to see the fight. You know what I mean? So you got to be on american tv so you've got to be in either use your built or and to me like fucking a I am.

Speaker 4:          02:30:18       I'm happy at bell tour because they gave me freedom dude. Like I know goddamn well the people like would you ever go back to the ufc? Would I have liked to do? See the question. Doesn't matter. That doesn't matter because guess what? I'll be fired everY week. You know what I mean? Like it doesn't matter. Like just for your blowjob tweets. Yeah, I couldn't do shit. I'll be fired. So it doesn't matter if I would like to use that doesn't. I don't want to care about it right now. What I want to do, I want to fight for to her and I'm going to win them and do good. And now I'm gonna start this side business with mike, with my navy seal friends and the tee shirt company. And that's it. I do alpha male shit. Tee shirts, which is very funny. I love those sharp tongue in cheek there.

Speaker 4:          02:30:57       Funny. We know why. It's because all these fires make the mistake of making a t shirt with like war machine on it, right? Not everyone knows who I am, dude. And not everyone likes me. So for years, my fucking, my little profile on my twitter and everything says all of a sudden instead of like ufc belt and he says, I do alpha male shit. That's it. Right. So I said, I'll make sure it, that way guys will see it and they'll be like, they don't need to know who the fuck I am. I don't care about me but by the shirt because he liked what it says. You know, I saw way more if I made a trip, said warm, I wouldn't sell it. Not nearly as much. I saw hundreds of these. That's funny. You know what I mean? It's a smart move. It's a lot of dudes who want to pretend to be alpha.

Speaker 4:          02:31:35       Yeah. Yeah. And you know, and like a body's wanting to do this. I want to fight and be able to do these shirts. And me and my, my navy seal buddies were getting a government contract to we're, we're, we're, we're building a whole curriculum dude. So it's three seals, me and bruny and we're building a me and brittany or putting on navy seal gear and we're going to wrestle with it. And shit, we're going to actually the vulnerable brand new curriculum from start to finish and we're going to. We're getting government contracts to train seals and green berets around the country. That's a great idea. And it's going to be fucking lucrative dudes. Brandon wolfe from you remember him. He was an ex silly fight. The ufc, he's doing a similar thing on the east coast, but they did obviously they did it where seals method moves and then they had brandon since he fought to help them teach it.

Speaker 4:          02:32:21       So we're doing the opposite. We're going to have us or the shit and the event moves and we're going to teach it, but it's going to be like it's never been done before. And we already have like my buddy has all the government contracts so it could be a thing where if it gets big enough, it can be where we can hire out other fighters that are done fighting because a lot of us don't have shit to do. Dude. Like we don't have a backup if you're not. If you had the champion that you didn't make enough money to have a backup plan. So if I can make fucking 150 grand a year, training seals and green berets this hand, the hand shit and then if it gets too big and we could hire fucking this guy and that guy that, you know what we've done fighting come work for us, it will be trained in the moves that we could do it.

Speaker 1:          02:32:56       That's a smart thing to. Because there's some, there's some specialists in like unarmed combat when it comes to removing guns from people and removing knives from people. There are some specialists but outside of that, most of their hand to hand combat shit is bullshit. It's not real. It's not going to work. Like I was watching the show the other night, I was watching the sportsman's network at late at night. They have like the self defense scenarios. Like a guy got attacked in an elevator and he's controlling this guys arm and then he pulls his gun out and shoots the guy after he's controlling this guys arm. And I'm like, why is that guy just standing there like he's not gonna you not gonna control a guy's arm like that. If a guy knows how to fight, what about his other arm? You ain't doing shit about this arm.

Speaker 1:          02:33:34       You just. There's so many facts. What if he moves? What if he pulled his arm out? What if he kicks you in the dick? Like there's a lot of shit going on. Like what you should know, and this is what I was on opie and anthony wants to. They used to have this dude that worked for them was this fake karate guy who was talk all this mad stupid shit about you know their sport and then there's what works on the street. Like no dummy. This is what works. What works with trained killers that works on everybody when you, when your shit works on anderson silva, your shit works on everybody.

Speaker 4:          02:34:00       What did that. The thing is like know I've been at, I've been trading a long time, you know, like a new gal coming. He's like, oh my god. Like right now I could poke your eyes out. I should poke him. Okay. You can try to poke them like, you know what I mean? Just try. Just try and you can't motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       Because if I'm on the mountain, you can't reach my eyes and I can read yours. I'll poke your fucking eyes and if you in my garden you can reach my eyes either because I'm going to have. You're not going to get my eyes try biting through my calf. So said that once. Yeah. You don't fight through your calf. You try to arm bar but you won't hurt. That will break your fucking arm. Can you bite through a steak? If I gave you a fucking giant ham like ham with it? It hasn't been cooked yet. You think you can bite through that. You could hurt it. It'll be out cheat. But in that field, good. That's the whole thing is like, all right, well now usually I pokes with youtube motherfucker. If you can learn how to mountain one night can really pull through as good.

Speaker 3:          02:34:52       And that's the thing we will street fighter like won't work. Street fighting is all who's willing to go farther. So like maybe like we're fighting and then you know, if you want to, if you want to try to head with me or bite me, he's asking to scare me. I'm disengaged. Or I'm like, oh mother, motherfucker, and I'm going to do it too. You know what I mean? So it was always like, who goes through this farther? You know, how serious are you willing to get. You know what I mean? That's, that's. You remember those felony fights. There's one of them where a dude held the guy down. He was biting his face. It was so fucked up. He's holding him down into his scree and biting his face. The guy just giant bite marks on his face and the guy quit actually do a bit his face.

Speaker 3:          02:35:28       He was like, what the fuck man? He's like, hey, didn't say I can't bite your face. He goes, how far are you willing to go? Dude, go, yeah. You always hear stories about some dude in some town, a bit, some dudes nose off. You're like, jesus christ knows off, but you're right about those guys. They don't know. My friends are seals and they're like, don't do that. They said they thought they thought it was. Don't shoot the fuck out of you had a hand, you know that they don't know shit, so if we can invent a curriculum that it's legit because all, they're never going to be in a fight, but if they're going through a hallway with a gun and someone don't talk about doors grabbed was when the tangled up. They need to be able to defend themselves. Ready real quick. You need to know how to do that and that's something that for the longest time before the ufc came around really before nma came around, people didn't really know what was the stuff that worked because how many times do you get in a fight in an elevator?

Speaker 3:          02:36:20       We got to pull your gun so dudes would be inventing a bunch of shit that could work. And then from here I'm controlling his arm. He's, he's in my position for me to land up devastating elbow and from here he's done. Like if there's not, that's why I wasn't hungry. Once visiting my family and I trained them, I was hungry and I find that good human train and I found another gym and it was like these fucking japanese akita kind of guy and he was showing me shit like for like an hour just twisting it, like he was like showing me stuff, but I'm letting them do it. I'm like, fuck it. This shit is bad ass. I'm going to maybe said maybe it does kind of work. That. And we wrestled was fucking never once was I ever in anything. Not one thing I didn't even have to defend.

Speaker 3:          02:37:00       One thing was just it doesn't work. It doesn't fucking work. And somebody told me that to quito is really effective. You just have to have a true aikido master. I'm like, well, get an aikido master to fight in the octagon. I would love to see it. I'd love to see a guy just stand there. Just flip people effortlessly. Have them sore. It worked. Yeah. Like we're kids. We watched steven seagal and van damme. I wish that shit. What was the best? That's the best. It's fun, but it just isn't, you know. But that's the most important thing about, about mixed martial arts is that we know now more about martial arts than people did 20, 30 years ago. We just know more for, for a fact, we know what's more effective. Because know back in the old days, everyone gets by with like, they don't have to prove it.

Speaker 3:          02:37:40       Had the belt. That's it. This is the best, you know, I'm the teacher. You stand still. I'm sure they'll move. You don't spoil the fucking teacher. You know, like, like, you know, I met my, a beer at your sheet. Have tried choking me on track and trying to get him. We're fighting all day long. He's my teacher were fighting. No other martial art. Do you really fired teachers? Happier teachers. Sometimes you know, any bravo goes to town with his students. And I've seen him get tapped by guys by black belts are brown belts or what have you because he takes chances and it'll fight five guys in a row and he's exhausted. That's what's called training. I mean, that's what it's. That's what it's about. Practice. That's where you want to lose. Yeah, exactly. And if you're afraid to lose, then you're afraid to get better. If you're afraid to get better, you're going to be stagnant and you're always going to be.

Speaker 3:          02:38:18       You're always going to shy away from rolling with anybody that can tap you. There's a difference between people that don't understand, that they've never trained before. If you've never trained before you, you'll, you'll never understand that the correct mentality, the correct mentality is like marcello garcia, like has the best statement about that. It's like you have to open up your game in the gym. That's the only way to get better because you have to worry about, you know, you have to give yourself the potential to get tapped. Don't, you're not going to be able to type of guy. But if you do, you figure just tap, just tap and move on. That's like barrett, barrett, small, just fucking 35. He's a bad motherfucker though. And he's a maniac. Barrett is a fucking dick. The personality to the core, his drug is introduced. I mean, he's in there three, four times a day, all day long.

Speaker 3:          02:39:04       He's a maniac. He, he gets hurt. You'll tapers out onto himself and still really, he's a maniac with barrett. Take a day off. He won't. He'll blindfold ourselves sometimes in rural. Wow. He just uses a maniac. He's a maniac. And uh, he always wants to put himself and make it harder for them, you know? And he's little and he's like, fuck, he's so small. We can just get them. But you can't because he's a super technical though. He's really fun to watch too, you know, she does a good guy to learn from my bed to. Oh yeah. And he's, he's like one of the most humble guys. He'll see a white belt, like do something weird. Like, hey, what the fuck? What did you just do? Like, it wasn't a move, but at the bears then it'd be better with like, he doesn't care if he's learned to brandon.

Speaker 3:          02:39:44       We've invented yourself and your, your first day he'll try it. He don't care. He has no ego at all. That smart guys experience. Well that's a good attitude man. Because you remember there was like a big resistance to a lot of the traditional guys with a lot of new stuff. Was coming along, a lot of guys were saying, you don't need it. All you need is just straight. Great jokes, but there was so many new moves and people were like dark jokes and all this shit that people didn't accept for a while. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You do japanese neck ties. You have to do japanese neck times. It's when you can't get the doors. If you can't go all the way through and get the doors, you get it and he's cinch up here and you tuck the guy's head into your chest. You roll over them this way and you hook a leg and crank.

Speaker 3:          02:40:24       It is a nasty neck crack. It's obviously not london. Bravo's really good at that. The japanese japanese neck tying guess. Yeah, peruvian necktie, japanese net cranked, whatever it's called. It's a nasty move. Instead of completing the doors, instead of getting it all the way and sinking sensation it like this. Sometimes it's hard to get all the way. Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. With long arms. Guys. How'd you. How those little t rex arms, but guys like roger gracie, you know they have that advantage. Damien maia want 70, you know, he's got a good long frame at one 70. He's an interesting guy at one 70 [inaudible]. There was a guy that like, I never thought he was gonna be able to cut that weight. Like that's a, that's a big dude for 170 pounds. He guys like Nathan Moore court tool. I couldn't live with Kuwait. He apparently was walking around and like one 85 when he was fighting at one 85 or was.

Speaker 3:          02:41:14       He looks so big. I never seen him personally, but he looks huge while he's muscular, you know. But apparently he never really cut much weight at all and fought at one 85. That dude, they, you know, there's people to talk about him from the time when he was coming up and enter into the ufc about how fucking good he was before he got into the ufc back when he was fighting in strikeforce or buy back even before then that uh, he was always sparring with like big, big heavy guys though. Like he would spar with shane carwyn and they came up at the same gym. So he'd be in there guy fighting at one 70, one 85 flight and shane fucking car when it to 65 and they'd be going to war with each other on a regular basis. I've been a fight like the waterways.

Speaker 3:          02:41:54       Nothing. Yeah, you're going to hit me. I get hit by a car when everyday and not that they mean he's also taking those shots and like a guys who know him think that probably contributed to his demise all chin. He was it. Yeah. Because you know those dudes that trevor whitman's dudes, you can't spar with them. Big guys. I mean like unless they're really, really controlled. But even like, um, I was probably like ray sefo and like a couple of guys that could towards that are big, but they're going soft. But even though I'm going soft dude it fucking, they hit you. You know what I mean? They checked your kik for knees or even like needs like that wire they kick. You know what I mean? Even even, even a soft heavyweight keeps you in the leg soft and it lands that weight. It's still heavy and it still hurt your leg more than any wall to where ever, you know, I stay away from the heavyweights unless they're super, super controlled.

Speaker 3:          02:42:44       Yeah, that's smart. That's how it all you guys get back. Injuries to rolling with heavy weights to get twisted up and gets sprawled on rehab. One time I fucking shot on gabriel. Gonzaga squash me like a book. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. piece huge and moves good. And he's a giant dick guy when he walks onto the scale when gonzaga is different than anybody else in the ufc. When he gets on the platform, you feel like the weight of just his. He's like dense, like stone, like he's mad stone, but he's a dude that trains all the time and ludlow, Massachusetts. He's not treating them like real good guys out there. You know, he's got massive potential. I mean jujitsu world champion, bad ass jujitsu, knockout power. But he's like a step behind the, the really the very best guys as I felt that, that the last thing on the uc did about them.

Speaker 3:          02:43:37       They followed them around. But it's cool though, you know, you see his, his life there is really good. Obviously it's got a nice gym. The people love him, you know, he's a great jujitsu coach too. He's a nice guy and he's very, very nice guy. I remember, I remember one time I was at wec wins. He came up to me. He's like, hey man was. It was close after I filed j rock. He was like, that was a good fight. And I was like, fuck. That was awesome. Like I was like, you mother fucker, you if I was good with crooked when you. That was crazy. I mean like, but it was to have them say that it was maybe not all of them. Like, oh, I love him now. He's a very nice night. His knock out cro. Cop was the all time greatest head kick knock out ever was plus because like it was a little.

Speaker 3:          02:44:13       How is he going to win the last one? all the lists of lists. His head kick. Yeah, that's croak. I was fucking move. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like you're never going to invent guests that move. He had kicked the guy who's responsible for more head kick, highlight reel knockout than anybody. like when you watch a cro, cop and pride career was head kicked in. What happened to him? Why do you not do good in the ufc? Did a lot of questions. Juice could be that. Could it be juice? Could be punishment. Maybe the amount of punishments. Body took all those fights or fate or the fights with nogueira fights with. I mean think about how many guys who fought took a lot of fucking hard hard fights because it was scary. He was a monster in his first fight in ufc. Eddie sanchez, right?

Speaker 3:          02:44:53       Yeah. And like theY told eddie, eddie eddie knew was going to lose. We didn't even like you didn't do shit that he really, you know what I mean? Not much. He definitely didn't look like the same cro cop. He never did ever say, but it could just be that it was the end of the run. you know what I mean? Guys, just they can only keep it up for so long. Like you want to keep it up for so long, you know, he was a great, great, great fighter. When he won the pried open wait grand prix man, he was a motherfucker back then when he knocked out vandelay, the cro cop that knocked out vandelay was one of the baddest motherfuckers ever because he had like, he first fought vandelay. He didn't know shit about the ground game and they had like a weird first. The first fight was like weird rules, like they only go to the ground for like 30 seconds or something like tide family up and hang out with, hang on but wouldn't even be standing up.

Speaker 3:          02:45:37       He didn't. It wasn't free to uncork shots because he was still worried about the wrestling. But the second fight he had his take down defense down. He had a good spa at the end and he lit vandelay up like a christmas tree. That was one of the best, the best performances of his career. It's the second fight with vandelay, but yeah man, who knows. I mean every fighter, they got a window. You got a window of time where you could perform at that level, you know, and when you're 37, 38, 39, it's just slowly winding down and then that's it. There's not much left after that. You

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       know, these guys that did perform at that super high level was vandelay and pride. I think about that. Vandelay was never the same. Vandelay

Speaker 4:          02:46:17       no was easy. We, yeah, he was still. He was still pretty good though. Pretty good pride. It was crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:46:25       Well, he was dominant and pride. that's the difference. He's still wild in the ufc. like he's still beat kyung lee. Yeah. But then he gets knocked out by leaving, you knoW, it was weird. Fucked up. Each tried to go to war with leaving. You can't stay in the pocket believe because he can take it, leave and can take it any. The motherfucker hits hard. Chris [inaudible] left hand is a, a battering ram and motherfuckers got a real hard lefthand is a matter of him being able to hit you like uriah hall fight. He just couldn't catch. Hall hall was just too good, but vandelay went chin to chin with them. Well, theY're the same style. That why is. Yeah, but you know, like vandelay is still like the brian stann fight was a great fight. Still capable of putting on great fights. It's just not the same vandelays the vandelia beat like, like, or like I'm quinten jackson or the vandelay that beat sakuraba or the vandelay, the beat henderson the first fight and he was a destroyer. He was a scary fucker. it was. But it might've been a little bit help there. Might have heard a little bit.

Speaker 4:          02:47:23       They had to. They all know they do, but I know they do it, but it's like what happened? What I think happens is that some fighters, if your first fight is on juice, then you mentally are dependent on it. Yeah. I think the guys that can't perform without are those ones that they always had it, but I think the guys that fight a lot of times without it and then having, having and then have, they can do either way. You know, some guys that they've done it from day one, then they rely on the juice. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          02:47:52       Well, we only have a couple minutes left, but I want to ask you one thing about, because this is like the hot topic now in mma is testosterone replacement. These guys that are like 29 years old and replacing that testosterone and there's a real issue now because vittorio is going to fight chris weidman, they're going to fight in the United States and they're going to fight in vegas, which is a really hard place to get a testosterone exemption, especially if you tested positive for juice, which tour has in the past, so he might not get a testosterone use exemption, which is fucking crazy because he's been fighting at this insane level for the last year. The bisping fight. Luke rockhold fight the last. Dan henderson fight me. It looks like a fucking demon. I mean The new veto on testosterone replacement looks like a fucking demon, but what is gonna happen to him if he asked to get off of it, the fight weinman.

Speaker 4:          02:48:39       See, here's the thing with testosterone and steroids is that, so say that guy abused it when he was young, which be to probably dig back in the day. I think for sure too long when you're young. Well guess what? You never came off. He never fucking did a right. Your balls turn off and they'll turn back on. So now he may be young but his balls don't work. So he now he needs this therapy for really, really does. So if you don't let them have it, you're hurting him. But at the same time other guys, maybe they just

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       do because they want to juice. So then they get a bullshit doctor to say, hey man, you're a fan. Give me, give me this prescription. You know, so it's a fucked up thing. I don't know like, but in the end of the day, like if a doctor prescribes it, dr has a lot, is supposed to have. The last rule was a doctor. So you know, doctors are, you know, they're supposed to be infallible and like honest and stuff and you know, we all know that no one is, but some guys need a man because some of the guys that they abuse steroids and are younger and now they have to have it. Yeah. But their argument is that those guys shouldn't be allowed to fight because in doing so, your natural hormone levels drop during training camp because you train hard and you breaking down your body. It's natural for your hormone levels to drop.

Speaker 3:          02:49:45       But these guys are, their hormone levels are not dropping because they're keeping them at a consistent level. If they have to take twice the amount of an unnatural testosterone in order to do that, they're still doing that. And so they have an unfair advantage and training camp by taking that. And I think that's a good argument man. It's a good argument. It's tough. But I think every sport juices period, a lot of them do every sport, you know, and not every guy there, he's probably every sport dude's juicing football, baseball. He give a shit what works exactly. And people are always going to try to find a way to juice and cheap. So you know what I mean? It's just a fascinating situation when you've got veto who's streaking, who's looked better than ever, but now he's going to have to fight weidman. He might not get a testosterone use exemption.

Speaker 3:          02:50:26       Kids real weird, right? Yeah. It's like a. I don't know. You can't say yes. The one that probably didn't know that next fight. That's why it's not fair either. Got to say. All right man, if you're on the sheet, you guys can't fight no more. Well, he's only been fighting in Brazil. That's the craziest way. It's been fighting in Brazil for the last. Like in Brazil, the. They'll let him fight on pcp. We will get a new pcp prescription for vito. Yeah. I don't know man. He's a. He's a fucking hero over there. But yeah, that's a. That's a tough subject then. It is a tough subject because I would like to see him at this level, the level that he fought. Dan henderson. I would like to see him fight weidman and it might very well be that the only way he could reach that level is on trt.

Speaker 3:          02:51:05       So I dunno. It's going to stop testing. Fuck it. But you take lexapro, take lexapro. And you'd take lexapro. Why you fighting all throughout your camp? Oh yeah. Well now if they said that there's an advantage that you don't get anxiety where everybody else is freaking out and they all get anxiety. Do you think, do you think there's anything to that? Um, I still get anxiety, but I mean everyone before the fights. Nervous. Right? Because you want control your nerves in some way. Yeah. Well here's the thing, I still get nervous, but before I was way more interesting, I should have been because I had, I had a, I have anxiety and panic attacks so it manages my nervousness to where I should be. I'm a normal nervous instead of a retarded nervous, you know what I mean by not back there like this. Like totally like, you know what I mean? It's still nervous like any other fight, but not like I was before my medication, you know, it doesn't make you tailspin. No. But in saying tHat most of fighting is mental, big part of it is mental. Isn't that an advantage to take something like that?

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       Uh, for, for example, if I said that they said I can't take it no more, it was thought it would fit with me because I've been, I've been relying on it, you know, I, I would not, not for fighting. I rely on it for life, you know what I mean? So it would fit me a lot for me, you know what I mean? But, uh, I don't, I'm not sure what it would do too. If you're a normal person and he took it. I'm not sure how it would, how it would affect you, you know, I don't know if it would help you nervous before the fight or not. I don't, I don't know how that would work. see, because it's an interesting argument because on one hand I want you to take it because I think that if it benefits you as a person and is a, is a drug that someone invented that has a positive effect on your life and it makes your life better, then of course you should be on it.

Speaker 3:          02:52:47       I mean That's a good thing. It's a good thing for some if something comes along and gives you less anxiety and you feel good and you're still living a healthy life, that's a good thing. That's a positive thing. But when it comes to performance, like there's certain things like I know the uh, you know, like adderall, like fighters aren't allowed to fight on adderall and some guys have prescriptions for adderall. Yeah. But adderall. Adderall is just speed. The speed. I mean look at the generic it was sold but, but for add guys, is there any benefit to it? Does it actually help them? And it helps you study. Add, say you add real bad and you just can't concentrate your spouse. You can't read the book. It will help you study, you know what I mean? But dudes, they're fucking have a prescription for adderall that aren't in school, are full of shit.

Speaker 3:          02:53:27       You know what I mean? I mean, it is not a real doctor will tell you. It is not a real fucking thing. It's speed, dude. It giving you energy and you don't have energy because of what happened. So like guys, I think that have adult prescriptions that did fight mma. It's because they do the train the train harder than you're fucking jacked up. Hitler invented or does not just affect to meth or to make their soldiers marched better and longer and unless food. So if You could be hopped up on that all day long and train, you know, it'd probably be good. You know, it's, it's, it's interesting man. I think that adderall is a weird one. I've never done it. But the people that do do it saY it's fucking awesome for a bunch of different shifts will snort it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean chicks, it's basically like, it's like, uh, you're too proud to do meth.

Speaker 3:          02:54:10       You know what I mean? Like that's drugs. My doctor gives me this. Oh yeah, the doctor told you snort it, motherfucker. Talk to snort it. You know what I mean? Exactly. Alright. War, machine, war machine. one 70 on twitter. Follow him. Go to his instagram as well. Not safe for work. Don't get kicked out of the cubicle. Is war machine will show his dick?
