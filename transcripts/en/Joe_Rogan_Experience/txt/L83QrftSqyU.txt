Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. That's the thing I was reading a lot of people, you know, that we're sort of deriding the idea that we're calling him crazy and they're saying, you know, basically when, uh, when, uh, a Muslim person blow kills a bunch of people, we start talking about uh, the calling them terrorists. When, uh, when, uh, you know, uh, a black dude kills a bunch of people, we start calling them thugs. But when a young white guy starts killing people, we call the mentally ill and somehow bats, there's some inherent hypocrisy. And then I kind of just think like, it's, I was thinking about this last night, there's, there's levels of human evil that are so intense that will we get, when we approached them, we just kind of like shut down. Like, you know, remember the matrix when they would do like the electronic pulse and all the machinery would just shut down.

Speaker 1:          00:44          It's like there are levels of human evil that we get to that are so intense that when we start approaching them, a thought just drops out and pee and it's all emotion that's left. And so you can look at somebody like that and say, you know, it's a hypocritical to call that guy mentally ill or you're fighting against a feminist cause by not recognizing the inherent misogyny and his attack. But really what's happening is something so much sadder and deeper than either of those things. It's just like we're living in this insane fucking world where human beings have some tick in this country more than another countries. No one can figure out why were they sometimes once in a while we'll go into a place and shoot a bunch of people and no one knows why it happens. And some people say it's because it's mental illness and some people say it's because of bad parenting.

Speaker 1:          01:29          And some people say it's because of gun control. And some people say it's because of, you know, violent video games and violent and MMA and movies and music and nobody fucking knows why it's really happening. And it's so terrifying that we just start slinging mud at one another. Trying to, trying to say, well it's this, it's that, and you're part of the problem by perpetuating this idea. And the reality is, is existence is terrifying and humans are fucking weird. And once in a while there's this evolutionary blip that somebody pops out of their mother with a, you know, sort of genetic code ready to murder people. And I don't think it's because of being spoiled and maybe it is, and I don't think it's because of, you know, chemical imbalances or maybe it is, it's just the reality is that's what's happening is jack the ripper exists in some 0.001% of human beings.

Speaker 1:          02:18          It's terrifying. I did the audio book and my book and I wrote an article, a chapter about Patrice, and I had to decide in their, do I do patrice has voice or do I just do a regular voice? So in the, so in when you buy the audio book of my book, you hear me, God damn good. And I was like, do I do that with all black people? Like when I, when will smith talks? Do I make him like I did it, I did it. It's done. Well, patrice is just so big with it. He's so is, uh, you know, his voice was so big and he was kind of almost have to do it because you heard, I was telling it on opiate anthony, but the whole thing was that I did a girl with cerebral palsy, didn't know she had cerebral palsy, so I was drinking so much and patrice thought that was fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          02:59          And he kept saying, you alcoholic, you can't even say if someone disabled disabled. That is the worst version. But it's like if we did do a Joey Diaz impression, you have to do it right. If you're going to say something that Joey said, you kind of have to say it again. Everybody does. Everybody does. If they say something as Joey, you don't just say like, if Ari has a joke, you know, like I might say it like as me, I might tell you all are, he's got this great new joke, you know, about blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Except if you're describing already mad, then you'll do the mumble. You can't do that. What was your will smith voice though? Um, same exactly voice. Hey, exactly. This is coby bryant voice. I wrote the n word in the book twice and I was as white people saying it.

Speaker 1:          03:48          I didn't realize it because I didn't fucking really pay much attention to the editing of it. I just wrote them and then if, if the publisher liked them, I was in and I was like, I read it and I was like, Oh shit, I've got to say the m word. It's thinking for history. I'll go down as saying the word and despite whether or not I've ever said it, no one's got me on record saying it. So I called my buddy Omar Dorsey, who's on a, he's on eastbound and down. I was like, Hey, can you come and read a passage of my book? And he's like, Oh, I'd be honored. Oh my God. So passage, what's the word? Oh, you did. Am I supposed to do this? Like a white person? I go pose how good that way he did it. He's like, you know, I love you. If I'm getting you out of this one own up to it. In the book itself, an audio book itself, you would say, well, there's a question, we'll word in this passage. So I brought in a good friend. I do. I'll do 16 hours to read my own audio book. I was like, oh my God, I cannot read out loud to save my life.

Speaker 2:          04:53          Yeah.
