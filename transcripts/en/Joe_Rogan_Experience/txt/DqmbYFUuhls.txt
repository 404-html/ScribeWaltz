Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Amy Young, Jimmy, fix this fucking mess we have here. Electronics fail folks. They just, they judge do sometimes they just go bad on you. They just feel, that's why people like mechanical shit, like cars with a collage, they fail to, they fail to. He did three boards, three boards. Young Jamie had a fire through a bunch of shit we have laying around. Luckily we almost have enough. If you're listening to this, you're like, this is in mono. It's not even in Stereo. Is it? Stairs like mine. Now I'm going to sound like shit. Well you're in like one ear only. What? I can only get us to one from what I own over here. How do you sound to the regular people? I'll fix it later. I think it should be just fine, but for right now I'm only going to be left here. Well, if anybody's listening to the youtube on headphones, that means you're probably at work and you fucking off.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       So that's what happens. He's definitely not working. Do you know how many people listen to podcasts while they're working and don't really work? Do you know how many people messaged me about how they're doing something pretty dangerous and they're sitting there like I'm doing fork lifts and moving shit around, but I'm laughing, listening. Really comforting man. But at least they're, well if you work at forklift you really need to listen to people. No, I guess not have those headsets on it and we'll have a good laugh. I think a lot of them say they have a policies where someone will tell them, hey one ear free, you know, so that you can hear someone screaming my legs under this thing right now. You know, that kind of shit. Isn't that the rule when you drive him? Like you're not allowed to have like full headsets on as supposed to yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       You can have one in I guess you can. You definitely, yeah. Legally drive. I don't know. Legally I'm guessing. What am I a lawyer? Yeah, it'd be a great lawyer. Thank you. That would, I would fucking argue to the end. I think if you became a lawyer and you were arguing all the time, you'd probably be a nightmare to be around. Cause you probably always trying to win. Oh for sure. Yeah. Yeah. That's what they do, right, is what they do. Find their way out of technicalities. You're a shrink too and you're, you know, every, every conversation you get in, are you psychoanalyzing everybody probably, right? Yes, for sure. That's got to wear out on you other people for Awhile. Like will you knock it the fuck off? Yeah. Well when I was in college that was the area. I'm never really applied myself at college at all.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       But the one thing that I was thinking of, like if I had a job, like what, what are things that I'm interested in? Psychology did come up because I'd read a lot of like self help books and psychology books while I was fighting to try to like manage my mind and anxiety and shit like that. But then I thought about it, I'd be like, you just be dealing with people with problems all the time and you don't, I don't necessarily want that. I don't, I don't think that's a good idea. Just make you dicks off. That's why. Yeah. Yeah. When someone tells you their problems. I always feel like if you tell me your problems, you're making my Dick's off problems make you dig stuff. I've never, well,

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       I always felt like that when I was dating. You know? It's like, oh, the girl, she starts telling you problems. You're like, man, you're making that ticks off. Right. Depends on what the problems are. The problems are they ex boyfriend? He just never wanted to eat my pussy. I don't know. That's a good problem. That's a problem. That makes it the car, Babe. We got solutions. We've got solutions for this problem. Problems, mathematics. I've never heard that before. Thank you. But now that's an original problems. Make my Dick Stop. You should make a song. I've written a few lyrics. I really have. What does it wrap or the way that I had it written out is that it's one of those songs that starts with banter between like the piano player and the guy on the mic and he's like, yeah, you know, hey joe, how'd it go last night?

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       He's like, ah, man. You know, she came over, but you know there's nothing I hate. Listen, I hate more than proud was right. Aww. Yeah man. Then you hear a little sprinkle of the piano, you'll problems make my dick so dick. So that can actually be a funny song. I think so. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. You seen the team up with somebody? Yeah. Well that's a sure sign that someone is not really into turning you on. Yes. They get together with you and then just start whining and complaining. Exactly. Get your freak on. Especially if it's early on and you're wondering, you're like, I don't know where we stand. And they start, if it's a girl is downloading the problems, she's not interested in that deck at all or she's just so into herself that you just got to get out of there anyway. Yeah. Time to bail. Yeah. Because when you tell someone about your problems, aren't you thinking while you're telling them like, I don't want to fucking burden this guy with my problems. Right? Yes. So when someone doesn't think like that, they're very self obsessed. That's just thinking about themselves. That's true. And I told her, I can fuck you. You fucking, he only my boss because you're

Speaker 3:          00:04:57       okay. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:04:59       yeah, yeah. Then you're like, look, I made a souffle. What's up are going to do, especially at work problems when people start talking about work bullshit, like you're not even there. You have it. That when you go on a, you know, double date, real life and then they start telling you about Sarah and accounting or something and your dude double dates can be fucking rude. All and especially the ones my wife wants to set setup.

Speaker 3:          00:05:23       Can I leave me leave to meet my husband?

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       They don't realize you're your conditioned pretty much fully to interesting people. Your, you know, your host a podcast. Do you have guests on? You have a lot of people. You're friends with Comedians, so you have funny, insightful people all the time. I can write here and then, and then you have a, you know, then you're in the fight world and you have, you know, people, things, people talking about things that interest you. Yes. And if you go on a double date with someone who doesn't check off any of those things, that can be real

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       fucking downer. Some people just don't know how to tell a fucking story either. Yeah. Oh my God. We went on this one double date and this dude started telling me this story about his son and his son's basketball game. And I swear to God there was fucking nothing. There was nothing there, you know, usually gets a few minutes and then the coach apparently wanted him to do dance, but he wanted to do that and trouble. There's not getting enough time on the court and it's droning on and on and on and on and on. And the guy's just like, no, no sense of someone listening. There's no sense. There's no interaction. It's just like he's decided that he has a story that he likes to tell and he's going to go on with this story and he's using his hands and he's bending his head forward. He's got all this crazy movement and there's nothing there.

Speaker 4:          00:06:51       Just like the cause. Probably cause that story works in his dad's circle, you know, with his other dad friends that are, that are dads on that team. And then, you know, they have kids on that team and he tells them, can you believe when the coach and the other dads are like, I'm, I, I saw the same thing. I mean he usually scores so he thinks he leaves that going. That's a good story. I think some people, Joe, that one, they don't care. They just wait for their time to talk. Some people they talk and then you talk and then they talk in the, and everyone they know is boring and they just can't wait to go to sleep. And that's their life. They fucking take sleeping pills. Do you know how many people I've run into that fucking takes sleeping pills every night? No.

Speaker 4:          00:07:32       Oh, a lot. Really. It's one of the things that I do. One of the things that I do, I ask what you know, I did this bit on Ari Shaffir show about a house fire or a fire in a hotel that I was in with Thompson girl. That's right, that's right. And a Joey Diaz remember that fight about it. They tell us not to take the elevator. We get stuck in the stay with a host point of the story is I was ready to fucking stampede these people cause they were slowly walking down the stairs and we got outside. We were looking for Joey, we were panicking. Joey comes outside and they'd go, where were you? He goes, I took the elevator like a doctor. He was smoking a joint outsider and he's smoking a joint. He's the greatest. But I realized while I was doing this that some of these people were literally waking up while they were walking.

Speaker 4:          00:08:19       And then I started thinking, how many of these fucks are on sleeping pills? Because I knew Kevin James, Kevin James would take sleeping pills and he would do shit. Like he made dinner once and he just didn't want to admit that he made dinner like you think. I think he went to the store and bought a Turkey or something crazy like that and cooked it and went, got up in the morning and didn't want to admit he did it. He was like, no, I didn't fucking do that because he didn't remember it. Didn't remember it at all cause it warped him that much. Remember Shit, they just do things that don't never taken one scary dude. They scare the shit out of me when I'm not tired. I stay awake. I'm crazy. That's crazy. How fucking crazy. Yeah. If I'm not tired I just get up and do shit.

Speaker 4:          00:08:58       I'm crazy. Now do you sleep well when you like a brick? You know what I do if I'm tired or if I want to get tired, I jerk off. Yeah. I go out like a baby almost instantly. Especially high. Oh, sometimes get paranoid though. Right in the middle of jerk. I don't know when is it going to hit. What if tonight's the night that I never wake up at those. So I started getting into pain, uh, sleeping pills like I started asking and people I work with, uh, at the UFC, fucking tons of them. Tons of them take sleeping pills every night. Tons of them. And I'm like, what the fuck man? Every night. Yeah, I can't sleep without him. Oh my God. But that's not good. You're not started. It seems like the key to that. Yes. You don't get good sleep on though. I don't think you get real sleep.

Speaker 4:          00:09:48       I heard a doctor talk about that one time, that you're not actually getting the benefit of real sleep on that yet. You're shutting something down, but you're not actually dipping into real rem sleep and, and, and getting all the benefits to your brain that you're almost like getting knocked out unconscious. Right. You're like, when you get fucked up like Michael Jackson. Yeah. I mean, he went as deep as you get. He was taking that fucking stuff that they used to put people under anesthesia. He's getting hit anesthetized. Yeah. He imagined that every night a doctor's administering that. Oh, through a mass. K Are we removing your gallbladder? No, I just want to take a nap. So just, I just like this thing. Oh, well he was probably so fucked up. You know, I saw Dick Gregory talking about him and it was really interesting because Dick Gregory was getting interviewed by this guy and I'm, the guy was talking to him about Michael Jackson and Dick Gregory just started going off and he, and he started screaming.

Speaker 4:          00:10:46       He never had a fucking child. Do you understand me? He never had a fucking childhood. He never bounced a ball and he's just started going off of it. Cause I guess he knew Michael Jackson and was just saying he missed that part of his childhood. Like the whole Neverland thing and hanging out with children. A big part of that was just that he never had a childhood. I think that makes sense. It does make sense. I don't know if he ever did anything to anybody. I don't know cause I wasn't there obviously. But I think a lot of the people that he's hanging around with, those little kids, their parents realize like this is a fucking golden ticket. Even if he never did anything, they realize like, this is a guy. My kids spend the night over this fucking crazy. Multi-Multi multimillionaire's house hoes up fucking backyard filled with amusement park rides, toys in his house, like monkeys and zebras and shit. Yes. If he's not a pedophile, you know, like there's something going on. Fucking let's sue this guy. Fuck it. Yeah. Who knows? Yeah. That he's a sad, it's a sad story when you think about, I mean

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       it's pretty well documented that that it wasn't very pleasant to be a Joe Jackson Kid. No, no. That had to be a fucking disaster. Yeah. Then that'd be a goddamn nightmare. Yeah. And then you sound like a crazy guy. That's how you get good. Having a dad make you do that dance one more time I guess. But it's pretty, is that the only way I wonder? I don't think so. Probably the only way to get that good. I do. I do think with, uh, with athletes, you know, I've read a lot of stories about how dads affect certain athletes, some of them, but, but there's the other side of it that some of them just have that focus and that desire themselves. And some of them say, the only way you get this good and it's in you, you gotta be the one that wakes up and goes on the run and trains and that's how you get it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       But there's the flip side of that is the dad, you know, the overbearing dad that I'm going to make you a champion or you have, a lot of times it was overbearing. Dad's kid winds up rebelling. Sure. They wind up just abandoning that dad and they never want to have anything to do with, I'm sure todd Marinovich and Mark Marinovich, you know that's that whole story. Yeah. Yeah. His Dad, Marvin Marinovich was this like legendary strength and conditioning coach. He's a guy I worked with Bj Penn when Bj Penn was in his prime and he just has these crazy really revolutionary ideas when it comes to strength and conditioning. And he had his son on this insane organic diet and I don't think he views even feeding them meat when he was young and it was at home. So it was a, this was 24 seven it was, you're going to, it's not like, here's a meal plan.

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       Hope you stick to it. I'm stretching him, feeding baby. So crazy. We're gone. US flexibility now. He did make todd pretty, pretty fucking insanely good. I mean, todd was a, was a hell of a quarterback. Oh yeah. But he also was freaking out and you know, went to drugs, I think as a release for how, how overbearing dad could be. Yeah. He blew a fuse. There's a really interesting documentary. I think it's one of those espn, it is 30 for 30 yeah. I watched it and I was like, wow. Yeah. What a, what a weird life. Having a dad. Like, then he became like a painter. He's like an artist now. Todd is now. That's interesting. He could have been, it's worldclass NFL quarterback. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But I think the only thing that really derailed that was probably the drugs, right? Probably. Yeah. Well also desire. Like he, I guess he just didn't want to do that. Yeah. That's that desire thing. Like you have to have it in you. Like they say that some people do have it in them and some people don't. And so when you look at someone that became successful, it's so hard to figure out, like what was it that drove that guy to be so obsessed that he had to be the best baseball player, the best basketball player? Like was it, was it his upbringing? Did he have, I mean, with everybody, there's a

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       different story. Some people, they had still had to prove something like maybe they were born, uh, you know, single mom didn't have a father always angry and they want to prove to the world. There's those guys a lot. There's a lot of proof to dads. You know, Jerry West, his story that he's the guy that's the logo of the NBA, you know, the outline of the player playing is Jerry West and he had a really abusive dad and he even said an interview. He didn't think he would be as driven as good in and be a great player if he hadn't had basically a shitty dad. Wow. Yeah. So there's, there is a lot of that or the Herschel Walker story. Did you see his, what was his story? His story was, it wasn't anything about that. His parents, he had a good relationship with his was getting bullied.

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       You know, he was teased and bullied. What the fuck could bully that guy? I guess eight, nine, 10 years old, you know, we're talking to that. Yes. But he was getting pushed around. He was Chubby and then it was Lord. It was that focus though of I'm not going to get pushed around anymore. I'm not, I'm not going to get bullied. They, he started running and doing those insane claims at least of pushups and sit ups and then he just, you know, also had genetics. He was freak fucking ass. He's still a freak. He is still a freak come back then. And the thing about Herschel Walker is he allegedly never lifted weights. Yeah, that was a big thing. Um, I don't know if that's true, man. I don't know if it's true either. Cause a lot of people said they saw, like I saw him lift weights like people, I was with him in the fucking weight room.

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       Like when you talk to a strength and conditioning coaches, they're like, there's muscles on that guy that you really don't develop unless you're picking up heavy shit. Sure. But I don't know if that's the truth. I don't push up. Claims are 5,000 a day for back then. So that's a little also, you know, I'm a big Herschel Fan, but that's a lot of fucking pushups. I can do that. I can do that shit that easy. He was, he, he's like, I was doing it between every commercial, you know, watching shows. I'll just hit the ground, bang out like 500 pushups. Like, come on man. I think there's a lot in a row. Uh, a lot of these maybe, you know, like the fake ones and kind of push up half ones yet. Well, he definitely did something right. Whatever he did. But he also says something that he said, some stuff that's not physically possible.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       Like he said, he only eats a salad in a bowl of soup a day. Well that's not enough calories to keep your body mass. That doesn't make your whole body. The only reason why your body is the size that it is as because you take in calories I enough to fuel all that muscle, right? If you don't take in enough calories to fuel all that muscle, your body starts eating that muscle. And that's a fact. That's just physiology. So did you wonder, by the way, I was listening to your uh, Lance Armstrong episode, how when he was talking about how writers are just not eat and you go like, how do you have any energy to ride? Yeah. We're not talking about a leisurely stroll down the beach. Yeah. You guys are training for Tour de France and starving

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       yourself. How, how do you have the probably amphetamines if not amphetamines, caffeine, some, some, whatever. Legal and it isn't there. Just all kinds of cramping going on. Your body's just, I would think freaking out. I would imagine me. Fuck man, I have no idea how he said that's a very common like bike cyclists that cyclers colors, right? No, it's cyclists. It's not cyclers. No fucking mad at Jesus Christ. He got mad at me, man. It was like, it's cyclists. Cyclists don't say cycling is so funny, but I guess it's like if someone said the ultimate fighting challenge. No, it's championship championship. You ultimate 40 challenge challenge, you know cyclist. Got It. Yeah. I don't know man. I think there's a lot of mental toughness involved in that sport for sure. I mean those fucking people are savages. They really are. And they really are. Yeah. Just to, I mean, how many days in a row do they do it? I think it's 21 something insane like that. 2125 something like that. Fuck man. A hundred miles a day and 2,500 miles total. What I know or have you heard about these super, the super, I don't know the right term. Mega Marathon. Yeah. The 50 mile ones and then they do them back to back. There's a few people that do them day after day after day as your body just sustained, keep going. In my neighborhood, she ran to a ultra marathons in a row, two days in a row, 100 miles one day, and then a hundred miles the next day.

Speaker 4:          00:19:30       That's a chicken. Hates her husband. Sure. You think fucking piece I shut. She's fueled by anger. You say my problems make your dicks off. I'm going to write this 200 fucking miles. Exactly. She comes home and their toenails fall off. Their toenails fall off when they do that. I saw a real sports about that and then a guy who's so didn't care about that just had them lasered off. Whoa. Because they kept falling off and he goes, I don't need them. So he just had them watch. What purpose do they serve? The guests. They protect the tips of your fingers. So that was going on on a man. It is a weird thing. When you look at fingernails, they are strange. They really are this weird, hard surface on the, like every other animal that has nails, their claws right there, the design to climb things or the design to kill. But we have these like weird tips for good for opening up on envelopes. Stickers. Yeah. That's where we have these scraping stickers off. Yeah. It's a weird feature of our bodies. It's weird how a person developed and not only that, like they just keep growing. So you're supposed to cut them. Like if you don't cut, you ever

Speaker 1:          00:20:47       seen that guy in India that grew his nails like the world's longest nails? Yeah, I've seen, I don't know if I've seen him. I've seen photos like that's so gross. I think he did it for more than 18 years or something like that. Just grew as nails and they'd grew so long that he couldn't use his hand. That's one of them there. They grow like that and what's facile? Two hands like that I'm on. So he has to wear like special shirts with no sleeves. That's ridiculous. Is I saw a dark guy. I saw a tlc show where it was um, I dunno. Weird. They have all these shows, weird people. And it was a lady who didn't cut her toenails and they, they grow and curl, you know, she can't wear regular shoes and I don't think she can work. I think that was the other thing.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       She's like, I can't go to work. I'm a fuck up. These nails. So stupid. I got priorities. Yeah. That lady was weird. She, she kept him straight. Oh, Jesus. No, thank you. Good Lord. That's like a bear. She looks like a bear. Well, how stranger people, I don't know. I'm sexy, but you have to take care of those nails like, oh, what's on the left? No lower left. Look at that. What are those? What are those? Oh God. Well that seems like we were looking at some other stuff. They're like, we're looking at hand nails and toenails there because there's the toenails and then nails coming down. It's coming down. Yeah. Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       Yeah, some disgusting about long nails. Yeah. Y Yeah. Even sometimes women will have the slightly longer pedicure. Why do you have long? Well, I don't even understand why. Yeah. Even slightly longer term growth trend. Get that shit. Even man, you hate for that. You have a half inch long on your toes like, Ooh, so gross. He fucking Weirdo. Why are you doing that? What are you using them for? It isn't that strange though because of a half inch on your fingers is totally acceptable and can even be sexy. Right? Like girls would like red nails. Sure. Kind of sexy, right? Why is that? I don't know the color. I just, because of the color, but well, how come the red toenails that are a little long, I'm not sexy maybe to somebody that it is. I'm saying I think it's fucking foul.

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       Somebody, I'm sure someone's going to be, I love those half luggage, toenails, Grossman who wants toenails that go over the edge and inch people do it purposely. So they have to be, have to be doing it. Now. Maybe it's one of those things like girls think guys like it, but only girls like it. Like really skinny girls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, like girls will see a girl that's like basically dying and he's like, oh, she's hot. Yeah. Look how skinny Shannon. She's. Yeah. Miss, how's that skinny? No, you don't. There's some people that really think that that looks good. They really do because of a fashion models,

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       you know? Um, I just don't, I don't understand that. Like, no guy likes that. I don't think so. He was something, it must be a few guys, but they're fucked up. Yeah. But normal guys want meat. Something to grab onto. Yeah. Yeah. It's normal. Like every guy I've ever asked, would you rather your girl be 15 pounds too heavy or 15 pounds to light? Everybody says too heavy. Everyone for sure to light is like, like you gotta be okay. Well yeah, of course you're, you're dying. Yeah. You're tired all the time. You face is all sucked in. Like you're making weight for a fight. He to the right to take the ass moving. Juggling jiggles are good. Yes. Bank. That's what I'm talking about. I'm saying. So tell me about throat zillow. So I started this podcast before we started. He started telling me to start.

Speaker 2:          00:24:37       I go, stop save it. I you asked me if I have on snapchat. Yes. And I said, no, I don't post on snapchat. And I said, well, I do have a snapchat account just to follow throat zillow. And you said WHO's that? And wait, here's the whole story. So my buddy josh potter is really, he's a great comic out of Buffalo. He turned me onto this. Um, so snapchat for people that don't know, you know, you post, you can post photos but also like videos 15, I think they're 15 seconds and they time out and then once they air they're gone. You know. So if you follow someone and they post all the time, you, you're seeing essentially a timeline of their day or week. So throw zillow came to prominence because she is a, uh, an escort in the Dallas area and she's hooked up with a number of high profile people who she doesn't call out, but one of them, um, Dallas Cowboy, offensive Lineman, Lael Collins hired her to blow him and eat his ass and she did it, but then he didn't pay her.

Speaker 2:          00:25:45       So she put him on blast, called them out, told media outlets and uh, then I got turned onto her, her snapchat because she'll also post sometimes little snaps of her blowing guys and eating their asses. And I'm also running out of gas. She does no, don't put that way. I don't think she wants that went up. Why? Because that doesn't actually post her face. Oh yeah. I don't know. I mean that actually her, I don't know if that's her. I've never actually seen her face. Um, but anyways, she, uh, she really has a gift. She's awesome. She goes, she had a monster energy Canada or mouth man. You should see her. What with with Dixon? Her mouth. It's a, she also goes by orally gifted. Um, two one four, which I think is the dallas, but yeah, there it is. Or the gifted underscore two and four. She, uh, it says I swallow everything. Lol. And what does that line and they know, oh, what does that alarm or something, I don't know. That might be the end of a guy's cock that she sucked off the old stick. Yeah. But she posts hilarious stuff, you know? Yeah. And she'll, she'll do things like, um, don't, nobody went to Dick suck right now. Somebody is going to get something to eat that and be like this.

Speaker 2:          00:27:11       She's like, I just feel like giving me head right and have it, nobody's hitting me up. I'm going to go get some gas. And then she'll get some gas orally gifted. Well, there was that other girl that got famous in the hip hop world. She called herself superhead. That's right. Yeah, I remember that. I know you're aware of, well this, yeah, she was a tomboy. She did a bunch of music videos too. She was in, she was a video vixen. Oh, and she was, yeah, she was blowing everyone left and right. I think she wrote a book about it. Yeah. But I might own actually own it. Well she's, she puts everybody on blast. Like Bobby Brown came over her house and fell asleep on her couch and she, she filmed it. That's fucked up though, right? I think. I think the fucked up thing like I, so I had throat Zyl on my podcasts.

Speaker 2:          00:28:00       I did. Yeah. Yeah. I messaged her and she called in, so she, she, she called into the show and that's hilarious. And she was really candid and really funny. And she basically said, you know, I provide this service, people pay and you know, I'd never would call you out there. That's part of the sort of unspoken deal. Right. But when this guy didn't pay up, it was fucked up. You know, we agreed to something and he goes, oh, I only have 100 bucks on me. Rude. Yeah. So she goes at that point, that's when I, you know, called him out. Yeah. Well he treated her like an idiot. Yeah, exactly. Which was the wrong thing to do. What a rude guy eat someone's ass. And then we actually, Josh and I had this car and I know you don't call a football, but maybe you'll be able to weigh in on this.

Speaker 2:          00:28:46       We, we started to discuss which position players have the worst assholes because if, uh, she ate a pretty big guys ass. I mean, how big is e six six, three 30. That's a big guy. It's a big guy. And she said it was a lot of work to get in there, you know. So she said, she said with skinny guys, she can, you know, put them in the, change my diaper, like pull their, pushing their legs up and get underneath there. But with these big guys, the big guys, they got to lay on their stomach. And then you got to kind of open their asshole out. Does she require that they go through some sort of a cleansing procedure? I asked. I'm glad you brought that up and she said that no one's ever not been ready for it. In other words, cleaned up, trimmed up everyone. Everyone's ready to go. No one's, no one has to be sent to, but well, she is known for her work. So

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       yeah, these guys fired their proper work environment. I think so. Yeah. You, you will. You wouldn't ask someone to do electrical work in the pouring rain. Exactly. That makes sense. A great analogy actually. Yes. So she's um, she says, you know, it's, it's one of her go to moves and gas. Yeah. I have a buddy of mine who hooked up with this girl. Yeah. And uh, they went back and forth online and then they got together and he said immediately before she even blew him, she went right to his ass and I went, what? And he goes, yeah. He goes, I just got off a plane.

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       Fucking disgusting. Travel as is bad. I'm like, why? He goes, I was so disgusted. I've never called her again. She went right to his ass. I'm like, who does that? A friend of mine said he also had an online hookup where the lady was, you know, pretty, you know, aggressive with how she was setting it up and he goes, come on over. And he said it was her first one. He goes, I wasn't prepared for that. I had never went to the, went to the like, you know, some ladies are bold. Yes. Yeah. That's a weird move though, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go straight to the butthole. Straight to the, what do you, what kind of message you're trying to send? It's trying to say like, this is going to go crazy. I'm going nuts. You're saying I'm freaky. Like if you were, if you were wondering, I am. That's what you're saying. As freaky as is possible. That's just, you bring a bunch of friends over to lick his ass too. That's yet whistle. And a bunch of girls start knocking on the door like PAC man knoweth all have fucking lobster bibs on. Yeah. That's pretty good. You're saying I'm advanced. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just does it, you're not married me.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       It's true. Maybe that's why. Maybe that's why she did it. Maybe she just doesn't want a commitment shaped the best way to keep a guy from wanting to marry you. It was just make them disgusted. Eat His asshole right away. Just really just tongue. Fuck it. You're not even like coaxing her into it or anything. She just leaves with that just pushed my friend said he just, uh, he thought she was going to blow him and she grabbed his dick, picked it up and then pushed his legs forward and he was like, what? She's just gobble, gobble, gobble, like a rottweiler drinking out of a toilet bowl. Some chicks are just cool man. Yeah man. She's the best. Well, I mean how many guys are told their friends that kind of a story and they're like, wow, that's awesome. Awesome. So what you guys doing next? So you found a good girl, Huh? Being the family this weekend, trying to get her pregnant, bro. Oh my God. Oh, you don't want to do that Wolf Wolf Wharf.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       [inaudible]. Yeah. That's a weird Dang shit comes out of there. Like why? Yeah. Hmm. Well why does it feel good though?

Speaker 1:          00:32:50       I know that's also part of the problem. Why doesn't your asshole feel like your fingernails? Well, hasn't it just like something that dead dull spot that just pumps out shit. Yeah. I remember doing that to someone in college. I only did it cause I saw it in a movie, you know? You know what I did? I got Hershey's Syrup and I thought it was like Kinky to do it. And then I realized as the Hershey Spirit Spirit, it just looks like she shit all over because it's just liquid chocolate. So I pulled my face up and I'm like, Oh man, it looks like she just shit in my mouth even though it didn't taste like it. Sure. Looked like it. Yeah. That's not a good look. No. Yeah. Look, yeah, it's like cherry sauce. Put Cherry sauce all over. Yeah. That's not good. I don't think she liked it either. No. Did she get weirded out by, you know, she just like, but you want to do right. Alrighty. Alright man. Did she say it felt good? Uh, I don't remember actually. I mean, I don't, I know, I didn't think she was like, hey, this sucks, but whatever. I don't remember

Speaker 4:          00:33:53       being, you know, big applause, break or anything. It's weird that some girls don't want to have nothing to do with taking the ass where other girls beg for it. Yeah. They love it. Put something in there.

Speaker 1:          00:34:03       All Right, God, Huh?

Speaker 4:          00:34:09       Yeah, but girls with toys, that's always weird. Hold on a second. And girls come back with like a giant black rubber Dick. Like, hey,

Speaker 1:          00:34:17       hey, hey, hey, hey. Now where's this going? That's for you, right? Or girl with a strap on. Ooh, I never had that.

Speaker 4:          00:34:29       No, not interested. Hmm. Yeah. If I want it done, I'd fuck dudes. Right. Or have dudes fuck me. Why? Why would I want a girl to pretend to be a dude? Unless you love it. Well, some people like really trainees, you know? Yeah. Insensitive. I was insensitive with that word. Yeah. You still say cabbies though. I don't have to take shabby call cabby point counterpoint. Well, he sounds cute to me. It does sound kind of, I don't know why it's bad. It's, it's, it's offensive. What do you think, I mean, is it pretty obvious that the attraction there for the people that are attracted to it is that it's looks like something and it's not, I mean, is that the appeal you think? Um, I think people that like transgender guys, I mean there's probably a whole fucking spectrum of different things that people like them, why they like it, right. But I think some of them, they like the idea of it being like naughty, like someone with like she's got tits and she's got a beautiful face and then you take her.

Speaker 1:          00:35:36       Right. Right. It's

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       just exciting that it's crazy. Not t what also could be that you had some weird experience during your formative period, like when you were young, like, like when you're developing, apparently they say, Chris Ryan has described this to me, um, that there's a state doctor, Chris Ryan who wrote that book sex at dawn. I do podcasts with them all the time. And he was talking about imprinting, like as you're young, like during your formative years, I think it's, I think he said between somewhere between like 11 and 13 are nine and 13 or something like that, that something can happen sexually. Like someone could do something to use. Actually, maybe a man can do something nice actually. And you might not even be gay, but you might get like sexually imprinted, you know, that like that somehow or another excites you and some sort of a weird way even reluctantly excites you.

Speaker 4:          00:36:29       Yeah. Even reluctantly. Well, for a lot of people there, they're afraid of the shame that comes with liking what you like. Sure. Like if you're a supposedly heterosexual man, but you're really into transgender women, there's, you know, you could run a risk of people finding out at work and, and thinking you're fucked up and um, or you know, labeling you so deviant and thinking like, what else is this fucker into? You know, it's weird. I know, I know. Almost weirder than being gay because if, I mean there's some people that don't like gay people. There's some people are afraid of it or there's a religious thing, you know? But I think that that's more accepted. Maybe even then wanting to date a transgender person. Oh, for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:37:18       I mean, even in today's world, the, I think a lot of people have come along way with, you know, at least somewhat accepting homosexuality. But when you get to transgender, that's a big leap for a lot of people.

Speaker 4:          00:37:33       Yeah, for sure. For sure. Right? I think, I think so. I don't know. Yeah. They start looking at like you like this is what your cards are. You got to fucking deal with it. You gotta take it. Yeah. And then some people like, but my, I got the wrong cards. [inaudible] I got out there. I feel like inside I got the wrong cards. Sure. Not only do I support that, I support people that feel like a dude, but want to be a girl. Like I was definitely born a guy. I'm a guy, but ah, I don't want to be a girl. Yeah. Fuck it. I want to get a sex change. Okay. I don't give a shit. Yeah, I'm gay. I don't care if you tattoo your face, go for it. I had never care

Speaker 2:          00:38:08       what turns somebody on, you know what I mean? Like I don't understand how it would bother you when when some people are afraid, you know you're seeing like the shame and people finding out. But it's amazing to me that it would bother somebody. What gets somebody else off? You know?

Speaker 4:          00:38:22       I think its Americans, Puritan culture where we're apparently when you compare us to the rest of the world, like as far as like what, what we like and do you know what we'll accept from society, from people were like one of the most

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       puritan cultures on the planet. So bizarre to think that that's our, our surroundings. Because you're, when you're in it, you don't even think about until you step out and you see how, you know other cultures are. Do you think we make the most porn if you like the yeah, I bet we make the most, I think without question we make the most without question. Without question. Yeah. Because industrywide I'm talking just as a business, there's, there's no other place that's creating the amount of content as the San Fernando Valley. It's gotta be, well, they're fucked now because they have to wear condoms. Stats. That's why there'll be a change, a shift, but for the last 30 years, it's gotta be California. It's like when they started shipping jobs overseas, that's what it is. God dammit fucking manufacturing jobs. The fuck the middleclass. It's harder than that to porn.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       Shipping all these hard Dick's to her place needs someone to put this somewhere. I put them wrapping them up with rubbers. That's the thing. The idea. That is a bummer, by the way, to me to watch that. I've seen that and like, I don't want to watch a guy wearing a rubber. No, it's, Oh, isn't that funny? Like why would you care? But there's something about like, they even try to trick you by having those like super transparent rubbers. Yes. But there's something about the glistening of the Dick just doesn't look realistic. You can't see the end like the rim that might've went down. You know, that's a fucking rubber robberies dicks off though. You know, it bums me out the most when a girl's blown a guy with a rubber on just stop. Stop Buddy. Just jerk off on the top of her head and that'd be better. I'll tell you don't even come near her face. Don't let her blow you the eye. I just don't like it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       I don't want to watch it. I don't want to see it. I've seen one of those blooper videos where they has the guy like, it's like a double team and one guy finishes on a girl's head, you know, on her hair and she goes, did you just come in my hair and the whole scene to stops and there's like a big fight. Everyone's screaming and yelling. Really? Yeah, it's, and he was like, I'm sorry. She got mad. Oh really mad. Really Mad. Yeah. Why don't you get mad at that? Because he went right into her hair and so she can't clean it. I don't know. I mean he's planning on going out like, I think she had an appointment afterwards. Yeah. Get their hair did and when they get their hair, did they like, they like to keep it that way for days. Do not fuck with the hair.

Speaker 1:          00:40:57       Yeah. Don't come in it for sure. Well, especially if there's like hairspray and then it becomes like stalagmites hangs down, gets caught up in the fucking webbing of the hair. No, no, wait. Oh Man. Not Bueno. Even slightly. No, no. It's the worst. But eyelashes are okay. Come on the eyelashes. Yeah. When they get it in the mug and then it's dripping off their eyelashes like Ooh, they have that look on their face and the flood or the IIF letter. The eyelashes kind of in some ways protect them from com. Like a good, that's why we have eyelashes. Didn't Dr. Ryan talk about that? A good thick shield like palm fronds? Yeah. Who Tags, you know, you know Joe, we've studied, um, for the last few hundred thousand years. Humans have eyelashes to protect them from facials. There's a weird thing, huh? Facials? Like what? Where'd that come from? Like why, why common someone's face?

Speaker 1:          00:41:54       Like what, like come it used to, it's kind of power. It's a power move, right? That I think it's a power move. What's a freak move to right? True girl sticks her tongue out. She goes, ah, how about the scoop and score? Isn't that crazy? That's disgusting. It's like, oh, there's little up here. And they take it down and then they pretend that it's the most delicious thing ever. That even on your watch and you're like, I don't know, it's been sitting on your face for a while. You didn't remember it was there. It's kind of cooled off and you're like, it's delicious. I like hot jar. It's like, you know, you never eat a pot pie when it's cold.

Speaker 1:          00:42:39       Well don't you think those, those save all the just videos trusting man. They see that's where a fellow draws the line. Like if you date a girl, she used to be a porn star. Well you know she just having sex. Who cares if it's on camera? But then if you watch a video of like five guys coming into a mug and she just chugs it as, so there's a lot of those out there. Jamie is going to throw up and they like drinking through a straw. So Gross, Mad Max Hardcore Guy. He opened up a woman's asshole. Well, the speculum, then he pissed inside of it and then attached to a straw to it and made her drink is pissed. That was opened up like a bowl.

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       What do you think his imprinting is from childhood? Whatever it is. Not Crazy. Not Good. Someone did bad things. I saw one of those, uh, was is a speculum, is that what it's called when they open you up and the girl's ass and then they put cereal and milk and somebody say to that of their fucking groceries shit too. That's when they need to stop. Like, I've had that. I've had this bit, uh, for a while. Then I just never figured out what to do with onstage. But the bit was like, why are they still making porn? Ou has jerked off to all the porn. Like, how could anybody who's, who's showing up at the video store on Monday morning going, Shit, new shit here. It wasn't new shit. Fucking constantly checking like no one has seen all of them. Like we've, there's enough, there's, you could jerk off once an hour, every hour for the rest of your life and you would never get through all the porn that's ever been made through 10 lifetimes. You could do that, but yet they're still making it. Sure. Like what is that? I Dunno. There's

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       just this insatiable appetite for it, I guess from enough people because it's not like music or comedy or something where people want new things because you like, well, maybe it is. Maybe that's it. I was going to say you like a particular artist might say, uh, you know Chris Rock. Like when's Chris rock or Tom Segura who's got a new netflix special that's available this Friday, this Friday. That's right. Shameless plug. Um, so like if you're a thompson guerra fan, like there's only one way to get it. You've got to wait for Tom Segura to put out a new CD or a new, a new, a Netflix special. But for a porn, I guess maybe that's what it is. I mean guys like jacking off to one girl. Right? So they're like, they become like a Kendra lust fan. Sure. You ever seen her? I that, that name sounds familiar.

Speaker 4:          00:45:20       So I'm sure I have all this good woman. She's all woman. All she's milfy too. She looks like she's like in her late thirties and it's ready to party. I'm talking about it has some experience but keeps taking takes care of herself. Sure, yeah. Yeah. So like if you're a fan of hers, there's only one way to get it. You got to watch her videos. You know what mean? There she goes, Pam. Oh yeah, no, she, that was sure somebody gets hurt. So like if you're a fan of any, you know, fill in the blank, Tara, Patrick, whatever. You got to wait for her, which she's retired. He had to wait for it. That's bomber. When girls are still hot and they retire, what are you doing? Well still jerking off over here. Yeah, you're not done. And I'm done. You know, it's like back or not. Yeah. It's like, uh, you know if Connor Mcgregor retires now like come on, come on. You got a few good years left in at least cause you make a few videos.

Speaker 4:          00:46:18       There's a thing about watching them, you know where guys get obsessed with like one girl and then they'll go to like the avn shows and then wait in line to get a picture signed and a, that's too far. Almost they're going to charge how far over truck I got a photo of a true and they're like, they're holding onto her and if the girls do escorting, yes. The other thing, some of those porn stars like you can actually fuck them. Yeah. I'm sure it's a pretty penny though, right? A couple of grand? Probably think so. Yeah. But is that awful? I mean, is that worse? Here's the question. Here's the big question. Is that worse? Easy over there. You're right. Getting sick. None of news. Um, is it worse to have sex with a guy who's paying you than it is to have sex with a guy on film?

Speaker 4:          00:47:04       Is there a line that's crossed that? Mm hmm. What do you mean by worse though? Well, I don't give a fuck either way, but for some people is the perception more so like is it worse to be a girl it was a porn star who also escorts or is it, is it, you know what's absolutely, I think the, it's between the two. I would do it off camera. So you're, it's not documented unless you, unless for some reason you want it to be documented, you know, if you're doing just your escorting, well it's just between you and whoever you do it with. So you don't have that social stigma of being known for doing that. Right. But, but for those girls, they don't care about that social stigma. I got you. I mean, that's their living. Sure. But is it worse? Is it worse to be an escort and a porn star or just a porn star?

Speaker 4:          00:47:59       Or is it a stupid question? Oh no, man. I mean, it might be a stupid question. I just feel like they're probably trying to get lucrative. That's exactly what it is. So just keep taking those escorts. Hires. That's exactly it is. Yeah. Well it's a good move for them for sure. Probably get, I bet some of them get paid. A lot of them I've had the rich dudes yeah. Which cause they look, um, and then if she was like, it's 10,000 and for the guy who was like, okay, yeah, then you, you're getting paid man. Yeah. Yeah. Well Red Ban had something and he put on twitter the other day about a girls that uh, take another vacation to go shopping and do by, you know, like, and like he knows it was a thinly veiled prostitution reference. Uh Huh. Cause that's what a lot of people do apparently.

Speaker 4:          00:48:47       Oh really? They go, I'm going shopping. Well there's so much money in Dubai. Yeah. So much money. Like, you can't even have your been, I've never been, I was there once for the UFC because a, there was a ufc in Abu Dhabi and we went to Dubai to do the Wayans, the Wayans and Dubai and then we drove to a Abu Dhabi from there. Like fucking when you drive you have to drive the fucking speed limit are, they will hit you with a missile, they'll shoot you in the face with a missile. Like it's so strict. They're like the drivers, like they will not violate the speed limit. Like if you violate the speed limit, if you do anything wrong, anything that can allow you to get locked up, who knows what the fuck's going to happen to the office. Literally, who knows what's going to happen.

Speaker 4:          00:49:29       Especially if you are in a position like a driver or a service person, like a waiter or waitress or a bartender or something that you cannot fuck around over there. Like it is not, America is, you're essentially dealing with kings. Like it's some kind of game of thrones type shit and a lot of ways. But, um, so we were there. And, uh, when you're in Dubai, every fucking car you see is, you know, hundred thousand dollars, $200,000. So it's all Mercedes and Ferrari's and Lamborghini's. It's like everywhere. I mean it's literally, it's like, like a joke. It was like a scene in a movie of extreme opulence, like over the top opulence. When you go, come on, it's not really like that, but it is really like that. Like everywhere you go, everyone's got a million dollar car and there's Bugatti va, Ron's, they've got like one point $5 million. It's insane. It's crazy. The amount of wealth. I remember that the, uh, Mike, one of my cousins

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       came to do English course here at USC and he has people from all different countries. And so the, the Abu Dhabi guys, uh, took the classes, the kids from the class, you know, we've taught kids, I'm saying 22 year old people, um, out on la. And they would just pull out stacks of money. And he was, he was like, where'd you get that? And he's like, oh, we just, the government gave us money because we're, we're educating ourselves and coming back so they'll pay for everything. And he said, you know, you could go, if you're a born there, you can go to the government and be like, I need money for this. And they would just give you that.

Speaker 4:          00:51:08       Yeah. And he was just, they were just spending on everyone's stacks of money. Well, you're not supposed to drink there either, but you can't drink in the bars. There's certain bars where they allow it because Americans western picture. But I got as a whole, like they don't want drinking. Hmm. It's very strange. And I had some friends when we were at the UFC, uh, I stayed in Abu Dhabi, but a bunch of the guys were bored and they were like, oh, we're going to go to Dubai and see what's up. They went to a bar and they said it was 90% prostitutes. It was all like eastern bloc prostitutes. Like you walked in, it was like a wolf den and just a bunch of wolves looking at fucking snack on you. [inaudible] like everywhere they went, like just, these girls just go there and they just wait for someone who's got a lot of money.

Speaker 4:          00:51:57       He goes, you'll, you'll, you'll come with me. Let's go. Yeah. And then they leave with a stack. Yeah. Fat Stacks. Yeah. Well, if you're a girl and you want to involve yourself, it's a prostitution. It's probably a good move. You go over there, just clean up for a month or a week, come back with half a year's worth of salary. So people aren't doing that though. Yeah. According to Red van allegedly. How's he so it on this? He knows things. He knows. He knows these people. He's aware. He knows that Hoe and mentality. He's around hose and definitely knows hos. Yeah, he knows him.

Speaker 4:          00:52:35       We always teased because you know, we started doing our podcast with him and he's our retarded stepchild. He has special knowledge. Yeah. He got, he knows things about certain things. It's just like he's got to figure out like he started doing his own podcast was guys only thing first. First episode just launched last week and I've been telling them to do that forever. I'm like, it'd be so good for you because you have this, you have this weird style, this weird way about you. I'm like, get into it. Yeah. You know, you'll find people that are wanting that wanting to see it, but right now they only see it if you're on someone else's show. Sure. You know, and like do your own show and it could be all your freakiness. Yeah. And then I think also when you do your own show too, you realize like how much is involved in like managing the sure. Like

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       making sure it steers in the right direction. Thinking about what the subject you're talking about. Is this entertaining is when do I pick this up? Do I, how do I ramp it up? How do I, how do I add some new stuff in there? And he has a lot of expense. I mean, you know, we actually, we love, right Ben. Uh, but he, he steered our ship for a while, you know, kind of help shape things. So I did a lot of people. Imagine if all the people that started podcasts with him could tolerate him and stay Ari Dunkin. Joey is grime callen Sam. Yeah. Sam Aaa. Yeah, it, Sam's still doing a show. I thought. I Dunno, but I didn't think he'd stopped. I don't, I haven't seen it or heard it. I Dunno. Well those guys definitely still do their, their punch drunk, their sports ones.

Speaker 2:          00:54:14       Yes. That's still a thing. He still does that. They do that on a another network. Right. What does that all things? Comedies. I don't know. All things. Comedy. That does sounds like in all things. Comedy show. Yeah. All things. Comedy is a lot of good shows on it, right? It does. Yeah, it does. I mean, that's magical and burr and then, I mean we're, we're part of that. Are you in your mom's house is, yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. I mean it's, you know, that being a part of all things, comedy is almost like being part of a collective support thing where everybody's still owns their own shows, but you just kind of have more power in numbers thing, you know? How does that work? Well, I mean I think the idea behind it was that if, if we are all together and we can approach people as here's what, what, doing business with all things comedy means, it means you're getting this bundle as opposed to just saying one thing.

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       You still get to be your own entity, but you're a part of something when you need to be. Right. And it helps for, it's, it's great for promotion to, you know, if, if, uh, like my special comes out, so I sent out a message to our group and then everybody who has a podcast, we'll get info about helping to plug my thing for each other. So that's cool. I mean, you're getting, if you get every show together, you're getting a few million downloads. Well we kind of all do that for each other we knew anyways. Yeah, absolutely. I'm always tweeting for friends and you'd do the same and we all do that for each other. We support each other. That's the best kind of network, right? That kind of net worth is totally organic. Yes. There's no financial gain in it at all. We all just kind of help each other.

Speaker 2:          00:55:47       Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I mean we, I mean, I know we've, as all things comedy, we've also worked with sponsors that, you know, the idea was that we're approaching you because we have this collective and they responded to it. So, okay. So like a, they handled the ads and they bring them to you. Is that how it works? Yeah, like so with like, you know, our bill approach, um, you know, whatever company and say we have 50 shows, here's our gross amount of downloads. If you sign up to do this set amount and then kind of divvied up amongst the people that can do it. So we've that a few times. That's

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       interesting. So is the amount of money that you get based on the amount of downloads that you have? Yes, exactly. Hmm. Who manages all that? It seems like it's, it's a, it's a lot of work, man. I mean, Mike is one of the guys over there. I think Flynn, and I'm trying to remember another name, but it's, it's a, it's a job that's a full time job. At a certain point in time though, is you're podcast becomes more and more successful. It seems like that would kind of get in the way. Well, it doesn't really, like I said, because those guys are so about Al and bill, Hey, we're not taking anything from you and do whatever you do, whatever you want. Right. That they're not, they're not saying if you do this, you can't do that there. It's almost like they're saying, do whatever you do and in addition you can do this with us.

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       You know? That's a perfect world though. It is a perfect world. Yeah. That's beautiful. Your podcasts is fucking blown up, man. It's amazing. It's been going well. Yeah, it's amazing. And you guys do live ones too. The live ones. I see. When you guys tweet about live once and the people go to them. It's a thing like there's a, there's a whole thing going on with the mommies. Yeah. People keep, people get excited and they go live podcasts or something fucking different man. It's fun man. We did a at the ice house in the, in the main room and it sold out like a couple of months ago because we've been, you know, when you're doing it again, I don't have, uh, we don't have it set up, but we need to do it. Let me gum. I want to be a gas. Do you want to be a guest on live?

Speaker 1:          00:57:45       Okay. All right. We're got to start doing live podcast. I've done a few other people's podcasts live, but it's really fun to do live. I did fit simmons the other day. We had a great time. He's doing it in the belly room. His 500th episode with his Buddy Mike. It was awesome. It's really fun. Yeah. We uh, we just did his show to Fitzsimmons. You find yourself like going for jokes, more like going, it changes. But here's the thing there. So geeked up for those laughs. Yes. So it's a, it becomes a really fun environment to do it. Then I watched another podcast live that's not mine and not yours and not fit semans into, oh my God, I wanted to run through a fucking wall. I was like this. Some podcasts are weird, man. It's, they find their own level, like water seeks its own level.

Speaker 1:          00:58:32       They find their own vibe and there's some podcasts where you, you go and you'll, there's fans of that podcast. You'd go and see it and you're like, this is not my fucking scene at all. They weren't swearing. They were doing it very much like a radio show. There's gotta be a bit, a little bit of that too, don't you think to probably stand up shows. Oh yeah. You Fuck, you don't end up walking into, but if you were to go to, oh, so and so's here tonight and it's sold out and you walk in, you're like, what the fuck is this? Oh yeah, yeah. Well that's just the way of the world, right? That's how it is with music, with everything. Movies. I mean, I, I've you seen pitch perfect. That's the singing one. Exactly. No, you haven't. No, no. But fucking millions of chicks have as a blanket pitch. They fucking love it. They get crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       It's not bad. It's not bad. It's not them. It's the, what's the like what they like, there's a lot of shit I like the people don't like, yeah. Somebody told me one time and it was about, you know, a movie come out. It's one of those, uh, comedy comes out and you go, well, this looks like fucking shit. Right? And there's billboards and there's always a few famous people in it. And you got, and I was hating on how shitty it looked. Terrible. And he goes, well, you know, this wasn't made for you. And I go, yeah, no, I know. He goes, no, no. But like there's a, there's a lot of people that love this. Oh yeah, this just isn't for, you know, it's not made for you. And I started to think of entertainment differently from the moment that was said to me that I see things now, trailers, posters, commercials for something. And I go, oh, but this has made for a different audience. You know, there's things that are made for me where I respond to and I go, oh, I fucking can't. Well, that's for me. That's why it's so important to do what you like on stage. Oh, stand up wise. If you start trying to make it for somebody. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:00:26       Those guys are, they're fucked. Those guys who create those squeaky clean acts, but they're not squeaky clean. Those are tortured people of course, because they're literally making art that's not for them. Right. But you're, you, you're, you and you can't be, you like the audience won't accept it. She kept talking about roofing chicks and sticking around and when they're asleep. Yeah. I watched, uh, speaking to bill cosby, I watched his lawyer, uh, debate some commentator or some television pundit or whatever you would call them hosts. And, uh, she was explaining, you know, what, that, how ridiculous these allegations are and how Mr Cosby, you know, didn't do any of these things and that all these women, like their stories, some of them are just, they were like, he grabbed them by the wrist hard. Like some of them aren't even sexual allegations and she's like effectively sort of muddying the water and that he is a very rich, wealthy man.

Speaker 4:          01:01:26       And then that has to be taken into consideration that these people are doing this for attention. And I was like, wow, this is, it's fascinating to watch the spin, the dance, you know? And the guy was saying, well, there's 50 people though. Right? And she was like, well, out of those 50, a lot of them are not even sexual allegations and not even sexual assault allegations, which I didn't know, you know, only 23 or six 37. Yeah, I don't, uh, I don't know if he did or not, but I haven't heard of another person ever that's had 50 people claimed that he raped them by giving them drugs. I know it's the, it's the, I think the sad part is the people who really want to defend the, like the conspiracy theories on it. Oh yeah. He was, you know, he was about to buy NBC. I don't know if you know that he was making a move to by NBC and they don't want a black man in power like that. It's so ridiculous. Yeah. Oh, they

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       don't. Okay. Nobody wants to take down cosby. Nobody's agenda. Was that why they would have taken down Oprah first? For sure. Man. It's so silly. It's worth more than anyone ever. It's so silly. She's the most successful entertainer ever. And she doesn't even have a talent. Not a singer, not dancer. It's not great actress. What? What'd she do? She doesn't tell jokes. What she does. She talks to people giving away cars, will get up in the morning and look at the sun and think, eh. It's like, yeah. Okay. Well she has like positive messages. Super Positive. She is really good for menopausal women. Like they really relate to her. Oh, a strange way. Yeah. So, you know, we're vibe down, but I get why people do have their, why they want to defend them. I understand the, the motivation and the, and, and feeling like, oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       The adoration for him and wanting to defend. I totally get why they do it. And the reality is we don't know. Yeah, that's true. Really don't know. But I mean, the idea that you could never find 50 liars, of course you could. Of course you could. But it's, you know, I think the, the, the argument that I find the most sort of ignorant and uninformed is the one where people go, why did they wait that long? Well, you know, if you, if you talk to any sex crimes unit, uh, officer detective, any psychologist about victims of sexual assault, it's not unusual for it to go and report it or for it to go a long time without someone wanting to talk about it. It's completely within the spectrum of normal responses to something like that. So when people are like, well, you know what happened 25 years ago?

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       Yeah, it's normal. It's normal for someone not to bring it up completely normal. Well, there's a lot of shame involved. Of course. Some women, they would rather just forget about it then report it. Yeah. They would rather just pretend it never happened. Then go through all the public shaming and then you're dealing with an insanely rich, insanely powerful man who was loved by so many. And then if there was no previous allegations, who the fuck is going to believe you? Yeah. Like to a woman in 1996 let's say back when he was, you know, not doing the show anymore, but he's in his heyday. Right. It's loved by everybody and he's drugging checks and I'm like, she's probably like to, how does this, this can't be. Yeah, I'll just fuck it. I'll just eat it. I'll just deal with it. Is deal with it. But then they, it fucks with them, I'm sure for a long time.

Speaker 1:          01:04:40       Oh, for sure. Yeah. Could you imagine? Well, that was the weirdest thing is that some of them claimed they were, that he was like in a mentorship role with them. I got help you with your career. I'll do this and have a coffee. That was his moves is power move. Yeah. That's sounds to me more. Is there more? You want more good. What is this? Butter coffee. And that's a caveman coffee with a little grass fed butter and some mct oil. It's good for the soul. That's lovely. Just feel right. Lovely. I felt good. So, um, you're a trump supporter, right? Big Time Man. Southern

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       California chapter head. These Bernie Sanders people been fucking tweet, not me. There's so mad because I said that Bernie Sanders supported, uh, 90% taxing of the rich apparently is not exactly true. Uh, this is what assault course, correct it for the Bernie Sanders people cause they get upset. What he did say was they're talking about marginal tax rate, which that means if you make over a certain amount, how much should you tax? And we're gonna cap that are now, he was saying that for a marginal tax rate, uh, would you, is 90% too high? He said No. And that's for extremely wealthy people. So like say if you make, let's say if you make 10 million bucks a year, everything over 10 million bucks, they would tax at 90% and I'm just coming up with a number for 10 but the, the regular, and he thinks it's not too much to tax 90% over amount.

Speaker 4:          01:06:12       But the problem with this kind of thinking is, well people say, Ooh, it's going to help other people. It's going to be a good for other people. Not necessarily. The problem with that kind of thinking is that money goes to the government and the government is a bunch of fucking monkeys. Yeah. That's the reality. It's not, it's not like an insanely ethical, really educated, super smart, really disciplined, conservative, fiscally conservative person who's gonna take care of this money and allocated correctly. No, you're going to give it to the government and you get to create bigger government and got to create bureaucracy, red tape, more people, more bullshit, more jobs that are bullshit jobs. It's not necessarily going to help people. And then he, he, I think Bernie Sanders says a lot of good shit. Like people that think that I'm a, I'm Bernie Sanders Hater. He says a lot of good shit.

Speaker 4:          01:07:01       I like what he says about marijuana, but he says some fucking silly shit too. Here's one of the things that he said that drove me crazy. You don't necessarily need a choice of 23 underarm spray deodorants or 18 different pairs of sneakers when children are hungry in this country. Those two things are totally unrelated. What's his, that's totally unrelated. Like what if you wanted to open up a fucking deodorant company, you shouldn't be able to open up a deodorant company because children are starving, so you should work to to feed children what's instead of renting in which he said that though. I mean we was just talking about the economy. It's just talking about the world and the idea of a choking on choice. You know, if too much, too many toys that we have too many choices that we divert our, but here's the thing, when you think about these choices, you're talking about these choices that are created by whatever percentage, whatever number of 300 million people, that has nothing to do with whether or not poor people get fed.

Speaker 4:          01:08:05       It just doesn't. Right. And the what in taking money away from wealthy people, it doesn't have anything to do with whether or not poor people get fed. I think that one of the things that he said that I agree with wholeheartedly is they need to stop people, these corporations from hiding their money overseas where they don't have to pay taxes on it. Yeah, a hundred percent hundred percent I think that's fucking criminal. If you want all the benefits of living in America, you want all the benefits that are provided to you by this free country, but you want to store your money overseas, fuck you, and you don't want to pay taxes on that. Fuck you. But maybe there's some compromise where that tax rate does get adjusted for that a little bit so that they have the incentive. Right. Cause the right cat over here. Yeah. Because right now the reason they're saying well I'm going to keep it over there cause I'm saving so much fucking money but they make so much money.

Speaker 4:          01:08:58       Yeah, I agree. I'm just saying those are greedy Kershaw for sure they are. Because you're talking about people that are making insane amounts of money that are doing that. People that are barely bought theirs. So I think in that sense, yeah they, that's, I'm a hundred percent with him on that and corporate tax shelters, there's a lot of like really sneaky shit where you find out companies made billions of dollars and they paid almost nothing in taxes cause it's shelters. Shame. I'm 100% with him on that. I think he's got a lot of really good points. He's got a really, I mean he's 100% down with pot. I appreciate that. His position on cannabis is, it's totally on unnecessary and criminal to have it illegal. I believe 100% on that and I also support them 100% on the idea of a living wage. Like if somebody works 40 hours a week, they should be able to feed themselves and have a roof over their head.

Speaker 4:          01:09:43       Yeah, I'm 100% down with that. I think a minimum wage for a kid who's in high school or something like that, it's still lives their parents. That's one thing and I think there are entry level jobs like that where someone should make whatever it is, but it should be enough where you could live. You know if you are, if you're a person who's 18 years or older and you're working at a job and you are spending eight hours of every 24 hours a day working for someone, you should make a living. You should be able to feed yourself without worry. Clothe yourself. I'm not talking about opulence, I'm not talking about wealth driving a Mercedes, but you should definitely be able to take care of yourself should. I think the problem with that when people cause a lot, I think a lot of people would agree with that is it's always, well how are we going to, who's going to pay for that?

Speaker 4:          01:10:26       In other words, the idea is right and then you go, where? Where will the money come from to support making that a reality? Well, I think the money's got to come. I mean, it's gotta be profitable business, right? Right. So if you've got a profitable business, how much of the profit goes to the employees and how much of the profit goes to the owner of the business? Sure. Like say if you have a diamond business, right, and you're selling diamonds and your employees are making $5 an hour, that's kind, Kinda fucked up. You know, like you're making millions and you're paying your employee $5 an hour. What is it, seven now, what's the minimum? I have no idea. See, and that's obviously an extreme example, but in that extreme example, yeah, man, you need to pay more money to people who work for you. If someone do, if they didn't work for you, your job wouldn't work.

Speaker 4:          01:11:12       Like you need someone say if you run a car manufacturing business, right? Yeah. If you don't have employees that put together those cars, you literally don't have cars so you don't have anything to sell. So you need to pay those fucking people because they are the reason why your car's getting made. And if they do a good job, they should be paid. Well, I totally agree with you. I mean, nothing is, it's, it's horrible when somebody applies themselves to a job and can't sustain the minimum. Yeah. Like having a place to live, paying for food. It's terrible. It's terrible. I totally agree. I, I, the only thing that I'm not smart enough to definitely figure out is, well, what is that number? And then, uh, you know, do you then dictate to different places of business? It's got to be this number or it's gotta be this percentage, at least, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:11:58       How do you, how do you make it a reality? I don't know, man. I do know that like Obamacare, according to everyone that I know that runs a business is a fucking disaster, really can. It's costing people way more money and costing businesses way more money. I've yet to hear anybody make a convincing argument why, why it works. But on the other hand, I'm a fan of the idea of socialized medicine. Sure. I think that medicine should be just like the police and the fire department. I think you should they the hoop that people who do it should be paid really well. They should have an incentive to want those jobs and the people should be able to get the services for free. I really think that, I mean I think, I don't, I'm not, I'm not opposed to private doctors. Yeah. Like if, if you're a, say, if you're a bad ass fucking knee surgeon, you work on the NBA and you work on all these different people and you're just the best of what you do, you should totally be able to work privately.

Speaker 4:          01:12:53       But the government could easily allocate enough money to provide public health care. It's just if it's been done in other countries, the fact that it can't be done here. [inaudible] it's been, they do at other places. They don't do it well. It's sucks in England. It fucking sucks. Does it really? Everybody I talked to you that lives over there and tell you it's a year. If you hurt yourself, you get surgery. You know, cause people always cite Canada too. And I'm sure, yeah, Canada is a joke too. Well I know that, I know a couple of Canadian people that when shit got serious, you know, and they needed to see a cardiovascular surgeon and they talk about that weight. They were like, fuck it, let's fly over to the Mayo Clinic. And exactly. You know, and then you shut off the money though. Yeah. Then you have to come to America and you have to pay for a hotel and airfare and who knows if you have that money. Yeah, I think, I think there's gotta be some sort of a comfortable middle ground, but it's got to be, well it's sort of like public school, you know, like you can get educated in this country if you don't have enough money. Right. But is it a good education? No, a lot of parts is a lot of parts. Not a lot of parts of California and Southern California, Los Angeles, one of the richest fucking cities and all of the United States and the schools are dog shit. Dog Shit

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       terribly. Shouldn't be an excuse for that. No, but you know also you're dealing with crime. Yeah. You're dealing with extreme levels of poverty. Engineering that and trying to fix that is not an easy task. But I just don't think you do that by limiting the amount of underarm sprays or toothpastes are fucking the flavors of ice cream or whatever the fuck you want to. I don't see the, it doesn't make sense. No, I just don't know. I don't know if he's been a businessman ever. You know, I think, I don't think so. That's what I like about trump. I don't like a lot of things about trump. I don't like how he talks about Mexicans. That shit drives me crazy. I don't like, I mean the idea of people sneaking over here over the border like, dude, how do you not have compassion? And these fucking people are born a third world country that's attached to America.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       You know? He knows what he's saying, what he's doing that he's fucking around. Well, I think he's playing to what he knows. We'll get people go, you're goddamn right. You know that place. Yeah. He knows that. That's that saying those controversial things that are going to get in the paper. Also going to get people going. Well, at least someone saying, you know, I think he knows that. I don't think it's an accident. Yeah. I think you probably write in a lot of ways, but I think he gets a big response from that and then he feeds off that response. Loves it. But he's a successful businessman. You know what's something, someone told me though? It's really kind of fucked up. If he took that money that his father gave him, his father gave him 2 million bucks to start his business. If he took that money and put it in a mutual account, uh, it would be worth way more than he currently is worth that.

Speaker 2:          01:15:45       I do not believe I would really check your friend pretty fucking hard. I was up. I a friend, like someone told me on the hill, if he makes that money in a fund, that would have been probably around 35 years ago, $2 million. His net worth conservatively is around four and a half billion. I mean, do you really think that, uh, a mutual fund would have? Well, let's, let's look at it. Jamie. Why don't you a google that if Donald Trump took the money that his father gave him and invested it and blank, there's whatever it is. Yeah. I mean, whatever that, um, whatever that equation is. Let's see. If he would have bought apple stock, let me know. Yeah, it would have been crazy. I don't think it'd be four and a half. What about Google? Oh, Shit. Oh Shit. That was some big money. I thought that, oh shit, but you know it's funny is that he goes, I'm worth 10 billion and Forbes did this breakdown of all his assets, and they go, no, you're not.

Speaker 2:          01:16:46       He goes, yeah, I am. And I get that. That's kind of how he argues things is go, yeah, I am though. You know, he doesn't have the substance right facts behind it. He just says, yeah, and they go, why are you saying that? He goes, because it sounds better. It sounds better to be worth 10 than four and a half. Did He admit that? He said that? He said it's because it sounds better, and they said too. In other words, if he were to make him worth 10 he would have to, he was, he'd be inflating the value of a lot of his holdings. In other words, it's like saying, well, I have this house and it's worth $65 million but nobody wants to buy it. They're like, well, no, houses in that neighborhood sell for that. They sell for 3 million and he goes, not mine, my 65.

Speaker 2:          01:17:30       And that's how he determines that he's worth 10. I'm going to start doing that. That's great. Just tell people no, you're wrong. Yeah. But I don't think he can hang at all with the elite politicians when it comes to substance and knowing actual policy, knowing details. That's a good point. But here's the question. Is anybody who's running for president and elite politician? Well, I mean you'd have to say that Hillary's at least way more savvy and knows a lot more about how, uh, certainly you know how the world works. International Affairs. I mean she was secretary of state. She knows the ins and outs of a lot of what you would assume. She knows that, but wouldn't she know not to use a private email account while she's secretary of state? It's crazy. She go to jail for that. It's insane. That's something that if somebody wanted to push, that's a crime.

Speaker 2:          01:18:25       I don't, you're not allowed to do this. Still don't understand why even though it's still discuss how you kind of get away with that. Cause it just feels like I don't get it. But I mean she's certainly more savvy politician. I think that trump, I don't know what his savvy though. Well cause he's saying shit that's led him to a 39% lead over any other candidate in the Republican Party. Remember when Ben Carson? Yeah. It was like on the the cost line. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he was ahead of them at one point in time. It, he was, yeah, that all dry it up. Yeah. I don't know man. I think people are really into the idea of the fantasy of a trump, you know? But I still think if you get to a debate, it's not that he wouldn't win. Maybe he'd win, but it would be based on, well, you know, you're a fucking loser.

Speaker 2:          01:19:09       Like it's like that guy, he says shit like that. But it, it's weird. No one ever does that. But it seems to work. It's that. Yeah. And then I, then I guess you could argue, see he is savvy. Yeah. But I mean, you know, I guess he's not savvy in the traditional sense. I don't think he knows the INS and outs of the way a lot of things work. I think his whole thing is, look, I'm super successful and I'll get it done. Yeah. But the wildlife, lot of the ways that things work or kind of bullshit, you know, crony politics and influenced by gigantic corporations, he doesn't have that same sort of influence cause he's independently wealthy. Right. There's a lot of weirdness to that. There is like special interest groups don't really have the same sort of pull on him that they have on other people know they can't own them. They would never let him say the shit that he's saying no. And lots of put a wall between us and Mexico and call it the trump wall. I just, his fucking name, here's what doesn't use me anytime. If so, if, if, if this is

Speaker 1:          01:20:07       CNN and [inaudible] your host of CNN show and I'm somebody saying like, well, you know, trump is a, he's completely unqualified in this claim. He made his idiotic. He then tweets saw Tom Segura on CNN. Guys always been a fucking loser for whoever, whoever says anything bad. He'll be like, yeah, saw his show last week, not one laugh, exclamation point. Like shit like that. He does that for everyone. That's what Ronda Rousey, when Rhonda got knocked out, he did. He said, I'm glad she lost. She was, she's not a good person. Whoa. And you know why I did that? Because she uh, he had claimed that she was a trump supporter and then she said, no, I support Bernie Sanders. And he was like, Oh really? Oh yeah. So when she lost it was like before that he was saying that she was interested a supporter. He was like all for it.

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       Yeah. Rhonda Rousey supports me and she was like, the fuck I do. And he's like, she's not a good person. Glad you go off. I'll lose her. Pretty interesting way of just a loser, the loser, a loser, but always been a loser. Bunch of losers. Remember when she was, he was going back and forth and look at that. Glad to see that Ronda Rousey lost her championship fight last night was soundly beaten dash. Not a nice person. The fuck are you talking about? Well, what about you? You're way more of a dick. She's at least not a nice person to sell massive amounts of fucking paper view sales. Yeah. And, and you know, be the protagonist. He tweets about everybody. Uh, the, if they write an article in the Washington Post, the Washington Post, which has been on the decline for years, had an article written by this loser.

Speaker 1:          01:21:55       He writes. I know. It's pretty funny. It's sad. Sad. Not a nice person. Yeah, you're fired. Like that's his whole thing. You know, I was a, they gave me an offer to, to be on that show. I was going to do it. I was thinking about, really talked to him, the family, like you guys want to live in New York for a few months, but um, you know, they fire you in the beginning. They do all that. You're fired stuff in the beginning. Oh really? So you don't have a chance to go faulk you. Oh really? Yeah, like before, before anyone knows anybody's fired, he fires everybody. Tom, you're fired. And then you get up and leave. Jamie, you're fired and you get up and walk away. Joe, you're fired. You get up and walk away and then they do the show. Okay. Yeah. So you don't, you don't get a chance to say, let me tell you what I think about you and your fucking plastic hair. You cunt. You fucking sloppy dummy. Who got lucky. That was probably done once and he was like, that's not going to happen again. Well probably right. I think he probably planned for in advance. He's probably pretty good chess player. Yeah. Yeah. I got to look like I'm always the king. But they canceled that show after we talk shit about Mexicans. Yeah. And macy's and

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       did their partnership. They had a whole line of, you know, trump ties and shirts, trump ties. And they were like, we're done. We're done with you. And then Miss Universe threatened to, or NBC threatened to not air his thing, posted the contract and he was like, I'll steal your balls off. You know, NBC had a contract with him to Air Miss Universe. He, he doesn't Miss Universe. It's his, well he sold it, but he owned, he owned Miss Universe and maybe Miss America to be on those various pageants. Yeah. It's just to be around checks. He like, he literally thought those to be around that shit. For sure. For sure. That's a good move on his part. It's a gangster move. I'm a billionaire. I bought a pageant. Hmm. Then he just, I like the Czech Republic this year. Yeah. What is this?

Speaker 1:          01:23:53       I find it kind of like some more information about what he inherited. Okay. Uh, he was also, when his father died in 1974, him and his siblings took over a $200 million real estate business, which he may have gotten around $40 million of the bottom of this says if he invested that and since 1974 and the s and p 500, he could be worth around 3 billion today. Okay. So it kind of makes sense. Right. But that's also 40 million, not to just the one or whatever he was given. And what does it say? So it was current claim network of 8.7 billion would equate to around 120 million in 1974 which is right in the middle estimates of what he inherited. So that means if he invested that, that doesn't make any sense. That's confused. It says the s and P is up 74 or 74 fold since 1974 I see you didn't do anything and just left it there. It'd be about 120 million. But if he did other chances and other got good business, things went well for him. It could be worth up to three. Okay, so what they're saying is here, here's a clear example, says if he had invested the 40 million in an s and p 500 index fund, he'd be worth about 3 billion today, which is in line with the third party estimates of 3 billion and 4 billion, which is his net worth. So they estimate between three and 4 billion. Yeah. Yeah. Which is probably right. Still baller.

Speaker 4:          01:25:14       Well are still baller, doesn't have to listen. You can do whatever he wants. How fucking good. I liked it. He's making a mockery of the whole thing. I like a lot of things about him. I in apparently Jeff Ross who, uh, did the trump rose says he's a good guy. So you talked to him. He's a good guy. Like he knows what he's doing. You know a lot of this like fucking fanfare and this craziness and all this shit that he's doing. He's mocking this stupid fucking system. He's a smart guy. He knows what he's doing. I mean, look, he's talked shit about Mexicans and he's still the fucking front runner in a giant way. He's like, well, someone's raping someone's birding and we're going to let a bunch of rapists and murderers over there. I'm sure you said Pete, everyone over there is a rapist and rent.

Speaker 4:          01:25:55       Well, someone's raping. Yeah. Who's doing all the, but he's just like, he says crazy shit like that and like hits it flies in the face of, look what happened to that poor fuck the Mormon. What the fuck's his name? Uh, that ran for president last time. I know you're the fuck's his name. Romney. That poor fuck. All he said was, we don't have to pay attention to the 47% that aren't going to vote for us. Yeah. The the lower 47% that make little money, they're not going to vote for us in the first place, so let's not pay attention. Then that tanked his business. That tanked. It tanked it. They're like, it's over. It's over, bitch. I know it's over. How about Howard Dean? All we did was cheer and that was it. That was it. You fragile bitch. You can't even cheer. You can't cheer. He can't scream and trump can say mexicans are rapists and everybody's like, Ooh, El Chapo wants to Muslims at the border. Yeah, we should stop letting him in so crazy. Like this is a country founded by letting people in. Did you? Only way this country got filled is letting people in, not old people. These people are running. They're leaving their country because radical Muslim terrorists if taken over it. Yeah. What was that? His new ad. The first ad came out. This, what is it?

Speaker 4:          01:27:10       What is it? His first ad. Oh my God, you're kidding. But this was the beginning of Craig it

Speaker 5:          01:27:18       and I approve this message. The politicians can pretend it's something else, but Donald Trump calls it radical Islamic terrorism. That's why he's calling for a temporary shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until we can figure out what's going on, you'll quickly cut the head off my sis and take their oil and he'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for it.

Speaker 4:          01:27:48       Wow. Okay. Okay. He got flack for that shot of the people running. That's not where they were from there. That was a shot of Morocco. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty fun. It's not America. It's not running across about, he'll so just get me some brown people running. Any Brown people running in black and white footage. We'll take it. Yeah. Yeah. He's entertaining. I will give him that as a show. This is a fun show to watch. It's the best show ever. I hope him and Hillary debate. I hope he gets to debate on the long side cause I think he'll crush her. Do you think your husband will be back in the White House getting blow jobs like he was? Oh yeah. He's going to throw some grenades. Oh, sure. He doesn't give a fuck detonate some. Yeah, it will be awesome. It will be anything. Ben Carson should be involved too, just to tell us that the earth is 10,000 years old and Jesus wrote a Unicorn. Yeah. Through the fucking, that garden of Eden. Doctor fucking awesome. Doctor Brain's amazing. Neurosurgeon, one of the greatest neurosurgeons this country has ever produced that really, that, that accomplished. Oh, 100% yeah, and he doesn't believe in evolution.

Speaker 4:          01:28:54       Well, he believes, he'll say, well, I believe in certain types of evolutions. He's got a, I don't think he's a 10,000 year guy. I don't think he's one of the young Earth Christians, but Sarah Pailin was, Sarah Pailin, talked to allegedly, obviously this is all anecdotal, but she allegedly talk to a librarian in Alaska and told the library and that she saw photos on the Internet of a dinosaur footprint with a human footprint inside of it. What? Which means dinosaurs and people were in the same area. Walking. Is that on? Is that recorded? That said, oh, it'd be amazing if it was. Yeah. A lot of young Earth Christians, man. How did the how, I don't know the argument of that they make for, you know, carbon footprinting things cause that's how shit, that's just a bullshit. Losers. Not a nice person. Yeah. Oh, that guy that said, that's fucking dog.

Speaker 4:          01:29:44       I know you're talking about, he's always been a loser. I'm waiting for the day when no one runs for president. I'm waiting for the day where the fucking roster everybody gives up. It's like as soon as we can read minds and figure out exactly what people, what their intention is and what their past is, and you have to sign up for the mind reading machine in order for to be president. That's going to be the end. There was, eh, it's rap. I do think I look at it so much differently now at this age. When I see people, I'm like, you're just, they're all just egomaniacs. Oh yeah. Their egos are climbing out of their skin to, to want to be, to go through that to be the president. Well, Obama's publicly stated that it's not what he thought it was. And then all these people that are lining up to do it like Filson the fame wears off as what he said and that people criticized him by taking that quote out of context and showing a bunch of pictures of him with famous people smiling and laughing, handing out with Jay z and rich people and ha ha ha.

Speaker 4:          01:30:42       Ah, and then there was this whole story about his, uh, vacations. How much is vacations costs while he was in the White House? The president's vacations cost a ton. Yeah, of course they will. They have to fly in air force one and they got secret service vehicles. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Well they have bulletproof cars. Yeah. I have to, what was his Hawaiian vacations? Apparently during his time in the White House, it's been $70 million. Taxpayers had to pay a lot of money. It's a little pricey. He's, it's great. It is a little pricey, but you know, it's kind of trumped up man. We had a great time on that trip number. Often he was golfing 70 million. Not a trip we took. Yeah, I mean he was golfing like when the San Bernandino murders were taking place, he went golfing out. There was a little skinny legs picking up golf balls. Yeah, it doesn't do any squats do.

Speaker 4:          01:31:30       There's a shooting going on man. I'm trying to play this back. Nine if you like, give me a second. Why do they all play golf? Can you be president? There's two things you can't be if you want to be president. You can't be someone who doesn't believe in God when you can't be someone who doesn't play golf. Um, I think we're about to see maybe a change of that. What Hillary, I don't think the pictures, she's going to be golf. And if she wins Bernie, do you think if he won he would play? First of all, I'll make golf illegal and I'll turn off the place of intense places where the homeless people, yeah, would be like these courses, a waste of space. They are. Yeah. The cough is, I don't have a good Bernie impression. I need to get a good brand seen. I think it James [inaudible] who was at the, he's a comic and an actor. He doesn't find it. How do you spell his last name? I think it's a d. O. M I. A N. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:32:19       james a domain. I think that's it. Oh, you know what else does a good one? Really funny. Steven crowder, he calls Bernie clause. Steven crowder fucking mocks Bernie pretty heavy. Really? Yeah. He's pretty funny. And this is a Bernie clause impression crap. You know, crowder is, and he's kind of like an internet comedian, but politically conservative. He does. Uh, he did a really funny thing. You know, social justice warriors are always saying that you should ask people what their correct gender pronouns are because some people like to useZ and h I r and all these different that nonconventional gender pronouns because they, they're either gender queer and uh, they don't, they don't want to be labeled in a specific male or female gender. You're set up for this as exhausting to you. Now I want to punch whoever fucking told you this. It's the worst thing I've ever heard.

Speaker 4:          01:33:21       I'm having an aneurysm right now thinking about where this is going to go. See your pay attention to throat, zillow and I'm paying attention to ridiculous social requirements that people in college today or we're asking people to do and they want people to ask other people's social, uh, you know, like they have like this real rigid idea of how you supposed to behave socially and you're supposed to ask their preferred gender pronouns. Like, I can't just assume that you are a man. I have to ask you. I'm not kidding. You know, there's a guy, we had this guy on who was a guest who said that one of his colleagues was, I think it was fired because he refused to this. He had a student in his class that would change his gender pronoun from him to her and her to him. And it would go back forth, back and forth depending on what days of the week.

Speaker 4:          01:34:14       Like some days he wanted to be a girl and some days he wanted to be a boy. And this, this professor was not willing to do that. And so he was fired. Good for the professor. That's one where I a hundred percent support. If you're going back and forth on today, she is here and tomorrow he might be back tomorrow. I'mZ , I'm not her z. And then the next day I'm hr her. All right. I give the fuck up. Well, you know, Harvard released a list of possible gender pronouns and so they sent it home with people to like, I want you to be aware of these potential gender pronouns and gender neutral pronouns that you should be aware of that people want them to use. Fuck me.

Speaker 4:          01:35:03       I would just walk around. I would go, he, and then if someone's like, no, I'd be like, whatever. Sorry. Sorry. You're right. Hey Jesus. You can't have a fucking Thompson Jura style beard and b, she, her maybe he z your Z, Z, z. Z. Z. Sigora mister, can I say Mr? No, no. Well, when he was in class, oh, excuse me. When Zee Zee was in class when her was in class. Chai are there really are using uh oh yeah. Z. Z. H. Here it is. Gender Binary. These are gender binary. He, she hurt him but gender neutral. Are they them? Theirs like some people on their twitter page to have a preferred gender. Pronouns use pronouns. Zi Hr, ours, h. I. R. S. Z. H. E. Here. Here's here. Here. How about here? Pronunciation. H I r is here. It's not even her. Z. Z are zeroes. Zeroes, sometimes z. If you get crazy, they spell it with an x. Z. It's like another class. I would have failed because I would really, I a run right through the fucking door. You never even bothered to open it me out. Oh, I would've been like the Kool aid guy. I would have left my outline like in the car.

Speaker 6:          01:36:32       Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:36:33       Gone. I'm gone. I'm not doing it, man. I'm really not though. What the fuck man, what is going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Everybody got a trophy participation trophies. Yeah, I'm against that for sure. That's what did it. Everybody got attention for who they are. I'm amazing on my own, right. No, I'm here. I'm Zaire. How remember, you know, losing games and, and, and it sucked. That was part of the thing is that you remember, it sucks. Yeah. Well that's why winning is awesome. Yeah. Winning is awesome. Not a loser. Yeah. Yeah. When no one's a loser, winning is an awesome anymore. Right. Cause everybody gets participation trophies. No. Yeah. Well My, my daughter when she was three, she was playing soccer and no one won. I was like, what do you mean no one won? This team scored five, that team scored zero.

Speaker 4:          01:37:18       That team fucking one. Nope. We don't celebrate that. I have, I'm going to look into, uh, a League for my kid that definitely has winners and losers. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. Well, when my daughter played softball too, and she was six, this was not even the young, the three year old that when, uh, my seven year old was six. She was playing softball and they didn't count the score. I don't get it. Then they would run and everybody high five, everybody, nobody count score. They wouldn't count. It's just about playing the bullshit. Bullshit. What? What's the point in hitting the ball then? Yeah. How about we just throw the ball around? How about you just hit balls randomly? Someone's pitching,

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       you're trying to hit it. If you don't hit it, you're a loser. Okay. Yeah, you suck at this. You know what? I sucked at tee ball or the ball sits on the t and it doesn't move. I had trouble with that. I couldn't hold. That's the other thing they do with kids. If they can't hit the pitch, they gave him a couple of pitches and they can't hit it. Then they put it on a little stick and they let the, they set it up for them and they hit it and they get them on base for sure. Yeah, and a lot of them, they don't mean hit the fucking stealing with the ball. They hit the stick itself and the ball falls down and they just start running like they just won the world series. Yeah. I got an a tee ball pretty quick, you know, I was like, I suck at this shit. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:38:34       I was bad at every sport until I did martial arts. I was pretty okay at baseball, but uh, I wasn't a good baseball player because I wouldn't listen to the coach ever. They would say go on there and try to hit a single. Okay. Whatever. And I get up to home run every time. Yeah. Every time. Swing for the bleachers. You know why? Cause I hit a couple of them and it was awesome. The best, when you feel that, take that crack of the bat and that ball starts flying through the air, you like, Yay. Sweet spot feeling man. There's that feeling that you only get when you hit a home run course. You don't get that feeling when you get on base. No. That's like, oh, okay. I'm not a loser. When you get on base, you're like, I'm not a loser one. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:39:18       You watched that thing fucking sale under the bleachers. You're a winner. Winner. Now you're a winner. Yo One. I agree in a home run, he'd come back, everybody's high fiving you. And the coach is like, I told you, get on base. You could fuck all the way off, dummy. I just hit a home run. Yeah, that's why in in football, they always tried to teach you that when you tackle to wrap up, you know, they're like lower your body, head to the side, shoulder into the chest, and then you wrap up. But you know what you try to do? You Try to light people up, throw fucking, and you miss, you know the guy who bounces off of it. But every once in a while you lay somebody the fuck out and you're like, what's up now? So that's, that's why you do that. You know, he goes, what? You do that? What the fuck is wrong with these coaches? Coach raising a bunch of pussies, they want to be called Z or her or Zarr Shit is zero. Zero. Um, well, let's see the Bernie impression. We have it. Yeah. Do we fire it up? What's his name again? James a doe Meehan. Where's he at? He's, he's here. He's an La guy. Oh, okay. Paul, let's go full screen on this bitch. Give James a domains. So props. Yeah, he's, he's funny, Dude.

Speaker 7:          01:40:25       Partisan that Donald Trump versus Bernie Sanders walling for president, but I thought of the Moody of Military Coup de Paul for like we all know power all pro football. That's really good. It's really good.

Speaker 8:          01:41:19       This is a great country. This is a great country. This is a fun place. It's pretty good too. Yeah, and I promise I'm killing everyone in the bowls. I can guarantee this. I'm killing everyone in the post and if I'm elected president, I will kill everyone. Listen fast. Okay. The minute I'm become president at the anchor baby program where we start bronzing Mexican immigrants and putting them on naval ships put to use. Finally, I'm just saying bronze and make it a real thing. No, it's no longer in events and metaphor.

Speaker 7:          01:42:00       You'll look like a warning shot here on the left to the right. It's two weeks were how out in a car. Fairly mature. Hold on. Happened while I was simultaneously buying stock pile. Where are your final courteous way completely blow up. I have more hair, but I didn't want to ask.

Speaker 1:          01:42:34       That's great. And so I don't know the trump guys name, but he's great. Yeah. What is his name was the trump press. If you highlight the video yet. Anthony, what is it, James Alimony in a domain. A domain to me at a manwich boy. Yeah. Both immigrants. Obviously names. Yeah. Probably Muslim terrorists snuck problem probably. That's funny. He doesn't really get trump to, yeah, that's good. That trump is good. It's really good. Put that fucking Bernie Sanders is on point. It really is a long haul. And talking about the percentages of the percentage, he got the uh, the substance of it down to, well, everybody's looking for somebody that comes along. It stands out as being the counter to what we're experiencing, you know? Yeah. No one feels like any of these people represent them, except maybe Ted Cruz fans is a few fucking a few Weirdos. I liked the guys that still stay in it, you know, when they know there's not even a shot of that level of denial. There's, you're just in denial. It was a pride thing. Yeah. But there's a certain point where you know there's not, it's not going to turn around and they still like, I'm, I don't know, I'm still got a shot. You know, you don't have a shot. I mean, is Jeff still in it? She's still in it. I think jeb is land back. This is my thought. My thought is jeb is rope a dope and he's letting all these people beat each other

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       up and he's laying way back and I think he's going to be the eventual Republican nominee. That's exactly. Yeah. It doesn't meet. His numbers are terrible, aren't they? I mean, Yup. And he's not trying, I'm not trying to do anything about it. It's got a long way to go. Yeah. November. Right. Which is almost a year from now. Think about what can happen publicly in a year, in a year. People become superstars from no name to superstars in this world. The world we're experiencing today. Yeah, that's true. This is a different world. Like you gotta be careful. And if you're a media savvy guy, and I got to assume that anybody who grows up where his fucking dad was president and his brother was president. Boy, if anybody understands that business, it's him and Hillary. Yeah. He looks so tired. She looks like she's exhausted. She looks exhausted. She looks super unhealthy.

Speaker 4:          01:44:42       Here's a thought. Ready? Hillary Clinton and Christie Brinkley or essentially the same age, are they, aren't they? I Dunno. I bet they are. I bet they're fucking clothes. Who would you rather hookup with a hillary? Just for the story. Yeah. That's good. Sorry, Christie Brinkley. It's like, so you're gonna Marie, your Bro. Yeah. Well the hillary like, Hey, what were you thinking dude? Christie Brinkley fuck had Viagara in me. Yeah, I did 200 milligrams of Viagara. I did 10 lines of coke. I drank a bottle of Tequila. I was on ecstasy and mushrooms. She's, she's had a real dog too, so she's had some savage sex, I think. You know, I think so. Sure. She probably hasn't been fucked in forever. That's probably been a lesbian for the left 30 or 40 years. At least. Just hangs in there with them. They made a deal. I think they made a deal.

Speaker 4:          01:45:41       She just take a picture to get a might know. What the fuck do I know? Talking Shit. But I got to assume at, first of all, if you got a guy like bill, you get to know him. You know that dude's a freak. He's a whip. His Dick out type freak. Oh yeah. He's one of those guys like, Hey, how are you? Whoa, whoa. That's my Dick. Belongs in your mouth. Look at that, Christie Brinkley. Bam, Bam. Now look at how, but that's a a really good picture. That's a really good picture of Hillary too, by the way. There's some horrific pictures of Hillary. Yeah, you can find some monstrous ones. That's probably from about 30 40 years ago to how long ago was that picture? It's November 21st two months old lies. That's photoshop. The same people that, uh, the girls are on Instagram, they use that.

Speaker 4:          01:46:29       She's listed as 68 and Christie Brinkley's 61 so seven years, seven years, whatever. There's no way the Christie brick is going to look that bad in seven years, but go for a better picture because it can happen for her. Look at that. Look at her face right there. Get the fuck Outta here, dude. She's hot, but she's also genetically gifted. You know that's a, that's a, that's her gift to look like that Eo. Meaning there's a lot involved. It's not just genetics involved. She certainly was genetically gifted at the jump to have that bone structure. Yeah, but there's a lot involved there. First of all, there's massive exercise diet. Yeah, for sure. Gotta be some Botox and some cautious use of fillers. Kegels. Yeah. Look at that one right there. Like, come on man. That's a hot 35 year old, right? That, how is that possible? How is that? That doesn't make any sense. Why aren't her teeth rotting out of her fucking head or those, they can't be real teeth. Those teeth are made out of ivory. From murdered elephants.

Speaker 4:          01:47:35       Yeah. Had real teeth. And you know what? Fucking up my grandmother died when she was like 64 and her teeth looked like shit. Why is she so hot? I appreciate the effort too. By the way. Her forehead would not move if you had a hundred Mexicans and six trucks trying to move it. Yeah. It's all the moving trucks in the world. They're not going to make that fucking forehead move. That thing is frozen in time. Like a, like a bully. Mammoth trapped underneath a glacier. Nothing's moving. Look at it fucking for you. I did. She didn't moving. She barely has some lines in the corner of her eyes. That's it. She's hot as fuck though. Yeah, whatever she's doing, everyone should do it. We should all do it and by the way, this is what we're seeing from this rare of rare, about 1% of the one, but then of the one I sent this is, she is the rarest of the rare when it comes to like women in their sixties that are still hot as fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:48:32       She's 100% hot as fuck. Right? That is what women are going to look like in the future. There's this doctor, doctor, I think he's an impure welling. They get same guy who created regena keen that blends pending procedure. They are literally months away from launching some new treatment where reignites your body's ability to produce Collagen. And so college in his weight makes your face turn all hillary like hang and droop and then it loses all its elasticity. They gonna bring that shit right back to life and your face pops out no more. When women get those old, old lady elbows were, the skin's just hanging. Nobody wants to see that. So what will they do? They'll just, I don't know. I don't understand the procedure, but it'll tighten up on you. You are going to, your body's Collagen production is going to read kickstart. It's going to just jam back into your skin and your cells are going to flourish and they're just going to fucking look elastic and yeah, you gotta Oh, wonderful.

Speaker 4:          01:49:32       Again, I like it. I like us all walking around. I'll tight faced. Yeah. Hot. Crazy. Yeah. You Imagine? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, ladies are going to snap back to life. Start strength training again. Build their butt up. Woo. And they'll looking for, still have old lady feeding. Uh, yeah. Keep socks on heath, a socks, big thick socks. I don't even see the twisted shape underneath. He'll crust at, won't go away. Ooh, he'll crust. Don't they have treatments for that though? There's sand it down, right? Yeah, there's commercials for it and Mama Stone's always trying to things that'll just shave it off. But I dunno. Have you ever seen that show dual survivor? Yes. Wait, is that the one where it's a couple of ex military guys and they, they're wandering around. Yeah. And only survive, drop them off in a lake or something. It's like sort of a fake version of survivor man with two dudes.

Speaker 4:          01:50:27       Yes. But one of the guys who's a survival expert, and I use air quotes for that, I'm sure he's an expert, but he's, he's, I think his name is cody and he's completely crazy. He doesn't wear shoes ever, ever. So he goes through the jungle, one or two, the jungle barefoot and his feet are a fucking atrocity to be, there have to be a crime against nature. His feet, he's doesn't wear shoes ever, ever. So he's just developed these insanely thick calluses on his feet, like his photos of his feet online. What does that, well, that's a good photo. There's feet look great there, but you've got to see like what his feet look like when they get close up on like the bottoms of them. I've seen some horrific photos of what his feet looked like, but he just walks everywhere through the jungle. Like there's this huge, oh my fucking God. Look how thick it is. Cracked and everything. Jesus Christ, what's called dual survivor. Yeah. There's the bottoms of his feet. Look at that a lot to make my eyes water and he got elephant skin fee. God. Yeah, well that's what people did for sure. It is weird that we have clothes and shoes. Yes. I mean for years, I mean obviously many, many years, everybody walked and ran everywhere barefoot, so yeah. Well that's why it's strange to see someone naked. What are you doing? How many clothes on?

Speaker 9:          01:51:59       Ooh,

Speaker 4:          01:52:03       who's the first person to wear clothes? Who's the first person to come out of the cave and you're like, what the fuck are you doing this kind get, I got underwear on and it's a guide. A Little Dick. I had to be, he saw a couple of other things was like, what the fuck is that little Dick started surviving people like that's a like a trait, right? Right. Somebody with a little deck. How to fuck somebody like, but that had to be like, I mean is it a trait because it's, everybody's a big Dick has a big dick son. I don't know. You imagine if you have a giant Dick and your kid has a little tiny micro deck. Man. I know. Fuck you're not my son. Yeah, you probably start thinking fucking whore. She's banging some little Dick Guy. She got tired of my big Dick. I sons, three weeks old.

Speaker 4:          01:52:48       Giant hug. We have no idea about the same size dick though. His body proportion wise about lines up. You imagine if your son was born with just said giant hard. Yeah, he comes out and he's, why is he up to and bill? Oh God, that's hard. To his time. He's a baby. It's hard every day the balls look big. How big their body such so small, the babies and then you just see like a ball bag that stands out for half side the size of the baby. Do you know that the size of the testicles is directly proportionate to the amount of promiscuous women who are in the area? Well, there's some fucking sluts where I live cause he's, he's got a big balls on them. Well they actually say that the human body adapts to the amount of promiscuous women that are in the area and your balls so crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:53:41       It's how it is with primates. The more promiscuous the women are in the area of the larger the testicles are of the primate. That's why chimps have giant balls. But gorillas have little tiny balls, little tiny balls and little tiny dicks for chimps, for gorillas, for gorillas. Because chimp, chimp, women are hookers right there. Just sluts. But gorilla women, they mind their PS and qs if fucking keep it in line, right? The gorilla has, right gorilla has a Harem. He's got a Harem big fucking pile of bitches and it just sticks his little tiny digging them to champion the chimp. They just fuck everybody fucks everybody. And when you're not looking at me, funny, the super slutty but knows they must have some giant dicks. Giant balls. Yup. Yup. They're balls. Chimp balls are giant and that's the reason why they're giant. But they ha they have observed that in humans, like, like the dirt, there's a direct relation to the size of the testicles because the more sluts they're on the area, the more competition there is to get your sperm and so you have to produce more sperm.

Speaker 4:          01:54:51       So you have to have larger balls. Yeah. How about that? That's something man, I didn't know that. Nuts and primates, there's a direct connection. They used to think that there was different kinds of sperm. There was a book written called sperm wars, but it's been largely disproven. And the idea behind that book was that there's different kinds of sperm. This actual sperm that attack other sperm, they go in there and the attack others perm, that turns out to not be true. There's no evidence that sperm have any other duty other than coming, you know, hitting eggs and trying to get people pregnant. They don't have any other properties. They don't actually kill. Sounds like a good premise for a movie though. It sounds like an awesome promise. Killer Jews. Yeah, she went blind. She got the killer as in her eyes. No sperm. Yeah. Yeah. Like it.

Speaker 4:          01:55:38       Yeah. If you like around a lot of promiscuous women, like on a porn set, then that ges that gets in a girl's eyes could probably blind her cause it's just looking at kill other sperm burrow into your eye. Like little fucking piranhas. It's chewing away through this or if outer a on one of those, those, those mugs that it starts bubbling cause there's main ones in there like fucking feeding frenzy in the Mug. If you bet a bunch of guys is in gang fight in the calm, like I don't want to drink it, drink it. It's frothing like boiling water.

Speaker 4:          01:56:26       Have you ever gone fishing? Um, where there's a feeding frenzy? Uh, yes I have actually. I was in Mexico and it was awesome man, because a, I took my kids fit, my kids love fishing. It's really fun. Yeah, they love it because it's, it's fun for little kids. Like if you can get them like near where the fish are and they actually catch one, so exciting and then they get to eat it. They are so happy. Like we caught this, I'm eating it and we caught it mommy. Like they're so excited. But we um, we went out in Mexico and there was like a hundred yards, like a football field size of all these uh, Jack's like Amber Jacks, I guess there are skipjacks and they were crushing these bait fish. So they are like anchovies or something like that or minnows, whatever the fuck it is. And they're smashing these things and the whole like football field size is just frothing and all you had to do is get close to it and cast a lure in there.

Speaker 4:          01:57:23       Bam. And the girls are like, they're holding onto the rod and I have to hold on to that with them. Otherwise, like the fish will literally pull the rod in the water. It was wild, man. It's wild. Yeah. Fishing is a pretty good time. I haven't done it in a wild fucking, I love it. It's fun. So Fun, man. I just love the idea that you could go out into that water and catch lunch. You just go out of here and bring home dinner. Yeah. That's again, not a store. And if you ever had fish that's caught like they prepared it for us. We caught a couple different kinds of fish. We caught a, um, when I was in Hawaii, we call it an, oh no, I'm going to call it, or it's a Wahoo, but they call them Ono's and I'm an ono is dalicious.

Speaker 4:          01:58:03       It's such a delicious fish and the sh, it's a big fish too. So we couldn't have even eaten all of it. So I gave half of it to the guy who ran the boat and then we took half of it. Half of the fish was enough for my whole family. Everybody ate it and they ate it. They prepared a bunch of different ways. They made Sushimi out of it. They made like a, they baked it and they grilled it. So they gave us like three different preparations and the Oh, they even made some Vj. Yeah, they made CV chairs. What city were you in doing? This was in, uh, that was in Maui. Wow. Yeah, it was a really awesome man. That's, no actually that was on the big island, but um, I love Hawaiian man. I wish it wasn't so far. I know, but that's why it's awesome.

Speaker 4:          01:58:46       It's cause it's so far. Yeah. If it was right there it'd be like Mexico. You just go right there. But Mexico is pretty bad ass too, man. You go there recently, Mexico. Yeah, I was there last year. Uh, area. Um, Punto Tomita okay. It's called, is that important by artos or what it is? I Dunno. I've been, I went to the loom. Taloon was nice. That was cool. Um, the next time I go, I want to go where the Aztec Pyramids are. Cause when I was in Mexico City, I've been in Mexico City twice last year for the UFC and a, but I want to go, man, I just fucking chill in my hotel and work out. It's pretty crazy city, right? It's nuts. Yeah. It's chaos. First of all, the pollution is worse than anything you've ever seen in your life. Really? Oh my God. I took photos and put it on my instagram and people thought it was bullshit.

Speaker 4:          01:59:31       Really? It's insane. Like the photos on instagram that I put up, it looks like you're in a fire like it looks like, is that bad? Oh, it's crazy. It's way worse than La. It's like Yelei in 20 years if if Donald Trump becomes president. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the biggest city in the world, is it? Yeah, I believe so. More than it. Chinese cities like Beijing, there's harm people, so, right, right, right. I tell him, no, I, I'm pretty sure it's the biggest, it might be just the biggest in North America and you might be right. Yeah. They might have Chinese cities with 100 billion. The biggest last time we looked this up, Tokyo two, three 30 million sentence. It's a lot. I saw it. La Isn't la. You have 20 million. It's not official. Well, let's, let's Google the world's. Let's, let's, let's guess right now, I'll tell you this.

Speaker 4:          02:00:19       My guests, I have a guest on site called La County and that city county, it's probably 13, 14 million posts. You're not counting Mexicans. Uh, am I not? How many illegal aliens are there in California? Uh, no one has a fucking club. 1 million. Isn't that hilarious? Yeah. It might be true. 7 million illegals. Yeah. 13 million regular. Yeah. Normal people. Normal people. What does that 3.8 for la La city properties, if that's exactly what that horse shit. That's Los Filez. Yeah, he's right. Wow. But that's not counting. That's, you know, that's not the greater metropolitan. Yeah. That's the thing is that La is not really a city. It's, you know, it seems like, whoa. What is 18 million greater Los Angeles area? 18 million. 18 five mm. Yeah. That seems that's more, see the greater, the thing about when I say la is not a city, what I mean is like New York City's a city. It's only New York City. Like you go there and you're like, oh he wouldn't allow it in the city. People say, oh we left the city greater Tokyo is 35 million. Oh my God. 27% of the nation's entire population. Ooh, wow. Now how about China's

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       cities? Cause I saw something that said they have something like 10 or maybe more than 10 cities in China with 20 million or more people. Oh my God.

Speaker 7:          02:01:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:01:52       Jesus Christ. China's cities. There you go. List of cities. Wow. Look at that. Wait a minute. Look at that first city, but don't even know what fucking city that is. Area. Hold on. Population control. I was 12 million. 700,000 okay, so Shanghai 23 Jesus,

Speaker 1:          02:02:21       23 for Shanghai. What does Beijing administrative area, you say that's not the real, but see the problem with this is you leaving this up to people in China to counter people. Yeah. Okay. This city that you'd never heard of that has 28 million tongue Pong Chong. What does that [inaudible] I think it's admirable. A Tab. Isn't that funny that if you, if you do that, you're an asshole. Yeah, of course. You know, if you a few incorrectly pronounce Asian cities in a humorous way, yeah. You're a terrible person. Of course you can't say Chung Chong Chong. You can't say that, but I'm a bad person. Right. Bad person and that funny. Guang jewel, the Wang jewel population 2015 what do we got here? 14 million. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. According to who? Guangzhou jeans. They're not counting. They're not counting for real. They're hiding their babies to for real. For Real. And you're only allowed to hit women 30 million additional in migrants living in the area for six months out of the year.

Speaker 1:          02:03:27       What? What? Oh my God. So they have 13 million and 30 million, 30 million people just kind of sitting around. They don't really live here. There are snowbirds or you live in there. You live in there. You can't say migrants. No, you're fucking with your numbers, man. It's Hollywood logic. Or Hollywood, uh, arithmetic. Yeah. When they do Hollywood accounting, I movies for sure have a movie that made $100 million and they tell the actors, I'm sorry. No problem. Really make that kind of money. Yeah. We'd love to give you what you deserve, but we can't because the accounting, it says we didn't make any money. Yeah. Hmm. I tell you to do with record companies too, right? Yep. Have you seen soaked in bleach soaked in bleach? Yeah. That's something that I have to watch. So it's courtney. There's a documentary about courtney love. Eddie Bravo in Brendan Schaub. We're fucking raving about, oh, really?

Speaker 1:          02:04:18       Saying that she killed Kurt cobain and her former bodyguard private investigator. Apparently. Uh, he's the one who recorded all these conversations with her. And it's another Netflix jammy. No, no. It's a documentary, but it's on Netflix, right? Yeah. Okay. You were talking about narcos. You just started that. Yeah. Smart goals really goes to shit. So good. It's fucking, Netflix is killing it lately. F is for family. The bill burr series. Hilarious. Uh, blood line. The new, I'm Bob and Dave show, Mr Show. They're doing it. They're calling. I don't know what they're calling bob and Dave. That's what it's called with Bob and David. It's funny, man. It's really good. I saw the Aziz Ansari show. Yeah, it's okay. It's been rave reviews cause he's in sorry shows. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I haven't seen it. Bloodlines. How bad do you want the whole thing? I watched the first episode.

Speaker 1:          02:05:14       It's like, it's okay. It's, I mean, I had a couple of laughs, you know who was funny in it? Eric, we're Haim. Tim and Eric. Yeah, he's fucking hilarious. Yeah, that guy's a maniac. He's really funny. He's funny. He's funny in that. Um, but, but bob and David, maybe the problem is I compared it to Bob and David. Maybe if I watched it on its own, I would like it more. But Bob and David was fucking funny. Like really good. I just got into the killing and, and ran through that, which was an AMC show that ended up on Netflix. Then Netflix paid for a fourth season. Really? That series. I loved it. I love the killing. What is it about? It's about these two Seattle homicide detectives, but it's really good, you know, storytelling that the, basically it's them following a murder per season and they really, you know, it makes it super engaging.

Speaker 1:          02:06:04       It's cliff hanger stuff where it ends. You're like fucking press play on the next one. Isn't that crazy too? They were lease. That's one of the things where netflix figured it out. Yeah. They just released the entire season and won gold course binge watch it. Yeah. It's the cards. Everything. They had house of cards. I watch house of cards too. I've watched one and a half episodes. It's all I've seen, but I saw it on a plane. American Airlines has netflix on. Oh fuck. Well that one. I'll tell you. I think you get three episodes in a house of cards. Consider it out. You're done. You're gonna Watch the whole fucking thing if you make it that. Yeah, it gets better. Pilots are tough I think. Yeah. As the more you watch shows like that, you understand that pilots are tough to introduce a world introduced, characters make you care about what's going on.

Speaker 1:          02:06:49       But once if you can get over that hurdle and you get to the second or third and when it's good, like I said, bloodline I was totally impressed with after I got to through a couple episodes and Fargo, which is not a netflix thing, but both of those seasons, you know the, the first season pilot of Fargo is just one of the best pilots I've ever seen. Fargo, I never hear about it. So fucking good. Willie. I think it might be the best show on television. Dammit. Tommy. Yes. And I sang this. You got to check it out. Wow. I'll give you, uh, you're going to get me, it was how I have it on DVD, but you can also just digitally give me some shit and then you can also just, you know, on demand it's on Fx. Really didn't give me, give you, give it to you.

Speaker 1:          02:07:39       It's an honor. It's on Netflix. It's on. But if you have apple TV, oh, he's going to Fx fx on demand. Oh, watch it on apple TV is another thing that is the shit. Netflix is built dealers, man and Netflix built in and it's great. And the new one apparently is even better. I got the last generation. I don't have to, it's a new generation out of what? Of the APPLETV. I got the old shit. I don't even have the new shit. There's new shit. There's a new one real shit to use. It's fast. The remote's better. Ooh, I might have to get a second hole. Isn't there a way you can make a remote with your phone? You turn your phone into her amount. That's some shit. That's Jamie Shit. Well they've been doing that with android phones for a while. So many android phones actually have like an iar thing and the front making like pointed at your tv and you can actually change channels.

Speaker 1:          02:08:26       The Apple Guy was trying to get me while I was in the store. Like he's like, Oh, get these, uh, by these lights and then your phone can control lights, make them different colors. We have those for here. Never installed them. Okay. Yeah. Well I don't have that kind of time. I go, dude, come on man. There's someone hacks my phone and turns the fucking lights on, off and on while I'm sleeping. It's no fun bullshit. That's bullshit. It's bullshit, man. It's a light switch. My wife installed these stupid fucking light panels in my house. They're like a little computer or you have to touch. It's a touchscreen thing. It's so stupid. She likes it because it looks cool, but they don't click. There's not a click, so when you walk in a room and the lights off, you can't just touch it. You have to look at it.

Speaker 1:          02:09:09       Find out where the, the white light is. Touch that. When it turns out it's glass. There's no tactile. Feel. Some horse shit. Horse Shit. Do you, how do you feel about curved tvs? Curved tvs are dog shit. They can suck my dick. How about that? All right. I was looking for an opinion and I want a flat tv. Goddammit. I'm not looking at certain. The fucking cockpit of a jet. Yeah. Why? Why is it curved? I Dunno. What am I have to look left? Look right, look forward. I don't know where to look. I it right in front of me and flat. They know what not too big. How about that? What size are you talking about? Too? Fucking big. What size are you talking about? Assholes. They're hundred inch TV. What the fuck are you looking? What are you going up? How far of you?

Speaker 1:          02:09:52       How about you get a smaller TV and sit closer? You fuck what? You got a 100 inch TV. We got to sit a mile away from that fucking thing of taking the entire image. What about projectors? Those are dog shit. I've had one. They take it, they take a couple seconds to boot up their stupid. So someone steps in front of it. You see that person on the screen. So tvs, the TVS are definitely the way to go. The image is better too. And I had a, I've had several generations of, of uh, projectors. Will you at my house? Excuse me? When I had the projector room? Yes. Yeah, that's all gone now as a pool table in there. I gutted that room. Oh, you did? Yeah, it changed it. I didn't know. But, um, when, uh, the, the projector was there when I got there, when I moved

Speaker 4:          02:10:33       in, they, uh, it was one I had to buy it and it was stupid. I shouldn't have bought it. I should have told them, take that wonky hunk of Shit and get out of here.

Speaker 2:          02:10:44       I own your house. Kicked the bricks. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:10:47       Uh, but the um, the light, if the, the curtains were open even a little, you couldn't watch TV. Yeah. That's stuff you had to make it so dark. You couldn't see anything. She had to get blackout curtains. You have blackout curtains, you to shut the door. If anybody opened the door while we're watching TV, it was so stupid. So then we got the next generation of, um, projector, which is smaller. It's a lower profile and it was much, much, much better. And then I got a big TV in there and I was like, these things are stupid. Projectors are stupid. They're just not as good.

Speaker 2:          02:11:21       It's not as good. All right. I mean, I was thinking about it, thinking about it. Oh yeah, I love, you know, I love watching movies and all that. So just get it a bad ass TV. Do you want a nice tv? They have four k TVS now. Like this is a four K tv. This fucking thing looks so good that the resolution is so high end. It's so pretty that when you're looking at an image, like it doesn't get any better than that. You know, my new specialist in four K oh my goodness. Your new special that's out this Friday on Netflix. January 8th. What's it called? It's called mostly stories. Why'd you call it? Mostly stories. I just figured I tell stories and um, you know, even though it's not the whole special is not stories is the story about your doctor in this one that's in my other special, oh, it's in my other special. That one. You know that I get a breakdown of what, what does the best from a sound exchange, they go, here's what's what people are playing the most on Pandora. Really? Yeah. And that, that story is number one. It's a funny fucking store. That's the doctor Dick Story.

Speaker 2:          02:12:22       This one, a real guy to write a real guy who I finally told him that I told a story about him and I gave it to them to listen to. And then he called me. He was like, I fucking love it. He's like, I just sent it to my parents and they can't believe I talk like this to my patient if anybody hasn't seen it. And we don't want to give away any spoilers because it's a fucking specialist call. Completely normal, which is on that place. But the new one has ever a Serena Williams bid in it. Yes, yes, yes. But this one has, um, has a bunch of stories of, you know, it has a bunch of standup. It's a standup special, but I have stories about my trainer in it. I have a story about the Jesus trainer. Yeah. I have him a no, no. And then I have a, he's going to find out. I think he's definitely gonna find out. It's going to find out I have a Tyson Mike Tyson stories in this role. That's a great story too. I have a story about a movie theater fight that I got into and yeah, there's all kinds of stories in it. I called it mostly stories. Um, ask you, um, oh, this is all going to tell you

Speaker 4:          02:13:26       no, I d I downloaded one of your, uh, one of your, uh, cds off itunes.

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       I bought one of your comedy cds. Thanks and welcome. But there's something, I was just in the mood for some comedy and I know you're hilarious, but I was, um, was really weird. Uh, my phone, like when you have Bluetooth synced up to your phone and your phone, um, if it starts when I get in my car, I don't know what the settings are, why it does this, but my car, we'll just all of a sudden start playing like from the mold because it's set, it's sinked up to Bluetooth and Bluetooth for music. So when I get in my car, it'll all of a sudden start playing music. It plays your fucking Serena Williams bit every time. It's so bizarre. Every time it plays it first. So when I get in my car and I start my car up, I hear you. You're the first thing that I hear every time.

Speaker 1:          02:14:17       That, so as a whole about I, you know, I want to die in a dumb way. Yeah. Like it goes right into that. Every time it's happened to me. Well it happens to me in my car with a gang starr, which I guess is probably a better, a better than my summary for you. It's better if you got in your car and you started playing your shit. He'd be like, Hey, listen to this pissed, pissed, my favorite, my favorite shit. But actually you knew who else it happens too with, with what you're saying is a, my mother called me and she goes, I bought your album and now every time I get in the car it plays in. How do I need to stop it from doing that? And that's my own mother. You know, she's fucking sick of this shit. So that's why I wonder why song or that one bit rather plays every time.

Speaker 1:          02:15:00       Every time I get in my car, it starts off with that. That's so it is, that is weird. Yeah. It's very strange. But it's um, what is your gangstarr one that goes, it's a, I think it's above the clouds, which makes sense because it's Alphabetical, right? So, hmm. But gangstarr but what I mean, I dunno man. Yeah. I don't know what, what it is. And sometimes if I plug in the phone then it will also only play that song and we'll let me fast forward or jumped to another song. What is the name of that and bid? I think it's called a good death. Is it? Oh, that's why. Hey. Hey. That's why I just want it to be justified. That's how every fucking day starts for me. It's because a, yeah, that must be a mass bay. Well, that's a good move. I'm going to name all my bits. A Big Dick Story.

Speaker 1:          02:15:58       Imagine if that was like what I did with my special every fucking bit was called a big Dick Story. That's another big Dick. I know. Biggest, my favorite big stick. I had that thing where I, that was kind of the idea behind when I did my first album called thrilled where I do like a parody of Michael Jackson's thriller. The whole idea, like part of the fun of that was so that I, cause I knew that people who got the album had a good chance of in their library having it next to Michael Jackson's, you know that was, that's fine. And people send me screen grabs, they send me screen grabs of their library. They're like, you're a part of that picture is, I love how you trimmed your neck, but you chest is like a wall between, you face your hair and then you have like this bridge of no hair. So much hair. That should be the name of my next album. So much hair.

Speaker 1:          02:16:55       So people send you screen grabs of them, have their phone being like it's you and it's like me and Michael Jackson, you know, like side by side. Thrilled. That's hilarious. Chest hair in a fucking chain. Something about chest hair and chained together. Yeah. Attract a very specific type of woman with that look. Oh yeah. Chest hair and chains. Yeah. It's the kind that will scoop and score. I thought that sculpin score. Have you heard a, if you watched F is for family yet? I did. I saw the first episode. I just saw the fucking funny, isn't it? I love the neighbor. Yeah, I was thinking of him. Oh yeah. Gold chains. And the driver says awesome. Yeah. I saw a funny series, man killed it, man. That's awesome. Apparently Louis Louis C K is going to do an animated series now too. Oh really? Those gingers and taking over man gingers are fucking run it.

Speaker 1:          02:17:43       Yeah, man. It's, you know, it's, you know what it is. It's like a lot of lack of pussy. When you're young, it's hard to get laid. That tension builds up. You get an upset focus and drive focus and drive that redheaded focus and drive. So he's going to do an animated one. Yeah. He's apparently going to do an animal. You went to animated series, man. It's so you could get away with so much. I mean, think about what South Park has gotten away with the stuff that they can do. What [inaudible] and butthead dead. Yeah. Back in the day. Yeah. When aren't they gone to Redo Beavis and butthead? They did. Right. But nobody cared anymore. But he's doing that hbo show. Mike Judd? Yeah. What? Silicone Valley. Oh, that's right. His, that's a good show. That's another funny show. Is this the best time ever to be just a fucking loser?

Speaker 1:          02:18:29       Sits in front of the TV without doubt. This is the best, best tv shows ever, ever. TV has for a while now. Just leapt over. Moving same cinema. Just not even close. Not even close. I think about what you can do with a TV man. Well, the thing about TV is like something like game of thrones. It's like a new movie every week and it's tied together. Yeah. Yeah. In a movie. I mean, how much can you really get attached to a character in a two hour film? It kind of can, but not like the way you can't over 10 1520 episodes season for sure. He knew what else I like that these television shows, whether it's narcos or whether it's game of thrones, they're largely unknown actors. So you associate them with the actual character instead of going, Oh, here's beneath old del Toro playing another crazy guy.

Speaker 1:          02:19:16       Right, right, right. That happens a lot. Yes. That's big man, because when I go to the movies and I see Tom Cruise, I'm seeing Tom fucking cruise. I'm not seeing some mad scientist. I'm not seeing a private agent, no secret agent. I'm seeing Tom Parking cruise. He's famous or Bradley Cooper or Jennifer Lawrence. I'm seeing them. I know it's them. You can't lie to me. It's why those actors that were really that really get into play and parts stand out so much like the way that Phillip Seymour Hoffman used to play roles. You lose yourself in his role because he was so committed to not being the actor. He was the park. Daniel Day Lewis is my favorite example of that fucking guy. When he did that boxer moving, he did nothing but box for a year, really for a year. All we did was go to the boxing gym every day and train.

Speaker 1:          02:20:02       He looked. He's the only guy that I've ever seen in a movie where he actually looked like a real boxer when he was doing the scenes. It was like if you watched the fighter with Marky Mark Wahlberg and he's playing, um, I'm a tour guide. Micky Ward, he playing Micky Ward, he doesn't live it. Got Boxer and I say, God knows how to throw punches. Jillian Hall. Do you think he looked like a box? I didn't see that movie. Yeah, the Marky mark movie. He doesn't look like a guy who's actually been boxing. He looks like a guy who knows how to throw punches. But there's a big difference between a guy who knows how to throw punches and a guy who knows how to throw punches, anticipating that so many punches back and the idea of an actual boxer, there's a difference between knowing that a guy's going to stand in front of you like a rocky movie or a guy who looks like a boxer.

Speaker 1:          02:20:51       And Daniel Day Lewis was the only guy I've ever seen in a movie that actually looked like a boxer. He, this is him. This is him jumping rope. But maybe there's a, Oh, that's him actually jumping rope. Yeah. Look how good he's jumping rope. Holy Shit. That shit, man. Yeah. That guy's an animal man. He really is an animal. That motherfucker, he, he, when he did that, uh, my left foot, he was in character like for like a year. Well, they said he was like that for, there will be blood stays in character. That's probably annoying as fuck it's gotta be. Imagine if you do it in a movie like Lincoln and nobody gives a shit. How about offset, you know, lunches or dinner with them. Oh, have a milkshake and they're like, come on. Hey Ben. Sorry. Yeah, it's, it's gonna wear on you score. And seven years ago, and nobody gave a fuck about that movie.

Speaker 1:          02:21:44       More people cared about the, the Abraham Lincoln versus the vampire movie. Abraham Lincoln, vampire hunter. More people cared about that movie then. Then the Daniel Day, Lewis Abraham Lincoln went, yeah, I believe that. What is that? We don't give a fuck about historical movies. I don't know. Sometimes they take off. Right. I think part of it is nameless this, well, no, I think part of it is now is that we have seen a lot like there's a point where you go, I know even though it might be worth telling, I've seen a number of Holocaust movies or I've seen a number of civil rights, you know, American story like so when those come out go, I kind of know the story, right? So I think that's where the, the interest, the box office goes down and people go, well I know, I know this story and you can retell it or tell it in a new way or interesting way. But people feel like I got it right. I've seen the story does, it doesn't feel like new, but it was for for a moment it's boring. We don't want to hear about it. Went on to hear about history. I want space ships and I want aliens and laser beams and explosions. Did you say a force awakens? Yes, I did. What'd you think of a date? Haven't seen it yet. You should before I tell you everything that happened.

Speaker 1:          02:23:02       I do want to see it. It's good, man. I was obsessed with him and I was a kid. I enjoy the shit out of it. Yeah, it's, it's a perfect blend of new and old. It's a perfect homage. It captures the essence of the original films, but with much more updated special effects, graphic storytelling and acting is really good too. There's nothing bad about it. I loved it. I've used, started watching, we were talking about netflix making of a murderer. No, I have not get your entire life together. I know. I need to. Everybody keeps fucking telling me. That is the number one thing that people tweet me about. Other than that, I'm wrong about Bernie Sanders. I'm not my party candidate. He not say 90%. He said he's okay with it. It's not too much. If it's over a certain amount, I'm not done with it.

Speaker 1:          02:23:53       Feel the burn. You're going to, it's shit your pants. I keep saying, I keep hearing that. Um, apparently I've listened to a radio lab podcast that talked about the exact same story. It is, right. I looked it up. It came out in like 2013 they weren't, they left out, uh, all the corruption going on in the movie. Yeah. Yeah. The state side of the story and the, the states side of the story and the woman's side of the story who accused the man of rape and she thought, I dunno the level of conspiracy involved in this. It's just, it's mind blowing. Yeah. The radio lab thing didn't cover that at all. That's what really, that kind of sucks. They couldn't have though. They do. Radio lab only had an hour, two hours. He's got to do 10 episodes that same little over an hour. He'd see. That's where something like Netflix fucking shines.

Speaker 1:          02:24:42       Yeah. Cause you can't do that anywhere else. Yeah. They won't let you know, like my new special six hours. Wow. That's amazing. Are you naked in all of it and most of it, beginning of the end was a lot of asshole shots or I don't know that there's a lot of what I tried to do. I do the diaper change style. I'm going to do the face down. I do both. I had a guy come up to me at the fucking Improv the other day, asked me to do a comedy and a nudist camp. He's like, it's amazing. We, everyone who performs, they perform naked. I go, Oh yeah, okay. Uh Huh. And he goes, who are you interested in doing? I go, nope. See Ya. He goes, oh, come on man. You, I go, hey dude, you're not going to see my cock. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:25:18       Okay. You want to, yeah. This is your elaborate method. Guy was clearly gay by the way. He was going for that car. Then you have us. Who was the guy that was dying to see you? Or was that a, was that a gym or something and you have a guy somewhere that was eyeballing you, something like that. Was it working out every day, bro. But I mean, you know, I did just scout at a, uh, at a gay gym for a while when I was on news radio. I worked at, at a gold's gym on coal, but like the same, like the same guy waiting all the call. That wasn't, no, that was in Jujitsu, Jujitsu. That was the sky. Well we had to kick that guy out. He was just like hang back. He would wait for me to get dressed but he waited for everybody to get trust and he would harass guys.

Speaker 1:          02:26:01       He was like say a bunch of creepy sexual shit to people when they were changing. Yeah. Which uh, it's end. He also would go and do Jujitsu and purposely get his ass kicked. Dicey. You're manhandling them. We want it to like you barely fight back man. Like I remember he roll with this one guy and the guy tapped him like really quick and they got to realize he wasn't fighting back and like looked at them and they looked at and the, and the guy tried to keep going and goes, no, I'm dumb and we're not doing this, doing this. First of all, you just came all over yourself. That's making me a couple. He said to my friend Brad, he said, sometimes I just come here to get my ass kicked. Come on man. This is not the place. And this is Brett was one of the guys that got him kicked out of there because he would just say creepy sexual shit though.

Speaker 1:          02:26:41       That's crazy. He would say weird shit. The guys, you know, like one time, uh, I, I wear, I would wear a jockstrap and then, uh, over my jock strap, I would put a cup on [inaudible], you know, and the cop goes in a jockstrap he goes, yeah, you were a two jock straps. And I just looked at him like, why are you staring at me getting changed and commenting? I'm on a blighted. Yeah, shut the fuck up, man. This is weird. And the way we do it, it's like this longing looking at his face. Like he's just hoping that you just just pull your car got and just stuff it and get mug throat. Tell us sweet freedom. There was none of that. That's another thing about the evolution of porn to things that have happened that have been pretty radical. One, no one has hair pussy anymore, puts her hair, puts it, turns out the war.

Speaker 1:          02:27:28       Yeah, it's gone. The radical crazy girl has a little landing strip. Oh my God, she's crazy. Like a little Bush. He like some Bush. It's not that I like it or dislike it. I have no problem with not getting pubic hair in my mouth, but what I'm thinking is kids today, they don't know what it's like to get a pubic hair stuck in between your teeth. Yeah. They don't want to set up yes for us. Sure. That feeling. Yeah. We have it in your Tanya so he can't get it out and even if you get it out, you think he's still in there. You never get it out. You actually don't use that move for anything else than removing pubic hairs from your mouth. Maybe if you bite a Napkin, if you take a Napkin and bite into it and chew it and then he got up, but why would you do that? Right, but you eat a lot of pussy have to hairs. I spent a lot of hairs in my youth. Sure that somewhere online it just stopped. It's silence.

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       The fucking, the trees were all chopped down like what happened? What happened to the forest? Just stuffy in there. It's weird. It's just stopped growing pussy hair. When you saw it. Girls get one of yours and then they stop. You're like, could you get back to it? And they're like, what? But some, some change happen both in pornography and in people. And it's almost like pornography became more popular because of like blockbuster and vhs tapes. Sure. Remember they have those local video stores. Of course you have to go through the fucking saloon doors to get to with that open a year, young, uh, adrenaline rush walking through those doors. You feel people don't, I know if you were on, if you were visiting someone in prison and you had to go to jail lockdown area, yeah. It really was. I remember buying to buying porn in those.

Speaker 4:          02:29:21       And you know, you buy, if you go to a porn store, it's funny, but if you go to a regular store that has porn and you buy a porn and then you get the checkout person who was like totally judging you, you're a real fucking pig. You know that. You can be so nervous. Oh, so nor honorable. I remember the, uh, some of the checkout person one time was like, you want me to throw away the box for you? A lot of people don't like the box. I was like, I'll take the puck, put it in a fucking bag, let's go to the box. Might collect them, collect the boxes, a frame, the boxes. If you're going to be an order, how am I going to know the order if I don't have the box? I need a box. Yeah. Um, the saloon door thing.

Speaker 4:          02:29:56       So I think people started buying them. They started renting them, right? And they started taking them home and then they started going, what's all the hair? Yeah. And then something happened where the industry recognized that it's looks weird when you see all this asshole hair and you're good to fucking camera three inches away from it. And some dudes, hairy ass and his ball bag or slapping up against her area. And I'm like, look, we've got to clean this up. We've got to clean this up. Okay. And so they somewhere along the line don't on what year it was the eighties maybe they started all the shaving down like ace and had some hair. I think it was to me I think it was the shift in the high def. Ah, you might be right. Took the airway well it's also people got bored with the regular product.

Speaker 4:          02:30:37       So we were talking about earlier like why are they still making porn? Well obviously it came a point in time where they had to shift from just two people meeting the pizza guy. Come on in, I don't have any money but I can pay you in another one. Something happened along the way were porn itself changed? Like they got tired of those scenarios and then it became like rough porn and gagging and Mascara running. It's not, those are really crazy still. Oh my God I saw this one with this girl. They laid her down on a bed and her head hung off the edge of the bed and guys just took turns. Just mouth fucking

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       are balls into her nose and slobber and like she was like puking up saliva, like coughing and spitting and that she would and they would just be right back in there and the next guy would do it. And these guys were these giant cocked black guys with these big meaty acids. Pound her fucking mouth. Yeah. It was just whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa man. Who's asking for that? Someone's clearly asking for that. Do you think they just had figured out, you know, we got to present this in a different way? I think it's probably the people that do the porn, like we're talking about mass hardcore being so fucking crazy. I think they just get so bored with sex. They're like, no up, I'm opening your ass home and throw my keys in there that people have. Like we're gonna play Jacks and when to throw the jacks in your ass haul something happened.

Speaker 1:          02:32:12       There's a proportion to that. Yeah. It went from missionary to like lay on your back, you know, get a dog and then it's like, you know, tongue my balls from underneath. Let's go ask her mouth like someone was the first worst Nigga. I got an idea. Yeah. And then asked her mouth was born. Is that safe to do so? Genre, ATM. It's a genre, you know milfs cause like a, a bunch of different genres. Guilty. You can find these genres. Kim An yeah, Jesus Christ. 60 plattsmouth but because of that, the images that people saw in pornography changed the way people take care of their pubic hair. Yeah. It's 100% what it was. That's the influence. Pornography changed the way women trim their pubic hair. Maybe guys too. Yeah, definitely trim, trimming it at all before. Do you manscape down there? Sure. Is it like your neck and the thriller thing where it's like beard, beard, beard.

Speaker 1:          02:33:08       It's no hair, hair, chest, clean cock and clean bikini line. Hairy legs. It would, that would be so it just not as crazy down there. But yeah, I definitely do some maintenance man. You know, I like, I like having a pretty clean ball bag. That's a good move. And then you know, hair grows on the shaft. I trimmed that off too. How much hair it grows in your chef. There's like my beard. Like this is no joke. He's a wolf man Werewolf. I'll shave all around it and then we'll trim all around that to save your asshole. No, I did it once. I had it waxed once. I did it once when I tweeted about it and people got mad at me. Why? Oh, it was great. I got to say I want to go back to it shaving your asshole. I had it waxed. And why did you do that for a radio show. But what radio show? Bob and Tom, they waxed your asshole. But the um, explained further please. I met, they made some comment about waxing and hair and I said something to them like, well the next time I'm in town I would do that, you know, to my ass. Cause I, I'd heard about how, how ups your wife game so much. Oh yeah. What a match. Well, they did it, it was fine. Like it wasn't that crazy

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       to do. It wasn't as paint know who did it and they had a uh, local people that that wax male or a female female, a girl saw your asshole. She waxed it. Yeah. She put that in there. She got in there. Did she have like those rubber made gloves? She had some type of glove on. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And then, you know, she was putting hot wax in my ass. If she didn't, you'd be like, um, yeah. Are you professional? She's pulling it off with her teeth and then, but here's the thing, users or finger nails for mips it away like a sticker. The memory isn't even getting waxed. It's how great the wiping was for six weeks after that, six whole weeks until it stubble starts kicking in. Yeah. You have unbelievable taint itch. Yes. The taint itch was other level, but I didn't even know what it was like to not to, to wipe a few times.

Speaker 2:          02:35:06       Yeah. It'd be like, yeah, I'm done. Because when you have a hairy ass, oh shit under the top of your head, a picture of that, that's what you're doing with your hair yet never quite get done. Roll of toilet paper for a normal shit to clean my ass. So disgust. So one time I decided I was shaving my ball bag and a I trim first and then I get in the shower and then I use a razor. Right. So a razor in my ball back. No. You know, so I can get in there. And so I lifted my leg up, some quite flexible, right? I put my leg up on the wall and just looked down there and just started shaving away. It just, the visual is amazing. Hacking fucking trees out of my asshole. First of all, I couldn't believe how long my asshole Harris, yeah. Gets lost. It gets like, uh, like more than a beard. Yeah. Like we're crazy beard. Like maybe like a Rasputin type beard. But how'd you feel after that? First of all, my farts changed the sound. I was like, I couldn't, but it's almost like before I was like farting through the forest and now it's like all my farts like wet and so cause it gets muffled with that. Hey, they sounded different. Yeah, they stayed literally sounded different and it will louder now that they had beautiful beef. Creem was coming out of peak.

Speaker 2:          02:36:34       There's this guy that we found on our podcasts. What's his name? His name is Thursday lane. Oh this is another guy. This isn't the other guy. The finance not kicking ass rapper. This guy, this guy is named his, yeah, his name was, his name is diego, but he goes by Thursday lane and his a fucking name. Yeah, he gets, I got a rap name and he wants to be, he wants to do fart fetish porn. That's his dream. So he posted all these videos about how much he loves farts and that's how we got in touch with him. And he has a description for whatever type of hair color you have. He associates it with a different type of cream or broth. That's the smell to him. So if you have brown hair, you have beef cream farts. And if you have this is him. This is him. Yeah. Thursday lane marries a fart. Yeah. What? Yeah. Yeah. This is play this, what does that mean? You'll see Mary's a fart

Speaker 10:         02:37:31       if you're a diabetic cock pit. Your meat marrying. Get farts where you're like the beef chicken. Spicy Korean. Yeah. Can I'm Mary y'all farce the light please. Please. What is I put his hair. It's different. Ready? One, two. Oh Wow. Other than made up for life. Thank you. These are the three lines on that.

Speaker 2:          02:37:50       So Guy Farts in his face and he gets super excited. Yeah. He loves it. Right? I mean you don't understand. So you know if you have, um, he really does like it. Oh, he loves it. He's not kidding. No, he just did a flip bullies. Even the way Jesus Christ, let's face it, is eating that guys asked one of the guy who was farting in his face is gay or not. I don't think he is. He works for that. Cause we talked to that company. To company. Yeah, because we, we talked about them on a, our podcast kind of company, and we talking about it, it's hot movies.com or something like that. So they, they, they heard him on our podcast and then they contacted him and shot that interview. Um, but he has a description for every hair color. So if you have, if you have white hair, he is, you're a silver trout cream.

Speaker 2:          02:38:37       If you have blond hair, your chicken cream if you have. So he associates this, it's really intense and he has a whole list of and calls your farts. Beautiful guppies. I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with him? He loves farts. But did you ask him how this all happened? Yeah, he, he likes to ramble though, so I couldn't really keep up, you know, it kind of goes off on some stuff and you on the phone with them, not real life. Right. So he was just, I was like, all right man, we got to pull this in. But, um, I, I even said like, oh, I feel like I got a little, I got a little beef cream today. He goes, hmm.

Speaker 2:          02:39:14       He, there's all types of people out there in this wacky world. There's so many wacky people, and if you met this guy and he was like, I love far, nothing gives me off more. If that's what gets me. When people say they're bothered by something that like, would it bother you that that's what he likes? No. Oh Shit, we're comedians. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that is what it is. We're freaks. We're not regular. That's true. I mean, there's a lot of freaks out there that have regular jobs that don't mind. Don't care either, but we're freaks. Yeah. You know, in terms of society. Yeah. We're about as freaky as it gets. That's true. We're, we're looking for this stuff. I mean, you contacted this guy. Yeah. He wanted him on your show. You get the throat master. What's her name? Through the zillow. Yeah. You had her on your show. True. We were seeking it out. Ah, and loving it. Of course. That's the best. I wish I met somebody like that everyday. Why not? Right? Yeah. Yeah. Just like a professional cycler. I got pee.

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       Oh, well, we're done. Anyway. It's five o'clock man. Yeah, we do three fucking hours. God Damn a girl. That was fun. That was, what are you doing here? Right here? Monitor. You're paying, you're turning that on. I'm turning it on and go pee. Why? Well, I'm just, I'm just, I'm a vlogger man. Oh, you're blogging. I'm flogging. I'm, you know, the people started saying that. Excuse me. I'm not in support of people saying it. I don't mind reading out of it. I make fun of it. And blogging. Blogging is a funny term to me. Uh, feel weird standing there pointing at that. You have a handle on it. Like it's a gun. It's a, I've had it stick out of the jacket by the way. And I've seen some people's eyes go. Let me ask you this. Yeah. Yeah. Why that and not just a phone, cause it seems like a phone would make it easier to upload the videos just as good.

Speaker 4:          02:40:59       It's not this, this picture quality's got to be better, but must better. Yeah. Jamie, easier to edit those videos that Tara, it's actually not so easy to get that the video off your iphone. You've got to connect it to your thing and you can just take that card out and plugging in your computer. Oh. It's not like it's super hard, but it's a little bit easier to deal with those. Okay. I see what you're saying. Okay. Well, you know, I would think that just having a phone, it's easy. I always have a phone. You're right. But I think this picture is better. Yeah. Oh, I'm sure it's better. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean that thing sticks out. That sticks out the, the, the lens sticks out. It's, yeah, that's real. It's real. It's a real shit.
