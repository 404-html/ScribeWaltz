Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Four, three, two, one. Yes. Mick West. We are alive finally. Are you ready? I am ready. Let's do it. Until you're getting a lot of heat online from all these. It's all the flat earth people and the chem trail people. Those are the people that are mad at you the most. That's my specialty. Chem trails and flutter. Yeah. Well that's. I ask people. This is hilarious. I asked people online, I said, I'm mick west from Medibank is going to be here. What would you like me to debunk? And one of the first ones was chem trails because you cannot debunk it. It's real Dun Dun, Duh. I would do. I would say this to anybody who thinks that that has got to be the most ineffective government program of all time. Like he asked people what they're doing things in the sky and the number one thing they'll say is like weather control.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Weather controls one. Well they don't have any fucking control of the weather because if they did they'd make it rain all over Santa Barbara and stop these fires. Yeah, I mean there's hundreds of millions of dollars where the damage going on right now, there's a fire that's bigger than the city of Washington DC. They think they're making those bias. I think that that's part of the conspiracy. Anything that happens is. Oh, as part of the conspiracy, what do you think it is? Like what is, what is it with conspiracies, like what, why are they so attractive to people? There's something going on with people, right? Yeah. I think, yeah, I've been looking into this a lot and you have, especially since you're a government show. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       I'm doing research with a book on writing called escaping the rabbit hole and it's about how people get into the rabbit hole and how people get out of the rabbit hole. So the whole thing is about the rabbit hole, which is something basically people get sucked into and I think people do a lot of research into the reasons behind people getting into conspiracy theories like the psychological reasons and they uh, uh, personality reasons and things like that. But I think most conspiracy theorists are just regular people. They're just ordinary people who get sucked into something. And why do you think that is? Just from talking to them, they tell me like the origin stories, the origin stories essentially, and they tell me what happened to them when they got into conspiracy theories and it nearly always starts with looking at some video. I now nowadays with them looking at some video and then they just get sucked in. Yeah. And then they start looking at another video and another video and another video and facebook and youtube is feeding them these videos because once you start going down that road, you just can't, you can't change your trajectory.

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       It's hard to treat in Youtube, uh, since they instigated this, uh, uh, autoplay thing or instituted this autoplay thing or the next video plays immediately and they're all related. I think that's definitely been a thing with people. And also like the suggestions on right hand side if you're watching one video in particular subject. Yeah. Within some experiments with that set up like a completely blank youtube account. And I would just go in there and typing one thing like con trials and of course when you look at trails on youtube, like half the videos, you're going to get it going to be Kentrell videos. And so if the first video you click on is the chem trail video, then that just sets you down that road. Well, I remember this was in the days, I think before youtube, this is in the days when maybe youtube was around, but it just wasn't that popular.

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       I remember me and my friend Eddie, we're high as fuck and we're talking to my neighbor and there was some plane that was flying over and we were wondering why the clouds coming from behind this plane's stood so long. And so I asked him, I said, this neighbor, I used to call them bling, bling, bling, bling was incapable of talk about anything other than objects. Like all we talk about that as a nice car. It's got a new car. Would you get there? Watch. That was blank, blank. All bling bling wanted to talk about is like material possessions. So. So he, he knows were parked uh, in front of his. I was saying hi to them and I said, hey man, do you remember clouds? Look, stick it around and this guy that long. And he was like, um, no, I don't know. Is that a new truck?

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       And like, I just remember how ironic it was because I had told Eddie about blink, blink, you know, this is all this guy cares about and wants to talk about. And then he did that while we're out there. But I remember thinking, man, how weird would it be if all of a sudden clouds from jet engines started appearing and it just appeared right before our eyes and we had noticed it, but I wasn't sold. It didn't make any sense to me because my thought on it was the amount of people that had to be involved. You're talking about all these different airplanes get all these people to keep their mouth shut. These are their pilots, right? So they're not making shit tons of money and they live here too. That's the other thing, like if there's actually spraying something in the sky, they live here too.

Speaker 1:          00:04:57       Like what are they spraying themselves? Well the theory now is the, it's basically the power elite in the country is doing these chem trails as it kinda latched last ditch attempt to maintain power before the entire world collapses into chaos. So they think it's kind of like a desperate situation. A power grab. Exactly. It's, it's the, the hanging on to have that kind of last hurrah. I really, they feel like the end of the world is nigh, like, you know this about to put this environmental disaster and the chem trails. So the only thing that is holding everything together, that's the thing that you get if you go to like, you know, gun geoengineering, watch Dane Wigington Guy, he, he's basically a, an apocalyptic prophet now. He's basically preaching about how everything is going to end soon. And the, the chem trails of the only thing that's stopping it, but also making it worse.

Speaker 1:          00:05:48       So he's kind of saying like, you know, the controls are helping, but we got to stop them. Otherwise, it'll make it even worse, but we're pretty much all going to die either way because a lot of money and we're going to die. There's a lot of people that love that, that that trope is just like something that gets carted out constantly throughout history because it's true. You are going to die. It's like, when are you going to die? You don't know. So because you don't know. You're freaking out. Like, is it going to be a car accident? Is he going to be a fire? Is going to be an earthquake, is going to be a slow aging death, or is it going to be the chem trails? Yeah. I think that type of thing, like fear of dying is one of those fundamental things that every human is Khalid wide with certain things that they, that happens in the brain without them thinking about and fear of dying and fear of other things, fear of loss, fear of wolves or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:06:37       Something that's hardwired. And that's the type of thing that leads to different types of thinking that, uh, you know, you ended up being a conspiracy theorists in part because your brain is wired that way. You had a great quote about chem trails when we did that television show together. You said Chem trails are like the training wheels for conspiracy theorists because they're like, they're, they're right above your head and you're just like, you see them right there for people. Don't understand why jets produce clouds. Please explain that because it's very simple. It is very simple. A jet engines have water. I have water in their exhaust, it can look at a car on a cold day and you see the exhaust coming out of the tailpipe. You'll see like a cloud condensation sometimes and you'll see some water coming out. And when they, the exact same thing happens with jet engines.

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       Uh, and when that exhaust hits, the colder it condenses, it freezes, it makes a cloud. And Con controls are essentially, clouds are exactly the same basically as a regular service cloud. And it's dependent upon the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. And you can actually monitor it online. NASA actually has a website that will show you, and I believe it's set up for pilots, right? Is that what the air traffic people are actually has a contrail forecasting side isn't really for pilots or anything. It's just part of the country research. Uh, but yeah, they have a site where it will predict like, well controls. They're going to baby. You can do it yourself. You just go to look up the relative humidity at a certain altitude. There's lots of different sites you can go to. I've got a whole bunch of them listed on Medibank and just like the clouds very in the sky, all the amount of moisture various as well, which is one of the reasons why you will see a jet pass through one area and you'll see a contrail.

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       And then it almost looks like they shut the contrail jets off and then you see it pick up maybe a couple hundred yards later. And that's say like a cloud. It's really exactly the same as the cloud. If you look at any picture of a cloudy day and then just remove all the clouds, but they're still there as an invisible clouds. Then when the plane comes along, it's almost like the plane is this magic pen revealing these invisible clouds because all the cloud is a region of the sky where the humidity is above a certain level. So you know, the, the

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       humidity's pretty patchy across the sky cause like there's a cloud here and right next to it there's no cloud. So where the cloud is, it's high humidity where the cloud isn't, is Loki meditate. But if both of those were just lowered like 10 percent, then you get no clouds at all than a plane comes along. She erases the humidity in the cloud area, ended the non-cloud area. But this area, because it was a bit higher, uh, you get a trail forming in this area, getting a trail forming. So it's exactly the same as invisible clouds.

Speaker 3:          00:09:23       Yeah. And for people that are watching it and you're looking up, you think they're spraying something if you're conspiracy minded. And because of a lot of the videos that are out there in particular to that were recommended to me are what in the hell have they sprang? Right. So I got to meet with that guy that made those documentaries and a right away I knew something was wrong. Like he's either on adderall or something. He's just like real, real edgy and speed it up. And just an odd guy, which is like a lot of people that are conspiracy really conspiratorially minded. They seem to be like very. They're nervous and agitated. And, and when we went over like why he thinks one of the things that he was talking about was the soil samples and water samples and that they've detected all this aluminum and barium in water and particularly aluminum.

Speaker 3:          00:10:17       And he's showing me all these results that he had. But even on the very results that he showed me, it said sludge. Like he had sent them out for testing. And I said, well, what did you send in his? He goes, well, I sent some water from these ponds. And I said, but it says sludge on your testing. And he said, nobody was water. I go, okay, but the lab said it sludge. I go, what is sludge? She goes, well, I don't know what sludge is exactly. I go, well, let's look. Sludge is a combination of water and dirt. Okay, so you sent water and dirt. So do you know that aluminum is one of the most common metals on earth. And you could basically scoop up a patch of dirt pretty much anywhere and find a bunch of aluminum in it. It's really, really common in trace amounts.

Speaker 3:          00:11:00       I go, so what you did is you tested dirt and it tested positive for being dirt musically. That's exactly what it is. And the guy was kind of freaking out. I'm like, how did you, how did you not put this together yourself? Like if you're the guy who's making this video and you're trying to find a reason why, you could know some facts that you could throw at people, we could say, hey look, the government is definitely spraying things in the sky. They're spraying them aluminum. Look, we found the aluminum and we founded in the water. It's in your water supply. It's going to get in your body, it's going to poison you. Look, we found in the water, how did it, how the fuck did he not look at it himself is what I was thinking and meet when me and him were having this conversation, I realized like you have these people that go down, they're not open minded in regards to these subjects. They go down a very narrow road and that road is, the government is doing something to me. I need to find

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       out what it is. Yeah. And they're really motivated to actually find evidence. Yes. So that trying to find something and you know, actually trying to find an alternative explanation isn't really that attracted to them. So they find aluminum in the water or in the soil or whatever. And then they glom onto that as being evidence of geoengineering and that's great for them because they can just find loads and loads of samples of soil and that's something that gets repeated online. That very fact over and over again, the aluminum that they found in the water, it's one of the core tenants is like one of the pillars of the chem trail thing. There's a, there's a, there's like four or five different things, like in every conspiracy theory, there are these core beliefs that, uh, the 99 percent of the people who believe in the theory, one core belief is that you work for the government.

Speaker 1:          00:12:39       Yeah. That is a core belief. Make, is a retired video game creator. You could find that out. Made Video Games, right? Tony Hawk. Yeah. Made a shit ton of money and decided to, uh, to debunk dorks. Yeah, I didn't. It didn't start out and I wouldn't refer to them as Dorks, but I'm saying they're dorks. Yeah. Dorks, if they don't believe this is the problem. You're not a Dork. If you fall for something, you're a Dork. If you fall for something, you don't believe the science that shows that it's impossible, but it's not real. But if you were spraying aluminum in the sky, folks, it would look like aluminum. You dummy, it wouldn't look like a cloud. It wouldn't dissipate. It would look like a thin missed essentially. Yeah, and metal is not. It's heavier than fucking air and vapor. It's not. It's not going to just sit up there like that.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       It would. It would be a very different experience. It has slowly settled to the ground and wouldn't look like a cloud and there's no reason to do it. There's no benefit whatsoever. There's no scientific evidence ever uncovered ever that there's any benefit for anybody of sprang aluminum over people. It's just, it's just, it's a waste of aluma thing. Even with the, the whole geoengineering field, there's really no solid evidence that it will work and we don't know what the side effects will be. We don't know how much we're going to. We would need to spray and we don't know, like, uh, you know, if, if you know, when we stopped doing it will bounce back in a terrible way and it'd be a big disaster. Well, that's an interesting thing because one of the reasons why I'm contrary hills are interesting to study is because they actually do have an effect on the temperature of the earth and this is something that we found out after nine slash 11 when September 11th happened in 2001, it was the, the, the big disaster. There was a shutdown on all flights in the United States. And when they did that, the temperature changed. Yeah, because is clouds literally do provide like a cover and it is, it does, do they act as an insulator or an escalator? Uh, they essentially act as an insulator. They block a radiation incoming radiation during the day

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       and they block outgoing radiation at night. But the net effect is that they actually block more outgoing radiation than they do incoming radiation. So if planes didn't fly at night than you would, you would cool the earth down a, you'd have to stop flying quite a bit before nighttime. So if all the flights in the world were between like a 5:00 AM and 5:00 PM local time, then you could actually call the world down by just not having any flights at night because if the night flights that have this really big kind of blanketing effect that stopped being outgoing, radiation. So the night of flights actually heat the world up. Yes they do. They act like a, like a blanket, uh, you know how it's, it's warmer on a well in a cloudy day. Like he doesn't get as cold at night, you know, does it get really cold at night because there's nothing over them. They tend to have any, any cover one. It's one of the reasons, but yeah, they, the controls will actually a warm the planet because the, the amount of outgoing radiation they block is just way high. I just go with the wave lengths and the size of the particles. That one.

Speaker 3:          00:15:56       So that, that's something to be concerned about, that that's something that people are legitimately monitoring. Um, when people need to understand is just because you feel like when you look up in the sky and see this crisscross patterns that they're spraying, you know, one's spraying. This is just a natural reaction to jet engines and condensation in the atmosphere and the heat and the moisture of the jet engine.

Speaker 2:          00:16:19       That's all it is. There it, they are actually talking about a way of using controls for a kind of Geo engineering and this is something that people often get confused about because you see these two words together, controls and engineering and they think, oh, that's chem trails, but what they're trying to do is use air traffic control and computers and weather forecasting to make it so the planes don't fly through the contrail forming areas when they would make controls at night. I'm making. So they do fly route contrary or forming areas what it might make some trials during the day. So this is a conversation they're having or something that's actually being. It's not something that they've actually done something that they can research fairly easily. So if they were considering trying to heat up the atmosphere or heat up the earth at night, they would just fly over these moisture rich areas and if they weren't, they would avoid them.

Speaker 2:          00:17:08       Yeah. The goal obviously is to combat climate change, global warming and cooling down so that a relatively cheap way of doing that to a degree is to have these planes be controlled by computers and it could increase his fuel costs, but the airline by about two or three percent because they had to make very deviations sometimes in height and sometimes indirection, but it could actually have a significant effect on the earth climate if we had the entire world, airline fleets all in this program where they would fly, making controls where they were needed and not making contracts where they were not needed

Speaker 3:          00:17:45       and how exactly they're monitoring the moisture content of the atmosphere. Like what are they to do that satellites.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       Yeah, it's a combination of things. Uh, the, the youth sounding balloons, which are these red weather balloons basically, which got mistaken for Ufo is quite a lot. And they use satellites and they use a planes a sensing the environment when they're flying through it and they use all these inputs and it goes into a big computer model, which basically predicts where the, uh, what the, uh, humidity will be at any particular point is basically a big weather forecast. But the upper atmosphere

Speaker 1:          00:18:16       now jamie, Google Cei a admits Geo engineering because this is one that the cabot trail believers constantly bring up. It was a conversation that I'm some guy in the CIA had at some meeting where they were discussing potential future ways, uh, to use geo engineering. Like, let's play with this. Guys has CIA director, John Brennan,

Speaker 4:          00:18:46       go ahead, often referred to collectively as Geo engineering that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change. One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection or Sai, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat. And much the same way that volcanic eruptions do in Sai program could limit global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the wires that are freaking out.

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       Keep changing back to to youtube glitch. I have to refresh the page and I didn't want to restart. This guy had epilepsy? Yeah, spheric. Eris. Hold on. Go ahead and just take it from where he left it here. What else? What else? He has to say?

Speaker 4:          00:19:33       Injection or s a I. A method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do. An Sai program could limit global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels. This process is also relatively inexpensive. The National Research Research Council estimates that are fully deployed. Sai Program would cost about $10,000,000,000 yearly as promising as it may be moving forward on sai would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community. On the technical side, greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany sai to address other climate change effects such as ocean acidification, because sai alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere on the geopolitical side, their technologies potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition by some nations others might seize on SSI benefits and back away from their commitment to carbon dioxide. And as with other breakthrough technologies, global norms and standards are lacking to guide the deployment and implementation of Sai and otherwise. Cool.

Speaker 2:          00:20:56       We get it. So this guy is talking about an idea of spraying things in the atmosphere to do something. Yeah. He's talking about geoengineering spraying stuff from playing was talking about. He's talking about reflective particles, right? Isn't it? Yeah. The spray sulfur dioxide, which isn't exactly a reflective protocol, but it acts as a nucleus for a parameter. Speyer clouds and things like that. It's basically, like you said, the same thing. A volcano does what a volcano erupt. It spews a whole bunch of sulfur dioxide and various other things into the upper atmosphere and that creates hayes basically, which, which blocks the incoming radiation and cools things down. Every time a big volcano goes off, you see a little dip in the earth's temperature because of this, this blocking effect that and so the theory is that you could do something similar and you could do it by spreading things out of planes, but yeah, he's talking about things that we might do in the future.

Speaker 2:          00:21:56       You see every, every year he uses the future tense, like we could do this in mind. They may do this, the effects might be this, and he's talking about the possible geopolitical impacts of it, which are very significant, like if one country is going to be spraying something that would cause the say the monsoons to double in intensity or to have and intensity in India. That could cause the deaths of millions of people from famine and flooding and this is what people think has happened with the big hurricanes in the United States. They do think that there's no evidence of that actually happening. At the pattern of hurricanes is pretty much the same as it's been for a long time. When you look at the statistical variations, there's, you know, maybe a bit more intense because the oceans are a bit warmer where it's not a, you know, people think that hurricanes have been steered a harp.

Speaker 2:          00:22:51       Yeah, through harp, but that doesn't make any sense, but there is, there are ways that do make sense which are a cloud seeding. Like if you do lots of seeding of the hurricane on one side you could perhaps reduce the amount of humidity and moisture on that side and so it will kind of turn a little bit more and move over to one side. So there are ways that you might work. And they did actually experiment with this. I think back in the seventies or so, there was one experiment where they tried seeding a hurricane, but he ended up going somewhere else other than where the were they intended and it destroyed a whole bunch of houses. The problem with having a video like this is that this guy is admitting that they have looked into potentially spring things. No one has ever denied that. We've been, we've been looking into geo engineering for decades. It's been proposed like in, in, in some sense

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       we're over 100 years, the other since the seventies. The other problem is he cave that. He gave it a initials as a Pi. That's a problem. People love initials. They love it. That's super exciting. Not even really well. Most people use the srm, which is, uh, the solar radiation management. Ah, that's a good one too. Yeah, I saw as a CIA dea. It's okay. Sounds good. That sounds. Sounds more scary than Dziedzic aerosol injection. Um, but they would have to be studies and has to be. There are, there are lots of studies going on right now. There are people are studying geoengineering. There's actually lots of people who specialize in Geo engineering. While I was going to say is studies would have to be available for people to understand, but nobody wants to do that. Nobody wants to go in and you wanted to look up and see the thing behind the jet and go.

Speaker 1:          00:24:38       They started it. They're spraying this patchwork. Look, this haze all over us. Which does happen, you can have a clear sky and you have the right conditions in a bunch of jets fly over and all the sudden it's very hazy. It does, it does. And that's the type of thing that's being reported since the Second World War or even even earlier, either first contract that we're spreading out into clouds. We reported in like the 19 twenties. Yeah, well I took some of these photos and I put them up. I think the last time we had this conversation where you could see them from World War II, you can see these jets and they see the contract falls behind the jets and the. But some people. That's the other thing is con trails, uh, dissipate. But chem trail stay. Well that's not. You misunderstand what happens. The contrail stay. If there's more moisture, the, if the conditions are correct, they stay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:25       And if the conditions are barely enough to make a contrary to dissipate fairly rapidly with that thing, they kind of use circular logic. And if I ask them, why do you think that controls a dissipate in Kentrell stay and say, because I can see it, if you look up, you look at the chem trails and the staging and the country also dissipating because of how do you know which is which? Well, the country also the ones that dissipate. Yeah. So they don't have any basis for that belief. And you know, the one thing I do, which you've probably seen is that video where I go through all my old books on, on the weather and I look up in each one of them, the section on contract and I read the bit in a contrail processed per hour, sometimes control, sometimes spread out to cover the sky contrary last a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:26:08       And I go back from these books from the 1998 all the way back to the 19 fifties. And I've got books in the 19 forties. And if you show people the actual books is a really powerful way of getting through to them because they just assumed that controls campuses. Right? And they've assumed that this is a recent phenomenon because they don't remember it clearly weren't paying attention what the people don't notice them until you're 90 percent of the people don't notice Cantrell's until they hear about the chem trail. Conspiracy theory. A lot of people, they will hear about it. And then the day they will go

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       outside and look at the sky. And then that's the first time that ever notice these controls. Even the people that are like the high ups in the, uh, in the, in the country movement, they only notice them when they hear about the theory. There's a guy, um, I can't remember his name now, but he lived in San Diego and he, he never noticed them until like 2014. And he lived there all his life. And now he's publishing scientific papers. Uh, Jay Marvin Herndon is his name. He's publishing these scientific papers about how the sprain slash like the waste products of burning coal and power stations. The spray that in the upper atmosphere. He's actually got like three or four papers published in these kind of pay to publish a scientific journals. And that's kind of becoming a bit of a problem. I like this, this thing with Brennan, the CIA guy. People bring that up all the time, all the time, all the time. And you just have to explain it to them. Again, I don't know what he's talking about. The future use. And then this guy

Speaker 3:          00:27:43       talking about possible solutions for. For global warming. Yeah. Now the problem with it is when he's talking about possible solutions and then people look up and they see these actual clouds that are created by jets. They assumed this has already begun at the government would not tell us about it because they don't understand the difference between contrary and with this stuff would look like. Yeah. Yeah. And just the fact that contract look like this, they, they heard the contrail shouldn't persist. Well what's another thing that drove me crazy? He's like, if you really want to worry about health consequences of these things that you see in the sky, there's a reality to it. The reality is they're burning jet fuel and all the people that live around the airports get sick. Like it's. There's, there's high levels of respiratory illness that are associated with living within a certain distance of airplanes or airports. If you're in a congested hub like lax, don't buy a house like a block away. It's not good for your health. They're burning jet fuel that's going to get in the air pollution pollution from cars. Yeah, it's even more intense because you're having thousands and thousands of giant planes.

Speaker 2:          00:28:56       [inaudible] even less smoke Santa Monica, they have problems with that. If you look at the houses just at the end of Santa Monica runway, which is right next to the end of the runway disease houses that did tests with various metal particulars and stuff and the ones right by the end of the runway, you know, they get to get pollution.

Speaker 3:          00:29:14       Of course. It's very real problems. That's the real problem. Yeah, and that's a real one. Now imagine if that was something that the government was engineering, that they really were engineering spraying things to give people respiratory illness so that the hospital industry could profit and whatever the reason was. Right. That would be, you know, something that people could be concerned with. Like, look, there's a real connection between airplanes and illnesses, but it's not spraying in the Scott, that's not real. I understand people love these things and I understand people don't trust the government. Those things completely make sense to me, but you got to pay attention to what's real and what's not real, because as soon as you don't do that, then all the real stuff that the government does, all the real stuff. The government does like these fucking roads they're going to build in Alaska right now through dangerous areas where, where they have a salmon rivers where they're gonna they're gonna start doing mining. I think. What is the Pebble Beach? Is that the. No, what is the, uh, the, the big mining issue in Alaska that is going on right now.

Speaker 2:          00:30:19       Bristol Bay. Bristol Bay. That's it. Why don't I

Speaker 3:          00:30:23       pebble in Bristol? I don't know how I got those two confused pebble mine. And that's what it is. And they want, they want to do this and it's near a major salmon area or these salmon river and they're people that live. They're terrified that they're going to do this. This is a real for profit thing where they're putting the environment at risk that's real, so this is something that people should be concerned about, but they're not. They don't get concerned about those kinds of things. You know, environmentalists do and you know, big conservationist do, but the conspiracy theorists don't. They don't look at that and go, hey, here's clear evidence of the government being in bed with enormous businesses that stand a profit, spectacular amounts of money from risking the environment and risking these very delicate salmon fisheries.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       Yeah. That type of thing is the exact reason why I still spend so much time debunking stuff like conspiracy theories because I think that so much a of conspiracy theories, the results of the effect of conspiracy theories is distracting people from real issues. Some real issue. Yes. I agree. Like if you, like you say, with the, the airplane stuff, like if people are thinking that spraying chemicals out of the bed to the back of the airplanes, they're just not gonna be worried about a regular pollution and if they think that the controlling the climate already, they're not going to worry about any type of global warming.

Speaker 3:          00:31:47       So let's find a one that we disagree on. I think you believe the official story of the JFK assassination. Do you more or less. Yeah, more or less. My belief in this is this changes over time. I think that Lee Harvey Oswald was in on it. I think he was a part of it, but I think there were multiple people that were in on it. That's what I believe. Do you think the multiple shooters? Yes. And one of the reasons why I believe that is because of the formation of the single bullet theory in the single bullet theory was formed because the fact that they had to account for one bullet that hit the underpass ricocheted off and put some man in the hospital. Um, and that before that they did not have an explanation for why all of these bullets bullet holes, all these wounds were in all these different people's bodies.

Speaker 3:          00:32:35       The other reason why I'm inclined to believe there's a conspiracy was the fact that they found that bullet on Connolly's Gurney when they brought him into the hospital. It's too convenient. And the bullet itself is fairly pristine. Now, knowing as much as I know about bullets from personal experience of hunting, you can hit anything with the boy. I pulled a lot of bullets out of animals. When you shoot an animal and you hit bone, those bullets, they distort brutally. I mean, they don't look like that. And if they go through to people and hit all sorts of bone, that's the bullet that came out of Connolly's body or connolly's Gurney, excuse me. And that's the bullet that they are attributing to this, a single bullet theory. Uh, if you look at the path of the bullet that goes through connolly or goes through Kennedy and then goes through connelly, that to me is, is not unbelievable. It's not unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       That one is, hey, you've got to look at the other one,

Speaker 3:          00:33:28       but even that one, but no, no. See what I'm saying. Even that one is not unbelievable. It is believable to me because I know that bullets do strange things when they hit things

Speaker 2:          00:33:37       right. But you've got to combine that with the fact that the bullet came out fairly pristine, which meant it didn't actually go through a kind of a bouncy path like that. It went through a straight path. This diagram is from a conspiracy theorist, but essentially, yes. But the thing of the diagrams that will show the actual path with him, like, you know, they've got them the butts that are on the same level and you know that Kennedy was actually sitting here was ella bullied? Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:34:00       So, um, see if we can find one that has the actual seating arrangement or more accurate seating. They will. They will one right there with the red line and the right hand side. The one the right hand side. That's a more accurate. I'm from above. From above, yeah. There's, there's also the fact that there was particles, there was more metallic particles from the bullets, more fragments from the bullet in Conley's body. Then we're missing from the bullet. I do not believe that was the bullet and I think that that is a very reasonable assumption.

Speaker 2:          00:34:32       Well, you know what you should do. You should get one of those guns. Get the same bullets. Okay. Some ballistic dummies, which some bones inside and start shooting. They've already done that. Yeah. The Penn and teller did that. Yeah. Some people have done it and they have found pretty close to what actually happened. No, they did within within the ground.

Speaker 3:          00:34:48       No, no, no. Every bullet that hit bone got distorted. That's just what happens. The you shoot those bullets into water or you shoot those bullets into like fluff or something like that. That doesn't have a lot of impact to slow the bullet down or then you get a bullet that looks like that. If you shoot a bullet into bone, they distort wildly where the bone was. The last thing that it hit, but it doesn't matter. It's still hitting bone, but he stopped at that point. Yeah, but I mean, didn't it hit bone and in Kennedy's body as well?

Speaker 2:          00:35:15       Hm. Went through his neck.

Speaker 3:          00:35:19       The odds of it hitting only soft tissue and it's going to go through his neck and it came out here that didn't clip one of his vertebrae or something like that. I don't think that's real. I think also there's a difference between, and this is fact from David Lifton's book best evidence, which was a book by a, an accountant to win over, um, the Warren Commission report and fennel is factual inaccuracies and all these contradictions. He found that there was a difference in the autopsy report at Bethesda, Maryland, the to naval hospital versus the, the show what they had reported on the scene in Dallas. The first doctors that got ahold of Kennedy's body in Dallas before they flew him to Bethesda, said that the hole in his neck was an entry wound. When they got to Maryland, they changed that to a tracheotomy whole. They changed the impact and they said that it was a. They said that this was not an impact from a bullet, that it was from something else.

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       Yeah. Someone said they enlarge the hole. Insert a trick tube.

Speaker 3:          00:36:26       Yeah. Well, I think. Well, uh, there was, uh, there was also a lot of pressure on these people to try to wrap this up nice and tight and say that Lee Harvey Oswald was the shooter.

Speaker 2:          00:36:36       There was. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. There's this big thing about the CIA, the CIA inventing the FBI. The FBI will inventing the term conspiracy theory. He was a CIA thing. I think it was A. Yeah. And this was a couple of years after the assassination. They, uh, there was a memo that went out were they were concerned about all these conspiracy theories that were coming out and they used it to them conspiracy theories and then they, they said they should try to, uh, basically debunk them and make the people who, uh, spread them around look like a conspiracy theorist. But basically the theory is that the term conspiracy theory came from that particular memo, that memo that never actually encouraged people to use the term. Uh, but yeah, there was a huge concern from the CIA that they would be, they would lose the trust of the public if people, everybody started believing that it was a conspiracy theory. At least that's what they said. I mean maybe there is a conspiracy and maybe they are just trying to cover it up. But

Speaker 3:          00:37:38       did you see the most recent dump of information on the Kennedy assassination that Jack Ruby had stated to people that before the day of the Kennedy assassination, keep an eye out today that's going to be fireworks. I didn't say that. Yeah, those Jack Ruby who eventually wound up shooting Lee Harvey Oswald in front of the police officer.

Speaker 2:          00:37:57       Yeah, something like that. You know, his dad obviously. So you couldn't ask him what he actually meant and things like that take on a special significance after an event. True. Whereas it could be just talking about it, like he was going to go visit his ex wife or something or it was going to go to the bar or he was looking forward to shouting at the parade or whatever. Could have been nothing but people say things and you know, after something happens people go back and they look at everything that happened and then they say, well that sounds like something significant. Like with the Vegas shooting, uh, there was a woman walking around the crowd in the Vegas shooting saying, yeah, you're all going to die. Basically what some people said, and this was like half an hour before the actual shooting itself. So people take that event and then since a lot of people did die, they think that this woman actually knew what was going to happen and she was trying to warn people. Right. But you also get crazy people wandering around saying things all the time, you know, especially in Vegas.

Speaker 3:          00:38:56       Yeah. And the problem with you're all going to die is that, that's a common one. Some guy was yelling that we took pictures of them when we're in vegas long before the shooting. It was a few months ago we were standing. No, we were in a car and he was standing on the corner and he had a stack of signs. I put it up on my instagram. I know I did because there was many, there was stacks of signs. He had not just one sign. We had like a long totem pole of signs with all these different things and I was taking photos of it and the guy was yelling out, everyone's going to die. I mean he was yelling it out that you know God's wrath and all this crazy religious stuff. That's a common thing for crazy people to shout. Yes. What they do show. It's not like this woman was saying specifically someone is going to shoot everyone at this concert, get out of here.

Speaker 3:          00:39:44       This is a dangerous area. If she was trying to warn them, she would have been a bit more specific. Yes, very specific. Right. If she knew something, do you see? Do you find it? No, I know I put it up there because we were mocking it. Maybe I'll put it on my instagram story and it went away. I don't think so though. I think it's, it's there from. I want to say, I want to say it was at least six months ago, but we were mocking this guy because this guy got a lot of fucking signs, like one signs on enough. I go is this is the guy, this is the reason why twitter only has 140 characters. Motherfuckers like this. I, I remember is like July because there's like 120 degrees out too, wasn't it? Yes. It was a very hot. This goofy ass hole had this giant stack of science. Um, so the, the back to the Kennedy thing, what do you think happened? Do you think that Lee Harvey Oswald probably acted alone?

Speaker 2:          00:40:29       I think he probably acted alone. I think the physics of what happened like is fairly consistent with the single shooter theory. Now admittedly the magic bullet is a bit strange, but I don't think it was after the rounds of possibilities a

Speaker 3:          00:40:46       do because of the fact the metal particles. There's more bullet fragments in Connolly's body. Then we're missing from that almost pristine bullet. And even though the fact that it hit connolly at the very end, if it went through all that flesh and it didn't hit any bone until it hit his wrist, then it would not have been compromised very much ballistically. It would still be going incredibly fast. It still would have smashed into that bone. It did enough to break his wrist and it would have distorted the bullet. That's just what happens with bullets.

Speaker 2:          00:41:16       See, unfortunately, I didn't really follow JFK conspiracy very much. And the reason I don't is that there are already, like I think literally over a thousand

Speaker 3:          00:41:26       [inaudible] I've read. I've read a few, um, I got into case closed. That was a Vincent Bugliosi book. Is that who it was? But I was like, this guy's got an agenda. It just didn't, it. There's, there's many books that you could read about the Kennedy assassination and some of them favor the conspiracy and some of them favor the assassination. I think they have a lot of them have merit on both sides. One thing that drives me crazy when people say that, you could never make that shot, that's fucking bullshit. That's bullshit. This is why I know it's bullshit because it was only like a couple hundred yards, like a couple hundred yards shooting it something the size. A person's head is easy. What about Jesse Ventura trying to do the a three, three shots against shots. Stuff. He didn't know what he's doing, but I mean first of all, you would if you were used to that rifle and you practice that, someone said, oh, the scope was off.

Speaker 3:          00:42:21       I think that's bullshit too. The reason why I think that's bullshit is because it's easy. Naca scope off. You have to have a direct chain of evidence between the time Lee Harvey Oswald had that scope shooting that rifle. The moment he shot that rifle and then you have to hand it off to someone who checks the scope. Right? Then because if you drop a rifle, the scope goes off. Just drop it. I've done that before. I dropped a rifle once when I was hunting in Wisconsin and my scope was off by six inches at 100 yards. Just dropping it. So the idea that he could have never made that shot because the scope is off. Scopes get adjusted. That's what happens when you drop a scope, they move. That's a whole thing about ballistics. You have to check them. You go to the range, you set up a a lead sled, you lay the other rifle down so it's perfectly stable.

Speaker 3:          00:43:07       You squeeze off a shot, you use the binoculars, you find out where the the shot hit on the target, and then you adjust the scope. They're adjustable. So the idea that his scope was no good, it's crazy. The idea that that shot was too far to make insane. It was only, I think it was less than a hundred yards when they think he made the first shot, which is a chip shot. That's the shot that you would make without even arrest. Now he's making this shot resting on the window, so he's perfectly steady. The idea that that was impossible as crazy. The idea that no one can do that in three shots, that's been disproven. Someone can do it. Someone who's really good at reloading and loading can do it just because Jesse Ventura couldn't do it, but Jesse super conspiracy mind is like, he goes all in with the conspiracy theorist, the motivated reasoning part of doing it just for a show or because he really believes it.

Speaker 3:          00:43:56       I worked with the same people that did his show, the same people that did his show. The reason why I did Joe Rogan questions, everything is they wanted me to take over Jesse show after it was done and I was uninterested. I was like, I'm not going. I'm not that guy. I'm not like the. I believe every conspiracy guy. I go, I think there's people. I think people have a real weird vested interest in proving that things are conspiracy. I'm interested in finding out what things really are like legitimately what they really are. Yeah, and even if I'm wrong, like I'm. I have. I'm not interested in reinforcing things. I've already said if I find out that what I said was wrong, I'm interested in repeating that I was wrong as many times as they can to get it out to as many people as I can. Yeah, I'm with you because I think it's important. So this, this JFK thing, there's bullshit on both sides of it, but the idea that this guy who went over to Russia, married a Russian citizen, came back here, was it mean he was absolutely involved in some shady, weird shit with Cuba. He's a fucking weird guy. Harvey Oswald was a weird guy. The idea that he was completely innocent. I'm not buying that either.

Speaker 2:          00:45:01       I don't know. By the idea that it's proven that he acted entirely alone. It's entirely possible that the other people who were helping him or motivating him or giving him an instructions even. Yeah. The thing I don't think has really proven is the additional shooter theory.

Speaker 3:          00:45:18       It's not proven and there have been people that said they heard things from behind them. The problem with that is chaos. When you have gun shots, first of all, gunshots in an area where dealey plaza, the echos, echos, ring out and people claim to see things and hear things they even believed themselves. Have you tell someone that you heard something in the bushes and then you run away. That person will say, I heard something in the bushes and then other people were repeated. It becomes the narrative and it just gets real hard. Create memories for you can you can.

Speaker 2:          00:45:51       You're going to point to somebody and say, there is somebody there and they'll think that was somebody that I liked it because they. Yeah, the brain is so chaotically working form was memories in a very weird.

Speaker 3:          00:46:01       Especially when it comes to something that's so significant like the president getting shot or any sort of violent thing of this is something that gets repeated ad nauseum about nine slash 11. It's something that people point to where they think that when the planes hit those buildings that there was detonations that caused tower one tower two to fall. There's no way they would've fallen like that. Like when people say no, they heard things in the buildings, they heard explosions. People always say shit like that. And on top of that, if you're dealing with a building collapsing like that, you're gonna hear a lot of crazy shit.

Speaker 2:          00:46:34       Yeah, yeah. You gotta that all going to be explosions, things, things are falling. You know, there were people falling off the buildings which goes to to

Speaker 3:          00:46:42       tower seven. That's another one that keeps coming up the see if you can find the video. Jamie, there's a video that shows what really happened in tower seven. There's a guy who was a conspiracy guy. He was really deep into conspiracies and then the more he started looking into tower seven, the more he realized that everyone is just showing the very final video where tower seven collapses, like a controlled demolition and it looks exactly like a controlled demolition. However, if you find the full video, you see that the interior had collapsed moments before, like quite a bit before Edward Current. I think the video, that's exactly who it is. See if you can find that gentleman's video, but he shows how the top of it, you could see the of tower seven given which is consistent with this idea that the diesel fuel that they had in the basement had created, wasn't a diesel tank.

Speaker 2:          00:47:39       Yeah, that was an early theory at the diesel fuel, uh, that, that was actually fueling the fire. But they never found any evidence that actually the diesel fuel contribution to the fires, it was just a regular office buyers, which is what everybody finds those associates.

Speaker 3:          00:47:54       Diesel never caught fire. They might've been after the collapse.

Speaker 2:          00:47:59       Uh, I think they're recovered one of the tanks with some days I'll still in it. So,

Speaker 3:          00:48:03       um, series of diesel likely fed by a series of diesel generators located in the lower floors, which is where most of the fires were concentrated. So at least one of the diesel tower, a diesel tanks didn't light up. Is that what you're saying? The, the theory, this theory is that the diesel had nothing to do with it. Okay. So nist, which, uh, if you are a conspiracy theory person, they get really angry when you bring up. Is that the government, the government man? Um, so I think this is an older video. Yeah. This isn't the video, Jim. There's one by Edwidge current. Yeah. And what it does is it shows the top of the building cave in first quite a bit before the rest of the building. So this idea that it all cave in like a controlled demolition because they detonated all those things. So Do, do, do, do, do. Is that Edward Current? I've got to find a good spot of the video to show it. So. Okay. Yeah. So what happened, what they think was that the fire, this is shitty design of a building and the fire caused internal damage to all of the floors.

Speaker 2:          00:49:13       Well, you see that, uh, the World Trade Center fell basically against the side of a, of seven. Yeah. It was back of the building was all kind of like all the windows were broken on the backside. There was one column in the middle of the back that was missing in a big chunk of the, uh, lower west side was going to gouge it out. Right. So this idea that it was just a fire. Yeah. It wasn't justified. Yeah. The fire is what triggered the collapse eventually. But the fact that all the windows were missing from the south side contributed a lot to that because you've got a lot of wind flow through.

Speaker 3:          00:49:49       See if he's got the. I Dunno mate, maybe this is a bad thing to do while you're actually doing the show. So this is what the idea is, the Nis computer models that all these floors had collapsed inside. Outside collapsed too. Yeah. But what this guy, Edward current had showed in his video, I think it was him, was he showed that the top part that past. Yeah, the top penthouse had collapsed first. There it is. CVC, the pen house collapsing. See is sinking it up. But with the two, the two videos, the simulation. So it's sitting up there and then boom, you see it collapsed and so the windows breaking down. Exactly. And that's that. No one ever shows

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       and then it gives in, right, so this is not a quick thing like a controlled demolition. All those windows giving in is indicative of all those floors collapsing probably more than it is the idea of the, you know, the people that want to see conspiracy, think that those bombs were going off there and that as those definitions or explosions were going off that that's what caused all those floors to collapse on top of each other. And I think that's what's talking about what the core beliefs of the conspiracy theories with nine slash 11. This, this back, that world trade center seven looks like a controlled demolition is core belief, but when you actually get into something and describe what's actually happening, you have to go through a much more complicated conspiracy theory at a much more complicated way of looking at what actually happened and now they're trying to do a complicated study of World Trade Center seven at the University of Alaska.

Speaker 1:          00:51:22       This is something paid for by architects and engineers when nine slash 11 truth that trying to actually figure out how they can reconcile controlled demolition with the fact that it collapsed the way it did, so they're trying to actually explain something which doesn't really need to explain to him because the explanation has been done by nist already. So what they're trying to do is find something that reinforces their initial idea instead of it just look at the facts itself saying, Oh, you look at the top of the penthouse collapsing. That's not indicative of a controlled demolition. That's indicative of the model that Nis described, which is a slow burn inside. Extremely hot deterioration of all the internal structure. Everything starts to collapse inside. And then the outside Clabsi to. Well, some of them will say that that is actually how controlled demolitions are done. You blow up the interior of the building first and then you blow the exterior of the building.

Speaker 1:          00:52:13       Uh, but the problem is that none of the exterior columns were cut. There was no explosion scene on the exterior columns. If you look at the World Trade Center, one or two coming down, yeah, you can kind of imagine their explosions going all the way down because of those things that looked like explosions from the folding floors, but in seven you just see the building kind of just going to crumble down. So they have to kind of explain that. So they come up with this study that they funded. It's custom, nearly $400,000, uh, and they're trying to come up with an explanation that doesn't involve fire a, so that saying like if, if it was controlled demolition than the way they would have done it is blowing up these interior columns a and it would have pulled in the exterior and collapsed the way we see in the video.

Speaker 1:          00:52:57       And I think that the, some of them say that the penthouse thing was a separate thing because they wanted to have a neat demolition. So they first of all blew up a few floors just underneath the penthouse. So neagley collapsed inside the building and then they blew up some floors at the bottom. So he's all fell in itself without damaging the surrounding buildings. So they've got this complex theory and it's based on confirmation bias. It's based on confirming this idea that this is a controlled demolition, not on examining the whole thing as it and going, okay,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       is it possible that the model is correct and that these. Look, the thing that I bring up to people all the time when they want to talk about conspiracies, there is a real conspiracy nine slash 11 and that's the fact that it happened. The fact that they did fly planes into buildings, that's a conspiracy and they pulled it off. That actually did happen. People don't want that to be it. They want it to be a much broader conspiracy involving world governments that are trying to close in on, you know, all our rights and this is the way to do it. And

Speaker 2:          00:53:57       Yeah, his proportionality, people want something to be in proportion to the size of the event when they think just like a bunch of Arabs with knives isn't a big enough cause. So they think that it has to be something. We have more significant end, even like with the physics of it, they think he have the plane flew into the building and it didn't collapse. So why would it, why would it collapse? Some of them, some people don't think that, uh, the plane we even have in the hall, they think it would have been bounced off or who the fluxing said, oh, some of them think that the, the tower would have knocked over. Really? Yeah. But these are people who have really no conception whatsoever, a physics and there's a minority of people, but you'll find people who, who don't understand how aluminum can cut through steel, you know, the columns of the exterior of the World Trade Center were made of steel, very strong steel and planes are made of mostly aluminum.

Speaker 2:          00:54:51       So they don't understand how a plane made of aluminum, which is soft, can go through steel, which is very hard and strong. And the example I always give to them is the ping pong ball going through a ping pong paddle. If you make it go fast enough. This is something I think mythbusters do and various other people have done. Uh, you, you send a regular ping pong ball a 500 miles an hour into a ping pong paddle and it just goes straight through. It leaves a ping pong ball hole in the middle of it and that's just what happened on nine slash 11. The planes were going 500 miles an hour. So you could do that with a ping pong ball. You can.

Speaker 3:          00:55:26       Wow, that makes sense. It's just, well, for the planes to the, the amount of mass you're dealing with two in the speed from 500 miles an hour.

Speaker 2:          00:55:34       Yeah. And then you don't need to be, it doesn't even need to be relatively that much mass. A ping pong ball, it weighs one gram and a paddle weighs like 200 grams or something. So. And you wouldn't think you've seen it. You've seen ping pong paddles that is laminated wood and rubber and you've got this flimsy little bowl is how on earth is that going to go through? That switch is unintuitive, right? So you can understand how people would be confused about why the planes left these little road runner

Speaker 3:          00:56:04       civic and find that you had the mythbusters thing. I want to see that. I hear it is. Wow. That was a whole. So they have some crazy air cannon. Yup. Blows off. Okay. Here's the problem with that though. Here's the problem with that. They're doing that right in front. I

Speaker 2:          00:56:18       have that they have to do with the pink phone bulk because it will slow down, but I understand. But you're also with the

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       actual air. Yeah, right. It's the. But it is the ping pong table. We can see it in slow motion. Yeah. Because what I was going to bring up was a guy killed himself once accidentally on a movie set because he took an unloaded gun and he shot it into his temple and it blew his brains out. Yeah. It was blank, but the fact that it was a blank didn't stop that air from blowing through. There is a thing that people do when they hunt in Alaska and in an incredibly moist climates and places where there's a lot of dirt and debris, they will put tape over the top of the rifle over the end of the barrel where the bullet comes over or they even use a condom and it has no effect whatsoever on the accuracy of the bullet because the air coming out of the rifle barrel from the explosion blows that tape out before the bill.

Speaker 1:          00:57:18       It even gets to it. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, the only reason they have to have the thing right at the end of the barrel, uh, is the painful bowl, but slow down in the say satellites. If you felt something a little bit heavier but still pretty small, it will go through it. Yeah. No, that makes sense. And you think you've got to scale it up like, you know, imagine like a beer barrel, uh, made a steel or aluminum weighs like 100 pounds or whatever. What is full? And he imagined that slamming into something. If I have a ping pong ball can do something at 500 miles an hour, uh, be a barrel at five miles an hour. I couldn't do it. An awful amount of damage, probably go right through a building. Yeah. And then you scale up from like a beer barrel to a 200 ton plane.

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       Yeah. And 200 tons hitting something at 500 miles an hour. It doesn't matter that it's, you know, it's made out of aluminum. It's still 200 tons of something. If it was just a big bag of water hitting something at 500 miles an hour, it would still make a hole in the side of the building. I think this is a problem with a lot of these theories is that a lot of the people that are involved in these theories are either not educated in what they're talking about because there are some various nuances to things like this ping pong ball trick or they don't. They don't want to be like, they don't want to look at anything that takes away from this conspiracy. They don't want to look at anything that debunks or disproves. They just want confirmation of their initial idea that this is some big grand conspiracy that someone is in on it and it's happening right before our eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:58:53       Yeah. Yeah. It's quite hard to even get one point past a lot of people. If someone starts out with that, that theory, that aluminum cannot cut steel, then that just becomes the gatekeeping obstacle that you have to get past. If you can't disprove that one thing, it does. Nothing else matters really for them because the, you know, the plane couldn't have entered the building. Therefore everything is a conspiracy. So you, you, you kind of have to address these. Yeah, you have to. In some, it's important for people before they decide that this is, you know, that the government spray and things in the sky or that the world is flat or whatever, whatever these things are. It's important to look at all the evidence. These youtube videos, one of the real problems with them is that they get to play out without being interrupted. Much like a podcast on unfortunately, but they get to have these grand statements without anyone who's an expert stepping in and stopping them and saying, well, that's not true and here's why it's not true and here's why.

Speaker 1:          00:59:53       He can prove that it's not true, which would just derail most of these conspiracy theories really quickly. Yeah. And that's kind of the brainwash aspects of these videos. People, uh, people watch these three hour videos. Kind of surprised me a first and I was surprised that people would listen to a three hour podcast, but, you know, once you get going in something, you know, the first time I was on your podcast, eight at the time went by light line, nothing. And if you're into something and you get sucked into it and you, you've got this really interesting theory and it's like all these revelations like, oh my God, I'm getting the, the real skinny on the world. Uh, yeah, you, you just, you, you just get sucked in. And then when it's finished, you on kind of a dopamine high and you want to do more and you also feel like you're in on something that people don't know and you want to tell them about it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       Oh yeah. And I've been there. I've been there. I've always tell people the dumbest one ever believed in was a stupid tubes that fly through the air. Rogers or. Yeah, I was hook, line and sinker. I would go outside and I would try to find those things streaking across the sky. Um, what it was was that there was a video that was made called Roswell rods and it was trying to say that there was these bugs, like things that look like jellyfish, that we're flying through the air so fast. The naked eye couldn't see them, but they were catching on video cameras. And then finally someone figured it out that what it really was was you could have an hd camera right next to a standard definition camera and the standard see those things flying across the sky. It's just a video artifact. When the camera cannot pick up those, those bugs, it elongates them. And streaks them across the camera. Motion Blur, motion blur. And this guy, this guy came to one of my, uh, UFC q and a's once and he waited in line and he yelled out, you're wrong about the rods. The rods are real. I can prove it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:52       Silly Fella. But these, that was a monster quest at proven that on television they'd set up two cameras. Yeah. It's so hard when it's actually been proven and you've got this conclusive proof and yet there are still loads and loads of people who believe in enrolled doesn't look how it looks, how he was describing that. It looks like some kind of alien jellyfish that's so fast. It flies through the air faster. You can see. Yeah. I mean the problem is these guys have

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       a vested interest in it. Being real is motivated and not necessarily by money. They just motivated because once they believe something, they feel like that privy to this special knowledge, it's just going to be such a letdown if they're wrong. I think it's that end money man. He sold. He sold a bunch of videos. I bought them. I bought two of those bitches. Oh, I always try to start out with the assumption that people are not, you know, they're basically good people. They're not trying to make money. Right. Well, I think they also get caught up in the business of whatever it is. If you're in the UFO business and then someone comes along and shuts down your business, you're going to try to. Well, let me sort of. They're not going to look at it objectively. They're gonna go, I want to keep my business alive.

Speaker 2:          01:03:01       I want to protect my business. Yes. Yeah. Almost like a architects and engineers when nine slash 11 truth there, they're like a half million dollar a year business. Uh, they taking between 400 and $800,000 a year and the precedent of the, the architects and engineers as he gets paid a salary of $85,000 a year and he gets these expenses paid. Now that doesn't mean that he doesn't believe in what he's doing. He, I'm sure studied how it is like a hardcore believer in nine slash 11 truth. But over the last 10 years, this has become his life and his livelihood. So even if he really believes it, he still has this additional level of motivation to not disprove things. How many people are in architects and engineers for nine slash 11? Truth really depends how you count it. Like they, uh, they say they have like thousands of architects and engineers actually signing the petition.

Speaker 2:          01:03:57       I think they have like a, maybe a few hundred working structural engineers. Uh, what do you think of their take on it? That take is kind of like the standard of a nine slash 11 truth. They think that it's a controlled demolition and I think they have all this evidence. We controlled demolition, but it's not very good. Evidence is, uh, one of the experts is a, a high school physics teacher and you know, he's already fairly good at high school physics, but he just makes them very simple mistakes about physics, uh, of the, the folding towers. And they repeat this on their website, unquestioningly. Uh, there's another guy who's like the expert on the Nano thermite residue that was found, you know, they think that these reading grade specs of what looks like a paint and rust was actually a nano thermite, uh, since he's now like an expert on their site, he gets to say whatever he likes and he's got this one theory about how the bits of steel that flew out of the building had these, none of them like rockets attached to them, which is why they were leaving these trails of smoke behind when they fell down.

Speaker 2:          01:05:12       And these are things that are just pretty ridiculous and you can kind of debunk them with physics, but they'll have none of it because they've got the experts saying something and you can't, uh, you can't deny the fact that you can't deny that you can't to debunk their experts because the experts, you know, where, where would you knew more about a high school physics teacher about physics? Where would you know more about nano to them? Then this guy who was an expert in Nano third, right? So that they've got all these supposed expertise, making these mistakes, about nine slash 11, like the, the, the, the president has this ridiculous demonstration that he does where he holds up to cardboard boxes and underneath one of them is empty space underneath the other one there's a, there's a tower, a drops them and the this one falls to the ground and this one bounces off the cardboard box and is basically saying this is what should have happened. This upper portion should have stopped on the way down and it's using these cardboard boxes and as a demonstration. But the ridiculous oversimplifications of what actually happened.

Speaker 3:          01:06:16       Yeah. I don't know too much about the engineer's take on things, you know, from architects and engineers. I really didn't bother getting into it too much, but I just do know that it's several hundred people if not over a thousand and they're all over the world. But how many people have studied it that disagree with them? Like how many and how good are the artists that are in our. I mean there's a lot of architects and a lot of engineers

Speaker 2:          01:06:46       world. Yeah. That they recently tried to get a motion passed at the American Institute of Architects, uh, which was basically a reopen a world trade center seven and they went to the convention and they stood up and they gave speeches and okay, the, all the evidence, uh, about why will the building seven investigation to been reopened and they took a vote and I think it was about something like 97 to three present against doing this. So all of the architects who are actually there, these professional architects, 97 percent, I can't remember the exact figures, but it's around that voted against this. So even though, yeah, even though there are thousands of signatures to the, a nine slash 11 petition who are actually architects, when you actually look at the actual millions of architects that are out there in the world is a very small fraction of that. Right? But how many of those millions of studied it.

Speaker 3:          01:07:45       I would like to see someone who's like a real legitimate top of the food chain architect from the deep debunking side view it from someone who

Speaker 2:          01:07:55       is absolutely considered people. Lots of people have done various studies on nine slash 11, the collapse of the building. There was a book by a guy from London, I think he's cool thing through a Chinese guy from London who wrote a book on a progressive collapses in large, came out last year, Twenty Sixteen, and it discusses why buildings seven collapsed, why the World Trade Center towers collapsed amongst a whole bunch of other buildings. Why we are the collapse, so it didn't. So there are lots of people who do actually study it and within a nine slash 11 architects and engineers when nine slash 11, they vast majority of them have not studied it. If you look at their position statements, if you look, they asked everybody who joins it writes a little statement which goes on the website. They'll say things like, I watched loose change and that my eyes, oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:08:49       It looked weird to me. That's like the real common thing. You know that when I saw the towers fall, I knew it wasn't. Know the. It wasn't very. It wasn't a a regular collapsed. It looked weird to me is my favorite one. It didn't. But it did look weird. It looks weird to me. Says, yeah. Then an architect saying it looked weird to them, hey, look what to everybody, and no one has seen anything like that before. It was unprecedented. You have the Saturn five rocket taking off. It looks weird because it hadn't happened before. Yeah. There's a lot of things that look weird. What other things do you think that you and I disagree on A. I think maybe the morgellons are more jealous thing. Oh, you are more prone to think that is a real thing because you went to the morgellons conference. Not that it's

Speaker 3:          01:09:39       thing that there's real fibers growing out of people, but that there's neurotoxic. This is what I got from a doctor. The doctor who had more Magellan's is at the clinic who was a very reasonable guy. William Coffee I think is that his name is. He has lyme disease and he said the vast majority of the people that have more challenge also have lyme disease and he believes that there is a neurotoxic quality to lyme disease that affects the way you see things and even causes hallucinations. And he witnessed it himself. He said I had hallucinated and saw something crawling across the surface of my eyeballs in the mirror, but it wasn't a real thing. I couldn't see it after I looked at it again, it was gone. But I did see it for a moment and he's convinced that lyme disease, when you catch lyme disease, you're not necessarily catching.

Speaker 3:          01:10:27       It's not like you know you have tylenol, you know something that's isolated. It's very specific. When you get tylenol, you're getting tylenol. He's like, when you get bit by a tick that has lyme disease, you could get a host of pathogens and there's what would test positive for lyme disease. It's very tricky to find someone to. This doctor is when one guy, William Lovey, like he, he's a guy who thinks he has more morgellons or he thinks he has chronic lyme, but he definitely has chronic lyme and he thinks that what morgellons is, is a side effect of chronic lyme where people start thinking there's fibers growing their skin. And so they think that fibers that come from their clothes or carpets, they get stuck to someplace they'd been itching because they opened up a wound and that they start

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       misinterpreting that as being something that's grown out of their skin. Yeah. Well I would agree with that part of it. Yeah. But that's what he thinks. So really, he's not really a morgellons guy. He's a chronic lyme guy. Yes he is. He's a more jealous guy in the fact that he has seen the hallucinations, but because of the fact that he's a doctor and scientifically minded, he believes that he's watching his own mind play tricks on him and he thinks there's neurotoxic qualities to whatever the pathogens that are in lyme disease are. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I guess I don't disagree with you too much then I would disagree with you, I think on chronic line, but I think you probably know more about it than I do from what I've seen. Like most doctors don't think chronic lyme is a real thing. It depends on how long you have it for before you get it treated.

Speaker 1:          01:12:01       That's the real issue is that there's this lyme syndrome and chronic lyme, which some people think there's a chronic infection and other people think that there's just chronic effects leftover from having the lyme disease for a long time. I think there's a lot of variability. I think one, I mean I think we'd probably have to really consult an actual lyme disease doctor on this. Not My area of expertise nor mine, but I do have friends that have gotten lyme disease and I know some people that are suffering from it to this day that have like real, real terrible issues with it. My friend Jim Miller, who's a fighter in the UFC, it's come and go with him and a terrible way to affects, greatly affects his joints and, and you know, he's had to take various medications, try to get a handle on it. It depends, I think on the person.

Speaker 1:          01:12:45       There's a lot of, a lot of variables. It depends on the person, depends on how quickly they detect the lyme disease. Um, my friend brought his son to the doctor. His son had lyme disease. He brought us on to the doctor. The doctor didn't believe he had lyme disease because that, you know, the. The Bullseye ring around the fight had gone away, which does sometimes happen. They said, Nah, it's probably nothing, and then the kid developed bell's Palsy. Then they said, okay, this is serious, and then they realized that he actually does have lyme disease and he was pretty pissed. The doctor didn't take him seriously. He had the lyme disease as well. He had to go on some serious intravenous antibiotics for months. It was like really heavy stuff. So we did actually have lyme disease. He had lyme disease and it devastated him for months.

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       For months. He wasn't the same. I think a problem with a lot of these medical conditions is that the clinical diagnoses, which means that the diagnosed not with tests, that you can do a blood and things like that, but it's based on the symptoms. Yes. A lot of the times people, they, they like to attribute their problems to something and gave it a name. So we've got a lot of things now like I'm a fibromyalgia a where we don't have, we can't do a blood test usually for something like fibromyalgia. He have elevated, uh, uh, immune responses and things like that. But you can't like Scifi show, this is fibromyalgia. It could be just a symptom of something else. But people like to put a name on things. So if people have the getting aches and pains

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       or wherever they say it's Fibromyalgia, they convinced themselves as fibromyalgia. And with the self diagnosis, with morgellons, that happens a lot. People, people get old and your joints start to ache. Your hair starts to fall out in your eyes, start to, you know, you're losing your vision and your focus and people think what's wrong with me? And they don't realize they're just getting old and they, they look it up and they think they have morgellons or they think they have chronic lyme people just, if they're getting ill for some reason, they like to attribute the chronic condition to something. So they might tag on to a particular thing like chronic lyme. If something, if they got bit by a tick, uh, like last summer and then this summer, now they have all these problems. They might self diagnosed as having chronic lyme.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       It is possible, but you do realize that there's a tremendous amount of lyme disease in the northeast and lyme disease is very real thing. It's horrible, horrible condition and the people that do get it, I mean they're pretty uniform and the fact that it sucks, it's a terrible and it's really scary because it really didn't kind of exist just a few hundred years ago. I mean, I don't know where it came from. Yeah. I just Kinda, I don't know. Or maybe they didn't know what it was. People got it and no one had any idea what it was. Yeah. It could be. It was discovered that village lime, which named after [inaudible] reminds me of the Cuban embassy thing with a song. Anyway, what do you think about that thing? I think

Speaker 2:          01:15:37       I don't think it's there is any signing a weapon. Why do you think that I. because the, it's the same type of thing. People are reporting a bunch of symptoms. They haven't really done any direct physical diagnosis of people. People were getting ill, people were reporting, hearing noises, uh, but the noise is kind of sound like cicadas. Uh, and so it could have been like one guy, whites live in the middle of the night. This is the gator in his room, jumps out of bed, scared. He goes quiet. And have you ever tried tracking as a caterer in your yard? And you get close to them and they go quiet. So you gotta start moving. It gets back into bed, skate assaults, buzzing again. So this time was the one guy say he tells this story to someone or he gets a little lighter, some unrelated thing and other people say like, you know, well, I don't feel very well either. And then, uh, at some point people sign up, make a false connection and they start thinking that something actually happened. And so they start asking people how you feeling? You feeling? All right, how's your hearing? And people say, well, I'm here. He's not as good as it used to be. My eyesight's not as good as it used to baby. And having these balance problems, but it's just people just having normal normal life problems. They're getting old or the near the through sickness. So they've moved, moved away,

Speaker 1:          01:16:55       pull up, pull up evidence of sonic weapon in Cuba. Because I don't, I don't agree with you on this one. The U s releases recordings of sonic weapon attack used against diplomats in Cuba. Play this.

Speaker 5:          01:17:11       Sorry.

Speaker 1:          01:17:14       Bit like a skater to me.

Speaker 5:          01:17:16       Yes sir.

Speaker 1:          01:17:24       At least 22 people have been hurt by the mysterious high pitch sound. Have they have like 22 people are sick. They're talk to their doctors and they told them about the symptoms of people with brain damage. But it's a clinical diagnosis, but you know that they have sonic weapons, right? Yeah. Have weapons or something that have been researched and surreal in you don't think it's entirely possible that this is a sonic weapon. I don't see any evidence. There's, have you looked into this a lot? Yeah. Yeah. Um, it seems to me that if they're broadcasting it, and this is something that the government is talking about, they're investigating and all these different people are investigating it. It seems like there's enough evidence that are concerned if everyone's reporting different things, stressful conditions, different weapon. Second US deployments. Cuba panel asserts Gabby can listen my thing there, right?

Speaker 1:          01:18:21       I Cuba like, yeah, they've got an interest in figuring it out because they didn't want to get the finger. Yeah, of course. It's probably not Cuba doing it. If it was somebody that will do this after a nine month probe hampered by a lack of success, a lack of access to medical records. A panel of Cuban scientists today declared US diplomats here likely suffered a collective psycho, sympathetic psychogenic psychogenic disorder. Not Deliberate how fast. Hysteria essentially. So see if what evidence there is that is pro this. I typed in evidence and assist it. This is what came up. Yeah, is the latest thing is. But see if there's any other articles contradict. There is a later thing and then this word has been. They say the detective changes in the white matter of the brain up some people which is a bit vague and they did white matter of the brain.

Speaker 1:          01:19:15       They using the Fmr. What do they use them to find? The. I don't know how they did it, but I can't even figure out cte and players, but who knows what caused this and how many people actually habit and you know, if one guy has changes in the white matter of his brain, who knows what that's actually due to dot treating victims and the cat attack, though I've found visible, perceptible damage to the patients' brains. Marking the first solid evidence that's sophisticated weapon described by embassy staff is entirely real. The associate Associated Press reports says the Associated Press based on what? Based on someone at the State Department saying, we're found, uh, some damage somewhere. You know, the State Department is covering their ass. The State Department expelled Cuban diplomat because of this. They did. Meanwhile, the Cuba. That's our mine. We did nothing. We did nothing. Go back up there please, because Rebecca at the top, they took some Americans away from the embassy because they were sick. And so they said the Cubans didn't protect the American as well. He know. So you're going to have to send six people back as well. See, it says the State Department, the FBI officials. Uh Oh. It's so unlike anything, the State Department, the FBI officials I've ever seen that the Cuban government's claim, the high pitched worrying sounds reported by the US embassy staff are just cicadas. Seems almost plausible. Click on that link that says they're just cicadas up at the top. That, but the same one we just saw her, I think. Is that it? Yeah. Yeah. Playing the noise.

Speaker 1:          01:20:47       Hm. This is a similar attack happen to somebody else in Uzbekistan. Is that Bush? Oh really? Yeah. Old School Bush. Why they have a picture of is being attacked by us again. Okay. Yeah, I did it all. Yeah, I'm too weird sound for sure. But I would think that um, something that would be, uh, that you, that could damage you would be a frequency. That would be audible. Yeah. Well some of them reported hearing things, but you know, people, some people didn't report hearing things. Some people had a high pitch whine that disappeared. Some people had a long lasting rumbling noise. Some people might not be. Sonic vision changes all kinds of different, you know, just your regular morgellons common chronic fatigue. Getting old type symptoms. Hm. So you think that someone started talking about this being an issue, that they're being attacked and everybody started freaking out?

Speaker 1:          01:21:41       Yeah, that's possible. Yeah, and I think probably something happened like the esm guy heard something and jumped out of bed and it stopped and then got back into bed and it started again and someone else had something similar happened. That's funny because if you were in Cuba and they didn't want you there and you heard weird noises like goddammit, they're attacking me with a sound ray and people are being. People are being harassed in Cuba. Like if you work at the American embassy, you get harassed. New Sonic attack against American diplomat suggest Russian involvement. Palm Palm, Palm. The Russians did it through twitter bots. When you click on the twitter bots, they send sound through your earbuds. Yeah. People are saying like, you know, linking the CICADAS, causing the hearing loss. But no one's actually saying the CICADAS are causing people to lose their hearing. They just saying that, you know, people sometimes get reductions in their hearing as they get older and maybe they're noticing it because they're focusing on it so much.

Speaker 1:          01:22:39       Right. That's why those diseases, people think I'm sick and then they focus on something. Like if you feel like you're itching a bit and you think you've got some kind of weird pathogen under your skin, you just gonna itch more and more, you're going to feel more and more itching. Right. So if people weren't really paying attention, like I have like mild tinnitus, ringing in the ears from video games or something, I dunno. Headphones they said yeah, it could be. But you know, people get tested, get older for no reason. Some people you're going to loud concerts or whatever. Most of the time I don't even think about it in my. I might have never even noticed it, but if I stopped and listened to my, you know, what's going on in my ears, I can hear this tonight is the noise in my ear very, very quietly.

Speaker 1:          01:23:23       So if someone said, oh, I think we're being bombarded by sonic weapons like a. can you hear any ringing in your ear or anything like that? And then you go quiet and you listen and you start noticing these things. Right. That makes sense. Do people are very susceptible, you know, psychosomatic illnesses, they're absolutely very real. And this, there's a thing called sick, sick building syndrome, uh, which is possibly a real thing and possibly a psychogenic thing, but a lot of people think that a sick building syndrome, a lot of the times when it happens, it's like when you. Lots of people working in the same place get similar symptoms, it's happening because of this mass psychogenic illness. One person says, I feel sick and everyone kind of assumes it's something in the environment around them that's causing that. And so they kind of feel sick as well.

Speaker 1:          01:24:13       This a disease. And I had heard of someone's talking about this one's called Allah phrenia I believe, and that it's when people go to visit people who have schizophrenia, when they, if they hang out with those people, they start developing very bizarre behavior of their own. And sometimes they have to be monitored. And that's kind of weird. Yeah, that sounds well. We all know that some people are way more susceptible to suggestion way more susceptible to him. Have you ever been hypnotized? Now? I haven't. I have. It's fascinating. Yeah, I, I, I feel like I wouldn't be hypnotizable saying that everybody thinks that I thought that too, but I did it with a friend. My friend Vinny shoreman did it to me, so I trusted him and I just let it and he's a registered licensed hypnotist and he works with a lot of athletes, a lot of fighters in particular and basically just puts you in a very bizarre state of mind, but you're aware of it the whole time.

Speaker 1:          01:25:06       It's not like some mentoring candidate thing where they're going to wake up mic now you're an assassin for the government and you'll run out the door and your underwear like captain underpants. Do you know captain underpants says, do you have kids? No, but I do know her. Yeah. My kids love captain underpants. Friend of mine told me I should try hypnotizing my wife. He didn't specify exactly the way he, uh, he keeps his relationship going is by hypnotizes them every couple of nights. He hypnotizes his wife and just, uh, I don't know. I didn't know exactly what happens. He's actually, he didn't really specify, but he, he highly recommended humanizing my wife. Wow. That guy sounds like a creep. He's doing some weird shit to his wife who's a nice guy, but maybe not when he's got that, that stopwatch hanging on a string. Why was, it was always a watch.

Speaker 1:          01:25:53       Right? Follow the watch. Very. You're kidding. TRIPI. Yeah. Um, that's real hypnosis. Israel. I was wondering, I was like, oh. I was like, what is this like? Is it the bullshit? But they, it really does put you in a very unusual state and when you get out of it there, you know, you can go through a lot of stuff that you have like maybe cluttering around inside your mind and reorganize after a hypnotic session. It's pretty interesting. It's a reason why people use it for like, you know, quitting smoking and things on those lines. Yeah. Well, this just shows how malleable the human brain is. Yeah. Uh, and you know, it goes back to that whole thing with being brainwashed by youtube, you know, people make documentaries, uh, in a way to hypnotize people. They, they, they structure it in a way that you get these images coming at you and these ideas and they slaves reinforcement of things in a way that will actually just kind of embed this idea in your brain without you even really realizing it.

Speaker 1:          01:26:53       Yeah. They'll say things like you are being lied to. And with the, the thing that kills me too is that they use oftentimes a hypnotic voice like that. Eric Do, big Iowa does those flat earth videos. He talks in a very hypnotic manner. It's like very calm and yeah, I think so. The nine slash 11 videos as well. This nice woman dictating it behind the buildings could not possibly a fall in the way they did. Physics proves it. Uh, it looks like we're going to have eric do bay. He said he's agreed to do it. Talk with Neil degrasse Tyson. We're going to, he's going to skype in from Thailand or wherever the fuck he is. Yeah, I think it's in Thailand. I don't know how he gets there with flat earth. How'd you get here? That's still in the northern hemisphere. I think Thailand scoop over there. Shoot over there and avoid the ice wall.

Speaker 1:          01:27:44       But he doesn't believe in dinosaurs either. It's kind of a crazy guy. No Way. You think he doesn't believe in say, I don't know if he believes in satellites, but I don't think he believes in nuclear bombs. Antisemites as well. I think it was him. Yeah. That's unfortunate. Subculture in the movement of A. Yeah. Nazis type people. Well, because of the conspiracy theory goes back to, you know, the rothschilds running the world. And so they think is these, uh, you know, this certain sector of the Jewish race who weren't actually in control of everything. And these are the people who were stopping you from the debate is not me saying this. I have no knowledge whether or not you're anti-semite don't chicken out. It's pretty easy to verify a bunch of videos explaining his position on it. My favorite thing is that he's my friend Eddie Bravo is kind of buying into some of his shit. Witch tortures me to no end, but Eddie is one of the greatest Jujitsu coaches on planet earth. He's an amazing Jujitsu coach in Jujitsu competitor and one of Eric [inaudible] biggest videos is about how Jujitsu is bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:28:56       It just shows you. It does, isn't it? About that. It's about wing Chung Kung Fu defeats Jujitsu, which is by the way, not true. Don't try it unless you're like way bigger and the guy sucks that Hugh Jitsu. She those guys in a room together and they can just fight it out. I don't think so. They would just talk about conspiracies to the end of time. Eddie loves conspiracies. I would like to talk to Eddie. We can do that. He's screaming, screaming. Might have to get you some earplugs here tonight. I said kick him. He's interesting because he knows so much about them all. Oh man, that's really interesting. Confuses me. I'm like, how much time do you have? Where do you have the time for this? Yeah. He's spouting off this advanced physics references like Mickelson areas, failure and things like that. Those are the flat earth science experiments that supposedly proved the wasn't moving.

Speaker 1:          01:29:46       That one's hilarious to me because when I first brought it up to Eddie, Jamie pulled this up and send it to me the other day that I first brought it up to Eddie from like eight years ago on the podcast, one of the really early podcast when we still did it in my house on a couch and he's like, what's the most ridiculous conspiracy theory? You're hurt? And I said flat earth, and he's like, no, people don't believe the earth is flat. So he went from that to. I don't think he's at 100 percent convinced that it's flat, but he's definitely willing to listen. He's down the rabbit hole. He got sacked and he loves it and it's probably like a lot of it is just from him watching endless youtube. It's 100 percent what it is. Here it is right here.

Speaker 1:          01:30:28       The worst conspiracy to like the worst one, flat earth. There's people that are flat to the young earth. That's another bad one. No, no, no. Like today, people don't believe that that's a big percentage of the Christian population dying. I went with young earth there for some fucking stranger. We were all baked. Oh, probably unfortunately. But that was, that was when he found out about flatter for me. And that was, you started him down the rabbit thousand episodes ago. What episode was that? Fifty four. So that was probably 2010. First year. Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't. That was even big on the Internet by the head of the curve. Maybe responsible for this whole thing.

Speaker 1:          01:31:14       Well, he and I used to watch ufo things forever, but he got off a Ufo. See, he goes in waves, right? Eddie goes in waves. We were both like really into Ufos. And in particular Zechariah situation, that was the big one. You know, Zechariah stitching is, I think you've talked about it, unless the Sumerian text guy, he wrote a the reason why a 10th planet Jiu Jitsu is June 10th planet Jiu Jitsu. Um, I actually came up with the name and one of the reasons why I came up with the names because we were talking about Zechariah stitching and the idea is that, um, this, this came from another planet. We actually came up with the name before Pluto had been changed from a, you know, they decided as a downgraded it. So we decided that this Jujitsu was coming from another planet like out there where the Annunaki live, but it was based on Zechariah Hitchen's book, the Twelfth Planet.

Speaker 1:          01:32:09       And his book was all about Planet Nibiru and that the Sumerian texts were when you, when you decide for them correctly, they all described this ancient race that came from this other planet that has this elliptical orbit that comes in between Earth and Mars and Jupiter somewhere somewhere. It comes near Earth every 3000, 600 years and that there's a group of beings called the Annunaki created human beings by coming down here and taking them and taking lower primates and injecting their dna into them and blah, blah, blah. We were, we were balls deep into that. That was a big one. Yeah, type thing like the ancient aliens, there's something that's really at the far end of the conspiracy spectrum, but you still get people who like, you know, chem trail, believers who believe it. One of the guys you interviewed a Scott Stevens. There's a meteorologist.

Speaker 1:          01:33:07       Yes. Yeah. He was into like, he believed chem trails 100 percent. Yeah. Yeah. He also believes in aliens and they did it that type of hockey, like white holes and things disbelieve in aliens. What I disbelieve is people that are in contact with them, right? Yeah. I think the idea of, you know, the Fermi Paradox, right? The idea that there's so many planets, so many galaxies and so many solar systems that the odds of life being out there so high. Why, why have we not been contacted? That's interesting to me. Um, it is entirely possible in my estimation, as a moron, that we are the most advanced life form in the universe. It's entirely possible because we exist because we are the most advanced life form on earth. We know that, right? As far as we know, as far as like communicating things that we've discovered in 2017, we are the most advanced.

Speaker 1:          01:33:56       It's entirely possible that were the most advanced everywhere. So I want. It has to be right. It could be us, me, yeah. People say like, you know what are the odds, but you know, what are the odds of us? The first person, you know, whoever wins the lottery because by the Alex, but he happened to that person. It doesn't mean that it's very unlikely. It's not like we're running lots of universities and see what happens was also there's a direct one progression that you could follow. Like what are the odds of someone inventing the iphone 10 and 2017. Well, I don't know what that's how long it took. That's what happened. That is exactly what happened. This is what we track it. We can go back to the iphone 1:10 years ago. It's real simple. People. People use the argument. It's like what is the probability, right? In weird ways. Like people say, what is the profitability of three planes falling from two free free buildings falling two planes hitting them, because if that argument actually makes any sense. Shitty argument. Yeah. They bring it up all the time. It's like, what are the odds you who get so lucky that you would have three planes pre buildings on the same day. This doesn't make any sense. No, it doesn't, but people

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       don't say things like the end, but again, again, it's to support confirmation bias, so I think that it's entirely possible that we the only advanced life form in the universe or it's entirely possible that they are incredibly advanced lifeforms that really aren't interested in us and quarantined. Yeah. That's possible to look at our fucking president and we have a wacky president that's just lies all the time. I mean fucking mind. I think the purpose was studied crunching as a bit a bit earlier, but what would you see? What you would go. These people don't know what the fuck they're doing. We need to figure out if they're going to blow each other up and pay close attention to them. See if they don't poison their water, like figure out what they're going to do first before we give them new technology or anything. You okay with people?

Speaker 2:          01:35:41       If this thing's out there? It's probably machines. Well, I think it's. You look at the advances in ai and stuff that's going on now. I don't think there's many civilizations can really survive sync. Biological life has its time. Yeah, because you know, people talk about lighting a terminator and skynet and things like that and the robots taking over and I think that's actually a real problem. I think we. You seem like these robots. Oh yeah, yeah. They're pretty crappy now, but yet got to the stage where they can do back flips and things and it's not too much further along the line like a hundred years from now. It's like a blink at the universities. I will have robots that can do everything that humans can do and more absolutely indistinguishable to from from people and how you choose to be and but not just any distinguishable.

Speaker 2:          01:36:38       They will be humans. Plus they'll be like gods. Yeah, they will. We do hundreds, thousands or millions of times more powerful than humans in terms of the processing power and news, hundreds of times more powerful in terms of their strength and that's 100 years from now. Yeah. We're really close to that. Yeah, because it's going to be an explosive thing. This, this thing in ai now cold. Um, uh. Oh. Alrighty Dan, because I forgot. It was a generative adaptive networks which has this way of doing ai where the robots basically basically teach themselves. They have one robot who is judging things and there's a robot that's creating things and the robot that's creating things teaches the robot that's judging things, how to judge and the robots, the judging things, teachers, the creating robots how to create and then they just go back and forth, back and forth. So the old way of doing ai was like you would teach a robot to do things and you correct it when it goes wrong and you tweak the algorithm, but now you've got these robots that are learning things incredibly, incredibly rapidly by teaching themselves how to do things. And the humans who are running these robots don't actually understand how this actually works. You end up with this huge big matrix of numbers which, you know, no one can actually decipher, but the results come out of it that they've got things like now where

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       you can, uh, you can take a scene in a video and you can turn night into day or you can turn a snow scene into a summer season because they can, you know, the robots and the ai knows how to do these things. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. There's so much more coming down the line. Yeah. I, I saw something that was incredibly disturbing. They said that when robots become sentient, like when they have the ability to make up their own decisions and do things for themselves and they first thing they're going to do is improve upon their own design. Yeah. And they'll, they'll will be able to have 10,000 years of human propel. Like if, if humans were evolving technology, a robot or a sentient ai could do 10,000 years worth of technological advancement in two weeks. Yeah. And is that real? Yeah, because computers just run so much faster. Just think about that number two weeks. So think about how long ago, 10,000 years ago was for civilization. That is probably a little bit optimistic in terms of like actual physical development because they can't make prototypes fast enough to try the out with. Again. They don't sleep. They will. They'll have these little robots. Then the enemy fuck robots can move so much faster. We do kill them.

Speaker 1:          01:39:15       Pioneer. So scientists acts. Some scientists are saying that we should actually not. We should put the brakes on this Ai. A lot of them, right? Yeah. But it's funny thing that seems like we're moving towards the edge of the cliff and everyone's going, hey, we should probably hit the brakes. It's also such a lucrative thing for people to do because if you get really good ai you can. You can sell it. Yeah. And the army is going to want robot soldiers. Yeah. You've got these, these, these drones with guns mounted on them. If you imagine you've got like you. That scares the shit out man. What are you showing me? This I'm going to hit play. It's really fast. It's sorting a ripe ripe tomatoes really quick. It'll slow it down here in a second fastest. Whoa. How can it see the. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:39:57       So it sees the green tomatoes and it just knocks him out. Yeah. What the fuck? Because the computer is essentially seeing what we're seeing now. He's hitting them. So. Perfect. That's insane. So as they're coming down this ramp, these computers are. Oh my God. That's in real time. Yeah. Holy Shit Dude. So he's got this computer vision that's processing it and because computers are fast enough to do this now, my God, we're fucked. It's just gonna get festival. So fucked. That scares the shit out of me more than the backflipping robot. Imagine that backflipping robot can move really fast. Yeah. Well that's what Elon Musk said. You won't be able to see him use. Have a strobe light. Yeah. And you know they're going to be super accurate shooting things and take your eye out. Yeah. They're not gonna have any trigger panic. Just going to be able to just be like robots.

Speaker 1:          01:40:49       God Damn it. So that's, that's a real, that's a real to put down the chem trails, walk away from the flat earth and understand that there's sentient robots. What did you, okay, you, you have a background in computers. What did you, what was your take on that whole thing? When Google had to shut down these two computers, communicating with each other because they started talking in a language that they didn't understand the. I mean, that's what I was talking about that with the generative adapted networks, they uh, they didn't have to shut them down, but they did because they were a little freaked out. Oh, they shut them down because they couldn't do anything with them. It was the two, two computers talking to each other in Gobbledygook. Say if it was something interesting, they would have kept them and studied it. The thing that they knew what the computers are saying, computers knew what they're saying to each other.

Speaker 1:          01:41:39       No, no. It was just some kind of loop that they got stuck in. It probably wasn't particularly intelligent or anything so much more ominous to say that they have the language they weren't like plotting to take over the world. How do you know it's because we aren't there yet, but they would've already done it. The first things computers do sexually harass each other. They send Computer Dick Pics. What would that even look like the other day? Like what's the AI gender going to be? Has anyone decided or has it been talked about? Maybe that's what's going on with all this crazy push to accept 78 different gender pronouns and non binary people and all this stuff that didn't exist in the past. Maybe were move. Maybe there's like a natural inclination in the human species to move towards a genderless prototype of the future. We, we went into this in depth yesterday under the influence, obviously we did a podcast.

Speaker 1:          01:42:35       We were talking about like what an alien is the archetype alien with the big head in the very thin body and the mouth. It's like barely visible that. I think that this is probably what we see ourselves becoming when we have some sort of a symbiotic relationship with technology. When technology becomes a part of us, when we have the ability to manipulate genes, which is absolutely coming, and then we have this enormous head, which I mean look at our heads, right? It's not very practical. Enormous head. Neil degrasse Tyson was talking about this recently being all over the place. They were talking. He was talking to Ray Kurzweil in a podcast. I was listening to Ray Kurzweil, the futurist, and they were talking about the size of a human head and that human head could only get so big because of the mortality issue with the mother, like the mother could not give birth to the head can only be so big and that it's also one of the reasons why folding over the skull in our heads are so big that we have to be born like almost helpless as opposed to like other animals that are born.

Speaker 1:          01:43:40       They're pretty pretty agile, like right out of the box, like a deer or a horse or something like that. Or even primates. Primates have very little body fat on them and they're. They're much stronger than a young human baby and that the design of the vagina in the head like leaves, little room for advancement in the state that we're going as far as it can go, but if we move away, I was thinking from China, from Vagina's not, not, not genres, ladies. That's not what I'm saying, but what I'm saying is move towards some sort of a. A Vat. Yeah. Something there can put together in some sort of a new concoction, some sort of a new artificial womb that doesn't have any size constraints. Why don't you want a big hat? Well, if you don't give a fuck about what you look like, the big head would allow you to see the future that you could have massive cut like that.

Speaker 1:          01:44:32       That would. That's a freaky one. That's not ready yet because it is a big head. Well, there's that version of the alien or there's the bodybuilder alien from fetus, which seems less likely. It's just a grunt. I think just the missing link. So now. But I think like with the big head thing, like I don't think you need to grow bigger brains behave and you could probably do a lot better by having some kind of implant silicon type thing and that little computer running in your brain. But what if you had a huge computer, like 100 iphones, dom, dom, dom, he covered a bigger brains as well because there's a limit to that. Let's apply like your brain is already using if you're using so you can have to have oxygen tanks so strapped to your back to what if we go away from all that stuff?

Speaker 1:          01:45:13       What have they figured out? Some sort of a vision way. Just have like a, Whoa, what is this? Before there's a. They put a lamb out and had it in an artificial womb and it survived for a few weeks at least when I was growing up or we were like a few weeks. I worked a little sort of science fiction. Now what will. But I think that's entirely possible for the future. And then the idea of human beings moving away from biological bodies and if they figured out a way to download consciousness, which is one a Kurzweil's things, right? To figure out a way to get to a point where consciousness is something that can be transferred as a freaky idea that freaky to me because as someone like Kim Jong, Uhm, we makes a thousand of himself and fucking put them all over the world. What if consciousness gets taken over, but it's, you actually die and you just.

Speaker 1:          01:46:07       This robot facsimile of you is what continues. What if you make two copies of yourself? Yeah. Do you want them as a sky diver? The trial bull riding? Because if you can hit a button, download someone's consciousness. You can you imagine if that's what you decided to do. You just do all reckless shit with one of your body and you start mma fighting. And then would you like download that experience back into your other buddy? Yeah, I'll just die. No, you would download it. You'd have the other body on steroids and you have the other body like working out at the Olympic training center. And turn the other body until like a super athlete and then the one that you sky dive in and doing backflips with the augmented brains, they're going to come along before things like that. I think you're, I think it's something

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       that with ai is coming along is like a bots chat bots on the Internet actually creating content. Yes. Not just like creating, like talking things like posts on Youtube. They can create pictures like these, you know, these networks I was talking about can actually create videos that looked like real videos. So I think you're going to get actual content creators which are artificial intelligence, like youtube personalities that are actually artificial intelligence. But some of them will be overt like, you know, the is Google's new bots, you know, posting on the Internet going, hey everybody, I Google, uh, uh, and then you'll get people, you'll get ais pretending to be real people and then you get these ais pretending to be real people in thousands if not millions of social media accounts trying to influence people. Wow. Then you talk about like Bot nets and things, but that just like people just posting shit like reposting memes and things, what if you actually get an artificial intelligence that can actually hold a conversation with someone at an artificial intelligence that's actually more intelligent than the person that you're holding is holding the conversation with it.

Speaker 2:          01:47:59       We'll be able to manipulate that person and control them and since it's a computer doing it, you could have thousands or millions of them and you could do all kinds of targeted like social media campaigns going on right now. Yeah, but they're not. They're not actually like a habit. It's not an artificial intelligence having a real conversation with people. We're on the verge of that, but they do have artificial bots that will go out and attack. People do have things on those. The simplistic things. They're spamming things. You can tell there are bought fairly easily for now. Yeah. We're getting to the stage where you won't be able to tell that it's the ball. They'll be someone who would be in in a few decades. There'll be people, there'll be artificial intelligence is that will be just as intelligent as you or me and we'll be able to have the same conversations on social media that you and I can have on social media right now and people wouldn't be able to tell.

Speaker 2:          01:48:53       The difference is this big famous test in ai, which is the cheering test where the test is. Someone sits in a room with a typewriter and they talked to the computer in the other room when, if you can tell it's a computer, uh, then it passes the turing test and it's meant to be intelligent and they can't tell that it's a computer. Yeah. If as a computer. So there's been very limited successes with that if you like, restricts the topics to just baseball or Britney spears or something like that. They had these very limited domains that they can talk about that if you get a general purpose ai that is actually intelligent and can and has goals to change someone's mind about something like politics, you could have a real problem. Well, we were talking about Duncan and I yesterday were saying think about someone creating an artificial version of him based on the hundreds of hours of his audio recordings because he has so many podcasts as do I know if somebody wanted to take a

Speaker 3:          01:49:49       like mine where there's a thousand episodes and take those thousand plus episodes and take my opinions and the way I describe things, the way I talk. I mean like if you're talking to me in a podcast like this, you're just talking to me. This is what I talk like, so. And you'd get a bunch of variables, right? You get me excited, me depressed me, shocked me, sad me. Happy. You would have so much to choose from. Yeah. You could look kind of material. You could kind of like fill in the blanks and guests pretty accurately. How I would react or respond to certain.

Speaker 2:          01:50:23       One of the episodes of Black Mirror, British TV show, great show. Yeah. It was about some woman whose husband had died, but he had all this video of him. There was a service that set up an ai version offerman and it starts out small, like someone who would post on social media as him and eventually it grew to be this don't spoil alert me. Right. I just watched an episode of the. The other day is a good. That one. Thank you. Thank you. It's a good episode. Oh, so good. I watched one the other day about the video games that they put that thing in the back of your head. Did you see that one? It's in the new season. This also too. God Damn. It's good. That's a great show and it's come out a couple of weeks. Three weeks, man. Joe Rogan does not like it though. Freaked out.

Speaker 2:          01:51:11       It is a bit creepy. I think she hears too much of that shit from me to, you know, she just gets freaked out on technology in the future. The possibilities. But yeah, like making a fake. Jurgen is something that is possible to easy. You can probably do something if they put enough resources in just. Yeah, just Joe Rogan. Yeah. They could have something because this type of, you know, the, the genitive adaptive generative generative adversarial networks, this thing where they got one judge in one generator, they'll have one ai that just tries to make Joe Rogan's and then they'll have another ai that, an expert at detecting the real Joe Rogan and it'll have all this real material to go by and then this will keep feeding things at this and say, well, that's not quite right. He doesn't say like that. He narrows his eyes when he's confused and wow. And eventually it will

Speaker 3:          01:51:59       come up with something that resembles you will. Then it becomes a thing of like, how do you know you're you and how do you know you're talking to someone else. That's them. Like, here's the thing. Let's just say, why'd you leave this rubber Dick to sitting right here? Rude. Chris Ryan gave me a rubber Dick. Sorry, I just noticed it. I looked over, had a comment. Say, let's say if, uh, say your father died, which is one of Ray Kurzweil's big things. His, one of his primary motivations is to recreate his father. He lost his father when he was young and he believes that through the advent of artificial intelligence and through the data that is collected

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       to recordings of his father and the images that one day he will literally be able to communicate with his father. Again, I don't know if that's real, but I do know that someone like Dunkin save my friend Duncan died. It's entirely possible that within the next 50 years they're going to be able to create a version of Duncan and Duncan can come over and say, hi, I'm back. Hey, crazy. I was dead and I won't even know. I won't know if it's really Duncan. You've gotta watch this episode of Black Mirror that okay, don't tell me. Don't tell me,

Speaker 6:          01:53:19       but is it for to remember where I found us, I think it was an NPR episode of might've been on radio lab thing called dad bought. This guy made literally a text. He used all of his dad's past text messages between himself and him and then made a Ai Bot he could chat with. I think his brother can use it to. They can just send generic messages like, Hey, how you doing? And He sends something that he would accept

Speaker 1:          01:53:40       back. Meanwhile, your dad's like, shut up, faggot. He Dad just says shit to you. A little pussy. You're never gonna amount to nothing. Oh, dad bod. That's what your dad was like. They wouldn't do that. Yeah, you can probably tweak it a bit though. Just asking to dilate down type of thing is coming. They're like text now and it's not, it's not like very good. You'd be able to tell. It's not a real person. Did you like x Mokena? Uh, what was that the movie? You never saw it? Oh yeah, I did see it, but I've, I forget. I forget very, very quickly. That's amazing. Was it was a plot real quick. The plot was, there was like some, some wishes in a house, super scientists who lived in the middle of nowhere and they'd be flown into him and he had created that guy right there creating artificial intelligence and then went over the turing test and everything in that too.

Speaker 1:          01:54:30       It's my, one of my favorite movies. That's my top 10 favorite movies of all time. It hits so close to home and they were so little cut the shit in that movie. You know, I described movies based on the cut the shit scenes, like someone who was like, what? Oh fuck is she cut the shit. How the hell did that happen? There was none of that in that movie to me. That in that movie to me was like, wow, like this, uh, this all could take place. It's paid there with these future robot things. So much of it is just trying to make a robot that just like a human. When the robots are not going to be like humans, they're going to be like, silence is going to be, you know, more than humans at your command rooms doing work that I'm going to look like humans because it's not very practical. There will be robots that look exactly like humans, but that's just one aspect of it. There's going to be all kinds of much more impressive robots I think of that tomato robot. Yeah. It's knocking. It didn't have to look like a person just has to be functioning the way it to be. For it to be functional. It's not to look like a person. Exactly. It's to have these multiple fingers that can knock away these green tomatoes. So why? Why, why build something around the limitations of the human body.

Speaker 6:          01:55:33       This is the same guy that isn't that black mirror. Episode two.

Speaker 1:          01:55:37       Oh, crazy. Okay. Um, do you think they're gonna do a reboot or a sequel to

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       x Mokena? I'd heard they were going to. Sure. Why wouldn't. I mean why wait man, fucking made it better. It was a really good movie, made a bunch of money and it was amazing. They better. Um, I am worried about that. I am worried and I'm also worried that by the fact that guys like Elon Musk are worried that when, when someone like that worries and he starts talking about it, I'm like, well, who is paying attention to this? I mean, how many people are really at the forefront? And is it possible to pull that back? Because I'm aware of what the United States is up to in terms of like what gets printed to the news. Obviously I'm not really aware, but when you get further than that, like China, Russia, like we don't, we have no idea what they're doing.

Speaker 2:          01:56:25       Yeah. And they must be doing this type of thing. They must be. And if you don't, they will. Yeah. It's one of those things, something they don't need this huge, a physical infrastructure, like they don't need a big military or anything to do cyber warfare with Ai. Fuck. So they could be developing all this artificial intelligence to do things like a infiltrate everybody's social media and make them vote for the difference

Speaker 3:          01:56:47       guy or just infiltrate all our power stations and they shut them all down. That's one of the real problems that I have today with, um, the conversations regarding politics regarding whether or not Russia hacked the election is because people are so concerned with painting out their party to be innocent and the other party to be guilty and describing all the different things that the Russians did and the interference and all of the, you know, the subterfuge it's being used that were, I think we're missing out on this idea that you can electronically affect the way people think about things if you have enough resources to attack an idea with propaganda through bots and this is something that you see all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:57:41       Yeah. A lot of the stuff that Russia did was posted in closed groups on facebook. So it's something that you really wouldn't be able to see happening. Like if you have to be a part of the group. Those traits. Yeah. They joined these groups, uh, and they, uh, they have not bought some birch, but like, you know, they had these sweatshops where all these people are typing away doing all kinds of stuff, pushing out these stories and they go into these closed groups because it's harder for people to figure out what's going on if you're in a closed group and they post all this stuff, all these, you know, whatever, Anti Hillary memes or whatever pro Donald Trump like pro Bernie to push a certain narrative. One of them where the guy got busted because he accidentally hat on is location and showed that he was in Russia and uh, you know, who's

Speaker 3:          01:58:34       some guy with a make Hashtag Maga, an American flag and his avatar and the whole deal. Yeah. It's going

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       to be really hard to figure out exactly what happened. That it's gonna be even harder in the future though because we will be covering the tracks a lot better. The learning. Yes, what works, but it's really hard to figure out what's real and what's not real right now. Yeah. You don't remember wag the dog. What was that like 20 years ago and that movie, they described the possibility of faking these conflicts and having this fake video and having movie directors film everything and that would influence the way people thought about world conflicts and now we're getting to a stage where that technology is a lot more, a little more realistic, faking videos. You were pretty close. There are things where you can take audio now and just basically sample audio and create anything that person might say. Yeah, that was a radiolab podcast where they did it and it's still a little crude, but like most things, I mean you go back to the very first oculus rift, which was only a few years ago and it was a pixilated and clunky looking, but if you look at the htc vive now they're virtual reality's pretty spectacular.

Speaker 1:          01:59:47       You could still tell that it's not real, but man, the experience is so much more immersive. Yeah. I remember reading a book back in the nineties. I think it's less than zero by Brett Easton. Ellis. Yeah, and this is seen in that way. They, they map somebodies face onto like a pulling, pulling back to a, and at the time I thought that was the most ridiculously stupid thing I've ever heard of because they would never possibly work and there's no way of getting that degree of accuracy and now I've got an app in my iphone that actually does it to a reasonable degree where it's quite hard sometimes to see what's going on. There's this thing called um, mugged life, which is just a toy app where you take a picture of yourself and instantly like mapsys onto a three d face and you can do all these expressions and you can say these things.

Speaker 1:          02:00:32       He can. He has these like meme generators and it's basically, it's, it's that type of thing, which I thought was ridiculous. Speculation like 20 years ago. But now it's come to pass. While there is an article that I tweeted today about Gal Godot, who is the woman from wonder woman, they've take, they use an algorithm and they tape her face onto a porn video. Yeah. So they have her doing porn and it looks just like her. You can kind of tell a little bit that it's not her, but not much. It's enough where you like, Whoa, they're going to get really good at this and then there'll be able to have you doing anything. You could be a murderer, they can have you outside murdering people and they put that in the news and then by the time they retract it, you know, and they say, I'll make west wasn't really out there. Just gunning people down. It was someone else. Your neighbors don't trust you anymore. You have to move. The damage is done, you know, and that's not, not that I support like the fucking hysterics and the craziness that trump tweets and all the different shit that he tweets, but occasionally they get things wrong

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       and they make stories about him. Like, like the CNN, Russia story where they had a fire. Those three. Yeah. Well when they, after they had fired those reporters who had made these erroneous connections and had this like a flaw written piece, they fired them. But the story has already been written like this is, I guess there's a rush to get things out there and they're trying very hard, but you've got to be very careful because once something's out there, that initial thing of being out there is so much more powerful than any retraction.

Speaker 2:          02:02:10       Yeah. It's really hard to get retractions out because the original thing just goes so much more than the retraction. Especially if it's crazy. Really more thing going on right now. The election today, there's a thing where they said that his signature was fake because the ink on the image was like black on one side and blue on the other side. So they said, oh, this must have been faked because this half of the Roy is black and the more blue. So I was looking into that and I did some experiments where I did a signature and then held it at an angle and took photos of it. And I found out that this, this type of chromatic aberration from the camera, which just does that with ink and it's very easy to duplicate and you can show that this was actually what was going on in his image, and then you can look at other images of the signature from different angles which show that it's all black. So those, there's one image on CNN that she had this blue and black ink. And uh, then I figured out that it was just this trick of the camera, but even though it's been debunked and explained this, people are still spreading the exact same thing around. So that's not real. And that can be a problem. It could swing the election. Yeah. And it's time limited, that type of thing. Like, you know, it's done today, after today. It doesn't really matter.

Speaker 3:          02:03:26       There was also something about him writing something in someone's yearbook. Yeah. That was the book thing was the, the thing was they said that the woman had forged the entry to the yearbook, but that's not the case. What she had done was written the date of the note, the old hickory house. Yes, but she didn't, didn't forge the actual words she is, but that's a. that's a problem. The problem is that she did do it and she didn't say she did it.

Speaker 2:          02:03:58       There's so many people want that to be true, that it was forged. That if you can take something that's like slightly problematic, like her, like not saying that she actually added this annotation afterwards and then you can say that, that she admitted to it being forged, which is basically a lie, but it, it will stick for long enough. It doesn't really matter that it's a lie because you know, in, you know, by the end of the day today he doesn't really matter at all. So only had to do was get this story out there. You had enough stuff in it to make it seem vaguely plausible to people who wanted to believe that she, she fortunate.

Speaker 3:          02:04:33       Did she forged the date and did she try to say that that date was

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       written by him? She, I didn't note underneath it had the date, but he had also written on the date above. He wrote like, you know, to a sweeter, more darling girl, I could never say merry Christmas, Roy Moore, 77 and then underneath she addressed and uh, old hickory house, 1977. And did she try to claim that he had written that originally? It seemed like she was saying that he'd written the whole thing. Uh, uh, it's. And she, she read out the inscription and she said, Roy Moore wrote this in my book, Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And she'd read the, the annotation at the end of the annotation at the end. Recent? Yeah. Nothing. I think she said she wrote it like afterwards, like you have to shoe. Oh, the same day. Oh, so how the fuck achieving remember how do you remember what you wrote down in 1977 at that handwriting is a bit different between them.

Speaker 1:          02:05:30       So it was fairly obvious that it wasn't the same, the same handwriting from stuff that's like her today. Trying to frame him, that seems more like she was just documenting it at the time. And for golf, anything, it makes it more realistic. So if she was going to forge it, she would afford to. The whole thing was she's talking about something for 40 years ago. Like, ah, yeah, that's this, this whole thing of trying to, like someone's saying that this definitely happened 40 years ago is to me, so bonkers to the hell could you, and this is a real problem with the news, you know, like one of the Al Franken accusers we were talking about yesterday, uh, claim that Al had grabbed her, her waist and squoze her fat and some sort of way when she's talking about something 10 years ago. Like, you absolutely remember what happened in something so inconsequential 10 years ago.

Speaker 1:          02:06:25       That seems insane to me. Now you add 30 years onto that and I'm just calling bullshit. Yeah. The, you can't really remember the level of detail that a lot. I mean, even if you would have to be something really significant, but even then you knew about creative memories. Yeah. People's memories change over time. Yes. A lot of people a claim, they remember where they were when they heard about the space shuttle blowing up the first one. Yeah. The people have done extensive research into that like tracking people's stories over like a decade or so, and they found that a significant percentage of people change the store is 10 years later, I'm sure asked about why they were so like for something like harassment or something like that. It's entirely possible that the story could change. Doesn't mean that it's false. It's just possible that it could change, but they're there conveniently forgetting or ignoring that human memories insanely flawed and malleable and I think part of why we have statute of limitations because like things like eyewitness testimony essentially degrades over time. That's one of the things that I'm really hoping is going to be cured with technology. I'm hoping we're going to give up our bullshit

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       biological memory for a fat SD card. They stick in the back of your head. Just pop that sucker in there and look and you'll have all of your memories entirely accurate. Like a. That was a black mirror episode says motherfuckers are on top of everything. They know everything, but I really think that that's entirely possible in the future that there's going to be some way we have a neural interface with some sort of recording device. It's far more accurate and that we'll all agree to it. We'll all agree to. It's just like photographs, like if Jamie is standing next to you and I say Jamie and Mick West, we're in the room together and take a picture. It used to be that I could say, well that's definite because I have this photo, but now with photoshop and video editing tools, so even then, so what am I talking about? Because even in your memory,

Speaker 2:          02:08:26       these are going to go create our visual intelligence, brightening, creating memories for you.

Speaker 3:          02:08:31       Well there wasn't that like a total recall, right? It wasn't that part of the idea of total recall. They could put you put like fake memories in your brain and have you have fake experiences. There's a lot of experiences that I had that award gigantic to me like all of my years of martial arts competition. If you had asked me to like accurately depict some of the most significant memories of my life from age 16 to 21, like all those martial arts fights that I had, I wouldn't even be able to touch it. I have, I've zero. I've scrapped. I've like flashes.

Speaker 2:          02:09:10       Yeah. I was starting to figure out all this stuff. I didn't never soft when I was working on Sandy Hook. Like I just got interviewed for the, doing a documentary about the making well about the history of Neversoft and Tony Hawk and the guy's interviewing me and I'm like, I kind of remember it was like somebody is like 20 years ago, but it's that type of thing that I thought I would never forget that because it was such a significant part of my life, but it's just kind of dropping away over the years. Anything that happens a lot with the, you know, people are looking back on nine slash 11 and going by the memories of what happened that day and it changes your memory changes.

Speaker 3:          02:09:45       Yeah, I will, I will. There's a few things that I remember because there like some significance to it. Like I remember the space shuttle thing because I was over at an ex girlfriend's house and it was one of the few times that we saw each other before we had completely stopped seeing each other, like we had kind of broken up and then I drove out to her house to visit her and then while I was over at house, we saw the launch. We were like, Holy Shit, we, we, we actually saw the

Speaker 2:          02:10:12       play of it blowing up and were like, Whoa, like this is fucked. See some people say that replay and then they remember that to seeing the actual event, so why? And so they think they saw right live. So that becomes a memory.

Speaker 3:          02:10:25       I'm pretty, pretty good at that. I'm pretty. I'm pretty good at going over my memories to make sure that I'm thinking, yeah, you think maybe you're not.

Speaker 1:          02:10:33       Maybe you shouldn't go back and check some of these memories of Tom, Tom and your ex girlfriend and asked her if that really happened. I remember very clearly where I was when Sam Kennison died. I remember definitely where I was when nine slash 11 happened. Yeah, because I got some calls from friends and they woke me up. My phone kept ringing and I remember that because I remember being in my house. I remember turning on the TV. That's 100 percent.

Speaker 2:          02:10:56       I was driving to work. I was on the floor of five, so I remember that. It seems to be very solidly, but seems there are details around that. Like I remember I went to, I went to Taco bell on the way to get some food because I thought it might be a long day now as the. How much is enough to get dental care. Remember now I went to a gas station. I think I went to Taco Bell. Dang. Now I'm starting to forget what happened on nine slash 11. I remember the day

Speaker 1:          02:11:23       because I spent it with uh, Eddie and Joey Diaz and a couple other friends of mine. We went to the, went to a burrito joint on sunset in Hollywood and we were just talking about how there's no flights like look, because we'd heard that the flight tend to like, look man, you see a plane. This guy's weird. It felt weird. We felt like we're stuck in California. Whereas the freedom of air travels, it's something that if you don't fly a lot you don't think about. But if you, if you really do, if they pull it away, there's no more air travel. Like what? We're stuck here, how long it take to drive to Colorado to that 16 hours and shit. Like you don't think about it going back in time in a way. Different Times. Yeah. Well at least you have cars say the train. Yeah. So is there anything else that we, um, we might disagree on? Hm, let me disagree with.

Speaker 2:          02:12:16       I know what, uh, I think we, I think we agree on the flat earth stuff. Uh, no. You think the earth is round, right? What about a changed my tune. What about did long Matt Delong? The,

Speaker 1:          02:12:32       the guy who from blink one eight, two. Oh Tom. Tom, Tom Delonge. Oh, he's out of his fucking mind, right man. People's bastard. Yeah. He's um, he's got some weird shit going on and since that podcast, a bunch of people have pointed out to me that he is essentially, they are selling stock in a competence. Yeah. The suddenly stuck and also he gets a guarantee pay out. Yeah. Oh, like I think $100,000 a year or something like that. Well, whatever it goes, how much money they take in what they make. If you get enough rubes to keep donating money to this. It mean he keeps saying stay tuned. Things are gonna happen. And I said there's gonna be some videos released. Yeah, like nearly a month ago now. I think dude, when he was on the podcast, he played some videos for us that were like absolutely ufos. And I almost pissed my pants laughing.

Speaker 1:          02:13:22       They were so bad. It was so bad. One of them was so fucking bad. I was like, dude, if that was in a movie I would want my money back. I'd be angry. So like, what do you mean easy? A crazy guy, or is he a smart guy who was making money? I do not know. I think it must. It must like this, this ufo stuff he loves, so I stay saying I'm making money, but the conversation I look, there's two ways to approach this and I tried to be district. I tried to be respectful because I'm the host and he agreed to come here and he wanted to talk about this so I'll try to be respectful and let this guy talk and what he was saying to me was so ridiculous. I was like, I don't even have to challenge him on this because it's so obviously ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          02:14:07       Everyone is going to see that. It's ridiculous. I was wrong. There was a lot of people that listened to that podcast that I saw on twitter that thought that what he was saying was mind blowing and this is real. Those are the people that are going to donate. He exactly right. Now, is there a problem with that? Is there a problem with the Catholic church because they're full of shit too. You know what I'm saying? I mean, Catholic churches essentially a moneymaking franchise and they don't have to pay taxes. At least he has to pay taxes. I mean, is there a. is there a problem with conning rubes out of money? There's loads of kickstarter's a technology, things that just could never work like those days, like clearer holograms. They say you'll get to play video games on the table in front of you. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:14:52       There's a go fund me's for people that don't have illnesses that. Yeah, there's like one way that they had a water bottle, it would magically take water out of the uh, uh, saw that one. Yeah. But it doesn't actually work. It would take like three days to fill the bottle. If you were in a rain forest anyway, require like a solar panel list, like this big, it's just easy to bring, bring your in. But they raised like $2,000,000. And what do they have to do with that money? They're allowed to keep it. They can keep it. If they went to the kickstarter. Kickstarter has this open thing where you're developing a prototype so it doesn't actually have to work. Wow. So what happens with that? So all those people is this it us? Yeah, and I think they might've like Gogo though. They might've been on a couple of different platforms and one of them is more a more relaxed than the other in terms of what it will allow.

Speaker 1:          02:15:48       Like one of them now you could have a working prototype. The self filling water bottle. Yeah. It's bullshit. Compulsively go created it. Yeah. A lot of these eastern European scientists types who do things like this. So they made it look like this dude's just driving around and then this sense of pull it out of air and then he can just pull it out of the tube and wow, look, I've got water all of a sudden. Yeah. It can't possibly work. It, it, it uses a real technology, like these little electrical things actually cool things down and condense things and it will actually condense a little bit, but hardly anything. So we'd take a long ass time for to fill was basically a dehumidifier. I don't know if you have like a, like a dehumidifier. The, the every humidifier. Because California's drought, he ever have a dehumidifier, it will eventually fill up the container of the dehumidifier, but this is this thing powered by plugging it into the wall and it's this big machine and it still takes all day to fill up the reservoir.

Speaker 1:          02:16:47       So they're saying like a little water bottle this size with a little solar panel and this little condensing thing that's this big. We'll fill it up in a few hours. Well maybe it's like physically impossible physical face technology swapping thing like 20 years ago it was impossible, but 20 years from now they're playing the long game. We can water bottle, you can improve computers, but you can't really improve the laws of physics. You can only get so much water out of the parcel parcel of uh, so they would have to have some sort of better mechanism for extracting it than what they're doing. Yeah. There's, I mean there's certainly a lot of scams out there. I don't know if that's what he's doing. When I talked to people that knew him from a long time ago, he's been obsessed with Ufo is forever. So his obsession seems to be legitimate. However, when I was talking to him about all the events and I was like, tell me what happened. You gotta a guy contacted you. While I can't say who I can't say, I can't say what it was, I can't tell you that we can't get into that. That's all bullshit. When someone starts talking like that, they're full of shit. He, he definitely seemed to be a combination of deceptive and delusional.

Speaker 2:          02:17:50       Well, the, the slides that he used in the talk to illustrate there was an event of some Ufo buzzing a aircraft carrier and some fighter jets. We're going after it and they couldn't find it and they put up some slides on the screen there which looked like a shiny silver penis flying around. And it was actually something that type of thing we do on metal bunks, identify objects like that. So we figured out what this was and it's actually a, a number one numerical helium balloon, like the digit one. Oh Wow. Like someone's like from a party. And I found like a bunch of other shots of the same thing where you can see it rotating and you can see it's fairly clear. It's this number one, but it's on this, um, this, this, uh, conspiracy website. They thought it was a Ufo. So he got it off that.

Speaker 2:          02:18:38       And so this is a Ufo took the image, kind of degraded a bit. So you can't reach out to where it was. It was quite hard for me to track it down because he'd mess with it so much. It was actually just this, this helium balloon that was a white shiny. What's disturbing to me is that he's got this business that claims to be some sort of aerospace business and he's involved in it with all these other people. It's weird because the guy who's running that a can't remember his name for fortune or something like that, is like a real guy who worked at Lockheed Martin or somewhere and the skunkworks amy started doing adderall, started getting crazy. Know what he's talking about. It makes no sense whatsoever. He says, our mission is to take what the science division gives us and we'll turn that science into flying craft. Right. But at the science division does. It doesn't really. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       They've got like a guy who's like one guy who was interested in like shooting a things with lasers to make them go fast. Yeah. That was one of the weird things. We're not just talking, I'm just gonna have a real technology. You can use a laser to power power of craft, but yeah, that's not what they're talking about. That talking about some kind of crap. The wolves, the very nature of time and space itself to kind of ride rides a wave of a. we're a wormhole or something like that. Yeah, and this guy thinks that it's plausible and only have to do is kind of like try really, really hard. If they put their heads together and like this scientists who all this science a lot and then these builders do that really good building based on these really good science they're going to get. Then they'll, they'll get this flying craft Johnson's nothing's going to happen. It hasn't. Having people donated some something like $2,000,000 or something goofy like that. How many fucking people have done that? See if you can find that out to 2000. 90 two people have donated

Speaker 6:          02:20:24       $2,000,000. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:20:26       Wow. So that's a thousand dollars each. That's a lie. That seems wrong.

Speaker 6:          02:20:30       I know the numbers, the numbers have changed frequently.

Speaker 1:          02:20:33       Well, the numbers seemed really high in terms of the amount of donations. Like it's very odd. You're going to get 2000 people to donate a thousand dollars each. That doesn't seem right. It could be a few very large donors that is somehow convinced to donate via this. There are a lot of really fucking crazy old people that believe in this shit and they might have a ton of money. What do you mean? What's that red line meant to represent? Kind of looks like they're flying right about the stars. Academy of Arts and science. That's what kills me. What kind of arts? What are you doing? Fingerprint.

Speaker 6:          02:21:09       I'm always tracking those numbers for awhile and they were going up proportionately. If that's the correct word to say from each other. The one that number was going up while the number, the dollar number was sort of staying the same,

Speaker 1:          02:21:21       so maybe he was calling these people if you double your off, getting a lot of people on the first ship submitted Mo of 200 I think really sound this bold, bold print down the. So some large donations. It's amazing though to still pretty large. Donated $2,000,000 to this wacky ass fucking company. Yeah, and Ole. All the company is required to do is pay delong $100,000 a year for the next seven years or something and that's it. Really. The crazy thing too is that they, that he had been contacted by the government because they knew that he could go on shows like mine and talk about this. Then he would have a platform because he's a rockstar. I was like, what? This is like some. Why didn't they stop him? This is some bad movie shit. Like this narrative is like a bad movie is that people like say they didn't want to talk to me on the phone because they're afraid of the government tracking them down and assassinating them or whatever. It's like I'm talking to you on facebook.

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       Well, yeah, if I really was like this, you know, agents of the government, it wouldn't be very hard to just say, yeah, get, get rid of this guy. That's a big one. They like to pull on you because you debunk things. You're an agent of the government. Yeah. Yeah, and it's really hard one to get around. I think that the, my approach there, I was just to be as honest as possible all the time, so I always tell them exactly who I am. Like that. I made lots of money during the Tony Hawk video games. I'm just like British video game programmer. Basically my life story, they don't buy it. They don't buy in it pal. They don't. But yeah, I think some of them it, it helps telling them about the. About Tony Hawk. Yeah. It's a lot of them actually are fans of Tony Hall and that's funny actually.

Speaker 2:          02:23:08       Well, it's, it's one of those things where if you don't want to believe you're not going to, you're gonna like that's a likely cover story for a guy and then then they'll go super deep. Oh, the government has infiltrated video games in order to keep kids stupid. They've created these games in order to mess with the kids' minds. And one reaction I get quite a bit is the, I am stupid. You're stupid. Yeah. A lot of people will say that I am really stupid. Those people like who were in like, you know, the architects and engineers when nine slash 11 truth type thing who think the time really stupid and don't understand physics at all. And so that they say that, but I'm not a government agent. I'm just this really stupid dude who doesn't understand what actually happened in nine slash 11 useful idiot.

Speaker 2:          02:23:50       Right? Yeah. Uh, and not just in the useful idiot in that sense, but a person who, uh, is just mistaken. Right. Is it just so then they can dismiss my videos by laughing at them, like I do lots of little videos where I do things like demonstrate how something buckles, like a column buckling when you put a load on it or you think things like that, just just physics videos and then they just say, yeah, you're an idiot. We don't need to look at this video. So it's a way of getting around the problem and a lot of other people say that I'm so smart about chem trails and things like that that I must be a government agent because I know so much about contrarian, so I get both sides of and why they're really smart government agent or I'm just a stupid, a useful idiot.

Speaker 2:          02:24:34       Well it's just them looking at you and trying to find some way to dismiss what you're saying, but you, you really get a kick out of debunking shit. I do span the backyard science stuff. There was a thing I did recently where A. Yeah, so the scientists were saying that the bits falling off the world trade center, we're leaving trails. That must be fraud. And the rocket motors that are pushing them away from the World Trade Center. So I said now he's probably just some some dust on it and they say no, I wouldn't do that. He wouldn't live a long trail. So I got a big sledgehammer and I piled some some ashes on it from my fireplace. And then I stood on top of a wall and I was throwing this sledgehammer with a big trailer. Dust is coming from it for like half an hour videoing myself doing it until I got some of the, some representative videos of it. It's just fun to do. It is kind of fun. You know, one of the ones that kept up

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       that I thought was the most ridiculous thing about the flat earth was I read this a couple of places where people are talking about ships disappearing on the horizon and then the ship disappeared. But if you pulled out, if you zoom in, you can still see the ship. Yeah. And I was like, well, how come you can't see Mount Everest motherfucker? Why can't you look towards Japan? Where's Mt Kilimanjaro? Get up. How come you can see the moon? You could see the moon. If you get a good telescope, you could see the moon really clearly. Take that telescope. Don't point at the moon point across the ocean. Where's the mountains? The atmosphere that the kind of advanced special. You know, I was talking about how not architects and engineers when nine slash 11 have to do this really I'd punch thing now because we've debunked the basic stuff so they can move to this advanced stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:26:08       Same thing with the flat earth people. Now they can. You demonstrate how things actually do go over the horizon and we're going to do get obscured by the horizon and how the sunsets and things like that and so they come up with a complicated explanation where there's this kind of giant, a refractive lens of atmosphere above the earth, which is bending all the light from the sun in such a way that the earth appears to be round even though he's actually flat. Don Don, Don, which kind of begs the question like, how do they actually know it's round? If it looks, how do they know it's flat? If it looks round right, like yeah, things are disappearing over the horizon as if it looks round because of this refraction thing, but they think it's flat, but if it looks round, why are they thinking explant? Well, the thing that killed me was that you could zoom in on it and that proved that the, that it wasn't actually disappearing over the horizon.

Speaker 1:          02:27:06       I know a little bit about optics because of my fascination with the outdoors. I have a bunch of binoculars spotting scopes, various power, and there's things you just cannot see that. Then you get a good spotting scope on them. So with the naked eye, like there's things you can't see with the naked eye, you would swear they do not exist. They're not there, but then you get a great spotting scope on them and you could see him miles away and that's the thing with ships. You've got a large ship. It goes far enough away. You can't see it anymore and you'll be convinced that it's disappeared over the horizon when in fact it's only probably a couple of inches lower on the horizon. As far as like the curve of the earth, but to the naked eye, it's invisible because so when they zoom in on it, they're convinced that Aha, there is no curvature of the earth. See, this looked like it went over the horizon, but it's an optical illusion. Yeah, and the thing is that I've been sharing this so many times because this actually happened. It was this so many videos now on youtube that actually demonstrate this thing like this time lapses of ships going over the horizon, like zoomed in all the way with that p 900 cameras. We do like an 83 times zoom as big as you can go. Yep. It's been demonstrated. They just ignore her. They say they ignore it because it's not in their same q.

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       If you look at the play in the flat earth video, all the cue to the right is like flat earth expose. Some of those get hundreds of thousands of views. This is one guy, Dr Zack, who's a foreign guy who does the. He does these, the these flutters videos and they're all mathematically sharing things in autocad with drawn lines and stuff and he gets like 400,000 views. It's amazing. It's bizarre. Well, it's just amazing that so many people get get into this and they buy into it. Do you see that one where that young man took a spirit ruler, spirit level on an airplane is flying around in airplanes and was convinced Darrell Martin is the guy's name. He lives in a van. It doesn't. Yeah. He has a bunch of videos on van life. He's a cool guy. He's a very nice guy, but he's got this weird idea about aflutter.

Speaker 2:          02:29:12       It's so. I've had a few youtube battles with him where he puts up something about how the moon is cooling things and he has this thermometer thing showing that the moon is actually making things cold. Then I put up a videos explaining why, you know, it's just a reflection because he's an infrared. Thermometers don't work that way and then he puts another thing like debunk this mic west. Like I gave up at that point. Wasn't a separate short battle. Well, the weird thing is that they see all these other planets is round, but they decided that the earth is flat, that it's some sort of a flat disk. Yeah. The thing is that different. Yes. They are these tiny little bowls that are like two miles wide or something and they think the earth is really close to the sun. Yeah, I think it's about 4,000 miles away. Four miles away.

Speaker 2:          02:30:08       Oh, you fucking idiots. They think the distance to the sun. Various depending on the Observer. Observer. Dependent. Oh, like where you are. It's only four miles away. Imagine if, if you drive away, just get super small, like what the fuck? Yeah. I mean it makes no sense. It's so ridiculous, but it's just, to me it's such a strange thing to concentrate on that this is like their identity is wholly invested in improving this thing to be some sort of a massive conspiracy. Yeah, very, very, very strange. It's love it. You love it. They love it. You love it. You love debunking. That's the thing. It's like it's, it's a rabbit hole for debunkers is a flyer that you just get sucked into it. It's one of the best ones because it's so silly. It is. There's no. Here's the thing that people send me. People like, I don't know if they're trolling me or if they're serious, they'll send me a picture of a glacier and they'll go, there's your fucking your ice wall. Yeah. They show you the real shelf or something like that. Like an actual ice shelf on Toptica. Yeah. You can look up the video, the picture and see what it actually is. The government, the government is guarding the, the ice wall

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       all around. So you can't get near it. Take pictures of it. Yeah. That's the thing. Like the southern hemisphere is a huge problem for the, uh, for the flood of authors because you can, you can have somebody standing on light the south of South America. So I went to in Australia and they both looking south, which on a desk will be away looking completely different directions. And they're both actually. Yeah, because they're both fairly close to each other really. They're looking at the same stars in the sky. Yeah, and there's this, even though they're really complicated explanations for the flush of. Don't explain that. One of the. The hot irrefutable proofs of a round a constantly changing their story based on what gets debunked. Like the big one that do bay was saying forever, every photograph of earth from space is a composite. Well that's not true.

Speaker 1:          02:32:08       They have full scale. Full image, high resolution photographs from the [inaudible] eight. Yeah. Those are fake. Then they decided that those are fake. So at first it was those, they're composites, which there was some composites from lower side lights and then blue marble thing. That's how that goes. Stuff. It is the famous issue of famous image of the Blue Mobile, which is a NASA very high resolution image that they did back in the nineties from composites because they went to to get something which had all of the landmass without any clouds on. Right. So they have to take loads and loads of pitches and just take the bits that had no clouds on and then stitch them all together and then they created this thing and then they did a separate one that had just the clouds and then they can put them together and move them around and stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:32:52       How many different satellites are taking full earth images? Probably around 30 or 40. How many of those are run by government? Chills. A. They're all run by government. Actually not all run by well are eight is the Japanese one was a Russian one, which is about the same. Especially to Russian wounds. There's a European one, meteo sat and the American high resolution one just went up a few months ago. It's offline at the moment because the moving it from one side of the United States to the other. Damn. They moving it. How long does that take? A few days. Jesus now? Yeah. How the fuck do they do that? Little little jets. Oh yeah, yeah. You've seen a gravity. Yeah. That's how things move around and get things moving in a direction and then sending them the anchor it in that spot. That's something that confuses people is how to rockets work in space.

Speaker 1:          02:33:52       They think that because there's no atmosphere in space, there's nothing to push against. Right? So how does a rocket actually work in space? Or does it? It's action and reaction. If you throw something in this direction, you will move in the opposite direction. I say if you sit in your chair, take a big bowling ball or something, throw it in that direction really fast, you'll move back a bit. So if you get like a, an air, a hose and you pointed us in that direction and you're standing on ice or something, you will move in the opposite direction. It doesn't matter if there's a. If you throw something that way, that has to be her reaction in the opposite direction. Okay, that makes sense. Um, a lot of those guys don't even believe in satellites. Yeah. They don't have to. Because how could they? They think that they think that signals are bounced off the ionosphere.

Speaker 1:          02:34:39       There's no satellite. Yeah. But you can, you can see this adult lives. Yeah, you can see, you can see the space station, you can see it fly overhead and I get emails whenever it is gonna fly overhead and I go out and have a look and you can see I've taken pictures of it. You can see the solar panels and the photographs that I've taken. Wow. And it always appears exactly where necessarily it's going to appear anywhere in the world. That's the other problem with these people that don't believe in satellites. Is that, how are we tracking the weather then? How do we know exactly when the hurricane's coming in weather balloons?

Speaker 1:          02:35:13       Yeah. It's uh, it's my concern about all this in particular, like the flatter stuff is young kids wasting their time on stupid shit when the world is filled with massive real mysteries and incredibly fascinating things you should be diving in and learning about. I think there's a great opportunity for teaching kids with things like flatter you can do real experiments to determine that the earth is not flat. Maybe even more importantly, teaching them about traps. Thinking trap. Yes. The mind can allow you to go down. You can teach them how to debunk. Say this guy is saying that ships should reappear when we zoom in, how do we test this and then they can get out and tested it. Yeah, well that that was. That one was so stunningly stupid to me and then I don't even want to go into the flat earth thing anymore, but it's the thinking behind it.

Speaker 1:          02:36:14       That's the problem. The thinking that every single airline pilot, everyone involved in commercial shipping, everyone involved in aerospace. Everyone who makes satellites, everyone, all those people are lying. Every cartographer, everyone, all the mapmakers, everyone. They're all full of shit. Everyone is agreed to not tell everyone else about the ice wall. If the earth was flat and there was an ice wall, scientists with detail it and they would explain why the earth was flat and they would show you a working model of the earth being flat and that's what they would teach in school. There would be no. There's no benefit whatsoever to describing the earth in a shape that it doesn't exist in. Andy will be obvious that the earth was flat because you can be able to do like really simple tests yourself. You see boats not going over the horizon. It's just so disturbing. He would say the sun gets smaller as it gets further away. The Sun stays exactly the same size throughout the day. Sunrise, noon, sunset

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       at the same size of the moon does the same thing. Why does the moon look so much bigger though? When it's on the horizon with obstacle of the optical illusion? What is it is a perspective issue like just the way your brain works. If you take photographs of it like on the horizon and then another photograph of it when it's right up there and compare them side by side, they be the same. Same zoom settings is exactly the same, but it's interesting because it really does look larger when it gets lower. It's purely psychological. The harvest moon, right? Yeah. Uh, what is the August man? Not that big old red moon or something as the blood moon eclipse at the beaver moon to beaver moon that you would take one didn't know about a beaver moon until they said it was the super moon, which is when the moon is just very close to you.

Speaker 2:          02:38:05       What is the Super Moon? How much closer is a superman? It's not much closer. Really. The eight actually only gets about eight percent bigger than it. Smallest is actually a very hard to see that. It's actually any big ap put them side by side. That's a lot though. But people and yeah, you see these news stories about superbowl and go look at the super moon tonight when it's, uh, it's not that much difference. Oh. Oh Wow. That looks a little bit different. But that's the very smallest movement and the very largest moon most of the time it's going to be somewhere in between that. So you're not really going to notice the difference. All right. Then, anything else we should cover before we wrap this up? Let me look at my list. I have to write lists because my memory is so bad. Now. I've offloaded everything like, you know, you're a standup comedians that you could have mail to memorize all this stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:38:54       Well, not only that, I have to memorize fights to UFC information in my head and I have comedy information in my head, but if you asked me to do my act that I did from last year like that, I filmed for my netflix special. I wouldn't be able to

Speaker 2:          02:39:10       do it. Yeah. Looking at my list and we've kind of covered most of the things that are on here. We could go over some like nine slash 11 crap if you wanted to, but I'm tired of it.

Speaker 3:          02:39:20       That's the thing about it. At this stage of my life, it's, it seems when there's so many incredible things to pay attention to that a real, you know, this is what I feel like about all this stuff where people are looking into conspiracies, that they're just nonsense. It's like you're chasing, they're chasing their tail. They're trying to confirm something where there's so much evidence that it's not real, that it just, it really bothers me. It drives me nuts and I just don't understand it and I don't, I just, I wish that it wasn't a problem. I wish it wasn't an issue, you know, and it is and it's one of the reasons why I continue to talk about these things and I really want to shine as much light on them as possible so that there's, there's a real pattern that you could fall into and you can waste a tremendous amount of time in your life if you start looking at things incorrectly and flat earth me is the best

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       example of it. It's the best example because it's so stupid. I mean it's so utterly preposterous that everyone is lying and that there are no images at all of this flatter, but yet this one guy or a couple of guys and I had heard that it started out as a, as a troll on four Chan, is that they had started doing this like way back in, you know, like it could have been flooded I think goes back to the 18th, but the people would like reignited it either way. Just using that as a shit posting was we talked about last time shit posting that people have always believed in the flood. Uh, yeah. Let's wrap it up West. I'm so [inaudible] dot com. If anybody wants to go to [inaudible] dot org, my upcoming book escaping the rabbit hole. What is that coming out next September. But have you finished it? Have you done? Nearly done? Yeah, nearly done. Okay. Excellent. Alright. Midwest, everybody. We'll be back tomorrow with UFC heavyweight champion. Steep Emile chick.

Speaker 5:          02:41:12       See.
