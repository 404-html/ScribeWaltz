Speaker 1:          00:00          Try My day, Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. People love both ways. It's interesting like people love your way, but people also love like shit talking [inaudible] people love Nate Diaz for that. And people love, they love the drama, but they also love someone like you walk up to holly and hug her. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:20          Middle though, because I get a lot of flack for, you know, my mouth like, so you just can't get it. I say what I'm thinking and I'm, I'm pretty transparent and sometimes people think that, you know, I get a lot of flag, oh, you're fake or this. And I'm like, not really, like, just because, you know, I'm like, I'll say this like I'm a fan of connor. I am, I like his fighting style. And I, I, you know, his antics at first were kind of like, wait, who is this guy? What is it? You know? And then I'm like, man, props to him. He's done amazing things like good for him and he's done really good things for our sport. But when you didn't show up to film that commercial, like I'm not getting, you know, I'll be honest, like yeah, I kind of rubbed me the wrong way because um, people are like, oh, he does so much more media than you guys do.

Speaker 2:          00:58          Yeah, it probably does. You know, he probably does. I do a lot. He probably does more. I agree. But I don't have a private jet flying out to pick me up and bring me back and fly 20 people in my crew with me too. He does more. So he gets more when they bring them to Vegas, they put them up in a penthouse, you know, they make sure he has everything that he needs. I don't get that. You don't know. That's fine. You know, he's earned that. He's in that spot. No problem with that. But I think three months out from a fight camp, you know, you have a private jet coming to pick you up with. You can bring 20 of your teammates. You could probably work out on the jet if you want to on the way there because it's yours, it's private.

Speaker 2:          01:29          Do whatever you want. Right. You could probably hit mitts on a jet. Yeah, you could totally, you know what I mean? You're three months out and you don't want to show for your media obligations. Like I don't really understand that. I don't like it just, I don't know. I guess I'm trying to figure it out, but the only issue that I had and it, it doesn't bother me. Like if he didn't want to do it, that's his own thing. The thing is, is that I showed up the day to film the commercial and I had two segments I was supposed to film and that's all it was on my schedule. And then they asked me like, they were like, can you please help us out because Connor's not here and uh, we don't know what we're doing for this third segment of the commercial that was supposed to be conor and nate.

Speaker 2:          02:05          So can you please come back later that day and film that segment. And also with that was during my practice time, so I had to come back and you know, I did it. So it was a company woman, but like it was just frustrating because it's like Dang, you know, if I had known about this, I could've planned my training otherwise, but now I kind of have to like scramble to get my second workout in and then it affected me. So yeah, his decision did, and it probably is actually, you know, I haven't made any more money in the sport yet because of Connor. A lot of people like to like, oh you must have got a bigger payday. Cause I'll ask them like, no, cause I wasn't the champion so I didn't get any more of like and get any paper views. I didn't get any more money. And now he's like not on this fight card. So I'm like, you know, but it's where ever, you know, it's, it's connors deal and, uh, I, I don't hate connor, but I going to say how I feel, you know? And I would say it if he was sitting here to be like, dude, why did you do that? You'd probably, well, I,

Speaker 1:          02:55          I feel like there's a bunch of issues here and we know, and the only way to really get a firm understanding of it is to sit down with everyone involved and say what was communicated your manager, did he know what the, what the appearance schedule was going to be like, did you guys agree to this? Did you understand what you were getting into when you're fighting? Maybe it's a misunderstanding, you know, who knows? It's hard to say, but it's the way he went about it was ridiculous. Like saying, I'm retired, thanks for the cheese. And then saying I'm not retired. And then saying, ah, I'm glad the UFC decided to give the fans what they want and be a, I'm going to be on UFC 200 numbers. Like what? And so like what he's doing is he's kind of like using the media to try to get this thing to pass through, but he doesn't understand Dana and Lorenzo and frank, like that's never going to work. Like you're you, you're either in or you're not in. Right. And they're like real clear about that. They have to set a precedent. So like if you say fuck you, I'm not doing media. And they kind of go, oh well, okay, fuck you. You're not fighting. Yeah, but hold on, I'm conor mcgregor where the UFC, yeah, this is what it is.

Speaker 2:          04:02          Made my new stars. They'll make many more. Right.

Speaker 1:          04:04          And we might lose millions of dollars because you're not on UFC 200

Speaker 2:          04:07          yeah, well he, he, he had put, they put 10 million ended up promoting this Saturday tonight and he's like, we're way over budget. You know? So that's why he's was like, you've got to show up and do you know that's how connor was made. Yes. It's true. That stuff. So now like at what point do you get to decide that you don't have to do that anymore? Like if that's what made you who you are like I mean don't you kind of have to like, does that make sense what I'm saying here? I mean at what point do you get to decide like when you don't have to like I use the machine and now like I don't, I just want to hop off now that I'm here, you know, and like, I don't know. So you kind of have to keep it the same

Speaker 1:          04:43          boys? I think so. But there, there is also like a fine line, right? Like you can do too much. Like when I was watching the Josie Aldo media tour, when they were going all around the world, I'm like, okay, I understand that you want to promote this fight. Yeah. But how much of this is helping the actual fight itself? How much of it is just conor mcgregor constantly talking Shit at press conferences and grabbing the belt and all that? That, I mean that's really kind of what selling the fight was that, I don't know. I did a lot of it, but apparently connor was sick. Like he was like, I'm just constantly fighting off a cold. It's really hard to get in shape, really hard to train because every week, you know, you're traveling from here to there and there to here. It's just, you're constantly getting beaten down and you know what it's like if I give you up. Have you ever flown to Brazil and fought? No. I fall in there for fight cards though. What is the, um, the furthest you've ever had a flight of fight? Japan. Japan. So that's an interesting one. Cause that's a long flight. It's like 16 hours, right? Yeah. What does it, uh, like, like, uh, like adjusting and then competing?

Speaker 2:          05:42          Um, I try to start adjusting my schedule at home, like blacking out my windows a little bit or you know, like to, to make the timeframe, but you've never get fully adjusted. But the, my mind frame is like when, when push comes to shove, when fight time comes, well that's two in the morning, my time or not like I'm going to be, so I would just look at it that way. But it's not fun. Like, I remember three weeks out from my fight with written to Chi, which I didn't even want to, I didn't want to do that fight because she was so unknown. She was undefeated. I'm going over there to like fight on a newly blooming fight pass. And I was like, this is like, feels like it does nothing for me. And like, and if she wins it, springboards her, you know, then she'll be 17 to know, shove a judo background, they're going to want to make that fight for, for her. And Rhonda, I know that's what they're trying to do is they're trying to use, you know, business use me as that springboard and was like I don't really want to spend, I did it. But three weeks before the fight they had me fly to Japan to do some promotional stuff and I was flying longer than I was even on the ground. And they said like ticket sales went up and everything was really good. But yeah, that was exhausting. So I do, I understand that.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Yeah, that's hard. Really hard. You're peaking right really hard. Ramping it up three weeks

Speaker 2:          06:48          for hard. And after my fight with the holly, like I got to spend a little time in Australia and then I went straight from Australia to New York. Spent a day there, did a full day of media, went to Connecticut to espn, did a full day of media, went to Toronto, did a full day meeting. And it's just like, it's non stop from like you start your first interview at eight in the morning, so you'll pick up at like seven and you go until seven at night and even while you're driving to the next place they'll have you on the phone. Was with the, with the, with the, you know, with the radio interview, you know, I mean there's no break. It's all, it's, it's pretty intense. It's pretty crazy. It's pretty exhausting site. I get it. And I have been in those shoes before, but um, you know, it's, I don't know, maybe there's more extended research. Maybe he was hurt or something. Maybe you didn't want people to see like maybe, I don't know. Like what if there's even something like that. Like, what if he had like hurt himself or something and he didn't want like nate to know.

Speaker 1:          07:43          Yeah. Who knows? I Dunno. Who knows? And it's also, he also had to realize there was a lot of work that needed to be done to beat nate. Yeah. Like he's hit nate with some of his best shots and nate was fine with it and it was a real problem.

Speaker 2:          07:57          That's more what it was, is that he was just obsessed with beating nay. And I, I get that too. I don't take that away from him for a minute. Like he wanted to stay home and he was in Iceland I guess training and he wants to train to be nate. I get it. Totally get it.

Speaker 1:          08:09          Yeah, I get it too. It seems like the only way also I felt like, but then again he could have brought his whole gym with him, you know, I mean it was going to be a difficult time just trying to find, uh, the, the moments to train and do, stay in shape and then obviously being exhausted from flying and all that jazz quick turnaround too. You know, like as far as like, I don't think he was supposed to be there more than like two days. I honestly think he's better off not doing it. I honestly think he's better off like sequestering himself for a few months. Like really focusing on what went wrong, how to correct it and can you correct it? Yeah. I mean do you like when it comes to the ground game, what I saw on the ground, I was like, boy this is a long road.

Speaker 1:          08:52          Like you've got a long road to beat. A guy like nate, he's so much further along in, in, in ground and pound Jujitsu, positioning everything. When I was watching nate beat him up on the ground and choke him, I was like, Whoa, that happened quick. This is not like a, like Weidman and rockhold was a prolonged beating before rockhold eventually stopped him the next round. Yeah. But with why with nate and connor wasn't that prolonged. It happened pretty quickly. And when you see that you go, Ooh, like this is going to be, this is a lot to overcome. It's not an unsurmountable build that those skill sets, they don't just, they don't come overnight. You don't, he can pick up your cardio pretty quick. You can do a lot of things. We can't, you can't build a skill set any faster than it's going to go into your muscle memory and being your effort.

Speaker 1:          09:40          You've got to put thousands of reps in and there's no way around it. There's no way. There's no way to fast forward through that. There's no way to cut the corner. There's no, there's nothing. You can't just repetition, repetition, repetition would also, it highlights all the various eccentric aspects of your training that people are like, hmm, is this what makes connor great? And you know, and then you know nate calling it touch button, the park, like they do it, all these cartwheels and stuff. Then video is so funny. Hilarious. My God I was dying laughing areas. So when this all, you know he's doing all these, this work with this movement guy. But then you see what happens when it actually comes to fighting skills and you go oh maybe this is not the way to do it. Cause like I've talked to a lot of people that were like this stuff that he's doing his utter horse shit like this, doing cartwheels and being obsessed with movement.

Speaker 1:          10:35          Here's the movements you need to be worried about. Okay, moving your feet, throwing kicks and punches, take down defense and Jujitsu on the ground. That's it. You know, understanding takedowns yourself, taking people down if you must trip sweeps, all that stuff. But all this cartwheels and what this guy was explaining to me and I want to name any names cause he's a prominent guy, he was like you have to understand that there's a limited amount of energy you have in your time training and you are not perfect at all these other aspects of mma. So if you are not perfect, all these other aspects of him that you have to say, okay how much? Yeah, how much of this stuff is going to help me? Well a guy like George Saint Pierre, he looked at gymnastics and he was like, you know what's going to help me if I can be stronger physically and there's no better way.

Speaker 1:          11:20          I think like as far as like manipulating your body. Then gymnastics, like doing the rings and developing. Yeah. You're learning how to manipulate your body and all kinds of contorted positions. Being upside down and understanding where you are. When you're upside down, you're going to be with the momentum you have. You have to calculate that your math is doing constant algorithms and math equations. Essentially. When you're fighting to weight distribution, where are we at? Especially when you tie up with someone else, then you have to feel their weight and you have to manipulate it in a way to get it where you want. Whether it's against the cage or whether it's on the ground. Your body is using

Speaker 2:          11:54          a equation. Yeah. You know, your mind is equating, how much force do I need to make this happen? How little force? Like what if I go the opposite direction because they're pushing into me. There's all these different things that you have to over. There's no other way to do it then than a trial and error process and over and over and over and over again. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:14          Look at someone who's like really good at one aspect of it. I may like Yoel Romero who's just a ridiculous wrestler and you go, okay, look how much touch button the park. Is that guy doing? You know, how many cartwheels is he doing? Is he tumbling?

Speaker 2:          12:28          No, but I bet you he does a hundred double eggs a day. Oh yeah, it'll least, well he's doing all kinds of eggs and then a hundred body locks. Then you know,

Speaker 1:          12:38          connor lost, everybody was like, this is what we need. We need a movement coach. I need a movement coach. You know, and it still might, I mean as we said with George Saint Pierre, it, it has massive benefits to get that kind of coordination. Physical strength.

Speaker 2:          12:50          Do you like about connor though is like, um, his balance is impeccable and that could be part of that. And like he's never over himself, at least with the striking part of it. And you know, the ground is a completely different thing, but when he's in striking range in his, just his body, his eye hand coordination is incredible. And his balance. Like he's never too far over a punch. He's never too far back. He's always centered, is always centered. He throws a kick, he never gets, you know, you see people kick and they miss and they kind of like stumble like their weights off balance or, or they kick and even land and even when they put their foot down, it's kind of like, it's not a good landing. You know, like I, I'm not like the world's best kicker, but when I watched conor do it, it's like he kicks or push kicks and sticks it. He is like, uh, like a a gymnast in the sense, you know, they do those flip and then they want to just boom, stick it like, and he's really, really good at that. Maybe that's where the movement does benefit, I think. So that he never is over himself and his weight distribution,

Speaker 1:          13:47          isn't it the case that whenever someone loses though everyone always second guesses what they were doing. Even if what they were doing was getting them to be like 16 to know. Totally undefeated world champion. When you'd make a mistake or something goes wrong or something goes right for your opponent, we should probably say immediately people start questioning everything you did.

Speaker 2:          14:06          Yeah, definitely. All the time it happened with me even, you know, when I lost to Toronto, that guy, you got to change this, you gotta change everything. But as long as you're winning people like, yeah, keep doing what you're doing, it's working. And then he lose and like change everything. It's like, Geez, that was quick. It's

Speaker 1:          14:23          also the Rhonda criticism in the Holly Holm fight. Everybody was like looking at her like a dominating vechicle. Heyo would stand up. You know, I'm beating Sarah McMahon the way she did. Alexis Davis beating her down the way she did and go, well look, Rhonda obviously is getting so good at striking. She's just such an elite athlete that she can do what she's doing to anybody. And then her trainer saying that she could go box women professionals and knock them out. And so you get this thing in your head that you can do, you have been doing. Yeah. And then you fight someone like holly and you go, Oh, well, okay, yeah. This is where there's, so, there's so many levels. I mean, it's one of the more fascinating things about martial arts is that there are so many levels. Yeah. There's never, it's never ending. Never ending story really is, right. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          15:16          [inaudible] okay.
