Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Like fucking robbed. And now look at that. Um, live. Ladies and gentlemen, we are alive. We are here at the compound, chillin with Eddie the twister. Bravo Shizam son. Welcome to the podcast again, Mr Ravo, sir, thank you for having me, man. Thank you for being, it's, it's an honor to be on the show sponsored as always by the fleshlight and you know, dudes giving me shit about promoting this. And uh, lately guys like woody was spokesman from the flashlight while he was bring up the flourish. Let your podcast, first of all, because the fleshlight is actually sponsoring this pocket, that fucking thing behind me. I forgot how. Shut that off, man. First of all, we never, we never have something that doesn't fuck. Only twice we've ever done this where we don't have sound going off in the background. My computer has the, um, the volume on, oh, my cat's in the room too. That's also could be a mistake. Yeah, I thought I kicked her out. She's so needy. She's an awesome cat, but she's needy as fuck when it comes to a podcasts. She doesn't give a shit about you guys. Spazz go, go, go, go as fast.

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       Was that you or the cat? That was fine. It was probably a cat. Anyway, people have been giving me a hard time saying like what are you a spokesperson for the Po? For the flashlight? No I am not but they are sponsoring this podcast and I'm here to tell you just as a person who jerks off, it's a fucking solid product. It doesn't seem like it would be. It seems like it's a silly thing. It's the, but look, you're going to jerk off. Just accept that and it's like 50 bucks or something like that and I think it's like 15% off, 69 bucks, 69 bucks and there was some of them vibrate. They cross more. You don't need that. What do you, a fucking robot. The vibration probably would not be the best on that day. How much distance in a that would work. It's just a dude who buys like extras who will want it loaded.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       Loaded. It's like in the 60 60 bucks and it's like 50% off. So for like 70% off for other, for like another 15 bucks for the wig. You're talking about 75 bucks total. Well, Brian's been stuff in them and couches and fucking them. Yeah. You put them in between the two. I did that with a towel once you take a a plastic bag, uh, a friend of mine, we both know him. Uh, he's a cartoonist. Oh, tell that you get a plan. You put a towel out and then you put a plastic bag on it and then you roll up the towel, right. And then it's like a Burrito and then you make, you just put some, you know, some guy has a youtube tutorial on how to make your own fleshlight. He makes it really, yeah, it looks super complicated. But the bottom line, that's like, how much time is your time worth?

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       An hour. Okay. Is it worth 20 bucks an hour? It's going to take you more than three hours to make that gut. Just buy it. Right? You don't want to be cool. You know, it'd be awesome if you were so tight and so cool with your housekeeper that you didn't even have to clean it. You can just leave it out by like 20 of them. Right. You buy like 20 of them and then she cleans for you. Right. That would be dope. Then I would use that shit all the goddamn time. Me and my housekeeper just saying we ain't that tight yet. Yeah, that, no, no housekeeper wants to be cleaning loads. That's where they draw

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       the line. How cool would it be? Seriously. That would be cool if you could just throw it like underwear. You know when you just leave your shit everywhere. You know your housekeepers coming on Wednesday. You know what I mean? It'd be cool, man. Then I would definitely use it. I buy it wholesale and shit. That's like, somebody told me the other day, it's like, don't you know that we'd stores or like a way for the government to get involved and take your money. I'm like, dude, I can use a credit card and be in and out. You know? That's why. Who cares if the government gets a piece of it. Who the fuck told you the government's involved in the West because of credit card? Well that is the number one problem with hanging out with people that smoke pot. Is there so many dopey stoners that have like crazy ideas?

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       The latest is that this Gulf disaster is um, all the, the wacky are saying that this was a planned event and that they're doing this to use it as an excuse to kill off a giant percentage of the population. Is Alex Shelan saying that too? He said we need to get to them. We need to get to the bottom of it. He's got to have black helicopters. Ladies and gentlemen. What they're doing right now in the Gulf mirrors what they're trying to do in our school systems. They're trying to take your guns. Did, if you ever had a cartoon, if you ever had a cartoon, you would have to have the Alex Jones be a character in the Joey d is because those two are almost perfect, like identical. You could totally have the best I can do Alex. Really good. If I listen to them when I listened to him, ladies and gentlemen, I get the tones of the voice. I understand what the new world order is plotting and it's evil. It's wrong. What is they're coming for your babies. They want to put implants in your uterus.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       What does Joey think about the oil spill? What the fuck are you bothering me with this oil spill bullshit. Listen, cock sucker. I got no time. I've got 10 cats and the weed store is open at 9:00 AM. You know what I'm saying? I get down there. I get my old g Kush. I say, hello. Maybe I have some fresh squeezed orange juice and I mind my fucking business. This was asked, this was asked on my form of spring that I just started. Cannabis clubs are one of the biggest capitalist money making schemes that have ever come around in 15 years. Why is this never called out? Why is that? Well, what does that mean? Capitalist money making schemes. Okay. First of all, the one that I go to that Joe was just shut down. What's shut was owned by a guy who's a businessman, who's a nice guy who took a chance on something that's very controversial, like opening up a marijuana store and he provides good service and he has loyal customers because he's a friendly guy and they always give you like free joints and everything.

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       When you leave here, try these cookies, they're awesome. They're super nice and super friendly. And it was a privately owned business by one guy. This guy's full of shit. I, this guy was providing me with an awesome service. He was selling great. We'd all legally doing everything according to California state law by the book, every single aspect of it. And he had a nice business going. We're at a bunch of people that were like loyal business. There's nothing that government has nothing to do with that. I mean, no more than the government has to do with me telling jokes because look, if I'm telling jokes, you know, if I'm getting paid to do comedy, I got to pay taxes. So when a sense when you go to see my act support the government, you know, I mean really in a sense, you know, I pay the government a ton of money every year it comes 48% or something like that of your, your money.

Speaker 2:          00:06:05       It goes literally to taxes supporting my government by drinking is coconut water. Yeah. Well he's launching a certain amount of fucking government folks. Okay. Don't worry about, you know where the money from pot stores is going. All right. Worry about the massive impact that marijuana being that accessible and basically legal, the massive impact that that has on our culture. It's only been going on for a few years and I've noticed a giant difference in just how many people are more aware. How many more people are, are just like aware of like the legality of it. Why, why it's illegal, what the, you know what the, the whole conspiracy was with William Randolph Hearst back in the 30s. So many more people are informed and people aren't afraid of anymore. It's not like people think that it's going to give you brain damage. Just going to fuck your world up.

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       Like people understand now that that's bullshit and they're starting to realize that it can enhance your life. That's so fucking important, man. Fuck all this government conspiracy. The biggest capital is making scheme. Everyone don't look at that. Stop. You're being silly. You're looking for a negative in something that's incredible. Marijuana's finally broken through and I can tell you from California, it's crazy. You can go anywhere. There's weed stores. My, my place got closed down because it's too close to a school, but I put an article on my, uh, on Twitter and I put an article or you know, I put a post on Twitter and I put a post on a message board, hey, where are the good places in the valley in California and fucking, I got dozens of suggestions. Like instantly that's, there's never been a time like this ever. I like my place.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       Check it out. It's just a house. It's like a suburban neighborhood. What's your face going to Luca? Late collective. Oh, you took me there once. Yeah. That place is cool. Yeah, no, that place is very good. It is like a house, like you go in little little picket fence, front yard and shit was kind of weird. The Best Shit is med pot delivery.com have you ever thought that? I done, I've already used them. Now what's the negative? My mother, I needed weed and this motherfucker came to my house. The negatives is that illegal? The negatives and some dude who delivers pot knows where you live? No. No.

Speaker 2:          00:08:06       Oh, okay. You actually bought weed from him before. Which guys? His name is Brett. He trains that. I'm in Culver city with a Gerson. He's a bog Gracie guy. We know him. Okay. You remember that guy? Yeah. Really good. So now the Shit Med pot. Oh Dude. But yeah, that is correct. Like if you were thinking like out of this cloud you would say, Hey, this guy is in the drug business and he's in my house checking my shit out. You know, that's Kinda, you could look at it that way, but would you be bothered if a guy came over with a delivery of fine wine? You wouldn't [inaudible] guy came over your house and he had some really nice expensive French wine. That guy's a drug dealer. Well I would never let him in my house like, like I don't let me pee he ups guy but I would have to let them eat that. The weed guy in my house. Cause you're

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       not going to just break out. No. You would know why not if it's legal because I have my neighbors don't care if it's legal. They think, oh this guy's doing drugs on the front porch neighbors. My neighbors can suck my Dick Button from your neighbor. You could roll down the hill and you still don't hit your neighbors. Yeah, but if I did, even if I did have neighbors, your neighbors should do who the fuck you are, man. You worried about getting a bag of weed and from your neighbors. That's crazy. Yeah. Well they also own the place. So I think if a guy came over your house and deliver a nice case won, you'd let them right in. You let them run it in a role that little dolly right into your kitchen like dumb. Fuck some wine. I lost my fucking button up shirt. It's trust me.

Speaker 1:          00:09:33       It's hilarious. I just met with someone with that mentality. I mean once a drug is a drug, it's responsible for so much art and culture and so much of the way human beings behave. You know, alcohol based societies, any alcohol based society, they're there. It's like, you know when societies getting into alcohol, it's always like violence and yelling and lots of fun and passion and poetry and music and shit like that. Next weed and alcohol together. That's the past. Isn't it funny though that you'd never think of wine as a drug but nobody thinks of why like I do drugs. What kind of drug you do? I do. One was, this certificate is not to be trusted. I don't know what that's going on. I think my Twitter is crashing. My girl, ex girlfriend used to always say that. She's always said that wines, that drug, that a certificate, nevermind.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       Oh there's nobody knows what we're talking about here. Twitter is going to be there. It's going nutty and I'm going to just going to shut it off. Shut off the youth stream though. No, no, no. I'm not shut off shut anyway. Um, wine is a drug. It really is. Nobody thinks about, always forget that, that, that, that alcohol is a drug and everybody, especially with walnut time, wine seems like something, you know, you have, if you're sophisticated, you know, it's like the most, the most accepted. Like if you tell people you smoke weed, there's a lot of people that look at you like there's something wrong with, you don't want to read that shit sometimes. But then you get like, you get like wine in a box and that's just like, man, this is like cool laid for alcohol. Did you know $5 I got a whole box of alcohol.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       Thank you though. There's nothing worse than some shitty wine, man. I agree. What do you think Mel Gibson was drinking when he made those calls? What was he drank? Can we hear him? If we don't, if you don't know what we're talking about. Mel Gibson apparently lost his fucking marbles. He's got this chick who, uh, he's, uh, I mean he was married for a number of years and has, uh, you know, quite a few kids with and he left her and uh, this is the new chick that he hooked up with. I think it's more than alcohol though. I think this is just straight like what she was saying. Crazy person. Yeah. But you would know. This is what I've always told people about actors, like actors are really annoying. And one of the things that's so annoying about them is they really are like you, you, you have to be crazy to want to be an actor. You have to be crazy to get through all those hoops. And there's a lot of them that are cool. I'm in a lot of actors that are really fun to hang around with, but for the most part, a giant percentage of them are fucking completely

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       insane. And the business coddles to them because the business has kindly like kind of, uh, they're, they're like always like getting them food and kissing their ass and Mr. Gibson will be ready for you in 20 minutes and he's making so much money and he's the, you know, the focus of all these people's attention and love and adulation. These movies are giant, you know, passion that Christ is giant. And so that just blows your fucking ego up even more, you know? And most of them, like a good percentage of them are really truly insane. You know, a good percentage of actors are, they're totally delusional. But we're starting to see that now because of these, all of these sources, these TMZ places and stuff like that, we get to see someone's true personality. They catch them draw coming out of a nightclub and you get a camera on him.

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       All this shit that's going on right now when you're getting to see like deep behind the curtain Twitter, I mean, shit, you know, you got some time. There's a lot crazy ass celebrities, I swear to God and couple of fighters. Oh man, that there, it's growing machine has an awesome tour falling, falling apart in front of the world. You know, it's, it's incredible. So I'm a loving, very entertaining. Yeah, there's definitely people that are losing their fucking shit. There's a lot of people out there doing Twitter that really should not be allowed to talk. You shouldn't be allowed to be just talking publicly. Yeah. Handle you man. Like whoever, whoever's handling Brittany Spears right now, they've got it wired for years. This wasn't an issue. People are going to have publicists and he could say stupid shit and, and you know, and nobody, nobody cared. Nobody ever found out about it all.

Speaker 2:          00:13:18       Think about all the crazy scandals that have happened throughout history and how much they would be much more in the news today than ever before. And we'll think about the rod Stewart pumping the stomach rumor level that, that was like early eighties when we talked about this before. The Jabil rumor, the Richard Gere Djerba rumor. That's the world champ before Twitter, before the Internet, he imagined that shit. That is the world champion rumor. No rumor can fuck with that. Richard Greer durable up the ass for or cause there was nothing, nothing. There was no CD television shows and talked about it. There was no internet. It's somehow or another made it. He grew up in California. I grew up in Boston. We both heard it. Yep. That one and that stomach pumping rod Stewart, Taco Bell's, uh, survived the sour cream come rumor. And I still even wild. I've never even heard this guy got busted working at Taco Bell.

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       He just came in a bunch of Tacos. He used to do it for two months, blah, blah, blah. It's dry. And that was a rumor only in your town. That shit didn't make it. That happens. That's like portal is food. We're talking about a human beings. Life is ruined. I don't put human beings in my mouth unless I could stop eating tacos and you wouldn't have to worry about that guy. You don't stop being Richard Gere. What are the two? What are the biggest, what are the two biggest rumors? Pre Internet having common loads and sex. Gay Sex. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       I don't give a fuck what anybody says. What about the George? Michael. Remember the George Michael Thing? Was that before the Internet? What was that same with with the cops. I mean there was a boy who was a meager intern. There was a little, it was not the kind of culture. That's how everybody had an AOL. You know my space. Yeah. It wasn't like that was, I watched careless whisper today on Youtube. George Michael, careless whisper, do it click. I think you'll open that shit up. You went to first year this Mel Gibson, careless whisper. First they were little. Mel Gibson. Let's go. Let's go positive first. That negative careless whispers, George Michaels and it's all talking about the videos. Him and he's dancing. He's with a girl, so I'll talk about him and a girl breaking out. It's a great, but there's a scene where he has to kiss the girl.

Speaker 2:          00:15:25       Why did you want it today? Why? Because it's fascinating. Was this during fleshlight time, you're like Sumit on his face, like with some crazy FBI. CIA stopped and you see right when he kept his eyes, his eyes rolled back, but it's just something about the, even the words were gay. It wasn't just gay, the way he dressed and looked and you know, maybe he did it except it guilty feed. I've got no rhythm. No, I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feed have got no rhythm. What heterosexual man would be willing to say that I've done guilty feet. I've got no rhythm. Jyoti feed of what the fuck are you talking? Oh you got it hooked up Brian to the soundboard on the fly. Like write news and gentlemen, tech support. Extraordinary Brian Redman Reichle and everything about him. He's so like feminine, like beautiful, handsome man. His hair is fabulous. You know, striking features only. Only gay people like saxophone and songs. If George Michael was strange, he could do so much damage. If he says straight aggressive man with those looks and the fucking voice to the ads, you know what kind of damage that motherfucker could have done. Facial hair, God, everything. The whole package. Beautiful Man, sad. Listen to this guilty feed. I've gotten over the cut son. You're gay and you're white, gay, guilty feet. You've got no rhythm.

Speaker 2:          00:17:08       Fantastic music of the 80s all right. Now that's positive and that's all good. And now what we have to talk about ladies and gentleman, something that's not so positive and not so good. We've got to play this buck and Mel Gibson clip. Can you cause you need to know, tell me when to positive if this was a gay thing, like a gay relationship. That's the next, that's the next one. Going to be a Ted Haggard. Ted Haggard banned me from fucking Twitter man. God dammit. What? He blocked me. I'm so mad. I want to see you are about all the time I was enjoying it and uh, no it was because of a comment. I think he probably has heard my bit before but he probably didn't know it was following them. I mean I would assume if he's got, if he's online, someone probably sat on my bed but he's um, anyway, he wrote on his Twitter, he goes after Sunday, you know, um, Bible study sandwiches and then.dot, dot.

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       Question Mark. So I wrote math and blow jobs. Question Mark, my response. And so he blocked me and fucking very upset man. Cause it was fascinating. Reading is Twitter now. I have to, I could still watch read it though, Dude, you can't totally block me. I'll just go in through a web browser. The old block c on your iPhone though doesn't it only blocks you on whatever application using tweetdeck or Twitter or whatever. It doesn't do it on the weapon. He could go right to the website. Remember that was how our friend did not know that. We knew that he was saying some fucked up shit. Right. Totally unrelated thing. But, but so I still get to read and take into goodness that is the Ted Haggard Twitter. If you don't know Ted Haggard, his famous evangelist that turned out was actually smoking math and having gay sex with hookers, all these gay hookers. And he was like a huge, like I'm a spokesperson for the religious right. Used to have conference calls weekly with George Bush, what they would talk about, you know, such things as, you know, promoting Christianity and stopping the gauge. And then it was just a crazy homo.

Speaker 2:          00:18:59       That sounds like a sitcom. Like that dude's life is a sitcom. He's married, he's got kids. He's, but he's not gay, but he said cooker on the side just to pay the bills. Oh my. And Ted Haggard is one of his customers. When that got busted, what did he feel like? How did that feel to get caught? Like with the video taped it like real clear quality, hello job. That's probably what he wanted to know. Wanted to get high. That's probably what this whole thing was. I mean, he probably got caught and start twisting his nipples by what's happening in the cops know that.

Speaker 2:          00:19:45       Yeah, he probably, I think Eddie's right, but I also think that when you, when you're hiding that much, I think the pressure is so hard that you almost want to get caught to end it. I think the pressure of like having that big of a secret, you're this Christian religious evangelists, that's like a public speaker who's revered by the, the Christian movement and meanwhile you're smoking crystal meth and sucking a guy's ass hole. You know, you're, you're following. I know that. Yeah, no, no. The guy was very explicit. Not all guys suck ass or no. The hooker and the hooker was very, very open about it. He talked about the rectum. They get freaky. I don't know. I don't remember. I might be talking about my ass right there. I don't remember the exact details. I remember he was talking about having gay sex. There's stuff he actually mentioned sucking blame checks and who don't really like to suck. Dick. I wonder if there's like a lame gay dudes who they don't really like to look assholes and I'm sure. Just give me a little selfish hope as gay dude. I was on some mate. Your flicks last night.com. It's just like youtube for porn. And there

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       was this one video where this hot chick had this nasty boyfriend and she was just like, this is home amateur video. Just fucking eating his ass. I want to, you know, it's like, it's like crazy. Like how do you get to that point where you're like, dude, it's right there. Never had a chick flick your ass, Huh? Yeah. But it was by mistake kind of. It wasn't like Shit's going to lick your ass. You, you can't, there was a very funny episode of sex.

Speaker 1:          00:21:15       She came out that very funny episode of Sex and the city where a guy wanted to get his ass lick and he was like, when he licked her ass and he was like trying to like lean his, her, his ass towards her face. And I like it. Yeah. I don't know what, what do you, why do you think porn is going in such a crazy direction or people spiral spiraling out of control? I mean the amount of like fucked up porn, it's available today. It must be like 10,000 times. What? It wasn't the eighties more even there was, it was very hard like in the 1980s to get, I think it's just technology. They got one mouth fucks, you know like smacks, beaten chick checks up and nothing in their eyeballs and there's like so much nutty shit that's online like aggressive, like violent porn.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       Yeah. So much more. It's more people have cameras and internet connections and what that, what it is and I think people are numb to the regular shit and things like porn and the obsession with porn accelerates just like technology. It just gets crazier and crazier and crazier. Crazier because there's a lot of like porn that you used to watch when you were a kid that you know wouldn't even get you excited. Now it'd be boring as fuck. You just get so desensitized. You want that high resolution closeup. Shit. 1,008 did porn and three d. What's the latest on that? Who knows? I know, but you went here. Mel Glitzy. Yeah. Let's go to Mel Gibson before we go into porn. All right, here's the, here's the big call. This is the first one. This is I think the second one, but this is like if you don't know Mel Gibson has this check and the check is is a baby mamma and she's got his daughter and so Mel Gibson is calling her and they're having a conversation over the phone. The chicken is secretly taping it and it's fucking crazy. All right, here we go.

Speaker 4:          00:22:55       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:22:56       Don't hang up on me. You gotta make this much louder, Brian. This is really low. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:23:10       I don't know if this is going to work folks. You know when it was better than that, it was better when you had the microphone and you put it right over the youtube again. We're going to try a different way folks, cause I think this recording is just a little too low. I don't think it's good to the mic. That's the way we did it before. It's louder. That's the thing. Give us one second here, ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the delay,

Speaker 4:          00:23:28       but you got to Brian.

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       Yeah, now it's just downloading the video. It's, I mean it's gonna take a second. Yeah. To about bringing a little bit, a lot of it. Why did it stop Goddamn Internet.

Speaker 5:          00:23:47       Okay. Right. When you think you've got to figure it out. Don't hang out with me. I have plenty of energy to drive over there. You understand me? So just listen to me. Listen to like, I didn't do anything to you.

Speaker 6:          00:24:07       You are ruining my life.

Speaker 5:          00:24:09       Fucking difficult. Well, you know what? It's your supports me instead of chuck taught me, I just fucking sucked me dry. What do love me? What am I? Oh shit relationship.

Speaker 6:          00:24:35       Listen to me as somebody who loves does not behave.

Speaker 5:          00:24:41       I know like this because I know everyone says that you cannot let me and every time no consideration to reject it or be happy. Fuck. Get the fuck away from me, but my daughter. That's nice. I'll get you one more time. Damn. You care about that yourself.

Speaker 6:          00:25:25       I did not do anything. This is your selfish imagination. That's okay. I'm sleeping with the baby. I'm waking up every two hours. I still asleep because I was waiting for you because you weren't ready to go to Jacuzzi as we reach.

Speaker 5:          00:25:46       Yup. We agreed. Agreed. You just fucking expect shit go. I thought it got down to commit to yourself to go with you because I left my wife because we had no spiritual common ground. Okay. No fucking dude, because you heard me so bad. I didn't want to see normally whether it be you didn't go do anything. Oh really?

Speaker 6:          00:26:58       I want it to peace. I want it to happen.

Speaker 5:          00:27:03       No. For me, I didn't. I feel that bad and be patronized by dishonesty and meditation. Medicaid, no god, but God damn life, miserable

Speaker 6:          00:27:26       medication

Speaker 5:          00:27:32       sampling. Fuck a little girl with, I'm fucking dysfunctional fucking side of the head, right. Judy does Dr Brain transplant. Fucking I need medication because I fucking bend over backwards with eye balls of and not just do it all for it. She gives me like I'm fucking sour. Look or say, hold on. You know care about me. I have no hard time, bitch. You fucking bitch. Don't hang up on me. Listen to this anymore. Hang up coming over there. You fucking, I'm coming to my house. My house. Honey.

Speaker 6:          00:29:01       Yes, but you honey. Don't call me honey.

Speaker 5:          00:29:04       You just call the police and tell them there. How about that?

Speaker 6:          00:29:11       You can do that. That's fine.

Speaker 5:          00:29:13       Fuck you. I don't blog. I wrote by the policeman anything because I stand up for myself. Yo, your week you'll call a fucking cop

Speaker 6:          00:29:20       and that will go to Lsu is right.

Speaker 5:          00:29:22       Well don't you fuck off. Did I fucking making eyes at me in five seconds. Five seconds. She's not your brand, your fucking friend who took me. How would he friends?

Speaker 1:          00:29:55       Come on. That's fucking actors. This is what I'm talking about. When I first moved to California and I first started working with actors, I couldn't believe how crazy so many of them were. There's a lot of crazy motherfuckers that just know how to act normal when they're being interviewed during press junkets and you know, and I figured out a way he can save his career. The black shut the fuck up. No, no seriously. That is all viral videos for a movie coming out. It'd be brilliant. It would be brow crazy viral video for a movie about a, an obsessive rich guy who's taking care of a Russian whore and we mean, I mean it's going to get worse. Yeah, that's a great idea for a movie that's going to get worse comes over. She, that's actually a great idea for a movie. You get a girl from a country like Russia, which you know, it's poor and they, they, there's a lot of women over there that are fucking beautiful man.

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       Stunningly beautiful. But we got like a hardness to them, right? So she comes over, she decides, all right, I'm going to let this rich guy, fuck me. I'm going to make a ton of money and just, you know, just deal with it and deal with him and he just becomes fucking crazy. And He's like a giant movie star like Mel Gibson. You know what movie was kind of like that? That hasn't even come out yet. Remember without dude. What was that? Joaquin Phoenix. I started growing the beard and going crazy and then I keep, that's a movie. Is He doing that for movies? Viral bullshit. That's what I've always thought. I was wondered what the other day did he go on Conan? Is he like gave up acting east and then he had all these like television appearances where he acted crazy and stuff. That was like a film I just found out recently and I thought that from day one I'm like, this is bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:31:31       That is not, why is he on Conan if he's going crazy and quitting acting, you know? Right, right, right. That's fascinating. So hopefully Mel Gibson who was supposed to come out, I don't know. I just a couple of weeks ago I heard about it. It was like, like a document mockumentary there's a few dudes that can just act their fucking ass off. There's, you know, there's a few dudes where I really appreciate the craft and what they're doing. Like a Gary Oldman. He's one of them. Walk Jakeem. How, how'd you say it? [inaudible] he's one of them to that motherfucking could act as ass off. He did Johnny Cash. Perfect. Perfect. That's a flux. Blueray must blueberry. It must be. I got it on my Mel Gibson. A great actor. Fuck you. Fuck you. Because he's crazy as fuck. Back in the day, dude. The Mad Max days. Who the fuck would have been a better mad max and [inaudible] fuck you in the drive Thru to Mad Max was, that's a fucking Joe Pesci Bro.

Speaker 1:          00:32:24       Yeah, but that was from lethal weapon. The weapon sucked, Dude. I, that's how I liked the weapon in life. Horn was okay. One was kind of cool and then they got stupid, but mad max is the shit dude. Mad Max is that, it was awesome. Bad Ass Braveheart. Braveheart was the shit. Braveheart was outstanding. That was his best word. Yeah. I remember leaving that was like a three hour movie and I left and I went to the comedy store right afterwards and I got on stage and I just, I had so much fucking energy just from that movie. Like I felt it like it, you know, who used to always say that Paul Mooney, he used to always say that, uh, whenever he entertains or whenever he gets entertained, rather he does a better job of entertaining. He goes, I always do a better job after I've seen something entertaining.

Speaker 1:          00:33:06       Yeah. Braveheart. I did not expect that. I thought that was, I didn't even want to say it was three hours. I like the movie I wanted to see wasn't, it was sold out and I was like, fuck this Braveheart bullshit. I walked out of that motherfucker and my head just exploded. I thought it was a date movie. You know, it's like, what does it mean? What is this? You know, a bunch of dummies running on each other with swords. I always thought that that is like the most tired premise ever threw his group of fucking enemy on one side. You know, group of soldiers on one side and their enemy on the other side and they were run out of each other and fucking smash in the middle and kill each other. How many times did they do that fucking scene and you know, keep going.

Speaker 1:          00:33:42       Brave heart. Brave heart should be that should have settled it. That shit. Unless you're using monsters and goblins and shit coming at each other like that. Stop doing that. Stop doing those. Gladiator was good though too. People started making more titanics you know people rip off movies. There's like a vampire genre. What if there's a giant cruise liners sinking genre? Yeah, they do rip off shore earners but some they can decide and adventures like the, that's like the only other, well I think shit really ripping off. Right, right, right. But how does that work? There's only one person authorized. I mean, anyone can pretty much write their own story about the titanic, right? I guess once it's covered like that and people go, well, it's a academy award winner. Let's just leave it alone. I don't think that they left it alone. I think there's a lot of titanic movies called Titanic.

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       You know there's a couple of shitty ones you see now like to cheap ones that existed before. I don't know who gives a fuck. Who Cares? Yeah, but anyway, that y'all walking peanuts, dude. That guy can act as ass off. There's a few guys like that. What's his face to the Australian dude? What the fuck's his name? Russell Crowe. Correct? He's a bad motherfucker to Robin Hudson. Big Balls. Thought he didn't see that new one. Yes. I didn't even know. It looks so fucking guard. First of all, he does not look like a Robin Hood. He's got this fat face. He looks like a guy who eats too much. You know what I'm saying? I mean, he looks like this, like he looks like a well fed taken care of guy. He doesn't look like a hungry. It was in Andrews. Who is Robin Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe. Like he looked, I mean he's not fat, but he's not, he's not like a lean like sinewy we looking dude, you know that's what you would picture of Robin Hood Man. You don't picture of some guy looks like well fed and tights and shit. It's like Robin Hood is that we're trying to keep out to try to do, if you got, if Sony pictures gave you like full full like greenlight power to produce and direct Jack and you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       You go fuck, they gotta go up a hill. Why do they go up this fucking hill? You know what I mean? They get some water. Can you imagine that? It's like Robin Hood, you, you're, you're like handcuffed. You got it. You got this dude in fucking steels. Like how are we going to make this happen? I don't see Jack and Jill. I can see jack and Jill coming out like the journey up the hill, you know, or something like that. I can see a good Robin hood, but she would have to get someone who's, you know, it's all about who writes the script and who directs it and who, whose vision it is. Dude did exist for real, but I mean the story.

Speaker 2:          00:36:11       Robin Robin Hood. What is the actual story? It was robbing from the rich, stealing, robbing the rich and giving to the poor. That's the whole Robin Hood. Damn, there's no Robin went. It's around a day. Which is the last motherfucker like what was the, um, what was the story? It was jeans or something like that because it was so bad. I don't remember shit. The movie was that bad. It was bad. I liked when he was a fox. He was a fox. Disney. Who? Russell Crowe. Robin Hood. What the fuck are you talking about? I haven't had the old Disney cartoon where he's a Fox. What? The original Robin Hood. I have no idea what you're talking. I've never seen Robin had cartoon movie. No, he was a fox. Fox Fox who's got some rumors about loads and Taco bell. Swear to God. Mushrooms too. Fucking Fox. Some people can't handle folks. You know what happened?

Speaker 2:          00:37:04       We did smoke a lot. Both we both smoked two hits each and then I said, do you want some more and Brunch it? No, no, no. Mother fucker. What are you talking about? I said, God Damn Fox. Listen Brian, just because remember this? No, I don't. No, I don't. I don't. That's, that's like a classic Disney movie like Bambi and stuff. No, not everyone saw that. So he was a fox first came Robinhood. I don't remember Ryan. I when I was talking to some or something. Well, okay. Anyway, the point was the Russell Crowe's movie wasn't very good. Back to fucking Mel Gibson. Holy Shit. When he said, when he, he tried to break up his friendship with the, her friendship with their best friend that she sucked me in five seconds. She's not your friend. That was deep shit right there. The Rose Garden. It's hilarious. It was probably true. Well, what, what, what is it about when someone just has a colossal catastrophic fuck up like this that makes you so uncomfortable? I think it's because you are terrified that you would ever see that kind of behavior in yourself. And you can only imagine that it could be possible in some fucking unsprung fit of madness that you got completely out of control, you know, and you were drunk or on drugs or something and you said Shit equally as crazy. God Damn check, cozy, cozy love to have recordings of like arguments I got in with

Speaker 7:          00:38:36       crazy girlfriends when I was young and stupid. But you know what? The one thing about this, the one thing I thought about it at least three or four times while I'm listening to this is damn, that bitch could be really psycho. He's probably fucked up cause she probably did some crazy shit. Maybe. Maybe I'm just thinking maybe he, she did some crazy shit. Then she records it and he's not repeating what he did because he assumes that she already knows. I mean, of course, you know it's, I mean he's, you know what I'm saying? It's crazy. And if he's not crazy then he's incredibly weak. That was like the week, his version of the pimp hand I've ever heard ever. They don't you fucking hang up on me. What are you talking about, son? Why you get all his brother? He like gave away every fucking move.

Speaker 7:          00:39:15       First of all, she's calm and collected. He's screaming and yelling and calling her a cunt. He loses. He loses bite off the bat cause she's like, I don't know why you're so excited. You need medication blocked, blocked. He fucking loses. He's trying to tear later. It's he's doing gang or doing nothing. He's telling her he's going to bring the cops to her house to kick her out with her baby and she's like, you can do that if you want. She's like, did she owned him? It was just like straight domination. How dare you? I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to help out a brother. He's my brother. He's weak, deprived idiot. That's a weak, weak man. We thought we were talking about Braveheart. You know what I mean? I've touched me and I'm thinking, damn this motherfucker out. You know what I mean? Guys can get crazy.

Speaker 7:          00:40:01       Great guys can get possessive. I don't know. You know, he's a brilliant director to that. Apocalypto was fascinating. I loved it. I never saw it. I hated the other one. The Passion of the Christ to me was like a two hour movie about a dude with magic who got the fuck beat out of him. I mean he could do magic tricks and they just beat his fucking ass and then killed them and the end and he comes back. Oh, what a fucking movie. Like if you take away the story of Jesus, he take away the biblical story of it. If you don't know that as a reference, as a standalone movie, it's terrible. As a standalone movie. It's a guy who just does a few magic tricks and they beat the fuck out of him and kill him. That's the whole moving to, they've got two and part three and when it comes, cause a motherfucker comes back, right.

Speaker 7:          00:40:40       You believe that other shit, you might as well go with it. There's more to the story. That's as part why Mel, that could save your fucking career. It's hard to, it's so funny how strong the urge is to look into the past for a time where things were explained and clear and you know that we were in the presence of divine glory and the Lord was here on earth and walking amongst men. It's so funny how we just have this incredible need to look to the past. Like as if there's something that we knew and we forgot. There was a connection that we had and it was lost. I wonder what that represents. You know, there's people that think that that represents psychedelics, that this, this whole idea of the Christ, this whole idea of that at one point in time were connected to God and now we're not.

Speaker 7:          00:41:23       You know, and a lot of people believe that it was a climate change issue that mushroom stop growing and they couldn't get them and they couldn't use them as a regular part of, of a, of their culture. You is the whole basis of the sacred mushroom and the cross that, that book. So I wonder, man, I wonder what the fuck that is. But God, people are so hung up on that idea. They love the idea of there being a person at one point in time that really had all the answers. It's so important to them, you know, if the exist, it is probably just, uh, you know, a super enlightened guy who, you know, figure shit out. And people were so stupid back then that they thought he was magical, but really he probably never even said he was in a fee exist. I mean, it's just, it's, you know, I've heard the arguments against it and they're much stronger than the arguments for him existence.

Speaker 7:          00:42:08       I know, I, I view Brian, I go back and forth, but if you just think about it, you know, the Christians and the Muslims, they fucking killed each other. They hate each other. They, you know, the, the Jews and the Christians hate each other that killed, he said slaughter each other. So if there was, if the, if Jesus didn't exist that Jews would be talking about that all the time. They say, well, he did exist, but he's not like the son of God. But yeah, he was a bad mother fucker and that's not enough. And the same thing with the, they would be all over it man. It's just not enough evidence. And when you were talking about stories that are, first of all, almost all of the biblical stories came from somewhere else. Almost all of them. You, you can get the, the story of uh, the creation from the, the, the, the epic of Gilgamesh has like so many parallels, almost the same exact stories are told through many different cultures.

Speaker 7:          00:42:56       You get down to that Jesus character that's in the movies is category exists and a lot of, but that Jesus character is exist in timeline so far earlier than Jesus Christ was supposed to walk the earth as a person. That's why I'm very skeptical. I don't know. I know that, who the fuck my theme, that theme has been going on for thousands of years. If I had to choose, I would say he did exist based on the Muslims and the Jews. So watch fish but use it all the same. They were just discussing it. No one really knows. If we just only discuss shit that we had proof for then. No, no, no, I'm not, I'm not saying, I'm not saying don't discuss it. What I'm saying is we have this inclination to go one way or the other and I don't, I don't think it's necessarily in something like this if I, if you had to though, but if you don't, you don't have to.

Speaker 7:          00:43:41       You know what I'm saying? You're just a human being. Like the, we have this, this massive inclination to go one way or the other, you know, do you go Jesus or atheist? You go Mac or PC. You know, it's an urge that we have to like to accept whether or not someone existed. He existed. He was just a bad dad was a god particle. I says, Dad was a god particle. If you don't know, there's a discussion and debate whether or not the Higgs Boson particle, the media crew named God particle, the scientist on a called the God particle. But what it basically is is a, uh, Parker that existed at the very beginning of the universe, the birth of the universe of milliseconds after the big bang. They believe that this particle existed and they now believe there's five different individual versions of the Higgs Boson particle and a particle collider in Illinois of all places is the, the place

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       that they're saying that they were about to shut down. Supposedly it's last breath is supposedly there's rumors that it found this and we're going to find out in this speech and Paris next week, is it next week or something like that. Or there's, there's two different, there's two different camps on this. Some scientists are saying that there's no way and there's no evidence and this is just bullshit and rumors. And then there's other scientists that are involved in it. They're saying it's very clear they have all the markings that they've discovered this actual particle. Yeah. They're going to present their findings July 22nd at the Paris international kind of joke around about the shit on stage. You know about like what the fuck are we doing? You know, because I think it's, it is a strange thing that technology used to be used to enhance our lives, you know, like to create cops and you know, electricity, all these different things that make our life easier.

Speaker 1:          00:45:18       But when you get to a certain level of, of, of discovery, like the Higgs Boson particle, like, you know, like what they're working on right now, like these particle colliders and all this craziness. It's like, wow, like what, what is, what's going to come out of here that's going to help us? Is this going to help us at all or is this just, we're just, let's see if we can do this. I mean, and there's nothing wrong with, let's see if we can do this. If you've got all your other shit covered, you know, but right now, I mean, look at all the fucking problems in the world. If the, the number one thing that scientists are working on is this, is that the right thing mean it's a totally debatable issue. I mean, if you were the guy who got to dictate, you know how we should fix the world, you know, and you, you got to bring all the scientists together and say, hey, you know, what should we concentrate on?

Speaker 1:          00:45:59       Would you say let's make little black holes and let's, you know, let's use the Higgs Boston, you know, let's try to find the Higgs Boson particle. What would would you try to do? I would let them do it. Jump really high. You got to let them do it for sure. Honestly, spent equal time trying to perfect big dick pills. Put some time into that too. Do you think if you jumped every day, and I had some way to calculate how high you jumped every day and he tried it for 10 years, that the, how big high do you think, do you think there's like a wall of how much you can of course, or do you think you could, can continue is how high are you? God Damn, what a ridiculous question. That's, that's like what? I would love to be able to do that experiment. Why don't you just do it?

Speaker 1:          00:46:37       I thought about it, but my people, my ex girlfriend thought I was fucking crazy, so I stopped. I only lasts like a week. Fuck that bitch, man. Try it. You could become the best jumper ever. Be on the Olympic jumping team. You have to tell about, my idea is that you would have to get better every week. You probably wouldn't ever stop. Your muscles would grow. You would go jump higher and higher and well, let's put it to the test son. I don't want to do, I don't have that time. I don't want it to it. Imagine if you could tell him, listen back to what we were talking about with the Higgs Boson particle. I don't, I'm not criticizing, don't get me wrong. I'm not criticizing scientists. I'm not saying they should be concentrating on other things. I just think it's weird. This obsession that we have with technology, with like digging deeper and deeper intellect, the heart of matter, and they're supposed to, man, I know. I think we're supposed to to, I mean that's what my whole thing on stage is. It's a joke is about that we create the Big Bang, you know, that human beings are what actually creates the big bang and crack the

Speaker 7:          00:47:29       universal open and starts all over again from scratch. Then 14 billion years later, another human being developed at that gets developed, makes the big bang and do it all over again. Did you hear that the methane gas bubble was debunked? That uh, that whole thing that was going around? Yeah, I did, but I don't know if there's enough data on that. I don't know who's right and who's wrong. I know that people that are talking about that area, we're talking about that they're not letting any photograph photographers and they're not letting reporters. Then they have a huge problem with the, uh, um, pollution in the air. The, uh, the oil is not just oil on the surface of the water. It's, there's a vapor in the air and the parts per million of acceptable toxins. It's through the fucking roof. So they might have to evacuate certain areas.

Speaker 7:          00:48:09       It's gets a fucking ugly, ugly, ugly scene. You're talking about an oil spill that's bigger than states, you know, I mean that's, I don't even think we can wrap our head around how big of a disaster this is. The ocean is gigantic, but there's a huge part of it that is just fucked up right now. And we've never seen anything on this scale in human history that we're aware of. Especially not in like, you know, with Florida is that's it, Florida. So all those, those houses as beach front houses that problem, what areas it's hit and what areas it hasn't. In Houston, Texas, they're getting those tar bubbles are when everything is. And parts of Florida started to get him about two weeks or saying millions of fish are dead. They just put a cap on it. They finally put some sort of a cap to stop it.

Speaker 7:          00:48:54       But there's reports that there's oil coming from more than one spot off the ocean floor, which means that the pipe when it blew up, um, that it's, it's possible that there's all sorts of ruptures further down the line, which means it's just good on Ustream right now. There's nine cameras on yet. Well, but what they're talking about is holes. Miles. We just take like a little submarine thing that would go and take go or you know, or the area you would see whales coming out of the water. When didn't you? Well there's guys that have photograph things that they say are plumes that are inside the water. I don't know. You know there's that was, there was a guy on CNN that was talking about the possibilities and he was just a, he was a scientist that was explaining what they're trying to do right now with the cap and what does worst case scenario, and he said that worst case scenario was there was holes in other parts of the pipe further down the line.

Speaker 7:          00:49:45       He said, but that right now appears to be highly unlikely. So he doesn't know. So they said that his worst case scenario, and if people online are saying that it, that is the case, who knows? We don't know. It's almost like a media blackout. Like you're only, you're only allowed to get a certain amount of information. There's people from a citizen's radio they put on that Jamie Kilstein dude. And Allison Kilkenny, they put on a bunch of stuff on Twitter where all these people that live on the Gulf are a accusing BP of dumping sand onto oil that's washed up on the beach and they proved it. They have videos of it on youtube where they're showing the sand and they're showing the black shit that's underneath the sand. You know like the show him like layers. They're like, they came with trucks and they dumped sand on top of this oil instead of cleaning the oil up there, like making it a little bit, the oil doesn't exist. Wow. That's fucking crazy shit.

Speaker 3:          00:50:35       But you know, they do that all the time. Putting sand and rearranging sands on beaches. That's just a part of each too, you know? Oh, maybe it was just regular maintenance. Not if they cover all the oil. That doesn't make any sense. They have, I mean they bring in Santa beaches, they fucking rate beaches every morning at some point because having a place that's a lot of sand. I'm just thinking. I'm saying the other side, you know, there's no proof that they fucking really take this sand to a whole coastline. When have they ever done that? What have they ever gone? Miles and miles down to beach daily. They do it daily. It's called maintaining beaches, beaches, some beaches, a lot. Mostly public beaches. They do that all the time where they just drive up with trucks, redo beaches all the time. What did they do? Did they actually bring sand everyday replaced sand from the back of the s know at the top front, you know, to keep it the beach going, we need to Google this. Are they rotating the sand? I think we need to Google this. Why don't you Google Google,

Speaker 7:          00:51:31       Google, uh, BP covering oil with sand and see if we could find that article and see what it says exactly. Because we're starting to delve into the world of, we don't know what the fuck we're talking about. But anyway, the bottom line is this is a giant fucking disaster. It's a scary one, man. I'm not saying that scientists should stop working on the Higgs Boson particle and stop working on the large Hadron collider. I mean, I think the whole, I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do. I'm not contributing to society. These guys are, it could fuck up clean the oil spill.

Speaker 3:          00:52:05       Yeah. No, I mean there's, there's out there, you know, they're saying that they did it. I just did a porky pig there. There's, there's some sort of like microbes that they built. Yeah, there said this. The allegations. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:52:15       There's some sort of microbe that they've developed that he consumes oil and you can pour it on top of the oil and it actually eats the oil. I wonder if they could do it on that kind of a scale now maybe it would take over. It would become some giant fucking blob and eat in New York. You know, once it gets hungry for oil runs out of oil that it starts eating tires and shit. Need to dump some vinegar in the ocean and let it push it to our tires. Tires are made out of oil. Right. Isn't it? Yeah. Tires are made out of petroleum fuel tires, right? You need it. You need oil for most things. You can imagine if there's a fucking disease, like a microbe that started eating people's tires and somehow or another got over here from the, the, the Gulf efforts when they pour, if they poured the stuff into the ocean and some of it got out and they started like throwing on the streets in New York and I started eating people's cars, eat your tires and shit, eat your sneakers, you can't walk in. It becomes a goddamn epidemic. We have to change over to hemp, hemp, everything that could really happen.

Speaker 3:          00:53:15       It could really, what's the problem with drinking bottled water? Well, there's a lot of people that

Speaker 7:          00:53:22       it's wasteful and a lot of people that think that, uh, you know, you use up so much

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       oil in the construction of a bottle of water and then the recycling is only so efficient and you're constantly contributing to this, uh, you know, ecological ecological disaster we have right now with recyclables and plastics and you know, all the shit that's in the ocean right now. Carbon cycle business, the fucking scam now, is that what they're saying? Well, Penn and teller thing about bullshit and credible, I think penitentiary did a whole episode of bullshit on it. Yeah. I don't remember the results though. There's some times where you just got to say, and obviously recycling, it's not a scam. You know, Penn and teller ever done an episode at Penn and teller ever done an episode of bullshit where they decided something that isn't bullshit when they were done. No. They went and did that episode, do you think? Oh, I don't know. They should do.

Speaker 1:          00:54:12       And then you got up, you got it. You got to mix it up. They turn into an episode of martial arts man saying that martial arts lessons for the money you'd save, you'd be better off just giving it to the mugger by not taking them. If you have the money you save by not taking martial arts lessons, you'd be better off just, I mean they have to find that conclusion, they have to find them. But that's just the dumbest doesn't have an open mind. That's not only that, that's someone who has never worked out. You don't understand the benefits, the clarity, these tall fucked up. Right. He's a great guy. I love that dude. Somebody asked me that. I'm on factor. I had him on fear factor or I had him on, he was on with uh, with teller and I became buddies with them, became email buddies, came to the comedy store a few times and I hung out with him and did his radio show a couple of times too when those moon hoax debates. But he's a, he's a great guy. Somebody asked me the other day who would win between you two and a fight. And I immediately see, I said Eddie, cause I know he could, he's tapped you 12 years old. Who would win in a fight? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:55:10       the bullshit MMA may question. And because you know, that's another thing, what they're saying is, you know, like if you do certain MMAs it's not gonna protect. You did a straight Jujitsu match who you'd kicked my ass, taps me all the time. I'd ever even come close to tapping into a real fight Jelica class. Then I was like, wait, no, no wait, Joe could like punch him in my standards. My kick boxing is probably better than my Jujitsu. You know, I don't really do it anymore and just don't forget about that. You always forget about that. You just spoke. But if we were the same size too, I'm still, I'm like 30 pounds heavier than I was getting swole. Yeah. So anyway, so that's, that is a thing though. Like if you're in a bar fight and you're, you know, Jujitsu is two people per set of bar fights is who hit who first.

Speaker 1:          00:55:53       That's the 90% you know, just in 90% of avoiding bar fights is don't go to shitty bars. Don't hang out with Douche bags. Get away when you see things are going bad, right? When people started acting Douchey, you see a comment, it's in the air, you smell it. Defensive drivers to people. Be careful. You see creep, stay away. There's nothing worse than drunk. Motherfucking due to been rejected all night. The club, some guys get wrong, so aggro man, chicks just rejected them all night and then they see you with your girl and there's like three of them

Speaker 8:          00:56:23       and they just can't fucking, they can't help themselves

Speaker 7:          00:56:27       and they can't help being disrespectful to Saul. So unnecessary man. It's so fucking hard for people to get their shit together so hard. There's so many dickheads out there. They're doing. The bottom line is the war were saying about martial arts. It's not even about learning how to fight it. That's your, you're rarely going to use that. If it was just about learning how to fight, like man, how often does it even come up? You know, you're just preparing for something that probably, if you're a smart person will never happen you in your life, but you get a shit load of benefits from it. It's not, it's like, you know, when you play chess, you don't just play chess to learn how to, you know, finish this one game. And when you play chess to learn the strategy and to become involved in like long term planning out of, you know, any sort of a situation you can apply chest to your life, you know, and the same thing as Jujitsu, same thing as any kind of martial art. You get better at anything that's really difficult and it makes you better at everything else you do as well. Like jumping, yeah. Could you do to helps your music and your music helps you Jujitsu.

Speaker 8:          00:57:25       Ah, well let's talk about your seminars before you answer that question. Where are they? Okay. I got a couple of seminars coming up. I got Omaha, Nebraska, 10 planet Omaha in not this Saturday, but next Saturday. And then I'm going to be at, um, the very next Saturday, July 31st I'll be at, uh, the future home of 10th Planet Charlotte for all the information, just go to 10th planet j J. Dot Com

Speaker 7:          00:57:48       and that's where they can order all your, your DVDs and

Speaker 8:          00:57:51       yeah, you've got a 10 pound at J J. Dot Com. Call on the forum. Then you'd be reform and all of the information. Just know, look for the Charlotte or the Omahas seminar and there'll be a flyer up and you're all good.

Speaker 7:          00:58:01       Now, don't you think that Jujitsu helps you music and music helps with Jujitsu? Don't you think that anytime you, you like, you get great at anything in your life that enhances all the other things in your life?

Speaker 8:          00:58:11       Yes, definitely. Um, but with Jujitsu you see constantly with Jujitsu is you see yourself as a total retard with a certain move. And then you see yourself practice and get good, and then you master it. And you constantly see that with all these different moves, Jujitsu, so gigantic, there's a million different paths. You need three lifetimes to master the whole game of Jujitsu. I mean I've been doing too just to 16 years. I got a lot of holes in my game, but I'm good at the stuff that I focused on and the stuff I focused on and put the numbers in. The reps, you see that constant. So you see that our bodies are magical. Our Bot, we have two people inside of us, the conscious person and the unconscious person, and you are, you want to train the conscious person so much that that unconscious person, the other dude, you've done it so much that he's going to do it all.

Speaker 8:          00:59:02       Then you become the executive producer. You know like when someone shredding on piano, they're not calling out the commands like this key, that key, that key they did out in the beginning, but after awhile it's like you're executive producing, you have a song in your head, you look down, you're looking at a certain area and Bam, that person inside of you does it like magic. So once you see it in Jujitsu over and you'll realize that our bodies are magical. Then a work, not just for Jujitsu but for anything. If you decided to play tennis, guess what? The longer you play tennis, the longer you put the hours in it, the better you get at most. People don't see that. Most people don't have any confidence in themselves whatsoever with anything they think they can't do that. They think that'll never happen. You can actually do anything.

Speaker 8:          00:59:42       You really can. You'll get good at anything. If you focus on it, you're, you put the numbers, you put the reps. That's what it's all about. The only thing that's different between me and a white belt in Jujitsu is the number of, of of reps that I've put in with my certain style and you know, and in Jujitsu you realize that and it brings your whole other life up because in other aspects of your life, your day job or your longterm goal, your dream, you'll realize, damn, all I gotta do is put the numbers in whatever direction

Speaker 7:          01:00:11       it is. It definitely, Jujitsu definitely shows you in any martial art and any difficult endeavor shows you what your potential is and how you can expand your potential as a human being. But what it doesn't give you is creativity. Creativity is a totally different thing that's attached to, to ambition and to, you know, focus and intensity. There's something about creativity that comes from a very pure place, but, and you could be a hard worker all you want, but you, you might not necessarily necessarily been able to be able to tap into the well of creativity. You know what I'm talking about? Sure. You gotta be born with, you're pretty creative with your moves in Jiu Jitsu. So that isn't there. Like, wouldn't there be that creativity is an art. Jujitsu is an art. I mean, martial arts are arts, you know, more ties and art. There's an art to, like, whenever I say, like I'm doing commentary and I'll say, look, look at this beautiful combination.

Speaker 7:          01:01:04       It is beautiful to me. I'm not just saying it, that's, that's the, that's an art form. That's, it just led to me, that's a painting. That's a, you know, an incredible dance. That's a, you know, that's a, a work, uh, a masterpiece. Like my favorite is when Anderson Silva finished off rich Franklin in the second fight. There's a fucking combination where like nine out of 10 shots land and he's landing punches and knees to the body and he's mixing them up and it's fucking poetry. It's ballet, you know, that's an artist doing that. Man. Jiu Jitsu is even more creative than that because there's so many more moves with kickboxing, you know, in Indian wrestling and whatever, there's, you know, there's take downs and there's controls and there's a lot of different reversals and stuff like that. But with Jujitsu that just the path to the submissions, the tree has so many branches and there's so many different ways to approach each aspect of the game. From the bottom, from the top, it does so many different sweeps and reversals and so many different half guard techniques and full guard techniques. It's impossible to come to an end, you know,

Speaker 8:          01:02:03       it's, it's out of control and, and my Jujitsu and my music, it's, there are so parallel in so many ways. It's like in Jujitsu, I am not an athlete. I'm not explosive. I am not powerful. I can't run fast. I can't jump high. I am not an athlete. Never was. Even when I wrestled in high school for a couple of years, I got away on tricks. That's, I had to think my way past the athletes and just to be able to hang with like the real serious athlete. I'm not an athlete. Same thing with my music. I am not a virtuoso at any instrument. I don't shred on anything. I just put it all together, you know? And, and it's, it's, it's a strange parallel that Ah, you know, but it's creativity. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:02:48       Because your did, you did choose a very creative Jujitsu to the most creative in my opinion. And you know, we're friends and I'm not supposed to say that cause it sounds like, oh that's bullshit. But it is, if I was just a, a Jujitsu analyst, I would say, well here's a guy who's, I mean there's a lot of creative guys, be no sham breeze, creative, you know, so many different cards were created. But as far as like putting it together in a system of all these weird different positions, in 90% of them you have invented and the ones you haven't, you know, your credit, all the different individuals that contributed to whatever move. That's a, that's an unusual thing, man. That's an incredibly prolific career of just creating Jujitsu and putting it down. I mean, very few human beings have ever done that. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:03:26       Thank you. Look at your system,

Speaker 7:          01:03:27       Mueller gear system. I mean, and, and all the different techniques that you've added to, you know, to the whole Nogi game.

Speaker 8:          01:03:33       It's a lot of God damn technique. You know what my, I think my strongest point is that I don't like being raised with just, you know, the terrible household. I mean with my Stepdad and my real dad and no one cares and then constantly watching TV with sitcoms where everything is just perfect. I just never believed anything. I thought everyone was bullshitting me. So the same thing when I came into martial arts. I'm not loyal to any martial art. I don't care. And growing up, listening to Bruce Lee and listening to what he had to say about opening your mind and don't follow one style. I was really influenced by Bruce Lee and he was right to me because my family was just not, it was not growing pains. My family was not the Brady bunch. It was terrible. So I just questioned everything. So as soon as karate, it's karate seemed good.

Speaker 8:          01:04:17       I started with karate. Susan's that didn't pan out. I saw Jujitsu, I was gone. I didn't give a shit about karate. I went to do Jitsu and as soon as I saw the Jujitsu started becoming, um, what they were claiming, the traditional martial arts were becoming just the Brazilian jujitsu became close minded. And I was like, I'm not going to key in some circles. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So some guys are love really open mind. Generally. Generally 99% of the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu community thinks 10th planet Jiu Jitsu, this mythical generally. But there are some people, you know, not everybody does that frustrate

Speaker 7:          01:04:53       the shit out of you or what, what does that feel like when you got, you know, all these guys, Vinny Magallanes, all these like high level guys, George Sada Rapa lists, you know, they, they go fucking crazy for it and they, they totally fully believe in that system. But then you've got other guys that are like saying, Oh, you know,

Speaker 8:          01:05:05       you didn't invent the, we've been doing the, what do you think about that? I love it man. I love the stronger the resistance, the longer it takes for 10 planet to become, uh, get uh, um, uh, become, uh, any, you know, not mythical as long, the longer it takes, the better. It's just going to be sweeter at the end. I love it. I love the, if there was no resistance to my philosophies and let's say in 2003 if I, when I decided not to teach with the g, I decided to open up the school Nogi and let's say Helio Gracie back then and Carlene hos. If they said, you know what? This American is making a point. The reason why Jujitsu isn't doing that good in MMA anymore is the geek. All right? Everybody is ordered to start teaching without the g. If they just all jumped on with me because I was doing this for Jujitsu.

Speaker 8:          01:05:50       I wasn't doing it to battle against the Brazilian Jujitsu. I was doing it for Jujitsu. I'm like MMA. It was doing it because that's what you believe. I was a big, Jujitsu was in my heart. Jujitsu is, I was doing it for Jujitsu. I was like, let's bring Jujitsu back in MMA. We've got to get rid of the geese. If everyone would agreed with me back then that first of all, the state of no Jujitsu would be out of this world. It would be crazy if everybody joined in and just not me and my association. If we all just agreed and you know, there would be a, you know, 500 guys, it's just like

Speaker 7:          01:06:24       Burleson as podcasts. I have no fucking idea what we're talking about. So let me just explain, uh, there's a, uh, a whole different to two different types of Jujitsu, good Jujitsu with a Kimono or a g, you know, it's like that karate uniform on and a lot of guys do that and those Jujitsu that you use Gnocchi and there's a big thing called the Abu Dhabi world championships and that's where all the best Gnocchi guys in the world fight. And the Nogi style is what you're going to see in MMA because when you see guys use a gay all the time, they're grabbing the GE and they get used to controlling their opponent with the biggie. Then when they have to fight in the octagon, they have no Geeta hold onto in. A lot of them look lost. And that's responsible for a lot of the early UFC fights having really good Jujitsu guys, but they couldn't do shit when they fell. They're back. They couldn't do anything in certain positions to handles. Yeah. There used to handle not Eddie devise the whole system entirely based on Nogi. He abandoned diggy and when he started teaching he just went total like MMA style.

Speaker 8:          01:07:19       Does he give you all the keys that he's abandoned because you have a whole closet full of ice right there. Them bitches. Think if you're wearing to 500 keys and even working anymore, what was the question? When we're talking about, we're just talking about Jujitsu, being frustrated that you don't get the credit that you deserve. I like it, man. I love him. I love what's going on right now. Is that with me in burst? Why? Why even worry about that? Right? Just concentrate, keep doing the good stuff. I love every day, man. I'm, I realized and it would if I don't, if I didn't really think about it like maybe five, six years ago, it did bother me. It did bother me that, you know, when I decided to open up a school without a geek for Jujitsu, the people that I was doing it for, they turn their back on me and they made me out to be like this trader. It's interesting. I'm a trader and I'm like, no, I'm doing this for us man. It's interesting. We were talking about how

Speaker 7:          01:08:05       growing up in a shitty household that when you have this fucked up family life and then you see bullshit on television, how it makes you question everything. You're forced to question everything. And I had the exact same experience. My life was not nearly as Shitty as yours, but there was a lot of problems. One, my dad was super violent and used to beat my mom and I saw it when I was a young kid. I saw it when I was like five. And um, I'll never forget that shit. I'll never forget thinking that my dad was like my hero. I thought, you know, my dad was like this cool guy and I saw my dad smacked my mother in the face over nothing and dropped her right in the kitchen floor. And I went running into the room to hide. And I'll never forget thinking at that moment in time, I can't trust anybody.

Speaker 7:          01:08:45       They might all be fucking crazy. Everybody's wrong. I knew there was no reason. My fault, my, this is what my mom went to go get something for dinner and she came back home with hamburger and that's why he hit her. He was like hamburger and he fucking smacked in the face. And so from that moment on, like literally, I've, I've questioned everything. That's what made me become a standup comedian. You know, people who say, Oh, were you a class clown? I mean, I said funny shit every now and then in class. But what I would really was, was the clash questioner, you know, I was the class guy. The guy would go, well, why are you even saying that? That doesn't make any sense. What about this? You know, I was, the guy would get in trouble for asking questions. Oh, that was me too, man.

Speaker 7:          01:09:21       It all depended on the teacher. If the teacher was weak and she had a big heart, I crushed. I was the loudest always causing disruptions. But if Mr Enders, he didn't give a fuck. And so I was quiet as hell. I remember this girl told me what you think, you're so quiet in here, but in Miss Aspens class you're out of control. Did I gave her a nerve? I gave to teachers and nervous breakdown this Franklin and [inaudible] and in the 10th grade Miss Aspen, I feel really well. I was proud of it back then and um, I, I wouldn't be proud of it now if I like, you know, kind of in a time machine and I went back, I would feel really bad that happened so long ago, but I think she might be alright. I got, uh, I got kicked out of school for drawing cartoons of teachers.

Speaker 7:          01:10:06       I would grow, draw cartoons, a teacher's fucking and like they're really looked like them, you know. And uh, I drew this one Spanish teacher. She, uh, I uh, had her without her makeup. I drew with she where she'd wear a ton of makeup. So I do with her makeup and then I drew one without her makeup and uh, I got expelled or suspended, rather kicked out of school. I remember like real clearly though, like the first laugh I ever got was like the first time I was like, wow, that was kind of cool. Was in a math class where a teacher was upset at me. It's just teacher. She had this really strong urban accent, quote unquote and uh, she was his math teacher and she was like, really? Um, just like, just aggressively conti. I just didn't like her. I didn't like her class.

Speaker 7:          01:10:49       And uh, I was talking apparently and she goes, miss or Rogan, since you know everything, would you like to come up here and do both of these problems with his class? So I go, would you like me to do both of them problems? And the whole place fell the fuck out. Like dudes just start laughing and slap and tables and she goes, go ahead, laugh at Mr Rogan. Mr Rogan is going nowhere in life. And uh, she suspended me. She sent me to the Dean and they suspended me for fucking just me. Come on, man. You're teaching math. You don't even know how to talk English. This is nonsense. As a dumb conversation,

Speaker 8:          01:11:23       I would shoot spit wads and Ms. Franklin. Sarah, she had a big bouffant hairdo and we would shoot speak bonds. We would do some terrible stuff. I was terrible when I was bored. When I was bored, I just did not want to pay attention. I didn't give a fuck. I wouldn't fuck around and guys classes though. I wasn't on the fuck. I'm like, I'm not Mr. Reed. My Sixth Grade Algebra teacher, Mr fucking read it was me, Bobby joys. And is this the Cambodian chick named pool? Muah. Right? Poor Melissa. It was, we laughed. He would get really mad. So it was hard. Me and Bobby tried to go above a choice and go here. Oh, Edgar Bravo. Okay. A pool. He was saying that black boys, dude, it was hard to contain. I'll never forget pool at Moma.

Speaker 7:          01:12:08       Just some something about schools, man, where you really, it's not just learning shit, you're, you're going in there and this intense environment, it's like preparing you for work. You know, you're getting prepared for like intense social environments doing shit you don't want to do around a bunch of people. You don't want to be around forced into a room together, you know? And that's a credible that we put so little effort into making sure teachers are good. I mean it's a really amazing,

Speaker 8:          01:12:30       they should get paid about the same as doctors of some sorts and these family agrees to that everybody. But if nothing's happening, no one's doing anything about everybody agrees on it, you know, it'd be cool. Why does it make pot legal and have like put 10% of pot go to pay teachers? How about that? Or they should just charge money for school. That's what I think. No, nobody would go to school,

Speaker 7:          01:12:51       man. People can't. People are barely getting by. Especially people with kids. They're barely getting by. You can't make them pay for school. But it's just incredible that we have all this money for fucking relief to Israel and all this money for, you know, the Afghan war and the Iraqi war. We got all this money, but we don't have enough money for fucking teachers. That's incredible that we care so much about our future, that we want to deal with the problems that we have right now and spend every fucking doll. We have thrown money at it, but we don't want to look at the foundation of what causes fucking problems in our own country. What causes so much crime, which causes so much civil disarray. Skulls, show retards. Somebody dummies school should have

Speaker 8:          01:13:27       some kind of profit though. You know, they should do some kind of like advertising. You're not like have banner ads. There's, you know, they need to update the school system. Probably like overhaul and change. Make it fun. Isn't it weird that it's actually weird because you're paying taxes for it, man. What if, what if there was like reality shows based on third graders? You know, we

Speaker 7:          01:13:47       need, it needs to be fun for kids. That's where kids learn. Kids learn when it's fun. Everything is not supposed to be boring. Everything is not supposed to suck. That's not natural. And the reason why kids hate it is because it feels like shit. It's not fun. There's gotta be a way to make becoming enlightened, becoming educated and you know, becoming, you know, having your, your life enriched with new information that should be fun for kids. Positive, you know, the fact that we set them up with fucking shitty teachers and shitty schools and under motivated people that can't control people like Eddie in their class.

Speaker 8:          01:14:19       Old Ladies, I'll kill an old lady dude's

Speaker 7:          01:14:25       I had this one dude, Mr. White and Mr. White was a Vietnam vet and always wanted to tell us about it. I always want to tell us about Vietnam and he, you would always snap. Like if you asked for a pencil one time we asked for a pencil, some doodads for pencil. Mr. White pulls out his desk drawer to browse it across the floor, filled with pencils and shit. Hurls this shit. He goes,

Speaker 8:          01:14:43       go get a pencil, go pick up a pencil. And the kid got up, grabbed pencil, went back at, sit down and nobody said a fucking word for the rest of the class were like this to just through a drawer filled with pencils. Like, are you allowed to do that today? That brought guy would probably be in jail, but I used to have a teacher like I would always sleep in class and he would come and full on soccer, kicked the bottom of the table so you bet Bam, you know fucking it would wake you up and scare the fuck out of you at the same time. It was the worst and it fucking hurt. It was a, it was like that much desk in between him kicking me in the fucking head. Help Mood Mr. Allen, Jason Alan's dad wrestler. But when a, when a spit Wad lady, she had a nervous breakdown and we brought in a substitute teacher, big buff dude.

Speaker 8:          01:15:30       He was going to come in and he heard about me. I wasn't going to fuck with them but I still make the class laugh. He would actually make me stand in a corner if I do, I wouldn't do anything. I was just standing there and people were laughing cause like my face. Yeah, I would just wait him and he made you stand in a corner but you didn't do anything to be made to stand in the corner. Little things with my face, like I wasn't, how'd you get stuck in the corner? I don't remember. But I do remember being in the corner and just like really being end to the wall. Like I was staring at the wall and people were still laughing and that guy said fuck this class. Cause he couldn't really do anything to me because I wasn't saying anything. I would just stand in and everybody was watching me. So no matter what I did, he just went insane too. Wow. What a nightmare. Yeah, it was crazy, man. You got a lot of pleasure out of that. Right?

Speaker 8:          01:16:18       We would turn off the light. She would have, the crazy thing is we weren't, I mean never became a comedian. I will. I did do it a little bit and I tried it nine times. How come you didn't keep going? Because I realized that just like Jujitsu, just like surfing, just like mountain biking, if you want to get really good at it, you got to spend a lot of time crafting it and putting together, you know, uh, 10 minutes, sad of 15 minutes and then I realize, wow, you can't, this isn't something that you can just get up on stage and you're a bad motherfucker. You have to carefully crafted practice it, go up to all these open mics. You got to, you know, it's a, it's an art. And I realized, man, I don't have time for another arc. Like I would like to learn how to surf.

Speaker 8:          01:16:57       I don't have time for, I would like to learn how to motocross, like with the motorcycles and jumping Dirk things and all that shit. I would love that, but I don't have, there's, there's not enough time in the day. So I decided, you know what the best move is to just fucking focused on Jiu Jitsu and music and that's it, man. I gotta I gotta I can't be spreading myself. Then Todd White told me that. He goes, dude, you're spreading yourself. Then dude, that's not good focus and I'm like, you know what I got and plus it's sucked. Big gigantic donkey balls, buffalo balls to bomb on stage and like at least half the time I bombed. I just like too nervous man. I was just super nervous. I went up there and it was just death. I'll never forget the worst time I bombed. I came off and Joe, because I was Joe's project and my Joe had shit riding on me because he was happy meat cut in line at Sunday night open mic night when there's like 50 people waiting in line all day.

Speaker 8:          01:17:53       Joe would just say put them on right before me. Like I would cut in and the comedians that go with this fucking bullshit, but Joe was running the comedy store so they would just put me in no experience ever. I go on stage and a couple of times I did our light and Joe, can I go? Oh I do. That was pretty good too. That was pretty good. We got to we, I like what you said about that. Like we said about that. Now let's do this now. Cut that out, edit this out. The worst bombing I came out, Joe said, all right, can I follow me? So he takes her to the fucking back and like I could see him thinking like, how are we going to do this? Cause it was like he had a safe space to like it was for him, you know?

Speaker 8:          01:18:24       And it was really bad. It was like the stripper, like it was like, I didn't even tell jokes, I just went on stage. I was just obsessed. Like I had [inaudible] had some good, some bits. You had some bids. The one, the two that I, that that did the best was when I talked about when I had sex with a one, one grown, a rag in the total darkness. And then when I turned on the light, it was just, just blood everywhere. That was all right. People were kind of into that a little bit. And then the other one was about my dad, the very first time I went up. That's the, gave me the confidence. First Time I went up, I talked about my dad and went to Dicky was or something. And I got a couple of laughs and I was like, Damn. Oh my God, I think I could do this. Oh Shit, I think I could do this. Fuck that.

Speaker 7:          01:19:01       Comedy Store Open Mike Night, there's an air of sad and pathetic. There's like a, a vibe in the air that's very difficult to cut through and especially during those open Mike night sets, those are, it's like, like you don't even really know what comedy is when you're doing those cause you're, you're doing them for these weird crowds that have only seen people eat shit for fucking the last hour and a half. Anybody any good, you know, I mean that's how it is in the beginning. Open Mike Nights, they're terrible. I was terrible in the beginning. Everyone is terrible in the beginning and you're, you're going, you know, there's five, six, seven terrible people in a row there. W It's weird. It was kind of, shows are so weird.

Speaker 9:          01:19:38       I had to make a choice, man. That was the last time I was on stage as the comedy store Sunday night. And I don't know, after I got off I was like, you know what, I'm just, I don't, like you said, I need to put way more energy and this and I'm not, I'm not spending three hours that night at the comedy store. I

Speaker 7:          01:19:54       think it's one of those things that it has to be a big focus of your life. You can't, I mean, even when I've put it on the side, even while I've been doing it for so long, you know, like when I was doing news radio for a long time, I was not anything new. I was not putting much effort into comedy at all. It wasn't excited about it. I was like, all of a sudden I was on this TV show and I was like, you know, going, wow, I guess I'm doing TV shows now. You know? And I'm just still going to kind of do stand up just to keep it, you know, that's my base. That's where I started, but I wasn't passionate about it. So for like a good solid two years, I just didn't write much. I didn't, I went on stage and then I bombed a couple times man.

Speaker 7:          01:20:28       And I had some people come to see me and I had a bad set and I realize I'm like, you know, I am not putting a lot of effort into this. Like this is like some weird shit where I'm like, I'm doing comedy. Like you know, recreationally every now and then. But I'm known as a comedian so I'm going up and I'm not having good sets. It's, they're not tight. And so I totally read dedicated, this is like right before my first album in 1999 and like 96 97 I had, I had some though. Those are the years, like 96 97 when I was barely doing comedy, I'd go up, I'd do a set every now and then, but I didn't give a shit about it. It's not even that I didn't give a shit about it. I was just so caught up with the fact that I was on a television show and that's where all my effort was going to. It was, it was one of the first jokes. You remember the oldest one had a gun? Oh, they're all terrible. I remember one, I remember a bad one about, um, this is my impression of a good looking girl getting pulled over by a cop. Do you realize how fast you're going? No. Do you like my tits

Speaker 8:          01:21:24       daddy? Yeah, he has a duty as a warning. That was one of my earliest bits. Oh Shit. One of my other earlier

Speaker 7:          01:21:35       that's was Julia child getting eaten out by a raccoon. That was like open like date too.

Speaker 8:          01:21:44       Oh, so stupid. I love that. That's so dumb. I mean, this is silly. This is the shit that I would think was funny when I was 21, you know, this is the, this is where law came from. And you know what's funny too is the one that another major factor was outlawed. It was always running through my mind. I was like, how can I ever be as good as Joe? You know, we were talking about we had the same. We would, if I put some time into, we would end up being kind of like that. We talk about the same things and you were just so good. You, you know, you still, I mean you're, you're fucking amazing. It was just like, how the fuck can I ever get back on? I just got to focus on

Speaker 7:          01:22:19       good to done it and anybody can do it. It's if you're funny, if you're good at comedy and your objective, you have a lot of time and you have to be objective and you have to just focus on it and just make it something that you concentrate on. You know what helps me the most is I'm listening to myself and listening to tapes and evaluating so important. All that stuff's so important. You can do it. Anybody could do it. All you have to do is just do it. It's just like Jujitsu. All you have to do is just put the energy into it, put the effort into it. You'd figure it out and not having a girlfriend or boyfriend, a boyfriend, if you're talking about

Speaker 8:          01:22:50       if your girl, some girl, if you're talking about con men here, so talking about comics, I don't necessarily think that's true. I think everybody's got

Speaker 7:          01:22:59       different situation and sometimes it's good to have a girlfriend because then you feel like you're, you have comfort. You know, I know a lot of dudes who, you know, the,

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       the world of standup comedy is like, you know, it's fucking scary to them. You know, you're out there on your own, try to make it, trying to, having someone that you live with that supports you to a lot of people that gives them energy and strength, you know? So a lot of people like they do way better having a girlfriend or being married, everybody's got their own thing. But if you have a girlfriend, she's got to be understanding that you spend all these time, all this time at the clubs. You have to be constantly working almost every night. You have to be out doing it, especially in the beginning. That will kill the relationship is it tells your social and that's material, right? Cause your social life, but then your social life becomes like the comedy club world, which is when dudes start cannibalizing. It's what I call cannibalizing is when a male comedian starts dating a female comedian, they become cannibals.

Speaker 1:          01:23:46       Start eating their own. Yeah. As soon as you start doing that you're fucked. Right. How many guys have pulled that off? There's like three Tommy Segura and his wife are both hilarious and cool. That's, that's that one works. But other than that, huh? That shit don't work son. My friend was telling me about when he broke up with his girlfriend that I, she's on, she's on a TV show, like a popular TV show and that one day he was feeling so down and he's, he comes to his apartment and his neighbors watching 24 don't say the name of this show. There's only two girls in that whole show that's guessing game now. But like how, like they had their windows open and he was just like walking up to his door and suddenly you heard is I heard a voice or whatever, like voice, just haunting him ever.

Speaker 1:          01:24:27       There's billboards when he's driving around and it was like, well that kind of sucks living in this city to the f two one point. Like, I only want to date gaffers and key grips now you now, because I, I don't want to like date and actors and have her make it big and then have her fucking everywhere I go, I go, you know, I'm already having problems like that. Being at the airport right now, you know, and seeing Whoa, look good. You look good. Is Lindsay Lohan? You know, but uh, you know, I'm talking about how high is this motherfucker. He's just, yeah, you definitely don't want very tricky. You date Angelina Jolie and the [inaudible] and she's on the cover of people magazine. Fucking some new dude. You're like, whoa. Like that shits at the airport. That's rough. Yeah, no, he grips. I just think that my, one of the reasons why I think comics should not take comics, why called cannibalism is cause you're there too much like you, you know, I don't think that's how a relationship works out well.

Speaker 1:          01:25:16       I think relationships work out well when you're different, when you different enjoy each other's company, but you're different. You're two totally different things when you're both trying to make it as a comic man. Fucking good luck. Good luck with the balance of needing this there. You know? And I'm not saying I'm a picnic, I'm not saying any comics a picnic. I'm saying a comic in a comic together. That's like two magnets, you know? I mean maybe it'll work. I mean I would never say it wouldn't work. Your situation could be totally different than mine. Especially when you're a comic that and you're in the La comic scene. It's pretty tight. So when you break up your fucking in shows with your ex, but that's what our problem with our friends. We have to, we have two friends and one friend broke up with his girl.

Speaker 1:          01:25:51       Or should I say the girl broke up with him and, uh, he was very upset by this. It was a devastating breakup. And right afterwards, our friend, a very good friend, starts dating this chick and got really creepy, but ask permission first, got permission to Fucker, which I think is the most hilarious thing, fucker. Just don't date her. Like you can't say that, first of all, I don't think you can tell anybody what to do. And then the guy chose his own medicine and so, you know, and if for the guy, the guy who wound up dating this girl who was his friend's ex girlfriend, you know, for him it's like, well, here's this perfect person for me and what I'm supposed to, you know, I'm supposed to let this go just cause some other asshole can't get over the fact that, you know, come on man, get over it dude, you would hurt it didn't have a thing together.

Speaker 1:          01:26:34       But I'm in love with her. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with her now. I can't because you got hurt feelings. Fuck you. So I could see his point of view too, but not me. I could never do it. I would not. That's to me that there's other women out there. I don't care how cool she is. You've got to respect the feelings. You want to hurt your fucking friend. You want to hurt your friend over some pussy. Especially if they were good. Since I looked at every girl that used to date one of my friends as a guy, you only rape. That's it. Rape Him. No relationships could only be a one night stand. Only in the but no, you gotta. You gotta say that's off limits forever. There's a lot of human beings in this life. You don't want to make someone upset for no reason.

Speaker 1:          01:27:12       I'm like that. You could avoid that shit. The problem is people can decide that this is the one. He's the one, you know? Especially if they can't have you bitches. Man. Do you think that celebrities, celebrity marriages, have ended up in divorce at the same rate as just regular marriages? Way more, way more way. You think so? For sure. People in this city period. That shit son, let's find out. But I would say yeah, for sure. It was crazy assholes. How many Mel Gibson's out there can keep a fucking marriage. She got out. How did Mel Gibson's wife stay with his ass for so long? That's what I want to know about. I'll a lid marriages money. Is that what it is? And he's not Gibson man. How do you break up? Braveheart is worth $1 billion. Craziest fuck uh, whatever. What are you finding? It just says Duh, Duh. No, just kidding. No it doesn't. I haven't found anything that's kind of a hard guy. Who, well, how could you even judge? I mean it just sent bright percentage of celebrities break up as opposed to percentage of civilians. Civilians.

Speaker 8:          01:28:19       Isn't it weird how um, like pick the most, uh, the biggest players of all end up like rock stars and Super Actors and all that shit? It's like they always end up marrying and settling down with another celebrity. It's like the bitch has got to be a celebrity or it's not good enough. Right? I think it's because first of all, they get sucked up into that world where that's who you're hanging around with all the time and there's an extra charge. You know, if you're dating some chick and she's on the cover of sports illustrated like holy Shit, there's like an extra jolt to that that people find attractive, especially people who are in that whole celebrity world, especially guys that can get any normal non-celebrity chick and then like a celebrity chicken. It's the same with like, you

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       know, hot chicks look at celebrity dudes way differently than just regular dudes. That's for damn sure. I mean routers are saying that 50% while nearly 50% of a Hollywood marriage or regular marriages fail that uh, 70% of Hollywood marriage.

Speaker 7:          01:29:20       Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. It's the whole idea behind it is, look, all celebrity is, is some crazy trick. You are tricked into thinking that someone else's special, especially if it's celebrity, just force a Labor Day just for the sake of celebrity. I mean like actors and stuff like that. I mean there's actors that you respect because they're talented, but it's not like, you know, like got an author, you know, like there's a celebrity author, like someone whose work was really profoundly affected you, you know, there's something, there's some sort of a special connection to that. It's like you, you have this love for this guy because of what he's produced. Like wow, you produce some amazing stuff. But there's a lot of people that are famous just because they got on a show and then they're just like reading someone's lines and they're in a movie and whatever.

Speaker 7:          01:30:01       It's like, that's a bizarre, bizarre life. You know, that life doesn't make any sense. Like your, you're treated so much better than the average person. Rose Garden. Everybody fucking loves, you know, Rosebud, Rosebud, Rosebud. My barrier and the Rosebush. You talking about Orson Welles citizen Kane talking about Mel Gibson. Crazy. Fuck. Oh, what did he say to you in the Rose Garden? Is that what he saying? Yeah, but what I'm saying is that, you know, your, your whole psychology gets fucking mangled, you know, you, you know, that doesn't make any sense. So the world doesn't make any sense. You don't have the right, your character is wrong. Your character as a human being is wrong because the amount of energy that you're getting for the amount of effort and that you're putting out is all out of balance. You know, like that's one of the reasons why celebrities go fucking crazy.

Speaker 7:          01:30:47       It's because they think the world is crazy. How could the world not be crazy? If you're kissing my ass and I'm driving a Bentley and I'm making millions and people were screaming to see me everywhere, I go out there taking photos of me. That's insane. This world is crazy. Of course you're going to become crazy too. But the thing that happens that I notice is with artists, especially when they become like super famous, there's like a burst or they can hang in there for a bit to hang in there for a few years and keep producing and then ultimately they just get soft and it dwindles off. Almost like to a person, almost to a person once their celebrity like hits that super peak, you know, they become big and famous. They can, they can hang in there and produce for a few years, but then eventually their creativity just dries up.

Speaker 3:          01:31:32       I think it's their connection to the universe dries up. That's what I think. I think they'd lose appreciation to for life. They become a Douche bag and then they just don't have the connection anymore. That's why all eyes are on the Double Rainbow Guy. Right. Like a couple of months he's gonna be like food that fucking rainbows. Shit.

Speaker 7:          01:31:52       Double Rainbow. There's a, a clip that Jimmy Kimball twittered and uh, I, I watched it and it's

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       this dude who's seen a rainbow. There's two rainbows. Yeah, he found it. He had an MMA fight, seen big fat guy and he, um, he, everyone's seen what? Double Rainbow Guy. He hasn't seen it. I haven't heard of that fucking serious dude. You can't say 3 million hits out of 300 million people in this country alone. How many in Europe and how many in Asia? Wow. If you can say everybody. Anyway, it's fascinating. This guy just goes crazy when he sees these rainbows for whatever reason. Don't do that. That to shit didn't work. It was just that video. I wasn't, yeah. Anyway, this a double rainbow guy. Famous on that. No, it's on Brian. Brian's. Brian could play. I think you can. I just don't know how to do it. Do you know how to drag this shit into Ustream? Producer Brian? A year two I think you actually have to have to video, so, oh, really? Yeah. All right. Hold on here. I thought it can show a web page that you're viewing. All right, here we go.

Speaker 10:         01:32:59       Okay. Oh,

Speaker 11:         01:33:24       oh God. Look at that

Speaker 10:         01:33:28       triple rainbow. Oh my God. Oh, double rainbow all the way across.

Speaker 11:         01:33:45       He's crying here by the way. He says it, knocked him over, knocked him down. You goes. At one point I started weeping. The energy from the rainbow knocked him down. What does this mean? What does it mean? It means mushrooms work. What does it mean,

Speaker 10:         01:34:08       right? Oh my God.

Speaker 11:         01:34:17       Probably the best bill I've ever seen. I know, but this guy sounds like he's got a bag of Leprechaun gold in his hand while Christie Brinkley sucking his dick. I'm just, yeah, there's just a rainbow, gigantic Ufo, like a hundred yards above the surface or something

Speaker 9:          01:34:31       and they're communicating. You know what's even better than that is all the music that has been coming out, and I was talking to my friend the other day, if this, this song is so great that I would actually buy the single off of iTunes and that is from some dude looking at a rainbow. He explained what song you're talking. Okay. There's a couple of these songs that have come from this video. [inaudible] song parody is one that is so good that I would, I mean that's like, well let's just, I don't know which one this is. Let's see what this one is. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       well this double rainbow dude.

Speaker 12:         01:35:03       Oh Wow. Oh Wow. I like this. Two rooms. Sounds like one republic.

Speaker 1:          01:36:14       There's actually another one that takes a whole different approach. That's my kind of like Tim and Eric Snyder. No, no, no. We don't have here. You don't hear more double rainbow songs. It kind of like scratching that double double rainbow. You know? It's like a whole difference, but I think that's auto tune. You can't fuck with that. You really like on no two songs though. That drives me nuts. I do know when brothers do it, others do it, but you right, the white guy in a rock band can do election, man. I like, that's what I like about Biggie, notorious B I g. His, it was all about the inflection, the way he would talk and rhyme and punctuate. You'd never sang. It doesn't matter. Really can't sing. I don't want to, you know, even when they sing, if it's auto tune and now really singing, I like a little Wayne's out 10 stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:37:00       Yeah, I like it. I still like it. I like, I can do this. Definitely being overused by, I mean there's a lot of music that uses it nowadays that you know, most of the time that I think is okay and it sounds better than hearing Brittany Spears going like without it, you know? Is that what you sounds like double rainbow guy sounded amazing. Can you imagine what Britney Spears could sound like? What? You know, she's already using it, dude. Yeah. You could put a lot of shit together with that for sure. It just, it just sounds gross to me. It's missing so much. I've been really getting into the black keys lately. You listen to black keys at all? Yeah, I downloaded all it. Damn. They got some good fucking songs, man. I listened to them all the way to a Ontario Improv every, uh, every night. This weekend when I was doing shows there. Every time I drove up there, listen to the black keys. Oh, I'm, this weekend I'm at, um, before I forget, cause I forgot to say at the beginning of the show. That's the ticket. I'm at the John Lovitz a comedy club Saturday night. John Love, who's my friend that I never talked to and we did

Speaker 2:          01:37:55       a season of news radio. He's a good dude. I think he's going to come down. Uh, I doubt it. I don't think he has anything to do with that place really. It just hasn't anything. It's like just his name. I don't know. Just guessing. [inaudible] um, put my name up. Dance. He got us the worst. James Cagney slash John. Love it. What was the his, his character back in the day in Saturday night live. Who would lie and say, that's the ticket, right? Any impressions I fucking suck or use your voice. Get on the horse. John Wayne, he's doing an impression of someone doing an impression of Peter Fonda. Peter Fonda, Jimmy [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:38:34       You're talking about doing an impression was born after 1960. Uh, Ari Shaffir go ahead. No, no, that was terrible. It's terrible. He's got already down. Good to it, Joe. Okay. I joked to an Ra joke, oh, you're like plugging along doing Jewish women, uh, uh, see this. This is what I look like. This is what a Jew looks like. He's always, that's called a Jew and wondering what Jewish woman looked like. Bam. Same thing. Not that good. Mumble. Mumble. Yeah. The Joey one. I've got down over decades. I've only been making fun of Ari. I can't, I can't. I wish I could. I would be doing that. I can't do, she used to have a real good Mike Tyson, but I don't anymore. Tyson's kind of easy, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, you know. That's why I never really liked impressionists because it's, there's a trick and the trick is you're like, oh shit.

Speaker 2:          01:39:47       He sounds just like that guy and that makes anything extra funny. It's like it's kind of entertaining. You put it, I can put some good material on top. Doctor Steve Berle. All right. At least I could a couple of weeks ago can, I might've lost it. Lost it. Come on here. Wait, nevermind. I have to hear it. No, no, no, not do it at that to Steve Brule. Hey, you got some vinegar on your driveway? Just put some vinegar on it. Don't be stupid. That sounds like Max Eberly. Hey, you know you might be a little knee his friend, but who cares about all that dumb. They could look at my dangerous, it sounded like that shit means a standup comedian on South Pole. He put, my dad gets on there. All the girls went to see my dad. I don't even know who he all, I don't know who you're talking about. Who's doctor? Steve Berle back to [inaudible]. John [inaudible].

I'm not too bad. I kind of an impression. I kind of understand that you're doing an impression. It's not terrible. I'll try harder next time. I'm rooting for you. So I'm doing all impressions

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       though. Like when you see like someone's act, they do like all impressions. That drives me fucking nuts. I don't want to see that. Especially when like all of them sound the same and they're only really good at the really ups like, Oh, this is pachino. Yeah. You know, it was good. Really good impressions as Jay Moore. Holy Shit. Have you ever heard was calling him his Collin Quinn is fucking brilliant and uh, his walking is really good too. He's got a really good walking. A lot of duties.

Speaker 8:          01:41:20       Oh, I got one. I got one impression, but no one would know it. But um, there was a German thrash band and the 80s called Creator. They're probably still around and they barely spoken English and I'm not even gonna do it. It's terrible. That's terrible. Well, I'm sorry. It's hard to, I'm going to do harm or do it. Yeah, go ahead man. Okay. There's my favorite creators song was called the pestilence. They don't know any English, so there's not too much banter in between songs. So here it comes.

Speaker 3:          01:48:22       Do you think the gay people have flashlights smoothies where after they're done with their flashlights to just put a straw in it and like walk around the house? It's an out of the hole. Oh Dude.

Speaker 13:         01:48:32       Brian, Brian,

Speaker 1:          01:48:35       this we, I'm sure you can just Google it, I'm sure, but what would it be? Flexible. There's gotta be some low out of flashlights. Google that. All video. Now, what's the latest? What's the latest with the real doll pipe technology. They hit a wall. They hit a wall. They hit a wall apparently according to Chris to do to worse at flashlight. The Vagina in the real doll is hard and not comfortable. It doesn't feel good. Does it feel like the flashlight? Listen man, I don't need to be fucking some rubber doll. I know it's not a person. I'm not pretending. Okay. A fleshlight to me is perfect just and it doesn't have to look like a vagina either. Stop. Just make it a whole. All right, so I don't feel it. That's making it a hole. Did I stick my dick in and I shoot a load into, I don't need to fuck some fake doll and do it doggy style and put her hands on my balls and shit. I don't need that. That's just gross. To me. That's even more gross. It's like you're pretending it's a person. I'm not pretending it's a person. I'm just trying to shoot a load here. All right. Pretending it's a person. There's just something about a fleshlight that's like, that you put on like a head, like, like a one of those helmets. Like helmet you see like a dick, but it's not yours. Obviously you see it and whatever that girl in that virtual

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       reality world, like she's suck like that flashlight that you to have it like moves on the inside. It's like controlling. And if you'd like a mouth, it grabs your, you know what I mean? It's the exact same stroke, Ej, you know, if it's going up, how cool would that be? I would use that shit program would pay like 900 bucks for that. Yeah. What helmets x, like Dan and they had a code and that code would, would transmit to the, uh, the fleshlight say if you add, uh, each video, each video was coded, you know, so you would take someone and they would figure out how to program into the computer so that the, the, the hands or whatever the fuck mechanical thing that you would have that controls to the movement on the fleshlight would move in conjunction with what's on the screen. It would be like a, uh, a basic computer pro.

Speaker 2:          01:50:29       So like if you're out of town, your wife could send, make a video for you. She could send it, you plug it in. Then how did someone interpret what she's doing? She can make a video me jerking off another dude. What the fuck are we have to be? You turn off you? Yeah. Yeah. You would ever have to be, could it be live or you'd have to be really open minded guy so I could see and I'll just jerk off and them it's way better than just porn. Yeah. Some to do that. Some something's ready guys. Why don't you guys fuck their wives? Have you seen idiocracy? No, I keep hearing about it. No, I haven't done so much. It's so much shit that people said that. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people. Oh dude, it's so, but it's good. It's by Mike Judge. But that's not an idea that is uniquely mine.

Speaker 2:          01:51:17       The idea that people are getting dumber. I think anybody, everybody who's paying attention thinks that people are getting dumber. Like a lot of people getting smarter, but a lot more getting dumber, you know? And this is not just like, you know, when I was a kid, people were smarter and all that grandpa bullshit. There was a fact that I read on the Internet that the average kid, high school kid in 1960 had 200 more words in their vocabulary than the average kid in 2010 what was the first year? 1960 yeah. I don't know if it's true. What about the new words that are add? Like with Ebonics and all that stuff and I'll slang words. There's a lot of new shit. Yeah. Do those count though? They're not in the dictionary. They don't count how the dictionary, how popular to something I have to be before it gets in there.

Speaker 2:          01:51:57       No, no, because I know there's a lot of words that you would think would be in there by now. You know? Quick. How about getting knuckles and with the explosion? Remember Joey, I thought Joey was the only one doing it. Did I make that up? No, I thought he made it, but then everyone started those things. It was like six years ago I bought Zoe made it up. What if he did and he just didn't know it? I don't think so because now you see it in movies all the time. Everybody's doing it. I hate doing it now because it feels sent don. Yeah, I do it when we get off. If I do it all the time before it was popular. Yeah. We do that all the time. We get on stage, but you know, I feel like one part of me says that, yeah, don't do it because everybody else is doing and then the party, he says, who's who gives a fuck spending the shaking hands.

Speaker 2:          01:52:37       Hey, but I do it backwards. Now. If you start with the explosion and then you go tuned to the fist, that's two creative. You're trying too hard. It's better. That's the editor in Saudi. It doesn't make sense to me to make sense to me. I want to touch them out goals and then there's an explosion. Hey, what's up? Boom. Hey, what's up? Boom. You're not going to sell that. That's not, that's how that could work, ma'am. You've got 2000 people on the want to do it. If you want to do it, go right ahead, but I think you're, what if I do it to you and you do it the other way? I think you're out of line. I think you need to abandon this. I like the faggy. What do you got like I like to do that one. I like that one. No problem.

Speaker 2:          01:53:13       No problem with dudes. Squish my fingers. When dude shake your hand. Shake your hand. I want to touch the finger tip thing where they go around the fingertip and cross your fingers like what? Are you nervous? Do you think that? I don't know what it is they're doing, but if I grab someone's hand and it's like they got it wrong, I let let up and try to like rejects it, let's fix you don't like that nervous hand Jews. I'm really getting paranoid about people's hands and stuff. Like our friend went to the apple store the other day, they totally saved his life and he was just talking about how these guys are just life like his hard drive crashed and they, the guy who just went right on right on that on the computer and he was just saying like how he was doing it and how gross his keyboard was, but the guy did not even flinch and touched it and I was thinking how many apple employees like girlfriends get pregnant from really bad fingering because they might, their hands must be like pregnant.

Speaker 2:          01:54:05       You know how much fucking calm has to be on all those girls. Fucking fingers can't survive. My keyboard has so much shit on it. He said he didn't believe it. That's obviously don't think anyone's getting pregnant, but you know how much comments on your hands after you work at an apple store. How about none? No one's coming in their keyboard. Brian. Ah, you don't ever masturbated. He never masturbating and wiped it on a towel and you still had a little bit of come around the corner and you fucking start typing your bit to income. Dude, you don't let it go to waste to what this show has gone down hill hard. We're talking about fingering loads. Brian, you hijack this goddamn shirt you hijack to show with this crazy story about getting people pregnant from touching keyboards on a banana. You're only out of banana.

Speaker 2:          01:54:54       Oh, Brian is on this crazy fucking diet where he's trying to lose 35 pounds and he won't shave until he loses the weight. So he's got this Muslim beard. He's rocking right now and he still has how many pounds ago? Oh, well, I'm down 19 pounds since June 18th and the way he's doing it is obviously unhealthy. It's rotting and well, you're the ones that can be a protein bar. I forgot though. How crazy is it? Just by 19 pounds. All the hot chicks that are just bombing you. I think that's amazing man. Just like just like that. You've got all these girls all over. You got this last one when he was fat? Yeah, I know. And now he's got dude, it's incredible. I, you know what props bro, you gotta I've never seen. What do you attribute your attractive institute? Brian, do you believe it's your sense of humor? I still suck my thumb still. My get big by their own. Their own. I like that. Brian is like the oldest child I've ever met

Speaker 3:          01:55:54       my life. You really, he reminds me of like friends that I had when I was in eighth grade. Like never grow up. You always stay with you when you got molested. What eighth grade

Speaker 2:          01:56:06       fuck are you laughing at? So that's wrong. What do you think chicks dig in you if you had to guess that real personality. Definitely. I am like real person and I opened doors for him and stuff like that. Good cleanup. God come in after the Douche bags. Right, right, right. And maybe I think guy, I think you're amazing success lately. It's only been on the last like a month where it's been incredible. I think it's because chicks like cats, you love cats. Seriously. Think about that. Think about the cat thing. I don't think that's it though.

Speaker 3:          01:56:42       Because actually most of the chicks, I hate cats. Once you date one pretty girl that all of a sudden other girls can smell it. What is your name? He realized it. Look, see you out with a pretty girl and like look at this bad motherfucker. I want him now. How did he get her? I think that, I think a lot of it and this city is just people fucking like taking care of girls because like I know so many girls that I talked to their boyfriends or like, you know, fucking freaking out about all of garden. Like you know like can you pay this? Can you, you know, like they, they don't get taken on dates, you know, they don't get treated like how they want to be treated out here because everyone's trying to survive out here.

Speaker 2:          01:57:18       Girl, I saw you with last week. I swear to God, I swear to God I didn't see what that would have thought she was Jessica Alba. You know what I'm saying? And I'm like, what the fuck is going on with Brian Vegas? Like I'm seriously thinking about getting a cat. I'm not even kidding. I'm not even kidding. Strong words cause Eddie doesn't even like cats. I like cats. I,

Speaker 3:          01:57:36       my new one's pretty sweet man. The grind of fucking relationships. Finding someone, Brian, you're single man right now was I feel like it was fucking great. Doesn't it? Until you clean out your iPhone of old pictures and you're like, oh Luca doesn't his kits. I need an I break up for apple. Once you break up, if the text by face your ex girlfriend and it destroys everything or puts it in, we'll go back together next week. She goes to Jews. I break up, they got time machine time machine and I break up and go back breakup. We were only taking a break. We were breaking up right now easier. There's easy it is to just flip them at the, which the craziness argument you've gotten a chick with recently, recently, recently over the last 10 years of your life? 10 years craziest. I'll just give him some room so the girls don't know he's talking about them.

Speaker 3:          01:58:28       Uh, last, I know you've had some doozies getting, got some doozies getting a tattoo behind my ear of a heart or something like that. Yeah. This one girl I dated, she wanted within the third week she to, I get matching tattoos behind her ears and I'm like already, we've only been dating for three weeks. And she goes, she goes, if you've got me. And I'm like, wow. Was like, okay, that sounds good. Cause I was thinking I'll just get it lasered off, you know, whatever happens. But like we were really close to actually doing that. How much do you regret not doing? Wow. Huh? Do you know? I uh, I don't think I would ever do it. I think if help is actually on the way to the Tattoo Studio, I would have just like chloroform or something like that in terms of that. But what if you know you were in the moment and she went first and you're getting and you had a couple of Japanese is spoken a little sign on top of doing it. I could see you doing it. Laughing about it. I tell you we do that. That's so crazy.

Speaker 7:          01:59:21       No, she wanted a mark. You see so many women when you get involved in relationships, we want to make sure that you're for real.

Speaker 3:          01:59:27       Yeah. You want to make sure you're like a test for real. You in it for real. Are you in it for real? For Real? Yeah. How about, I was talking about this on my message board today. How about dudes who fucking share a Facebook page with their wife? Some fucking guy sent me a message. You know it's like Bob and Jennifer Mckella Han and I'm like, what? You share a Facebook page with a chick? I have this ex girlfriend that I love. She's a great person to talk to and stuff by. Her fucking husband is addicted to Farmville. So like all day long, it's Farmville, this mafia wars, this. And I'm just like, I'm like texting her or sending her a message, like, would you fucking stop like telling me how much oranges you have and stuff like, and go, okay, this is somebody, I'm sorry this is so and so's boyfriend or husband. Uh, she, do you want to talk to her? And I'm like, no, I can't. You just have your separate fucking Farmville account and just get out of her. I'm so confused. The farm each other's messages on Facebook like, hey, someone's Heather or fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:00:27       So it's so, so and so. You're the worst. What? Dunkin? Yeah. So, so, and so, uh, just got a brand new horse in their stable, you know, like a teller. So every time you play this game at updates, your Facebook updates your Facebook automatically. Oh my God, that's so good. And they share inboxes together. It's like, dude, you don't have any life anywhere. I can't. What if I just wanted to send, Oh, you look cute in that one picture. He goes, dude sent me anything, an email

Speaker 7:          02:00:53       message on Facebook and the message was he came to the Ontario show and he said, I saw your show. Did you ever consider the possibility that Jesus was real and that he was who he says he was and I automatically dismissed him? I'm like, first of all, it's a silly question and second of all, how can I debate a guy who's got a fucking Facebook page with his wife? Like, you're on your own dude. Good luck. Have a good time. But we can't have any conversations. I can't have a serious conversation about anything. I mean, even if you're like goddamn scholar and you know and you know and you're, you're a brilliant person and knows a lot about the history of the, you know, the, the I, the origins of Jesus. I can't talk to you about that. You got to fucking Facebook page with the chick, dude. Does that drive you nuts? Give a call girl or a dude rather. And his girlfriend answers the phone. What the fuck

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       is that? Oh, what is that? That's the guy trying to prove his love. Yeah. My password to my Facebook, I swear I call it, you know what, that's probably like getting back together type shit. Girl breaks up with guy and they're like, I'll do anything. I'll do anything. Cause at that point you got, you'll do anything. How about giving your fucking password, your Facebook, your Twitter, all that shit. Let me check out them direct messages. That's probably what it is. I called Opie opie and Anthony is chicken. Answer the phone. A whole call the cell phone. Who is assistant? Hey, maybe told her. Answer it. You know, especially if you don't know who the fuck it is. You know, you see some, you know phone number and you're not even sure who the hell it is. Maybe. Maybe he didn't give you the whole phone. Maybe that was a whole phone. Maybe that's why she was saying maybe that was a ho or maybe that wasn't the whole phone because you're not a Ho and so he doesn't care who answers the real phone, you know? Oh I see. I don't think he rocks it like that. He just had a kid to Eddie Bravo. Someday you're going to have kids. What are you thinking about that you feel extra pressure even thinking about that, considering how fucked up your childhood was?

Speaker 8:          02:02:49       I did growing up, I really thought that hey, there might be a chance that I don't give a fuck about my kids because my dad didn't get by me. I mean I'm the, I was like scared. Like that would kill me if my father thought or if my child thought of me like I thought of it. Think of my father that would fucking destroy me. Saw that I was scared of having kids most of my life, but I almost had a kid. I thought I had a kid then, you know, we had the DNA test, but I had a kid for three months. I played the daddy and that's when I knew I could, I could, I could, I would love my kid no matter what. That was a test. I thought I had a kid for three months.

Speaker 2:          02:03:22       What was it like when you walked away? After three months?

Speaker 8:          02:03:24       I didn't walk away. After three months I stayed after we found out it wasn't mine. I stayed and I hung in there as long as possible, but the chick was just so, uh, um,

Speaker 2:          02:03:35       uh, she just, it just

Speaker 8:          02:03:37       do not fucking work, man. You know how that goes. Yeah. And I had to make a choice. You know what the craziest thing is when we finally did break up, I'd come, I came back like a maybe two months later to see Jake and he, he still remembered me is to remember, but it was kind of like, fuck where you been for two months. And then I came back like six months later and when I came back and he really did recognize me, like the girl had a pullout, like pictures of us at the zoo. Remember? He's the one who took you to the zoo, remember? And he's like, Dallas, like a fuck. You don't even know me. God Damn, those motherfuckers won't forget you

Speaker 2:          02:04:15       if you're not around for like six months. Has the mood. Yeah. Then I realized, you know, once he started forgetting me, then I realized, you know what? I could just step away from this. Now. It'd be a good idea just to, just to get out of this. He doesn't remember miss six months off from seeing a baby. Yeah. Yeah man. He was like, it was like this happened when was like one, one and a half, something like that is walking around, you know? And then he just started forgetting about me. There was a trip and then I just backed out. How many times have you thought a chick was pregnant and wasn't? Dude, I didn't want to talk about that. How much does not even talk about crazy shit like that man. Ugly. Yeah. We should also say we're going to be on another podcast. Oh yeah, we're going to do Doug Benson as podcasts and were like two hours. We got a dirt through traffic and,

Speaker 7:          02:05:07       well it's five now. We're all right. And we got to hit down to the UCB to do the Doug Benson podcasts tonight. Crazy. We hung out with Doug when we were in Vegas. He was there for some poker. And so what he came to show it the house of Blues and we hung out and then we, he came to the UFC the next day too. He's a good motherfucker and he's the reason why I had to make a fan line cause I fucked up and twittered my number, my number, I thought to him, I thought it was twittering it direct message. Right. It was a repliers. I've twittered just a straight message to the whole fucking world. So I had to get a new phone.

Speaker 2:          02:05:38       But you gotta do son. But so we're going to go do the Doug Benson podcasts right after this. Anything else we should talk about before we wrap this pitch up?
