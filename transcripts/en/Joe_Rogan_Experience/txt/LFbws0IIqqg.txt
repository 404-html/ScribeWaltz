Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Good googly move. Me Ladies and gentlemen actually lie. That's it. Actually live. It's that easy. We don't fuck around anymore, man. That's pretty cool. It's beyond cool. Um, this video that you gave me, let's get right to it. Yo. First of all, I love the characters and I see a reality show in your future. I see a parody of, of, of, uh, like a duck dynasty type moonshiners type of situations are real far better with music. Okay. Fuck it. Just genius guys who live out in the desert who just happened to make amazing music and be completely retarded and think they're, I think they're a punk rock band. No, that's fucking great. It's, it's really interesting what you're doing. I love how you're, you know, you don't have any roles. We just do whatever the fuck you think is interesting, creative and mix the two of them together.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       I mean credit, you know, credit where credit is due when it, when it comes to working with Lauren Milligan and Mike King, uh, her husband, uh, large, just like, she'll just go off on a tangent and I'll just, just film it. And you know, and we just kind of go with it. So if you pick the right wig for the bright tangent, then you just go, I like what you did to, or you're mixing different styles of music, you're mixing like legit country music and then some of the songs sound almost like tool. You know, some of the sounds have like your same type of vocals that you would, one of your tool songs, but it's just got this completely different extra vibe to it. Yeah. I think, uh, I think there's a, there's a lot of flexibility just because we are kind of a moving target.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       So why don't we start to kind of get inspired in some direction. We're not where they can find to, you know, I love slayer, but slayer. Slayer, right? Yeah. They're not gonna all of a sudden put out a country record. Yeah, no, that's kind of one of the cool things about, I really enjoy what you're doing that you just do whatever the fuck you want to do. You don't, you don't have a box that you have to fit in. You're just doing what you feel like doing. Like, I know what it never expect you wearing a wig and playing this character. I mean, he calls he fucking, you ride it too man. It's not like you just like play it at the beginning. No, I fucking keeps coming back and it's really funny. Shit man. It's really funny. Shit. Thank you. What does, what inspired you to make like a half country, half comedy half?

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       You know what I mean? It's like, it's just this, I think just watching, you know, I think we talked about this last time like a Monty python movies, right? They're just, there is no, you can't really pin him down and like the meaning of life just, you know, it's, that's Kinda how we did this new DVD is there's a whole, the whole documentary is at the beginning, you know, when you go, what, I'll watch the DVD again. You can actually skip the documentary if you want to, but it was important to see the documentary and see, you know, Billy Dee and Hildy Burger, uh, so that you understood when they came back up later in the actual show. Who the hell? Who the fuck is that? If he didn't, if he didn't see the documentary, you don't understand where those people are when you do the live shows. Do you play the documentary first? That's our opening band. It's a great idea, man. And the live DVD that you found, was that in Phoenix? Did you film it in Phoenix? Phoenix? Still repping Arizona baby. That's where we are. If you've seen the, uh, there's been a lot of camera trap photos of Jaguars are starting to cross the same paths from Mexico into the United States. That the, uh, the drug guys do jaguars the cars. No, no, no. Jaguar is in the native North American giant cat.

Speaker 2:          00:03:36       Yeah. Yeah. There's, uh, there's, well we have like, I guess are they called Pomona's or, yeah, the mountain is up around us, but we haven't actually, I haven't actually seen the jaguars coming out.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       Yeah, there's not that many of them and they're starting to take photos of them on camera traps. Apparently a long time ago they were native species in North America. Now they're starting to make its way

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       through your, your town. Excellent. Mm

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       indeed. So a is winemaking season over for you now?

Speaker 2:          00:04:05       Yeah, I just wrapped up, uh, had a good year. A lot of, a lot of interesting challenges, a lot of stuff that came up that um, I wanted to try, um, stuff that was going to give me a hard time kind of giving me trouble.

Speaker 1:          00:04:18       Well that's another perfect example of you just not fitting in a box. Oh, he makes wine. Like you just, you don't just dabble in it. You have a fucking vineyard, like a full time set of employees, a vineyard. You produce an excellent wines, a bunch of different ones. It's really good stuff. You know what you're doing. It's, I mean, you just threw yourself into wine maker.

Speaker 2:          00:04:39       Okay. Yeah. I mean that's one of those, you know, you could pretty much read the back of east packet to figure out like what to do to inoculate fruit. But you know, to really actually learn how to make wine, you just got to dive in. You know, you can go to explode, you can go to college to, to get all the nuances and be taught how to make wine with fear in mind, but just dive in and make it. It's really, it's not that difficult to get over the first basic comp of like the one oh ones of it. It's not that hard. Then you know, after that then it's like the nuances, the, you know, the upper percent of just intuition and instincts, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:05:16       Do you mingle it all with the people in the wine world? Like do you, do you communicate with other people in the wine industry and gas guys at speed

Speaker 2:          00:05:24       dial that I know that are world class wine makers from around the world and if I have a, I have a question that I think that they can, that they've seen the answer to or seen that challenge, we're seeing that hurdle. I will not even hesitate to text or call or write or email or you know, something just to go, okay, so here's the, here's the challenge. I'm your, or here's the thing, I'm going to try and based on, you know, the kind of fruit that we get because the fruit we get is not like it would get in Napa or get in a necessarily get in, uh, New Zealand. It might be more specific to like Adelaide hills but not necessarily the Barossa, you know, so there's, there's, you know, different stuff, parts of Spain, maybe parts of Italy maybe.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       Do you do anything to your soil or do you just let it be what it is? For the most part, you let, you know, you have to kind of give a,

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       I'll give it some, some food now and then some kind of nutrients that are, that are not going to come. They're not going to like cripple, you know, you don't want to give it steroids or anything like that. I get it. But you want to, you want to give it something that it needs. If it needs a little extra doses.

Speaker 1:          00:06:28       So what do you do? Do you add like minerals or, yeah, yeah. I guess if there's something that it's kind of short on and how would you know

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       petioles you take the, you know, samples from the plant, you take samples from the soil. Uh, we have, uh, for moisture we'd take it to have a pressure bomb, the pressurizes the leaf to see if it, how much women wash straight actually needs today.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       Wow. You give it like, if it wants 10, you give it nine. Yeah. That's a thing about the grapes for wine. They're supposed to suffer a little bit. Right. Why is that? Uh, it just, it just, it just gets some stronger. I mean, you know, you train Jujitsu that's there, you know, there's suffering involved. Yeah. I couldn't get anywhere unless you are pushed a little bit. Even as a grape, even as a grape. How many, even as a salary, Joe, even as a salary. I see, I see. Now it all becomes clear. How many years you've been doing this now? Uh, I broke ground and around 2001, 2002, um, made my first wine in 2004. I find that absolutely fascinating. I've never once heard of a, a Rockstar who decided to not just make wine. Like, I mean, I suppose Sammy Hagar has it Tequila, right? How much is he really involved in it? Is Sammy out there harvesting at Nga Bay? You know, is he a, is he pressing it and I'm saying, yeah, I don't know. Think so. Okay. I don't think so. He's definitely not doing what you're doing, man. You're, you're, I mean, cause you know, for me, I have, I have, uh, my staff

Speaker 2:          00:07:59       sitting room. So basically come to Jerome. There's like, you know, there's a staff of people that, you know, of course rotate. But, uh, we have Chris Turner's like my right hand man and the vineyard. I'm not a vineyard guy. I'm, I'm in the cellar. So Chris has his team of people in the actual vineyard making sure that they all have their finger on the pulse of what I'm looking for in the grapes to make the wine. We have, of course our shipping staff and you know, the business affairs managers and stuff. But in this, in the cellar, it's just my wife and I, it's just us making the wine, uh, pressing the grapes and acculate ing. So there's not actually a staff of people in the actual seller. Cause that's my house. Wow. So it's just us doing it. So I don't think people quite understand like, uh, he can't make it. It's harvest. So wanted his employees handle that. There's, I don't quite think he'd been listening to me. There's nobody in the cellar but me. I mean, we have a couple guys. I have a friend down the street that comes up and cleans up after me. Um, have a guy that comes out at the beginning of the season, I'll buy some new equipment that I don't know how to use. I Bill Greg makes that work. He'll go, okay, I'll read the directions. We hate reading directions. So I'll just have Greg figure out how to make that, make that go.

Speaker 3:          00:09:07       How do you piece together a team? Like when you decide that you're going to start making your own wine, you, you get a piece of land, you decide where you're going to grow grapes. You decide here, how did the fucking piece together a team to create wine.

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       Anything else? It's hit and miss. You got to just figure out who has natural, you know, natural talent toward it or is it ready or willing to do all the work if you have any, if they're not even naturally. I mean my wife doesn't, she's not a chemist, but she works the lab. She went, I went and guess what you're doing. So she's like, I am.

Speaker 3:          00:09:38       So you're nine years into production essentially, but the 10 1112 years into this project, is this still challenging for you? Do you still enjoy,

Speaker 2:          00:09:47       you know, every, every year that I'm making wine on my, on my own, you know, previous years, like from Oh four up to about a 2009 I had other people, I was kind of like looking over their shoulder and trying to be involved in doing it, but until 2010, you know, like part the, but the part of 10 until I was actually in, you know, doing it myself. Uh, you're only going to learn that way. And so, you know, that's, it's just, you just dive in basically.

Speaker 3:          00:10:14       Wow. And now how many months out of the year does it take to do that and then the rest you devote to whatever else? Like postal for anything else if you like doing

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       and anything else? Yeah. Um, yeah. Uh, don't even look for me on August 1st August 1st and November 1st. Don't even look, I'm not around. I'm dug in.

Speaker 3:          00:10:34       So for four months you're gone. Yeah. Yeah. Do you enjoy that, that you're committed to this like four month project, that, that list for four months you're accounted for. That's it. This is your life.

Speaker 2:          00:10:45       Yeah. I mean it's, it's nice to know that, you know, I'm going to be sleeping in my own bed, right. And it's, you know, it's hard work. You're up, you know, I'm up at six 30 doing punch downs and just checking things out and make sure everything's, you know, not, you know, something didn't blow up or I forgot to seal something. So it's leaking or you know, there's just those, those tragic things that kind of happened in the end. The seller that you look over and like the spouse wasn't shut and there's like peanut grief pouring onto the ground and like foc, bonehead, move Brent over and shut it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:15       This, that, that it's, it's such an interesting idea, but I love the fact that you figured out a way as a musician to guarantee that your home for four months, you know, like people don't know the musicians are, comics aren't, that fucking road gets sad man. It gets so boring and it gets so, it gets, it gets grueling body,

Speaker 2:          00:11:35       you know, as you go forward in time, uh, there's no going back in time. What was your back doesn't get it. You know, it doesn't get stronger from the journey. It gets weaker.

Speaker 3:          00:11:45       Yeah. Especially the travel. We were talking about a guy that you know that had a blood clot from an airplane ride and was feeling shit. And I was telling

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       you how I flew back from England and got sick. The flights, every flight is like going on a bender. It's like getting hammered. Every one of them is just like, just wrecking your body like Ah, and skidding into home plate and it was fun. I'm laying in the bed, not, yeah, it's very, very weary. Okay. It really beats you down. So then when that's over, November's done. Dee Dee had just chillax for a little bit or uh, last couple of years. Now I would jump right into, you know, doing some stuff with perfect circle or puts a for if the guys were writing with the tool,

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       work with them or maybe we go out and do some quick tour or something, but, and that's all it, just to kind of keep it alive and because you've done some work that you need to kind of tidy up and do something with. Like we came up with conditions of my parole and I had to, like, I had to, I had to promote that records. I had to get on the road right away in November. Uh, that was a couple of years ago. So,

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       and then between you add some Jujitsu? Yeah, that was the fun part this year. It's like, watch it, like

Speaker 2:          00:12:53       poor Matt Mitchell from poster for you. Came out to like record some tracks with me and uh, you know, I'm up at six, seven out there doing my thing. And that would come in and like, we tried to like work on a song or work on some tracks and he was helping record some stuff. And, uh, and then I go, I gotta go, I gotta do the, I gotta quickly destemmed these, this fruit. And then at 1145 I got to drive down the hill cause I gotta go do Jujitsu from noon to one and then I'll be pack up here at one. Okay. I'll be here at one 15. We can do a vocal, but then I got to press the Chardonnay. He's like, who the fuck are,

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       are you, and he's known you from long before this? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I toured with him. First Time I met him was on a perfect circle tour. So what do these people think that I've seen you prewired and post one or they like, did they think of originally like, God, this is just his new thing. He'll do it for a little bit and then it's probably, you know, it'll last a year or so, 12 years later, 12 years later. How many bottles do you make a year now? Uh, I did about, I'm horrible mass. Um, this year I did about six and a half, 7,000 cases in my cellar. Holy Shit. That's incredible. How many acres are you growing on?

Speaker 2:          00:14:13       Uh, in northern Arizona, I, right now I have planted, uh, 40, just under 40 planted. Uh, and only about 10 of those are actually producing at the moment. I'm southern Arizona. Uh, my sister company, Arizona's stronghold. I have access to fruit from our vineyards down there. So, uh, there's a lot and there's a lot of growers all over the state. Um, and there's growers just over the border into New Mexico as well, just to it just over from those counties. So there's also like kind of a mirror image, a terrain over in New Mexico with even more established vendors. And we have an Arizona,

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       so 40 acres you're, you're planting, but only 10

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       of them are, you're actually harvesting fruit from and probably by next year I'll see a little bit more from the other 30. And then by, you know, by 2015, I'll see full production from everything.

Speaker 3:          00:15:01       How does that work? Do you have to do something to soil? Do you have to just get you to the grapes used to it?

Speaker 2:          00:15:05       That and the ticks takes you three and three to four years to see fruit off the vine. Once you plant that, it's real. It's a commitment in time for sure. So you

Speaker 3:          00:15:14       planted and it, is it just a matter of it growing or is it

Speaker 2:          00:15:17       and establishing you want to make sure an adult depends on what you're kind of going for. You know, if you want, if you want to plant like tighter spacing and set free a little earlier on the plant when it's younger so it doesn't quite get big and it kind of like almost stunt its growth in a way. He gets some really concentrated fruit on, on a, on a smaller, on a smaller vine. But you've seen some that are like these huge old school of vines. There's different schools of thought on that. You got guys that pull out everything and, and uh, 20 to 30 years I'll just pull everything out and start over cause the vine might produce, you know, an eighth of what it was producing when it was younger. And if it's not great, I mean if it's like prove to these producing an eighth of fruit and it's fantastic, just undeniable fruit, well yeah, hang onto it. But if it's not, most guys are pulling it out. Oh let's start over. Do you find that this whole potatoes, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:16:08       the process of creating this new thing and then, and then getting involved in this completely new endeavor, does that do anything to the rest of your creativity? Do you find that it opens up new possibilities for other things that you,

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       I get a, I mean it opened yet it opens up other stuff. Cause you know, when you're, it's a whole different kind of creativity and a year when you're, when you're in the seller and you were just hovering over some of these wines, you, you're having to be kind of, you know, you have to have the tech, you know, the technique down. You have to understand the process that you're going through, but you're also have these opportunities to go, okay, I have to make a creative decision right here. There's like a, there's a challenge that's come in. Something comes in extremely ripe that you didn't expect that coming in extremely ripe because they just were, the numbers were just all over the map. The sugars are extremely high and it's just probably an IB not finished fermenting. It's so ripe and then you have something come in, it's a completely under ripe and you go, hmm, if I put these together, they're right there, right at the right number that I want rather than trying to finish something that's not high enough sugar and something that's way too high sugar. You know, there's little moments like that that happen that you just didn't expect and you can't plan. It's just chaos and you just have to just navigate the chaos. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:17:19       Would you like a big fan of wine before you did this? Or is this just something that you, you just decided to slowly but surely step into?

Speaker 2:          00:17:27       Um, I guess I had a great grandfather who made wine in northern Italy, but I didn't know that until I was actually planting grapes. Wow. So he just dove in, dove in? Yeah, I know, but I was into wine a little bit, you know, back in, I lived in Boston for Awhile, so I, you know, I enjoyed wine with my friend Kurt. He worked at a nice Italian wine shop, so he'd always bring stuff home on the weekends and we'd, you know, he would grill and I would drink this wine and you know, let you years later and go, oh wow. That was pretty, I think we were drinking some pretty awesome wine. Yeah. I don't know shit about one. I have a really good friend who's a, he's a real connoisseur. He has this gigantic room in his house that he constructed that it's digitally set to a certain temperature.

Speaker 2:          00:18:09       And I mean, he has this ridiculous clash in the La area. Yeah. He lives in the Palisades and he's got, I mean, he built this room onto his house before he moved into this house. Mean he's a, he's a nut and you know, he can look at blind lists and tell you what's good this year, what's nine? He's constantly on top of it. And he took me to a wine testing for his birthday, wine tasting. You know, they brought up different flights of wine and it was all good to me. But hearing describe it, it's so, it's baffling. The fruity taste, the Tannin, the smokey mic, but like the more people don't really get does it, you don't have to know any of that stuff. If you have it like a good, if you know somebody you know that's uh, oh, it's a cool shop or has a nice tasting room, like, you know, uh, Matthew over at Corvelle.

Speaker 2:          00:18:59       If you just go talk to Matthew about what they'd have on their list or go to silver lake wine or talked to Randy or April of George to go, okay, what's open? You know, when you had their tastings and they just take notes on the of stuff in front of you. Okay. Write down did I like it? Did I not like it? That I like it, that I not like it. They just write down what you liked and we get, didn't like and why? If there's just a couple words like, I didn't like that because of this or I like that because of this, write it down. And then you just show them like write down, have them write down what the wines were that you had and not so much for you but for them and come back again and do it again at for some other flight there or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:19:39       And once you have some notes down, they're going to start to get, figure out what you might like and then they're gonna go, okay, try this or try this and then come back and tell me if you liked it or not. I like, I tend to like, like the fruity or like a Pinot noir. I like that kind of wine and just see again does, you know, don't even gravitate towards the peanut, just like just taste stuff and then write down what it was and start kind of keeping a log or something of what that was. Because if you have a pretty good intuitive person working at one of those wine shops, they can kind of go, okay, having, having poured you have, you know, a hundred little tastes over the last couple months, we've narrowed down what you like. Do you see yourself going into whiskey next dude, I love Angel's envy. Angel's envy. What does that I can't, can I plug? Sure. Okay, why not? What is it? It's, it's, it's a, it's a mellow, a bourbon aged in port barrels. It's super mellow in port barrel. So they take the, the older port, the port it pours out. Yeah, there is a bigger list. Wow. About that. By the barrels from somebody. How does that affect the taste? Like what is it supposed to do to the table to tell you? I'm not a guy, but

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       I like that one. That's it right there. Angel's envy. There you are. Hello. Do you see yourself doing anything else? I mean, any other crazy ideas you have cooking in the back burner that you might get onto? I Cook a little bit, but uh, I don't think I would actually, guy wouldn't go be a chef. I would probably open up like a I. From that though, I could totally see you becoming a chef. So were just, well, it started out I just wanted to open up a restaurant and one then here I am. Wow. No wants pizza and always in Arizona. Yeah. I've got a couple, got a couple of things up my sleeve and Arizona brick oven, pizza place, northern Arizona. It's pretty fucking bad ass. It's do you live near the mountains or near Sedona. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's an interesting spot.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       Yep. A lot of Weirdos in Sedona. You think a lot of people, a lot of people believe in crystal power. Yeah. It, the people you just reach up and grab their leg and pull them down to the ground. It's, it's to hear what happens to people. How does that happen where you get a spot like Sedona for say where it just people gravitate towards their healers in quotes? I don't know. I can't, I have no answer for that. I have no answer for it either. I've always been fascinated though. It was like how does a spot like that come to be? And what do you mean you can, if you've been into, you know, a decent size city, there's always going to be a spot. Like for example in La. Okay. You got Millie's over on sunset. What's that? And silver, like Millie's Millie's cafe.

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       Millie's the restaurant. It's a little breakfast place over on sunset. That's always going to have a gathering of people in that spot. Yeah, it's okay. It's like that moment. I'll never heard of it. Millie's Millie's on sunset. Yep. You know where, um, sunset and one, you know, uh, just say silver lake just to, yes, in silver lake, just a side of a silver Lake Boulevard. There's a lot of fucking cool spots down there a lot. But that's the one that just like no matter what, no matter who owns that spot, there's always going to be people gathering in that spot for a cup of coffee or like some kind of opiate know sunrise kind of event, a Brunch, you know, even if it's not called brunch Sunday, just like something, even if it ends up being a doughnut shop, there's going to be, there's always going to be something there where people gather in that spot and you kind of have to assign some kind of value to that energy you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       It's the Dona until like those little, we'll call them for Texas. There's like a, there's some kind of gathering vortex at that spot. Well, I think a lot of those places, especially in La, they have this deep history of people returning to these spots and then it's almost gets like seeped into the wood places like the comedy store or ever eat it. Dantanna's no, fantastic place. It's one of the oldest school old school restaurants in Hollywood. It's on Santa Monica, uh, right near a boys town and it's this like super old school bar slash restaurant that hasn't changed the menu since 1966 or something like that. Cooks a fucking tremendous stake, has amazing pasta. The waiters all wear Tuxedos. It was just one of those like super duper old school spots. That's cool. Yeah. And when you go in there, it's like canter's Deli. It had been a canvas telling. Yeah. Yeah. That feel like that place has been used man. It's just uh, it's in the feel it. Yeah. You know, you can't get that in a new place. Cantors in years. That's a classic as a classic comic spot because it's open 24 hours a day. Go there all the time after food or after, uh, after shows. Yeah. Cause the Largo is right across the street. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. La has so many of those really cool old school spots that I've just been around for so long.

Speaker 2:          00:24:44       I think that's, and I think, you know, back to our SEDONA conversation, it's probably some version of that where those spots just kind of have that energy. And you know, just in general, uh, I was, I was driving to a la from kind of the Sedona Prescott area and I forgot that the RNL fires, they were, they had kind of had the road closed off so I couldn't go that way, but I thought it, you know, a month had passed and I figured everything was fine. It wasn't fine yet. So I get to a certain spot and there's of course a guy standing there, gone psych, you can't go this way. So I had to backtrack and then I kind of took another route that took me farther, kind of back tracked West Ish and kind of came back in. And, uh, there's an area out in that way where it's basically, it's that kind of Sedona place where you go there, but there's no people, there's no cell signal, there's nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       It's just these crazy moon rock, you know, setting with these, uh, Joshua trees and Cacti just as far as the eye can see. And it's like these crazy rolling hills who this, it was like the coolest hour and a half, you know, added hour and a half to my trip. It was completely worth. It just goes. He just, and that, when you see that kind of place, you can go, you can see how somebody who, you know when Sedona isn't there yet, you can see how somebody would go, I want to start something here. There's an energy here that I want to like, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:26:16       did you see that video of those Doby Boyscout guys who tipped over those hundred million year old rocks? Did you see this? You know the, I think it's called Goblin Canyon. There's an area of Utah that has these incredible, did they find the price? The video, these dumped fox, they made a video of pushing over this hunter. The rocks fall on them. Unfortunately. No. Do is it to pull it up? Yeah, it's too late. I don't think you can glue it back, but what? I mean is it too late to, to kill them? I didn't say that all loud. Um, I did. Um, yeah, they're too stupid to be held responsible unfortunately. But they did get fired from the boy scouts.

Speaker 4:          00:27:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:03       Which, yeah, that sucks. But the point is, it was one of these, a really cool ancient structures where it's this, this, this giant like top, like a mushroom cap almost. And it's just all this wind and sand has eroded it to the point where this is just like this little peak that's holding this thing in place. And it was so fucking cool looking and these tools just decided to, to tip it over. Did you find it? What's that adds on all these, there's ads on them. Of course there are, because that's what happens when a video gets 10 million hits in a week. Oops. Yeah, no worries. No worries there. For me, those structures are so cool though. It's so, it's so interesting when you see like something that's been created by hundreds of millions of years of erosion. I was in a, um, uh, a cave in Colorado. There's the thing, these, these things. So that's like, that's 170 million years old or something like that. This structure and these fucking idiots push this thing along.

Speaker 5:          00:28:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       I mean, it's like a Coen brothers movie. We have now modified Goblin valley problem. Valerie exists with the, this boulder down here,

Speaker 4:          00:28:24       the bottom hold muscles.

Speaker 1:          00:28:28       You're hired, you're pushing it off. Yeah. So sad.

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       But those things, so the, the, the, the, that area, Goblin valley is a, another one of those sort of, those spots where you drive through it and it's just has such an inward draw. Any interesting those fuckheads hopefully, you know, people will learn from the reaction to this and it'll never happen again. It's still a lot of really cool shit shit there, but right. Are you a one time, um, when I'm one of those, um, uh, publicity flights for the blue angels, they took us, uh, uh, you go down to San Diego and then from San Diego you cut across like deep into the desert and it looks like fat. It has all these incredible rocks and weird formations and desert and there's something bad ass about that man. Is that this is the area. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of spreadable. Yeah. And it's all just wind erosion caused all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:29:31       That's pretty amazing. Yeah. The, the desert south west of, of this country has some really fucking interesting landscape and fascinating energy to too. I'll try to, I'll try to text you or email you with the, with the, uh, the exact area that it was, that I was driving through. Cool. But you, you know, you can barely see them. Make sure you bring water because for some reason, if you get, if your car breaks down, there's no signal. You're not getting out of there. Yeah. What do you do? You have to wait for someone to arrest you. There's, you know, there's people out there that you can, you got, you go by ranches and stuff throughout in that area. But uh, yeah, no. Yeah. That's when counting on humanity gets very sketchy. You don't realize how vulnerable you are until your car runs out of gas in the middle of the desert and you're like, oh shit.

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       Okay. This is not just a matter of convenience. This is a matter of we might dehydrate to death out here. Yeah. There was actually a mixed martial arts fighter, a former UFC champion, Evan Tanner, who went on this sort of vision quest in death valley and disoriented, lost his water and died side. He was going to go camping. Don't do that. Don't get all like into the wild on people too late. Yeah, he did it. He died. Yeah, it was definitely not good. But he was an interesting cat. He was a type of guy that, you know, he was uh, whether or not it was a smart move. It was a typical Evan Tanner sort of self discovery type of a journey. And he did a lot of those and most of them he came through. But some of them, you know, this one, obviously it didn't work out for him.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       He was a fascinating guy though. Really interesting, very deep thinker, like a deep original thinker. It's just, you know, these guys are always trying to test themselves, not just inside the cage but in life period. And for him it was, I think a bit of a vision quest to go out there and one of the most extreme environments known North America. And test himself or see find himself. Yeah, I think, but you know when you're gonna do a thing like that, you probably should prepare to be tested. Exactly. It's like the end of the wild movie. The same thing. I mean the movie's infuriating. The book is infuriating. The stories infuriating. There's a seven 11 or right over there. Yeah, you've done it to do that, man. I'm only that if you're going to do that, if you're going to do that into the wild shit man, you should it take, if you were really respect nature, we, you should fucking prepare for it for a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:32:04       You should really know what you're doing. Like I am in love with these subsistence shows, like these shows, like these Alaska shows where these people, they live off the land and trapping and hunting and fishing, but they fucking know what they're doing and they've been doing it a long time and they have like cabins set up along the way. Like in case they get trapped outside, they know that they just have to get a half a mile down the road and they can get to this cabin. There's, there's dry wood inside of it. They can start a fire. There's matches. Everything's ready to rock and roll and over prepared. Exactly. They're ready. I mean they're in Alaska, it's 50 fucking degrees below zero. If

Speaker 3:          00:32:39       you're a runner and you're like, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:32:41       you know, like send me distance runner, like a four mile runner or you know, like a 10 K or whatever. You do sprints and you do marathons for training. You do the extremes and you do it often and you'd do it well and then you go to your race.

Speaker 3:          00:32:56       Well it's also, if you're going to, you really do respect that area of you really do respect the wilderness. I mean, you've got to prepare for it. You, you, you really have to prepare to respect it. It's the only way you can respect it. Cause by going out there unprepared, you're disrespecting it and it doesn't give a fuck about you. It doesn't give a fuck about your ego. It doesn't give a fuck how, you know, a lot of guys might get lost out here, but I got a natural sense of the woods. It's not hearing that shit that's on hearing that shit. No. It will dry you out and turn you into coyote food. Yeah. It's kind of school you for sure. Do you enjoy the fact that there's like less humans out where you are? Do you feel that there's a benefit in that?

Speaker 2:          00:33:37       Yeah, there is. Right? Yeah, I absolutely, I mean, you know, it's, it's um, it's all a matter of perspective and uh, I guess it's, it's, it's a microcosm, macrocosm kind of a situation where if you're in at the end, a big city like this, you're going to see a cross section of a certain kind of people. Uh, my friend Todd that I was just talking about the talking in reference to, uh, just any kind of an infrastructure or hierarchy. You got your 10% that are kicking ass. You got your 80% that are just kind of coasting. You got your 10% that suck, so you're going to end up, if it's La for surfers, like I was going to a 400 population town, you're going to have similar percentages. There's going to be 10% that are that care and know what they're doing or want to know what they're doing and then 80% that are just there and then 10% that you just want to run over

Speaker 3:          00:34:37       this. The one, the good thing about being in a place like New York City or la where there's a large population is there's the 10% is a larger number and you can cultivate a good group of them and yeah, you can see, but you have to, you have to go out and find them. Yeah. You've got to find them. You got keep them close and you got to feed off of each other and then hopefully encourage some other people perhaps that are in the other 80% to break free. Maybe tip the numbers a bit. I agree. When you die 75 cause they're all capable. We're all capable of learning, doing. Do you feel a responsibility for that or towards that as an artist? Do you ever feel like because of what you're doing, because if you're, you're so motivated, you get so much done, you have so many different projects going. Do you, do you realize the impact of that? Because a lot of people were inspired by though the, not just the work ethic that you have, but the, how much quality shit you produce, whether it's wine or music or, I appreciate it straight

Speaker 2:          00:35:33       to compliment. Um, I think, I think you can't worry about it. You just got

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       to do what it is you're doing. And for me, I just have to do what I'm doing. There's a, there's a, there's a sense of responsibility for the art or for the, the process. And just for myself, I just, I care about what I'm doing. Um, if I start caring about what you think about what I'm doing, whether it's going to be helping you, that I'm, uh, that I'm, uh, an assisted living, uh, employee. You said something in your video that was very unpretentious but had the potential to be massively pretentious. But it wasn't because you were being honest. And what you're saying is that life is too short to not create with every breath you take. Right. And but you, you, when you said it, the audience cheered. It was a real moment. You know, they recognize that real moment. But God damn the wrong person could say that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       And you're like, well you just shut the fuck up. Create with every, oh pluse yeah, you have to get that all the time. But you really mean it. If you really mean it, it is inspiring. And that's where the cheer and the audience comes from. You know, the people fucking love that. They love when someone is motivated to make shit motivated, to put out art, motivated to test themselves creatively. It's exciting. And, and you know, I'm, I have a lot of people around me especially, you know, just within the music, within the film, within the animation, like all those things. But especially in the, in the vineyards and the, and the restaurant stuff. I see. I see people that are just every day, there's like an inspired by their work ethic. And because, you know, we were talking about a restaurant, like that's not, that's not a whim.

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       That's not something that you can kind of just start on a whim and not expect to be responsible for keeping the boat floating. That's like, you know, I see. I, uh, there's a restaurant in, um, in Arizona called the F and B [inaudible] and Charlene and just watching what they go through and what, but, you know, not go through it. That's, that's the wrong way to put it. But like, just the process, their process and, and uh, and their motivation and their, and their fire and they're, they're derive just, it's very inspiring. Um, and then a lot of the winemakers that I know in the state as well, there's just, you're watching them go through their changes and you're watching them go where they discover a new thing about a new potential of what they can do and how bad, how much better they can make it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:52       And, you know, just see. You just see that process. That's really inspiring. Do you watch any of Anthony Bourdain's TV shows? You know, he is, yeah. He's, he had a, the no reservations and show and now the new show is, uh, his wife trains with Henzel. Yeah. Yeah. His wife's good man. That's all I saw. I saw their kid training there. Was that last, that hilarious. Yeah. She's bad ass. She's a at the fights constantly. Um, I'd never actually met Anthony, but, and I've seen some of the shows, but he's a great guy. He's heard he has a new one that's kind of fun. Yes. What is it called? Dead Parts. Unknown parts on them. Yeah. And it's, it's basically the same show, but this one he has more control of and it's, now it's on CNN. It's got a bigger budget.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       But the, the show, the one that he had on the travel channel was the first experience that I had ever had with chefs. A guide knew that I liked good food and I kind of understand that it takes a special person to make good food, but I'd never understood how intensive the processes are, how creative the processes. And, I mean, he explored some really boutique restaurants where these guys grow their own food, hunt their own meat. And there's a, there's one place in Spain, I think it was, I think it's closed. It was called El Bulli where this guy was, this head chef was this legendary guy who brought in all these amazing chefs and they would just create these fucking intense works of art, these small plate works of art that were just so unique and inspiring. Maybe want to write jokes, you know, maybe may, maybe want to expand my comedy. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:39:29       Retain, you know, you know, but at the same time there, the, as as intense, they are about those unique dishes. You'll also catch a eating a bowl of popcorn.

Speaker 3:          00:39:38       Yes. Yeah. Why not? Well, Bourdain's a big one on street food. He loves like street Tacos and sure. I mean, why not? Don't be pretentious about it. It's all about the, the full spectrum of

Speaker 2:          00:39:50       is Kinda like that film. Um, perfume, what is that?

Speaker 4:          00:39:54       Uh, was it dubbed? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:39:58       Um, intense. Uh, a movie about this guy that's got a perfume, a story of murder, I think is what the title is, right? Is that right? Yup. Um, and it, it starts going off about this child who was born in poverty, um,

Speaker 4:          00:40:14       that, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:40:16       what had such an incredible sense of smell. He didn't differentiate, uh, bad smells from good smells. He just could smell everything. And he was very good at like deciphering all these, all these smells there, but you know, so it's, uh, I'm an, I'm not going to spoil it for you. You get to see it. I'm not going to watch it. It's awesome. It, it really good. This is the trailer right here. It's pretty awesome. It's uh, it's pretty intense.

Speaker 3:          00:40:47       Dude's a creeper. A creeper. It's got to, I think it's got Dustin Hoffman. I read about a polar bear today that they train or a dog they trained to smell. If polar bears are pregnant.

Speaker 4:          00:41:00       You have to just

Speaker 3:          00:41:02       to stop and think of that. How specific is that dog trained to tell if polar bears are pregnant?

Speaker 2:          00:41:12       So it likes, is it just kind of sit around? Uh, almost like a firefighter kind of went through a fire.

Speaker 3:          00:41:18       That's powerful.

Speaker 4:          00:41:21       Ooh,

Speaker 3:          00:41:24       good movie. You recommend that. Okay, I'll get something. I got to fly to Kentucky tomorrow. No threat. Throw that bitch on the laptop.

Speaker 2:          00:41:31       It's pretty fun. I, you'll enjoy it. If you

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       don't enjoy it, I'll recommend out of them. What would you on enjoy? Okay. It sounds like a good deal. A dog that can smell if a polar bear is pregnant, they say that the best way to describe how good a dog's nose is is skunks. Cause that's the one time where we can smell parts per million. A skunk is so the, the, the scent is so strong that we actually can catch that sent from blocks and blocks away. Yeah. Very much like a dog can smell things. Okay. Yeah. Which is pretty interesting way of, uh, exploring the idea because otherwise it seems like intangible. Well, when, yeah, when, uh, we have have Lena around the Arizona and as soon as I have on the come anywhere near the vineyard or near their yard, the dog is up. Yeah. He could smell them already. Well, they're scary animals.

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       Not even in the yard yet and there they're up in what they can tell. Those are freaky things, man. Do you ever seen when they hunt Hava Lenas it's pretty intense. There's, they're the one of the few animals that when you call them, they come running. Like if you make a sound like an injured animal, they don't sort of like sneak around or try to start. They come running straight towards that sound and then they realize there's a person there that Yikes, they haul it and turn around and run the other way. But they supposedly it tastes great. It tastes like very much like a wild pig. Yeah. But you, what's one of those situations where if you don't, if you don't feel dressed them properly, uh, they've got some weird glands will just ruin all the meat. He cut the wrong gland and it's done.

Speaker 1:          00:43:10       Yeah. Probably the tarsal glands. Yeah, they're stinky fucking animals. But they have to be, man, they have to be wild hardy bitches. They live in out there in the desert man. There's, that's what they look like just to like a freaky small, wild pig looking thing. And I keep, people keep telling me that they're actually more, had more in common with a rat pig. Yeah. But that looks like a tree. That looks like a fucking pig to me. Yeah. It looks like a pig to me too. But I guess a rack kind of looks like a pig too. They just small. I have no desire to eat them, so they must not be a pig because I love a bacon. They apparently tastes really good. They taste very much like pig. Wild pig is supposed to be the best I've never had. There's got to be silenced in La. This serves Hev Lena someplace in La has to serve out her.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       Avalina you would assume. Let's find out. I bet it's really hard to get commercial. Have Alina though. You know, you'd have to hire hunters to go out and get it for you. And what kind of a supply could you actually get? What's that place? It's up in uh, like Malibu. It's like that kind of, um, game restaurant. Oh yeah, the saddle peak lodge I wouldn't have, yeah, I have it. I don't think so. I was there recently. They have like elk and venison and things along those lines. And Pheasant, I don't think they have Havoline is pretty, that's pretty freaky. You got to go to Lake New Mexico to get a house call and say

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       step up. Yeah. Call Him and say, listen man, I'll come in. If you have Havalina Tako who have a polar bear periods sniffing dog steaks and have Lena, there was a website that was selling exotic meat from animals like lions. They were selling like lion meat and also at Catalina Cantina. What does that sit down in Arizona. Oh, did they really sell Havalina there though? Probably not. No, that's like a Friday's Tgi Fridays. You know, in Arizona it's more like a Thursday. I said they take a day off really more, a little more laid back. A little longer weekend. It's hot. Yeah, it's hot. It's fucking the summertime man. And then you get that Sheriff Arpaio, Dick Wad that sheriff, you know who that guy is? You don't know who sheriff Arpaio is. You guys have the most controversial sheriff in the entire country. Uh, John Down South around Tucson. He's the guy that puts everybody in pink underwear and a pink jumpsuits and, and it has the men stay outside and tense, no air conditioning.

Speaker 3:          00:45:35       It's bad. Make some work. Um, it sounds like it sounds like college. I think it's more, there's more but fucking than regular college. Oh, okay. I think it's, uh, he's just this really controversial, conservative a guy. Yeah. I'd see the photo of these guys that he puts him in this a clean and sober. I guess he had Mike Tyson, uh, in one of those apparently resting to, and didn't get knocked the fuck out. No, I mean, he's pretty, pretty insulated by the time you get to him. Quite a few people with guns in the way. It's true. But he's a famous for sort of representing Arizona, you know, and then we get a lot of, we have a lot of those people, like those governor that Jan brewer chick, she's one of the few people that I've ever seen like give a debate where I was like, hmm, I could be a governor.

Speaker 3:          00:46:36       I was listening to her talk and I was like, I could do that job. I can definitely beat her. George Bush wasn't enough. You had to wait to her jam. Bruce? No, I don't think I could be president of too many skeletons, but I could be a governor. I can tell you they'll let you get away with a few skeletons if you're a governor. Sure. I mean, none of them are bad and I've never done any real crimes. I don't have any bodies or anything like that as Ooh drawer, actionable wisdom said a few things were sort of two things. Mark come back to haunt me, but nothing, but I watch her give debates and I'm like, oh, this is hilarious. And then she won. I mean I watched a debate where she was just, and then you realize you to be stumped. Yeah, it really is. I can beat this check I'll have to do is prepare a little saint hard. How the fuck did she win? How was she your governor? How is that? I don't know. You didn't vote for it to do. All right. How far away is the a place that you trained Jujitsu? Is it a, a real town? Yeah, it's uh, in Cottonwood, so it's small,

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       you know, small Dojo,

Speaker 3:          00:47:32       Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It used to be one point in time. It was super hard to find a good Jujitsu jam. Guys would buy like VHS tapes and train each other and now it's so amazing. There's so many, there's, there's guys in Prescott now, there's guys in cottonwood. I think that might be guys in Sedona, but there's definitely guys in Prescott and cottonwood. Well, Arizona itself is a huge hotbed for mixed martial arts. You know, you've got the lab, which is where a Benson Henderson comes from. John crouches place. Then you've got a power MMA, which is where, you know Erin Simpson, CB. Dot. The way a lot of like big name MMA fighters. A lot of guys come out of as a mega tons. The studios there. Yup. Yup, Yup, Yup. Yeah, it's a, it's really interesting how, um, that sport has a, it's opened up the door for not, not be even people that want to compete in MMA, but people that are just interested in exploring martial arts. You know, the amount of legit martial arts schools is probably at an all time high in this country now.

Speaker 2:          00:48:30       Yup. Yeah, I would, yeah, I would have, I would agree that I just got back from a training with my friends in St Louis that was hurt my wrist.

Speaker 3:          00:48:40       Derp derp how much training do you do when you're on the road? Do you like,

Speaker 2:          00:48:43       it's harder, way harder. I mean, if, you know, if we have a day where we can go in and train and, uh, we have like a nice day off or a day off, you know, two days off, then I can risk it. But, you know, to go in and just, there's what time, you know, when would you do it on, right. On a show day, there's just no way.

Speaker 3:          00:49:02       But you've been involved in one form or another, at least peripherally in martial arts for a long fucking time now. Right. You know, I saw a photo of you with Bj Penn back when he was like a purple belt.

Speaker 2:          00:49:13       I got, I got injured in like 2003 or 2002 actually before that. And then I just kind of compounded and then I had to just stop around 2000.

Speaker 3:          00:49:24       That was the back thing, right? Yeah. This is what a, I got drawn out of my blood. This is the what pushed me over the top and gave me the flu. I'm gonna pull this up for you. You see this fucking ridiculous amount of blood they sucked out of my body. That's, yeah, Jello shots. Let's go. Uh, that's what they take and heat up and then spin in the centrifuge and I'll let you know how it works out. But I've been dealing with a, a back injury for the past altogether for about four, four or five years now, but pretty bad over the last year and a half, on and off and started getting numbness in my hands and things along those lines where I was realizing that my nerves are getting in impeded and smushed. And I realized I had to do something about it. So I don't have any of the symptoms anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:50:14       But, uh, this is supposed to do an amazing job here. Yeah, it did in Santa Monica. Okay. Well they do it in Germany and that's where I was going. Dana white has been going over there for it. He has [inaudible] disease, which is, uh, something to do with a in the, the, the inner ear and it makes Vertigo and tinnitus. He gets like this ringing in his ear and you're like literally can't stand up, loses his balance. But the guy who developed this process in Germany, uh, trained a bunch of other doctors and now they're doing it in Santa Monica as well. So I just went in today, you're my Guinea pig then I'm in, I just got the first, uh, injections today, but I'm with Ya. Old dudes

Speaker 2:          00:50:55       back problems. So I look, so one thing that does soc about, about trainings that your, you know, your body, your vehicle, it's not a race car to assist flesh, just in general wrestling and Jujitsu. It's just, it's just brutal. It's not, you know, it's not just going into a gym and there's a, there's a, there's a direction at this weight machine moves and that's it. Yeah, it's every direction.

Speaker 3:          00:51:23       That's why it's so critical to find good training partners. You know? It's just like we were talking about cultivating good friends, cultivating good training partners is another one. Like there's a few guys had a 10th planet Jiu Jitsu that I know I can count on to not spazz out to be tested.

Speaker 2:          00:51:40       And I'm still learning that, you know, even even now it's like I'm so used to my wrestling background where it's like go, go, go and I'm having to go slow, slow, slow.

Speaker 3:          00:51:53       Yeah. If you ever watch like really high level guys go at it. One of the more fascinating aspects of it is it looks like there's very little effort being applied, you know, especially when they're sparring a little bit more. So when they're competing, when they're competing, you know, they're going after it. But when they're sparring, like a lot of times these guys are just sort of rolling around. It seems like they're flowing like walk, walk, walk, walk. Never give the guy a position where he could sprint to the finish line, always make him that he's got four or five steps before he can sprint because a regular person won't see the difference between that, between the, the, the what it looks like casual rolling. And even though they're casually rolling, he's always going to be two or three spots away from the finish line. It's chess.

Speaker 3:          00:52:41       Yeah, it really is. And that's something that I've found, uh, like we were talking about things that inspire you creatively. I, I get inspired by people who have a lot of discipline for Jujitsu. I get inspired by people that are, you know, constantly creating and, and, and putting, putting a new slant on that in that Jujitsu is very much an art form. I mean, the word martial art, it seems wrong to people that don't participate in it. Like the word art, it seems like the wrong thing. But when you do it, you realize like if you watch it and you see if you have an aptitude for you understand it and you see what's going on and then you watch someone's really good at it, it becomes beautiful. And then it does become an art. It is something, not just an art as far as like something creative but in art, like as in something visually beautiful and very, very inspirational man, I think. And it's also another one of those things that I think like creating wine, like putting together a band, like putting together a comedy act, like writing a novel, like these things that we do when we put our, our, our, our thoughts and our creativity into something, they sort of, they, they don't just exist in a vacuum, but they sort of enhance all the other aspects of our life too.

Speaker 2:          00:54:02       I agree. Yeah. And just in general, I mean there's the, just that whole just physical aspect of making the blood go through your system and then being in shape, you just start, you start thinking more clearly. You're more creative. Uh, you can Kinda, you can kind of solve puzzles better if you're just, if you're, if I notice, if I just, I just needed a break. I just started slouching off. It starts to kind of compound. If they don't get back into something, walking, running, no job. Do you ever fuck around with Yoga? A little bit. Yeah. I need to do more. That's one of those things that I just feel like it's the, that's the, that's the on the to do list that I just keep being embarrassed about having to put it on the next to do list. Yeah. That's one of those things that everybody always says to, I need to do more yoga. I, we talk, we talk about Yoga and, Oh God, I need to do, it's, it's a, it's an, it's an, it's an absolute embarrassing reality. I ha it's, I have to do more yoga. Yeah. I, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       couple good DVDs, so I slapped in the laptop on the road. It's a very satisfying thing to do, to work out in a hotel room completely alone and do just a whole yoga class through a laptop. When you get through it, it's a real feeling of accomplishment because I could have just ate Doritos and watch TV and stuff is what I

Speaker 2:          00:55:20       did last night. Yeah, it was actually a Swedish fish. It wasn't treatise Swedish fish. Those are rare. When you have those nearby, it's really tough to say no to them. That's what I'm saying. Like, Ooh, Swedish, I can pay, I can do yoga or I can have these. Well, you could do both. That's where it gets hard. I was out of town, so you know when I'm in a hotel out of town and my wife's mental, wherever she is, it's my opportunity to watch like all the stupid movies that she just won't watch while I'm around. Like what? I watched that new a Riddick buoy. I saw that. I saw that with my daughter. She was looking at me like, what the fuck did you take me to say? I'm like, I'm sorry. It's so awful to watch the whole thing so bad. The whole, yeah. It was one of the worst moves laughing the whole time, laughing at myself and knowing that like she's probably laughing. Knowing that it sucks so bad and here I am. I like watching the whole thing and just laughing at myself for watching it. The craziest thing is the first one was really good, you know, and I tried to explain that to my 17

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       year old after we saw it, which was like the first one was good near dark. It was a good fucking movie, good scary science fiction movie. But somewhere along the line, what is this number? 34 as for I think, I can't tell you how many times I've watched chronicles. Is chronicles good idle while my wife doesn't think so. There's something going on now, man with science fiction movies where there, there's so much CGI and they can get away with doing so much on the screen visually that I'm detached. I'm not feeling like I went to see star track the last star trek one into the darkness, whatever the fuck it was. And I was like, this is just a bunch of things happening. I have no connection at all to any of these panels. Pretty connected, but not bad. Yeah. But the last one was just like, it's just a series of things happening in front of you. Well, you don't give a fuck. Right. You know, it's just, they're, they're, they're almost,

Speaker 2:          00:57:22       I get, well I guess, you know, it comes down back to the art. Yeah. If you, if you see somebody taking even a mediocre script and just running with it, you see when you see an artist kind of ticking those, being able to tell those stories too where you just believe it. You know, I, I don't know if I use this example with you last time, but, um, I just saw it again, this a, this season of sons of anarchy watching Kim coats fully get an erection over. I'm Walton Goggins and drag and it's just, you know, it's, you know, a while and God says fake tits and he's, you know, like a mass, cause he's trying to get his son back and you know, the lipsticks all smeared and, and like, you know, Kim Coates is trying to figure out how he's going to date this dude. He's just, it's just such an awkward, but they completely sell it like, like all the way you're, you're convinced like that. He loves her and it's like not a her, it's Walton Goggins and with fake boobs. There you go.

Speaker 3:          00:58:22       That's hilarious. I haven't given a choice to try to find a shot of, of Kim coats staring at staring at him. Her, it's an incredible, and now as he supposed to be a transsexual or transgender or trends,

Speaker 2:          00:58:37       uh, I think, I think, uh, I think she still has her previous equipment but also has tits.

Speaker 3:          00:58:43       So are the tits, those are their implants or their hormones? Implants. I Dunno. Hmm. They don't specify. No, probably. They don't really say, I don't think. Yeah. The only thing they'll throw you off with those things is the dimple size and jet men generally don't have the right nipples for boobs like that. So when you see him and they used to be a man, can I go, just trying to give you advice, Bro. Thanks. Get Dark. Don't get sensitive. If she gets weird trend transgender communities. Therefore you, he sound like you've done a lot of research on I have, unfortunately, I'm fascinated

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       by a gender identity. I'm fascinated by people who decide that they think you'll love it and you can see why they brought their, he's, he's got his arm around her now. Wow. Awesome. Um, what'd, you can see why when it first came up, they were just using this, this tranny to blackmail a dude. And even in that scene, the character tig, Kim's like just was so distracted by what was like, they were supposed to just be doing this job and he's just, he was so fascinated with this person and you could see why the writer put it, put it back in to a later season because anybody who's watching that show and bring her back, that was awesome. And now he's now oh wow. Boom. Oh Wow. How did they do that? So that's the dude from the shield. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:18       And a, and a justified, I'm missing out. I need to start. He's one of my favorite actors, but I think he's a great actor that they can act his ass off. He was fantastic in the shield to are they on like season? What season? Like six or seven. Yeah. I can't catch up now. It's too late. It's just daunting. It's too much once. Yeah. I Dunno. I can't, I don't, do you watch anything else on TV? The stupid no I cause I, I mean I watch, I watch all kinds of stupid shows but I'm always looking at like if I find out there's an actor that I like in a thing, I want to see how they're dealing with the puzzle they've been dealt. That's, that's my, that's kind of like why I'm even watching it. I'm just want to see the craft of or you hear a rumor of like watch this fucker unravel.

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       Like cause you can, he had some, he slips. This particular actor is having some issues so you'll want to watch the show to watch his feet can see if he could get a whiff of the crazy coming off them. Like what do you mean? Like, yeah, maybe they are getting into pills or something and kind of looking just seemed just trying to hold it together. And you can also like two episodes later, there's like a new character that could potentially take over that person's position. Oh, that's fine. I think in a building it into the script to go. Okay, so you add the background, you have a little flavor. Yeah. Just to see how they're, just see how that's gone. Well that's a, that's a common issue. Especially the pills. Yeah. It's poor fucks. Yeah. And it's hard to want the, you know, I have a lot of friends that are, that go through that kind of stuff and it's, that's one of the hardest things to get out of your system.

Speaker 2:          01:01:45       You'd probably rather, you know, you're better off trying to get off heroin because the pills just go deep. Yeah. When the pills essentially our heroin, heroin, I mean that's what they are. They're, they're their opiates and they leave a lot. They do do damage. Yeah. Nature damage. And they prescribed them like they're giving out free gum. I mean it's, it's amazing how many people are on prescription painkillers in this country and how many of those painkillers or opiates and how many of those people are addicted to those opioids. So we're, we're, we're fucking weird when it comes to that man. Without a doubt. That's of the most disturbing aspects

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       of our society. The uh, amount of pills that people consume. No, it's a, it's dark. And when you see someone, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:02:28       they had a cardiac care can I started right? Kind of, you know, like about a generation before us with the Valium

Speaker 3:          01:02:33       [inaudible] sudden sure. Rolling Stones Song. Mother's little helper. Yeah. She goes running for the shelter. Yeah. That's a, that's when they first found out that you could live a shitty life and, and get through it with some sort of medication and just medicate yourself and dull the angst and dull the, the desire for, to free yourself from this fucking hell she existence and, or just do something. You could definitely do that to just go do something. Yeah. I wonder how long it's going to take society figured out as a whole to, that'll be a thing of the past without, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:03:09       Expecting to be compensated for it. Just do it because you want to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:14       Yeah. No, that's great advice for some people. I think they have a hard time finding something that they actually enjoy doing too. Well you're so kind

Speaker 2:          01:03:21       addition to it wants stuff and to have, you know, like the fluff around it from the glory days or whatever. He forget that just, you know, work harder for less to just enjoy your, what you do

Speaker 3:          01:03:35       you have children now? I have, I have a son. He's 17, 18. What does it like, like seeing someone who, you know, you created who's about to enter into this crazy world as a, an an independent, I mean it's essentially a, on his way to being a man is 18 is basically at the launching block of manhood.

Speaker 2:          01:03:56       Well, you know, he's way smarter than I am, so there is no, I don't have any worries about him finding his way. He's intuitive. He's um, uh, personable. He is good at understanding social dynamics, but he's extremely smart. You know, he wants to go into a chemistry and biology, so, but he's also an incredible cello player, so, wow. Um, he'd got a scholarship to play cello for a performance of high school, uh, for cello. And so, but he's not going to pursue cello for his college. He just, that's just an extra thing he does and he rocks at it. So I don't have any, I guess part of it is when you, my parents are, my dad is just a very active person, very smart man and uh, and healthy. And so when I see him, when you know, when you kind of know where you are, where you've been, you know where you're going. So I have feeling that's just having my son see what I did, see what my, my dad has done. He's, he has in a way, he has a good compass. Um, good navigation skills.

Speaker 3:          01:05:10       Yeah. I mean, the only concern that I have, the big concern is that children today are up with so many more variables than we ever did and also much more potential for quicker learning because of the Internet. And, and with that, again, more potential, more and more possibilities, more variables, more things to think about. It's like more, more that could potentially be overwhelming. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:05:37       And I, and I think most kids are, I think there's, you know this, my father was a high school teacher and by the time he retired it was basically because um, they kind of pushed him out to get into new person who wasn't going to question the curriculum. He was very, he was very adamant about making the people who came into that classroom. You had to make an effort in his classroom to pass the class. You couldn't coast. It wasn't anything, it was like a multiple choice question. You were answering the questions and you had to know the material. Then you had to be on time. You had to put in over the course of the year, you were also doing homework and coming in with completed thoughts that were, that counted towards your grades. Then if you didn't complete all aspects of that in his class, you didn't do well.

Speaker 3:          01:06:21       Yeah. If there's any one thing that you can in instill in a child that's going to guarantee them a healthier existence is an appreciation for work and a pure appreciation for accomplishing things, calm setting and accomplishing goals. So, so few kids are ever indoctrinated into that, that sort of the way of life.

Speaker 2:          01:06:46       No, we didn't. We didn't get to school unless he got up at 6:00 AM and snow blowed the driveway in the winter. We weren't going to work.

Speaker 3:          01:06:54       Where'd you guys live? Boston. Michigan, Michigan. Yeah. I lived in Boston. Same. Same sort of situation.

Speaker 2:          01:07:02       Yeah. You know, our driveway was almost a quarter mile long, so we didn't snow blow the driveway. We weren't getting to the main road that was hopefully plowed

Speaker 3:          01:07:10       a quarter mile of snow blowing. Holy Shit. Well, luckily it was snow blowing and not shoveling. Yeah, mother fucker. Yeah. A quarter. And you're dealing with some serious snow up there.

Speaker 2:          01:07:22       Yeah. Cause it's on the Lake Michigan side, so you get a lot of, oh wow. It's fucking cold. My uh, senior year, we had seven days of school in January.

Speaker 3:          01:07:31       What's that? That's hilarious. Lizard would hit on Sunday or Monday and boom. Done Til Thursday. Tell me though, how awesome were snow days growing up? That's one thing. People in California, Arizona Spo, mountain dew and red licorice, I used to look out that window and if I saw like a foot on, on the car outside park, I'll be like, fuck yeah. And then you would call that number and it was a number. They would, you know, they would, they would list off the different towns where school was cancelled and if they got to Newton, I would go fuck yes. Who was just this huge radius the day. Yeah. I was a beautiful thing. And it was also the thing that I really appreciate lot about a grown up in a really fucking cold place despite, uh, on top of learning that, you know, there's a good to having really fucking cold snowy days. And that's, you really appreciate the sunny days. A different vigor, you know, seasons. Yeah. But there's also the quiet, there was a weird quiet when everything's covered in snow that I don't think anybody will ever appreciate unless they experience it. Oh yeah. It's amazing when you're out there and it's like a full on snow storm and there's just a foot and a half of snow on the ground. The trees are covered with snow. You don't hear shit. It's this weird eerie rigging silence.

Speaker 2:          01:09:00       Yeah. Cause it's a different, you know, if it's, if it's a rainstorm, of course you're hearing the rain. Yeah. Just that floating snow, big chunks coming down. It's almost like an incredible sound barrier. Yeah. Yeah. Absorbs everything. And you're just like, you're such a like, like an isolation tank.

Speaker 3:          01:09:15       Yeah. You hear like every now and then you hit a car and the distance trying to get out of a driveway. Right.

Speaker 6:          01:09:19       Ooh.

Speaker 3:          01:09:22       Or your name and long ago fucker wold start. Yeah. I grew up in this area that was across the street from a river. And uh, we, we, it was a fairly rural area. And um, this a giant park and the river was across the street from my house and the street was a pretty steep and every time it would snow or especially if it would rain the street would become a hockey rink and I would watch cars drive down the hill and just right when they got to my house, that'd be losing control into your room, bouncing off curbs. I F I think there's something to learn about that. Then there's something about dealing with weather that I think is healthy for a person. Healthy for your character.

Speaker 2:          01:10:05       Well I haven't driven a car in snow and you know, decades or for any length of time, but in Jerome we get snow in the winter and it's amazing to me how people just cannot drive in it. Yeah. We get it every year, you know, a little bit, sometimes a lot more. But having to, like, I immediately just get in my jeep and I go up to a point in the town where it's the problem spot and just park and wait because there was somebody that can't get up the hill or around the bend because I just can't understand not to slam on the gas. So you parking weight to help people? Yeah cause cause they're good because, well I'm helping, you know I'm not, don't you know I'm not to, here we go stuff at one of those ones where they do the crash thing. Not because I'm like some kind of, you know, helping, helping hand type guy did this. Oh Jesus Christ,

Speaker 3:          01:10:59       the guys getting [inaudible]. The cool thing about though about accidents and the snow is they just sort of bump into each other and slide around. There's no one's glued onto the ground. So it's the same kind of impact.

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       Right. Well you know I, I go up there to help them out just because I know if I don't, there's going to be like 20 cars behind them. They can't get where they're going. So it's just like, it's just more a matter of like bringing a plunger to the, to the shit show.

Speaker 3:          01:11:28       This is a certain amount of camaraderie too, when, when things like that happened snow and people have to help push people's cars at a spots and things long. That's another thing that people don't, don't deal with an la, the lack of weather in La. It's, I think one of the reasons why people are so cocky because they never get humbled. This is your fucking rain here. You know? I remember after the earthquake in [inaudible] 94 is just when I moved here in 93 whatever it was, I moved here right after that happened and I remember people were so nice, they were so humble. It was a weird thing. It was like, it brought people together for a little bit.

Speaker 2:          01:12:04       So that was a strange experience to, yeah. You know, I was all, you know, Steve Martin, the jury out in the backyard with my dogs in front of me. Like, you know, like hearing the trees just like creaking around at all the car alarms, like a symphony of car alarms going off. It was crazy. Like hearing the glass shattered everywhere. Freak me out.

Speaker 3:          01:12:24       Yeah, I missed it. I came, I came right after it happened, but I got caught in one of the bigger aftershocks. I was in an apartment on North Hollywood and my apartment moved around. The best way I could describe it as if it was a refrigerator box. It just went side to side, side to side side. It's like it was made of nothing and I was just going holy shit

Speaker 2:          01:12:47       by like, uh, um, Lankershim Vineland and camera. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:12:50       yeah, yeah. That's what I was, that's where I lived right behind the blockbuster there by the Firestone. Yeah. I was like, uh, just uh, I guess it would be just east of Laurel Canyon, like deep down, like more park. I was, I'm more park. Yeah. You weren't that you weren't that far from me and know that fucking thing outside nude with my dog as a Merkin freaked the fuck out. Yeah. And there was that feeling about like Los Angeles then where people were humbled, you know, they were like a little nicer to each other. And I felt that again in New York right after September 11th, I remember a, I lived in New York in the early nineties. And then, uh, when I went back to New York, I remember, uh, like California, I'm thinking that people in California were like a lot more mellow and nicer than people in New York and people in New York always had that sort of hard edge to it.

Speaker 3:          01:13:43       But when I went after September 11th, that edge was gone. There was this warmth to people in New York and a friendliness that I hadn't ever experienced before. I was like, this is really interesting. I'm like, there's a real tangible, positive impact that this tragedy has had is that people are appreciating each other more people are silver lining. Yeah. The, I think, you know, it's almost like people need perspective. They need to see negative to positive. You need to see those shitty Michigan winters to appreciate a good summer day in California. Every day is a great summer day. Today was a great summer day. It's fucking November 4th it's 82 degrees outside. You know, we're, we're a little spoiled when it comes to that. People need nature. They need to see it and you know, fucking rainstorm, just kick your ass just to let you know, like it's fucking thing can come down on you. And anytime

Speaker 3:          01:14:41       I have no point, that's where it ends. I liked it. It's true though, right? I think that's the one curse. It's almost like being born rich, you know, you ain't never have to deal with adversity in California. There's a, a lack of appreciation for the fact that you're actually on a planet, that you're actually a part of nature. You know, just, there's no seasons here, so you don't really get the chance to see that change. So what a perfect place to put the, the factory of all things fake. You know? I mean, if you really wanted to think about a great way to fuck up a culture, right? You know, just take a spot where the weather never changes and then put cameras on people and pretend they're interesting. Pretend they're amazing. Give them lines to say that the winds too fucking stupid. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:15:27       Convinced them. Give them cocaine. Give them tons of money for pretending. Confuses the shit out of everybody and make it so that they get in line first at a clubs. Everybody lets them in. They, they throw velvet carpet down and they walk on them and everybody cheers. Confused the fuck out of everybody. Right. This is the spot. And by the way, it never rains and it never rains. Rain and Arizona this year did it. Yeah. And a lot of good rain. Yeah. Arizona doesn't get much props, man. It's not like when, when people talk about the cool spots in this country, Arizona doesn't get much props unless you're on, you know, unless you're on a vision quest, unless you're on a vision quest. Let's look for some solid payoti. Yup. Some San Pedro cactus and a good sweat lodge. That's pretty, you try to find your spirit. That's for the kids. That's for the kids. I don't fuck with that. Payoti I've never fucked with Payoti. I've heard mixed mixed reviews. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:16:27       hi. You know, maybe, maybe, uh, I had a balls friend who had a good experience on it. Oh yeah. Did he look like you? A little bit. Not then. Not quite then. Yeah. I'm but more of a mushroom guy myself, mushrooms and, and tryptamines. But a, hey, snub my nose. It no pod. This pod is a weird one too, because you can actually own legally own the cactus. Not just own it, but you can buy it at hardware stores. You'd go to Home Depot and get San Pedro Cactus and I'm pretty sure that's how you make it. Right. I don't know. I was with, I was with some indigenous people who invited me into their

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       ceremony, so it was quite, quite a special moment. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:17:15       Yeah. I have no personal experience, but I have one friend that did it and said that he was in an apartment building and he was listening to people talk that were easily five blocks away and he was listening to every word out of their mouth. And he could, he couldn't believe that he could hear it, but he was absolutely sure that he could hear it. God bless him, God bless pot and woke up with one of those orange cones stuffed in his ear. Good. No, he woke up trying to figure out whether or not it was a dream. You know? That's, uh, that's the problem with those hallucinogen is experiences, even if it's an incredible beneficial experience, there's that wrestling match or were you like, was it real? What was that? And I'm trying, I try to get people to look at psychedelic experiences as this way. Like whether it was real or whether it wasn't real, the experience was exactly the same. So if you took mushrooms and truly did go to another dimension and communicate with ultimate knowledge and, and, and then then and tune into the love of the universe, tune into the frequency of, of life and of, of progress and, or whether it happened in your mind, it's still the same experience. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:18:36       And it, but you know, I would, if people are going to do those things, uh, I think it goes back to what you were talking about before about understanding, you know, preparation for this thing you're going to do. Having respect for it, to having absolute respect for it and understand what you're getting into and understanding when you get, you know, wherever you go, uh, understanding, uh, how to handle it. Just to kind of us finding us a center in yourself that can you kind of handle what it is you're seeing and try to stay out of fear in a moment. Stay away from fear and just to, you know, just prepare. If you're going to do those kinds of things. Just prepare for the journey,

Speaker 3:          01:19:17       prepare for the journey and learn how to let go. And if you are going to do those things, do it hopefully with somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing because if you start messing with that stuff and neither one of you know what you're both going to be under that, that, that fog of fear. Right? You're both going to be tech. But if one guy's like, dude, trust me, I've been here before, I know how to get out of this neck of the woods. Right. Going to be okay. All right. How much benefit have you had personally from psychedelic experiences?

Speaker 2:          01:19:47       Um, I didn't, you know, I didn't really, uh, do a lot of it. Um, compared to people that I knew that did a lot of it and didn't make it out, didn't make it out. He has a lot of guys, you know, you know, you've met them and you've met those kind of people that just, they didn't quite make it out and it's Kinda twisted him for, for life. How many people do you know like that? Dozens. We'll, yeah. Holy Shit. Just, you know, they're just not, they're never going to, just because of the whole nature of how it breaks down some of those barriers between your left and right brain. Um, just metaphorically, you know, just, uh, just how you think about your creative processes. They can never quite get their feedback on the ground to understand what it, what it means to actually, uh, do a thing rather than just, you know, imagine a thing.

Speaker 3:          01:20:41       So, you know, dozens of people like that and wouldn't know what was it was a lego series of trips or was it like, did just did too much, too much, too much, too long. Just lived in that world for too long. Yeah. That is, it didn't prepare again, doesn't prepare for what they were going to do. And See, and Mckenna always had the best advice when it came to psychedelics. Large doses. Infrequently. Right, right. And, and prepare, prepare and don't do it all the time. Do it and then process, figure out what, what can you get out of this yet

Speaker 2:          01:21:15       again, it's contrast you whatever you, whatever it, whatever journey you took, even if not on the psychedelics, see if it, if it's like just some tire, you're going to go for a month to be silent in some, you know, some spiritual place and introspection and you know, do a fast or whatever. You don't want to do what you don't want to do that like, you know, 12 months out of the year that doesn't, they don't have any contrast with anything. Just go do it, get intense about it, prepare for it before you go and then B, and then be ready to take a while to come out of it when you are coming back and then you live your normal life.

Speaker 3:          01:21:53       Do you feel like you creating wine or when you're putting together a DVD or when you, when you take on a project that you're kind of on a journey like that as well? But absolutely. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:22:05       Everything, everything that uh, yeah, everything that I've done this, there's been some element of preparation attached to it. It's not something I just dive into

Speaker 3:          01:22:13       and then every time those things are accomplished, there's this feeling of reinforcement of the process.

Speaker 2:          01:22:18       Yeah, I mean you, you know, everybody has a way to check themselves into thinking they're right or you know, kind of consistently put up particular process and to get some results back that reinforces the behavior. But you know, aside from that, if he just, if you're just preparing a properly that there's definitely a satisfaction from, you know, coming from, you know, even even the happy accidents along the way. Things you learned that you didn't think you were going to learn stuff. That was actually a challenge that he hadn't prepared for it, but you managed to get through. Those are the kinds of things that really kind of make those results a satisfying.

Speaker 3:          01:22:54       Do you intentionally seek inspiration like through books or through documentaries or anything? Not intentionally, but just, you know, I'll, I'll be reading a book or an article seeing

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       a film and somebody will use a word that resonates on some level and I go write the word down. Then I might build something on that word. So it could be, it could be two years from now that I'd come back to that word.

Speaker 3:          01:23:21       Right? So just following your own curiosity or interests and that eventually leads you to it

Speaker 2:          01:23:27       ration, right? I mean, if you're, if you're, you're into, you know, physics and geometry in general chemistry, there's those Thursdays structures that are already there in terms of the, the relationships between a numbers and shapes and angles and, and, uh, you know, just molecules. Um, and they're, and they're very similar, uh, in respect to just the emotional experiences, uh, just life experiences, even just the Jira and journey from, you know, an infant to, uh, an elderly person. There's a whole, there's very common angles and structure and a commonality between those experiences that can be, can resonate. So if I see a word that for some reason resonates with me at the age of 35 or 40, I write it down right away because most likely there's some kind of a geometry or residents with that word that's speaking to me at this age, in this stage of my life that I should pay attention to. So I'll write it down and I'll see you. I'll explore it more to see if it is in fact something that wouldn't be relevant when I was 20 might not be relevant when I'm 60 but it's relevant now, so, so I'll look at it and I'll build on it.

Speaker 3:          01:24:40       Yeah, that's an interesting thing about getting older and the, the ideas that you come across, these ideas are sort of cross referencing with these other experiences that you've had in your life up to this point now and now. Now it resonates. Now it makes sense. Whereas at 21 it didn't mean a damn thing to write a documentary and a guy making Sushi when you were 21 would be like, oh fuck am I watching? Right? But when you're 41 it's like, oh, okay, this guy is obsessed with this art. There's something to this, right? This guy's making swords. Look, he's making a CS, folding the metal. I watched a whole documentary on this guy making traditional style Samurai swords and the incredibly intensive laborious process involved in folding steel, hammering it down, folding it, hammering it down. Fascinating Shit. Yeah. And that, like everything else, it's all just, they're still skipping any steps in the impossible.

Speaker 3:          01:25:40       You know, we weaving a rug properly, you know, making your own fucking clothes, uh, of a thread. Yeah. Pulling, you know, weaving threads together. Like some they had to do that. That's what they did. And you know, that's, there's, there's, there's no other way. I watched this, um, uh, documentary on indigenous tribes, Inuit tribes, uh, creating fishing nets and that it would take a year often to create one net a fucking year. You better have a couple already. Yeah. You have to have a couple already made and you know, that's the way you're eating is the way these fucking people are going to eat. It goes back to those subsistence shows I'm absolutely fascinated with. Like there's this one that I've been watching now, it's called a life below zero. And it's just these different families, families or individuals who live up in Alaska and then go from one to the next and follow these people.

Speaker 3:          01:26:34       And this one, a tribe that's a man and a woman and the woman is a, a native in you at woman. And the man is a American from the lower 48 and they have children together and you know, like they've lost family members because they fell through the ice and died. And I mean this is like, this is real shit. This woman who's, they're walking across the ice and they're like knocking holes into the ice to make sure that it's deep enough for them to walk and they're with their children. And then they got to put this net down underneath this ice and, and, and feed it to each other and the other side of the river and they're going to catch fish. And that's how they're, they're all eating and there's no other way to eat. And this is what they do. And that's, and that's their life.

Speaker 3:          01:27:18       And there's something about it that's so fucking terrifying to you that just, that just shut me down. That sounds cold. Oh, it's fucking cold as shit, man. Well, you know, this woman had lost two family members. She lost a, one of her sisters and I think one of her brothers or maybe a cousin or something like that, fell through. It was just going to reach for a sweater. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's wild shit man. But to them, that's life. That's what they do. That's what they're doing. That's, that's, that's their existence. Laughing while they're doing it and everybody, I mean it's, I guess people just adapt and get used to it, but there's also this like intense spiritual connection with their food. That way, you know, when they're pulling these fish out of this water and the grabbing hold of it and making sure it doesn't fall back under the ice.

Speaker 3:          01:28:04       Like there's this intense connection between this, this animal, this, this creature that they just caught, we don't really ever get. And when they eat that animal, there also this intense feeling of satisfaction that goes with that, that this substance living very, very, very intense man. Very intensive. Lost touch with that because we have so much available to us, you know, no matter where we look. Yeah, we've got food, clothing, shelters, pretty much readily available. We've got a little lazy on that kind of stuff. A lot lazy. And I think it's a lot like what we're talking about Los Angeles. I mean Los Angeles too. Goddam easy. There's no weather. No. Whether it's simple, go to the supermarket, everything spelled out for you. Soft life. Soft life creates soft people. We got to figure out a way to fix that. What's the way, dude? Um, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:29:04       reset. Do I, the only way I think is for people to figure it out on their own, to be inspired by people who are or have figured that out. You know, the, this marble is way smarter than we are. So when it decides that there's any even, you know, if, if the kids get a little too cocky, it'll, it'll toss a few title ways or toss a few meteors at it just to, just to reset. It'll just reset and you'll go back to having to figure out what to do with your time, not having your PDA. I've always wondered if that's what it did with the dinosaurs. If it, if the earth looked at the situation was like, those are big, this is a mess. No one's going to figure that out. No one's going to stop that. They're stupid as fuck. And they don't have to get smart.

Speaker 1:          01:29:50       They kill everything with their face the way 50,000 pounds a piece. Right. All right. You know what? It's time to throw in a race or their way. Yeah, I agree. I think, I think that's probably the case. Eventually we'll, you know, something that you said how dependent we are on I just everything digital and electrical, just a simple, natural, naturally occurring. You know, electromagnetic pulse. We'll just fucking ruined people's lives. Yeah. One big fat solar storm that erases everybody's Kendall. Yeah. Don and go try find a book now. A hundred years from now. Try Finding a book. Yeah. Books. It'd be like records. It was be like try and find vinyl today.

Speaker 1:          01:30:30       I many final do you Elliot? Everything a few people do. Right? Yeah. It's still pretty common. We try to do every that every, there are only a couple of things I've released flustered with the, haven't come out on vinyl to, cause they were just digital, but the pretty much everything even. Yeah. Even the remixes we do, we'll do final four to, well there's a weird push now for not even just a digital copy of something but in the cloud to leave everything in the cloud. Like have you seen these new Google chrome books? They barely have a hard drive and everything's in the cloud, right? You're accessing your day. And I'm so like, and I'm not, I'm not being like, you know, grandpa kind of know, hang onto his, you know, his Beta Max or eight track tapes or any of that that, I mean, I honestly just like I keep, when I download stuff off iTunes, I have like a hard drive and I just can't let go of the idea of like just deleting it all and getting it later when I want it.

Speaker 1:          01:31:28       Because I mean are we really going to wash those CSI Miami episodes again? Probably not. Probably not. But you feel better if they're sitting in on that because I paid, I paid for him. So why did you, why don't I have them somehow near me? I just am not willing to accept the idea that everything's in the cloud. And then it's secure either. That's the other thing. I mean, they want you to put all your photos in the cloud and contacts in the cloud. That stuff. I was like, no. Yeah, I don't believe. Think about it before you print this photo out. Fuck you. What if I, I'm not to have this photo. If something

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       crazy happens like that and it's lost.

Speaker 3:          01:32:02       Yeah. And also the, the latest revelations that the NSA tapped into the Google cloud and basically access to everything that was up there, which is a, you know, Google's all pissed off, but come on, you didn't see that coming, you know, aren't you guys at the front of the line? Don't, don't you know what's possible. You seen that show yet? No. What's that down? What is it?

Speaker 2:          01:32:25       It's everything you're talking about. Like what's a show that just started, you know, a couple of seasons ago and like maybe it's third season or second, third season. I think now Ben from losses on it. Oh really? Yeah. And it's all about him having been the engineer, this computer that, that was predicting, um, national threats. And I think it takes everything. It takes every camera it out with the access. Any camera that has, you know, that's in the system. Here's the cameras on your phones, every microphone. And it puts together all of this data looking at all the digital information and uh, predicts like your national threats and, and, but the, the trick, you know, the whole trick of this story is like nobody really knows about this thing at all. It's so, so self contained than it inserts this information into, uh, and to studies or you know, when they're looking at, when we're looking at somebody

Speaker 3:          01:33:15       that was too weird. People that was Ben from loft and Jesus does Jim Caviezel. Yeah, the passion of the Christ. That fucking nutty dude. That dude thought he was Jesus. Who is that Candy Alexander in the back? No Way. Benjamin buttons. Mom. Oh, okay. Wow. Pr. So good. You recommend this, right?

Speaker 2:          01:33:35       It was funny because like everything about what the show is all of a sudden came out with all this, you know, all this NSA spying. They were like, that's what they're doing already. So this show is like kind of being a cutting edge thing like on, Oh, there's a supercomputer doing all this stuff and they're like looking through the cameras and there's gathering all the information and all of a sudden you go, none of their doing that right now. Like this, this is not a, this is not a stretch. This is not a supernatural show. This is like actually happening.

Speaker 3:          01:33:59       Well, it went from being something that guy like Alex Jones would rant and rave about to the reality of the day and it happened within like a month. Right. You know, I mean everybody sorta just realize like, oh shit. Like everything you've ever emailed somebody actually is somewhere in a database. That is the facts. That's the world that we live in now. This isn't science fiction anymore. Does that, that off color photo you sent me to, I told you that wasn't real. What do you, does that freak you out? This is, what do you, what do you think this is going to lead to this, this, this does dissolving of privacy. I Dunno. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:34:45       part of me says that I'm not, I'm not really that important that it were, that I'm too worried about anybody looking at what I've got. Uh, you know, the government like sifting through my crap. There's nothing, there's nothing of,

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       yeah, I agree in that personally, but I also see it as something that's very different than I think what, what people are realizing. I think everybody's worried about their personal privacy and people were worried about not just their personal privacy, but the government being able to access their personal privacy and to be able to look into their photographs and read their emails. And I get all that. But I think that ultimately what we're dealing with is a dissolving of boundaries between people and information and that it's going to be some, there's going to be some breakthrough one day, whether it's some, some ability to read minds or some new way of connecting people, some new way of separating boundaries that's going to make this seem like a joke, that this is just basically one more step in this neverending trend of a dissolving of boundaries.

Speaker 2:          01:35:57       And I don't know. I don't, you know, again, I don't know, the other side of me is like, don't, don't be looking at my emails. I don't, you know, there's, that's, that's just my personal stuff. And then you'd have no, there's nothing of interest there for you. I think I've done, you know, I've done my part for society. Why you're looking at my bunk.

Speaker 3:          01:36:16       Yeah. The, I think the, you know, the people that are doing it too. That's one of the weirdest things. Like this Edward Snowden thing. When it came out, it was, uh, they were, they were trying to discredit him and they're like this high school dropout, Edward Snowden. And you're like, wait, wait a minute man. Did you guys hire him? Like you're, you're, you're making fun of him now, but right. Cause you're fucking employee, man. And he's telling everybody that he had access to everybody's email, not just encrypted, but can actually fucking read them. It wasn't just mad at metadata. He could actually go and read your emails and he was a high school dropout. Right? Like who else is working for you guys? Right? Like, well, who gets these jobs? How do they get these jobs? Like the, the, the questions, the questions are just leading to this, this weird ultimate reality, which is that the trend seems to be across the line, this dissolving of boundaries between people and ideas and people and information and then eventually everyone's going to have access to everything. It seems that that is, and I just

Speaker 2:          01:37:21       think that that's, you know, I, I get caught up in the idea of like, well maybe this is part of some, you know, this might be just our tendency to do things, you know, this is what we do to control people. You know, just through the ages, power, you know, power wants more power. Uh, but at some point you have to wonder like was so is that, is that choice and the, the dominant, you know, whoever's in charge, that's a tendency of uh, whatever we are, whatever it makes us up. Is that an extension of what, again, going back to the marble, is that what the marble wants in some way? Is

Speaker 7:          01:37:56       that, is that a, is that consciousness just trying to sort some things out and just take us to the next step? Um, you know what I mean? I, you know, I don't, I have no answers to them. I'm just saying, I still, I started asking, I started asking those questions of like, okay, so what's the, how, how would I, you know, if I was David Koresh, how would I rationalize that perspective? I mean those, so think, but think like a crazy person who, you know, comes up with some awesome rationalizations to justify the actions and then try to go the other way. Like, try to feed like, you know, be more like the paranoid, you know, opposite Defensive Brat, you know, reasonably defensive, uh, person who wants to be like, wants to know why, what the fuck do you need to see in my emails? I don't understand why that's important to you.

Speaker 3:          01:38:43       I tried to look at it as someone who's analyzing the human beings as a complete alien, outsider looking at us collectively as a group, which is what we, we move as a group. We act as a group and I, I would say, well look, here's this thing that works collectively to make technology but thinks it's an individual. They all think that they're individuals, but essentially all they're doing with their manic desire to acquire goods and did the acquire material possessions. What they're really doing is just pushing innovation because they need the biggest, baddest, newest, craziest. They constantly need the latest and greatest. They're pushing for these innovations and these innovations are constantly within, you know, three, four, five months. The exponential increase of these things is making every new step far more powerful than any step before it. And it's happening faster and faster and faster. It's happening exponentially. And I don't even think the creatures even realize that

Speaker 7:          01:39:44       doing the, the, the, the, the periods as Mckenna had put a thought at the time periods between novelty and novelty and normality or it's like a home now. It's not even a, it's not even a peak and valley anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:39:56       Yeah. Makenna described it as a funnel that, you know, if you spun a quarter around the top of the funnel, who took a long time to go all the way around the circle, but as it gets lower and lower, it's getting faster and faster and faster and faster until it reaches what he thought would be a point of ultimate novelty. But he thought it was going to be the December 21st, 2012 but think, you know, he had, he's a a dude, you know, he's a guy, right? You know, at the end of the day it's brilliant. As he was his fan, fantastic as his mind was. He's still just a person with an idea. And, you know, we can, we grab ideas sometimes and ride those bitches right into the rocks. But you know, if you look at those,

Speaker 7:          01:40:36       those, uh, this beautiful chaos, uh, equations that kind of make those cool kind of Paisley looking things and that he looked really close and you see like, oh, the detail becomes fractals Mandelbrot set. Yeah. So, you know, if you look at that, um, when we get down to the bottom of that funnel and you're looking close, there's, there's a deeper funnel. It's just as much detail as the funnel above it. So,

Speaker 3:          01:40:58       and he might ultimately have been right in some sort of a way that December 21st, it might not have even been that exact day, but that era, the era between 2012 2013 which is the era we're living in and experiencing right now, it might ultimately be this new opening for this new future. And this what we're talking about where there's, that's that TV show or the revelations about the NSA that could be just the first steps an opening up this new door of perception, this new door of reality. Right now we're living in strange times man.

Speaker 7:          01:41:32       Yeah, totally. Yeah. Mixed and it makes you know, mix up person when I'm trying to write songs or trying to make this wine or you know, doing, you know, doing whatever, uh, writing and doing comedy bits or whatever, it almost makes it feel weird. You almost feel kind of an odd like self conscious way of like, what am I, what am I doing? Like you go to a show and you see like the dude up there dancing around in front of the people that are like watching them dance around and look at you dancing around. Just feel so fucking weird. Such a weird relationship of like, like such a show until kindergarten thing and when I like when you say a word enough times, that was, that sounds weird. Yeah. That when I look at that and I think about it like that, like coming back, repeating the word to the point where it doesn't make any sense anymore. That thing just seems so strange standing. So I'm going to imagine like most people at some point in their career, whatever there's they're doing, they all said it's kind of go, what the fuck am I doing this to something? We'll just thing I'm doing.

Speaker 3:          01:42:37       Yeah. If you like rip, paying too close attention to ballet, if you're locking into a ballet, you can enjoy it. If you're in the moment and you're just appreciating the movements. But if you look at it too closely, then you start to s to step back and pull back and look it into perspective of this planet spinning a thousand miles an hour and a circle around this gigantic nuclear explosion. You're like, look at this asshole and tights throwing his body through the air. This is so preposterous. Like why does anybody give a fuck whether or not you can sing the words to your, your play right now? I went to, my wife was taking Spanish, uh, or a, a Italian rather. And uh, one of the things that she did in her class was they took everyone to an opera. So we went to an opera. And so we're sitting there with the rest of the people in her Italian class watching this opera. I'm like, this has gotta be one of the dumbest fucking ways to entertain people I've ever seen. Why the life they're saying in this language that nobody understands. It's everything is like everyone falls in love immediately. So I can't buy it. There's no reason why these people are in love with each other so quickly, like this ready to die. Like, this is preposterous. This is made in an era when people didn't have books. Like they didn't, they, they bought into this because they were dumb as shit. But yet

Speaker 7:          01:44:01       here we are, 21st century. The entities in a seems absurd as, and as it would if anybody was coming here from some different, you know, galaxy walking in and seeing, you know, a standup comic or, or, or, uh, you know, we're about a band playing on a stage or a person like getting up so early in the morning to, uh, you know, to make bread. I ain't got had, that's food. I guess that that makes more sense about to make wine. Yeah. I mean the, I, you know, you always kind of take that, take it out of that perspective. Like somebody comes to this culture and then there's this thing where you, you, you stick rocks in your ear and that's like this thing you do. And there's like, oh, there's, there's better rocks and other rocks that you're sticking in your year. And then people start stumbling around and you know, falling, you know, bumping into a wall.

Speaker 7:          01:44:47       Like, okay, so you, you pick up a rock and you put it in your ear and there's different kinds of rocks. I feel different and give you different effects. And there's, Dear Stephanie, you know, you can, there's certain rocks that are really expensive and some that you can just pick up and know, stick in your ear, but you just basically bumped into a wall afterwards and that's cool. Right? Yeah. Okay. There you have it. Good luck. Oh, whoa. Yeah. It just seems so absurd when you, when you, when you kind of tick take the, take the words and replace them with, you know, other, other objects or things, you know, wine, food, I mean food is food, but like singing a song. I've heard of it.

Speaker 3:          01:45:27       Yeah. And there's some things that to the people that participate in them, our life itself, it's, it's almost, uh, you know, one of the things that I do, uh, I've done since I was a, a young man, this play pool I play, I played in tournaments and I play like on a just below professional level and a to peer. Should I play pool now? That's a weird word that only gets used to. It only gets used outside of pool shark. Actually impose a negative term, meaning someone who distracts you, why you shooting? They tried to shark you. Okay? Like if you were shooting, I was like, Hey, come on man, you ain't going to make this shot if I was fucking with you while you were shooting. That's called sharking someone. It's actually poor form and it never happens in tournaments with the highest level guys. They never do that. But to my point was that the two, the people in that world pools everything. I mean to watch the great matches from going from tournament to tournament, you know? Now nowadays they're there watching them streaming on the internet, whether it's through paper view venues or whether it's through a, you know, some, some people set up cameras at various tournaments, but to a person has nothing. No connection to that world. It's idiotic. You're watching these fools are, there's a Tate, the table never changes. The six remain in the

Speaker 7:          01:46:50       exact same spots and it's just about which way the balls roll around. Like who gives a fuck? Nothing changes outside the table. I mean, this is the microcosm of microcosms, man. I mean, it's a fucking table. It doesn't even mean it's level. It doesn't even move. It's just a matter of balls colliding and that that interests you. But to the people that are involved in it's every or a person who, you know, goes to the kind of process of self discovery. You, you, you did something and it went in the hole, you wanted it to go in and you've had that positive reinforcement and that encouragement from that, from that behavior. Uh, then you follow it more because like you got some, some hugs, some kind of accolades, either from yourself or from someone around you. So you start pursuing that thing and it has more about your ego developing in terms of like the praise that you got for doing that thing.

Speaker 7:          01:47:41       Yeah. So you end up, you can see how things get to that level, you know, watching, you know, watching, uh, you're, you know, English, footy. I was never a footie fan. Angela had somebody kind of walking me through what was happening. And then I recognize something and I was patted on the back for recognizing this thing that I still don't have any fucking idea what I was talking about. But you know, I'm watching it more cause I want to see where this goes. And you were like six total goals tops and that's like, that's what we're watching here. If you're lucky. Yeah. But you know, at the same time I, you know, not other, now that I've got sucked into the rabbit hole, I completely enjoy what that is. And there's entire like, you know, there's probably a bunch of English shoes right now outside of the studio ready to kick my ass for even mentioning it at that.

Speaker 7:          01:48:30       That might not be something that's interesting. You know, like there's like a fury that police, you didn't call it soccer. I did not do that. Yeah, I would not. I would not go that they'll fucking scream at you if it was football before football. They have a point. They do have a point. But yeah, it's, it's that same thing. It's like that seeking higher truth in, in whatever discipline it is. Whether it's the discipline of football or wine making or music making or jokes or Jujitsu, those, those microcosms, those worlds that exist sort of a holy on their own and are very difficult to appreciate by people standing outside of them. It's a, it's a, it's a very fascinating aspect of, of human beings. So I guess going back to what you were asking about the, you know, the Pulitzer for DVD, how I can, you know, the flexibility of everything that we do.

Speaker 7:          01:49:24       I guess that's, that's kind of what that is. Me and the guys that I work with, realizing how absurd some of the things are that we do anyway with our other projects are with this project. But we do it anyway cause we're just really enjoying. We're in the rabbit hole. We enjoy seeing how far we can take, uh, a particular absurd obsession with something. And that's absolutely what I loved and appreciated about it. Besides the fact that it was funny and beside the fact that the music was good, I loved and appreciated the fact that I could tell it this structure was wholly your own. This was a, your own, this is, you just decided to do it this way. And you know, I don't know if he saw some of the, some of the shows. The, we normally have a table and chairs that we set up at the front of the stage.

Speaker 7:          01:50:08       Depending on the show, there'll be different kinds of tables and chairs. But we always have like some wine and some stuff on stage because we have friends that will either, that have either opened for us or coming down to see us or I actually playing in this particular band that while they're not doing anything, they sit down and have a glass of wine onstage and you know, at the front of the stage, uh, with us and we've, you know, we've done a lot of shows like that where we've had, um, like, you know, two drummers, two base players and a couple of extra guitar players. And then like that rhythm section just sits down for five songs and just having wine and cheese at the front of the stage, just kicking it and then they get back up and do it because it just felt, it just feels more casual.

Speaker 7:          01:50:45       Even Korean around, I'll sing a couple songs and I'll sit down and just kind of, you know, watched the show from the stage that, is that, is that something you saw someone else do or just so I don't know that I've way, I don't know that I've seen anybody do it. I'm sure that tasks have been done right. But I just feel like there's a, and I've actually tried to, I've been trying to put this other show together with no luck. Uh, well we have several bands kind of come up and do a very similar thing, but they play, you know, four songs and then they sit down and maybe there's some kind of segue work, one of those guys who's playing with that other band. And then like a band does, you know, four songs or five songs and they sit down and the other guys come back and said, you just keep rotating, you know, rather than doing your whole set and like, here's who I am and this is what I do kind of, you know, just kind of, you know, do it almost like a very well rehearsed rehearsal, you know, very well rehearsed rehearsal, like not the final performance, but like a week before it had a little glimpse into what it was, you know, a little bit of the chaos of those guys getting up there to do their next three songs.

Speaker 7:          01:51:52       And it's not like them in their rhythm and in their element of like, you know, start to finish. This is our set, right? It's more like we're going to get up and do these three songs and then we kind of have to, and it's not like, you know, some guys have to get up, you know, full on Boehner to go do their set and, you know, they do the whole thing and you know, we fucking nailed it. And then whatever that is. Uh, but just the idea of like getting up and performing those songs and a couple of ways and put, putting them and putting us in an uncomfortable, unfamiliar environment that kind of helps us just look at it again. And Ray and joy will be remembered doing when we started doing it in a way. So fuck yeah, dude. And working on that.

Speaker 7:          01:52:32       Yeah, I love it. That's exactly it man. You know, if you could find that that's a, that's how honest energy, you know, that's a and an honest form of expression to, because you know, you're showing the whole thing, you're showing the underbelly, you're pulling the curtain back. Yeah. And then you're still, but if done right, it's not necessarily the underbelly, it's a, it's a show in and of itself that has, has depth and movement and passion and you know, uncertainty and fear and all the real stuff that comes along with a movie. Yeah. And that is within the songs you're hearing, there's all that stuff is built into each one of those stories. Usually there's some form of conflict within that song. That's why they wrote it. Yeah. And then seeing that preparation, it makes you appreciate the final product even more. So. Yeah, that's bad ass man. When are you a, what are you touring right now? Like what's a just got done with harvest? I'm doing a lot of writing.

Speaker 4:          01:53:30       MMM.

Speaker 7:          01:53:31       Training. Jujitsu. Well I was to like hurt my hands. So you sprained it a ahead. My, my coach and Saint Louis fell on it. That wasn't me. I was, I was going the wrong way. It's totally my fault. I was going the wrong way, pushing the wrong way and I have my hand out the wrong way and he went the other way and like this whole body like landed on my hand and went, I can hear like popcorn. Did you get an MRI or anything? I just, this happened four hours ago. Doesn't look that bad. Yeah, I think you'd be okay. Yeah, I see some swelling. Yeah. So I had it, I had the, the poor guy on the plane. I'm like using a puke bags. I go, can I get some ice? Like I say my arm on the plane coming here. Do you think the bones cracked?

Speaker 7:          01:54:11       I don't know. I have no idea. I had to come and do this fucking podcast instead of going to that hair. You man, I know what it's like. I gotta get up and four hours go to the airport. Well, I mean, the good news is I'm getting a, um, uh, Kim say is doing a tattoo of some tattoo work on me. So I'm actually kind of out of the training game for a minimum of a like a week or so. Anyway, cause I got to let the, I got to let the thing he done getting more am I snakes? My Arizona Rattler Oh wow. Is this the guy who's doing this in California? No. Kim. Kim Say Kim say shut. You don't know Kim Kim's work? No. How dare you? How dare you? A lot. She, she, yeah. Where, where is she? Uh, and I'm going to forget the name of her. How do you spell her last name? S. A. I. G. H. S. A. I. G. H. K. I. M

Speaker 4:          01:55:07       and Shawn Barber.

Speaker 7:          01:55:10       Oh Wow. She's wild work, man. Fantastic stuff. Yeah. So what town is she in again? She's in La. Memoria Tattoo Memoir. That's the one, that's the word I was looking for. I was going to say heirloom, but that's my friends that make food. Oh Wow. No more tattoo. And where's that at? It's in kind of the Hollywood,

Speaker 4:          01:55:32       uh, area, I think. I'm Beverly.

Speaker 7:          01:55:37       Wow. She's got some fucking amazing work. Yeah. She's got some skills to pay the bills. And Sean's work is awesome too. That's another

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       art form that over the last, say, two, three decades has really come into its own in a very strange way that didn't really exist

Speaker 7:          01:55:51       before. Right. And again, when you look, when you step back from it, you go, what are you doing? You're drawing on yourself. The fuck's your problem. Go fucking get, just get a pad of paper and just, you know, draw a little bit on it. And then when you don't like it and you'd draw another one. But no, like, but you know, but then I, I get caught up in the, uh, just the art of tattooing. And like you said, it's just, it's come so far and just the people that are so passionate about it and do such good work now it's no longer, you know, Tasmanian devils and shit. That's for real.

Speaker 3:          01:56:19       Yeah. I've had both of my sleeves done by the same guy, Aaron Dellavedova firm grew tattoo in San Diego and a grew tattoo is one of those uh, cool shops where it's, they're all artists. You know, they're all creating these weird pieces of art when they're not painting. They're doing, they're not doing tattoos, they're painting and not painting the Dune. Some guys sculpt some guys in there fucking around constantly and he just, this is just one more medium that they express themselves then. Right. But the, the medium of tattooing, I mean there was the tattoos have, you know, the 1950s in the 1960s and they have no relation to what is being done today.

Speaker 7:          01:56:59       Well and the u s yeah, you always had the core of the Japanese tattooing. This is like insane, beautiful stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:57:07       Insane, beautiful and, and ridiculously fucking painful cause they're doing that tapping

Speaker 7:          01:57:12       way. That's part of this one. I got done with that. Oh, did you? In Osaka? No kidding. So they did it. How long does that take? Uh, didn't take much longer than the gun. I mean, the guy was pretty, I mean the guy was fantastic. That was at the chopstick tattoo in Osaka. That was just so they use like as fans stick, they hold it there and the other stick. Yeah. Tap's over the top of it. Wow. That's pretty cool house. How precise can they get with that thing? It's pretty precise. I said, get in there, buddy. Yeah, that's pretty bad. I love the Thai style. Once they're doing too, like the, I'm going to have them do a drag and I'm actually going to talk to, to, to the memoir is the number three, five, three. What is that? That's a, it's part of my wine story. I don't know. Can you tell us a store? No, it's a secret really. You have secrets? It's a little fucking tap in your email sun. At least that secret within the secret's out.

Speaker 3:          01:58:14       And so you had that guy and do that. Would that tapping style with the bamboo? I think Tara Patrick had her whole arm done that way. She's like, it was huge. Japanese sleeve. I'm pretty sure she had it done the traditional way, like the uh, the, the full, I don't know what the word is. They uh, they do it. It's funny when you go to Japan, you can't show your tattoos. I was a at an OBL both in the gym. Yeah. They made me cover up. They told me I have to wear a, go back to my room and put a long sleeve shirt on and a, I couldn't train as you're a fucking derelict. Yeah. I tell I try to let them know I'm not, yeah, that's her, uh, her tattoo there. I'm pretty sure that's done the traditional way or at least part of it is. Yeah. In the Japanese culture, that's not a good thing. That's a no, it's bad. That's the Yakuza and it's really interesting because they're the ones who created such beautiful, these, these beautiful full piece body designs like that, those bodysuits that are actually just one long flowing piece of art. That's the origin of that, but not respected in the country where it came from. It's funny. Yeah. It's kind of fun. I got jumped. Please society, please. What'd they do?

Speaker 2:          01:59:30       Maybe put the robe on. I had to I to put like sweat pants on and a, and a top to be in the gym.

Speaker 3:          01:59:36       Where were you? In Japan. Which part? That was in, I think that was in Tokyo. Yeah. That's where I was too. There were, there were not having it [inaudible] it's a, if you have anything on your neck, you have to wear a turtleneck. I think if you have a tattoo scene and act like it's, it's much more discriminatory than it is in America. Politely discriminatory. Yeah. They're very polite, polite about it. Well, there are so polite in such a strange way. It's a, it was a really interesting culture and we went there pretty shortly after Fukushima where there was this weird feeling of distrust for, uh, the, the government's assessment of the damage and the dangers. And, uh, we were, we had this long conversation with this taxi driver because he had to drive us from the venue all the way down to Tokyo. And it's about an hour's drive. And so he was a, he spoke pretty good English and he was saying that for the first time, people are, uh, openly starting to question, we're not the government's being honest with them about yeah. Without, they can eat vegetables, whether or not, you know, the ground is radioactive and they're Fisher edible. Right. And I, and I would have to agree with that. That's, that's, that's starting to happen. Yeah. That's a scary fucking thing. And that they might have ruined their country.

Speaker 3:          02:00:55       They might have to bail because it could get worse. I mean, there was another earthquake just last week. There was a 7.3 off the coast of Japan. Yeah. Yeah. It was another one. It didn't cause a tsunami, but it could have, I mean, all it takes is the plates go this way instead of that way, and then the water's coming. Yeah. And if it does, they're fucked.

Speaker 2:          02:01:15       Yeah. That's it. You know there's a, there was a beer that a friend of mine had it. Uh, it is local so she plays and I went in and was like, Hey, can I get the ads? Some of that? He goes, no. I said, I said, what happened? They sit all of the earthquake. So that's there. That stopped production and particularly because no, it's gone. The family's gone. The beer has gone, the building's gone. They're gone.

Speaker 1:          02:01:41       Gone, gone. Like never coming back. Yeah. Yeah. You see some of the damage that that by the way, that ain't shit compared to some of the fucking tsunamis that they know have hit different parts of the world. That's why I always laugh whenever I drive by Malibu. How's the Malibu today? And I was driving by and I was looking at these houses, they have perched over the ocean and I was like, sleds, boy, there's no guarantee that's going to be there to wild. Those are just sleds with, they're basically playing a long extended game of musical chairs and they know for sure one day and the music's going to stop and their houses are going to have for sure go flying out into the ocean. But when the Michigan man, all the snow, you'd always have, you know, he could do bobsledding stuff. Can I just slid down the hill?

Speaker 1:          02:02:29       And that was, when I see those houses, that's all I can think of is sledding in the winter. Yeah, she can. Well they'll, they'll get a raised one day. I guess if you're like way up a one of those bluffs, you probably got a pretty good shot of, not of, not falling completely in the ocean, but those things have massive landslides too. There was a couple of years ago, there was a news report where these people were waking up in the middle of the night, these horrible cracking noises and they realize that their houses were sliding off the side of this hill down into this valley and it just gives out, you know, you decided to put a foundation and the ground that decided to not be there anymore. Right. And it all just didn't. Giant, huge, 30, 40 acre chunks just slides down and takes these $5 million houses with it. And that's the fear.

Speaker 1:          02:03:17       It then at worth $5 million anymore. Not Anymore. If I may, I think you're correct. And I think even if she wanted to reclaim that land, boy, it's tough to pinpoint where your house used to be. Yeah. Good luck with that survey. Yeah. Yeah. Those dudes with the sticks looking through that hole. Yeah. They're going to have to do a lot of measuring. That was me in the military. Did you do that? That's what I did. What'd you do in the military? Uh, we put in grid coordinates for, uh, like the tank batteries to pull in and you know, if you're gonna if you're going to shove a big missile in a tube and launch it somewhere, he had Kevin, he had to know where you are and to know where it's going basically. So that's what we would do with people. Put the survey points. What branch of the military army, how long were you in for? Three. Three years. Well, six years total. What year was this? 82 to 85 reserves from 85 to Aka. That's you buy boom, you handsome fast out of wig. It's just real, you know. Did you get anything out of being in the military? Yeah. Discipline. Yeah. Just, you know, just again, just being, being responsible. Uh, response ability. The ability to respond. Yeah. People that have gone through that. Um, it's a, it's, it's very interesting to see. I

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       had a friend who was a real lazy and Kinda shiftless and never got anything done and then went away, went to bootcamp, came back and this motherfucker always folded his napkin after that, sat up straight and got shit done. And I was like, wow, they turn this dude around. Like they're really did. I mean, I wouldn't recommend it today because joining today you have a high likelihood of either being forced to assassinate someone for the government or finding yourself in a position where you really wouldn't want to be. And people are shooting at, you know, that don't like Americans. And unless it's your calling, I wouldn't really recommend it, but God damn, for some people it really is a, a game changer.

Speaker 7:          02:05:23       I agree. Um, yeah. And you know, not all, not everyone can make it through it. It's a lot of guys, it kind of washed out, you know, during that whole, uh, basic training.

Speaker 3:          02:05:35       What made you join College Fund for Art School? Really? Yeah. Well, you're pretty convinced that we weren't going to go to war during those times

Speaker 7:          02:05:44       lately. I was like war, you know, I didn't, I just didn't believe it. And then, uh, I got, uh, I got appointed to go, I got this through long process, but uh, uh, basically it got handed a, an opportunity to go to west point by going to the preparatory school for a year and uh, got to the end. Like when I finally got my appointment to go to west point, they said basically you have to forfeit your army college fund to go to art school. And I didn't really go into be a career military person. I kind of went into get college fund so I can go pursue the arts. But you know, but you're being, again, I was being, my behavior is being reinforced as far as my, the way I was excelling as in, in um, in the military. Um, so it was very tempting to go, I could be an officer, let's do that.

Speaker 7:          02:06:35       And then you get, you know, I got to that moment where I had to like add them, make that decision. In that moment you have basically I had like three hours to check the yes box then. Except my appointment or check the no box and go back into the regular army and they go back to and go to art school and I chose, I chose art school. All right. And I, if I had not done that, I would have provided, I made it through west point, which is not a guarantee. If I'd have made it through west point, I would have been in the first Gulf war as a lieutenant.

Speaker 3:          02:07:05       Wow. That's fucking crazy. Golf for one, I think they call it. I had a friend who, he's a cop and he was in the army reserve, the army reserve for 20 years and had less than a month to go till he was out for 20 years and they shipped him to Iraq for a year and a half. Come again. He was in the reserves and the reserves during the Iraq war or after September 11 they just started sending people over there. You were under contract. That's it. It does. It didn't matter if you had a month ago. During that month you were assigned a year and a half tour of Iraq and he went not just once. He went and came back and they sent him again. They sent him twice and he did three years in Iraq when he had less than a month ago. And there was nothing he could do about it. His whole life was thrown into chaos.

Speaker 3:          02:08:00       You, it was his relationship. His job is everything gone. Yep. Sorry, you, you live in Iraq now. You, you're over there. You're a soldier. I mean, he is a fascinating thing to watch. Like, well at least he made you a free life. He got lucky. Yeah. He came back different though. I'll tell you that. He came back, uh, you could tell he had seen some shit. There's no avoiding that. I mean, he, uh, he saw combat duty and wasn't planning on it. So thought he was getting out, thought he was going home, thought reserve, met reserve, you know, thought, thought 30 days meant 30 days. Nope. No, it means to one and a half year tours, or at least all in total was somewhere around three years. The beach. Well, we don't have water, but we got Sam.

Speaker 7:          02:08:53       Yeah, I dunno. I guess there's good to be gotten from almost everything, but uh, but for you at least it was a positive. It's dyed dodge, you know, quite metaphorically and literally dodged a bullet. Yeah. Wow. That must be something you think about often. But you know, I could see, you know, I could see how I could've excelled at that and done well for, you know, done my part in that setting. Uh, I have an aptitude for it and I have a lot of my friends are law enforcement and a military, so, uh, I get along with him. Well, you know, I also have all my crazy liberal friends that I get along with. Well, so I think I just would have been, if it would've, it was a path that I would've chosen, I would've just done whatever I could do with it.

Speaker 3:          02:09:41       The law enforcement friends, I bet understand your friendship with the crazy hippies and liberals more than the crazy liberals. Understand your real relationships with law enforcement. Absolutely. And that funny. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:09:58       Yeah. God bless him. God bless him. All the open minded liberals. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker 3:          02:10:04       There's not that many of those are there. Well it boils down to it. There's a lot of aggressive progressive's.

Speaker 7:          02:10:10       Yeah. And I, I noticed that. Yeah. And you know, coming from that background of being, you know, supposedly like the Liberal Democrat, it's pretty amazing.

Speaker 3:          02:10:19       Well, they have this idea and they think that it's right and they think that they should, uh, violently, uh, tried to, uh, support that idea. You know, whether or not other people have that idea or not, they think that their ideas

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       correct and their ideas on the right side of history. And so it's something to be something to be violently pursued. Baboon. Yeah. But boom, I don't know. I don't know who's right. I don't think any of them are, the truth is in the middle somewhere. Right? Yeah. Listen, man, I've got to go to the airport and I think five hours. All right, so let's wrap this bitch up. I just, I just came from the airport. Thank you for doing this, man. I'm glad you did. I'm glad you did.
