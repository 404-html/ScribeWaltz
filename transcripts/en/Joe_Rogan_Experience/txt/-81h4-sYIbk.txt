Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Five speeches. She already three, two, one. Yeah. I don't know who makes this weed, but fuck you. Whoever it is. Some strong might say this is some Ed Rosenthal. Wheat Grass. Yeah. We went deep. He went to the deep end of the pool. Dude. Dude, dude, dude, dude, just back from Brooklyn. So we would recap this, but before I want to congratulate Eddie Bravo and becoming five foot nine and it's huge. The modern medicine. Big Difference between five, eight and tell me about it. I'll kill you. Can Tower over people who are compressed discs. You literally get. I mean when you look at old people and they're all fucked up like that, that's really what's going on. They're shrinking because their disc tissue, the Chinese, the Chinese say you're as old as your spine. Oh, electronics people. That makes sense. It's true. They say cool shit. I like fortune cookies.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Just attributed a billion people. As I got a billion people say it's. It came from somewhere and try to from one guy I ordered a laptop and a. I got the package and it came straight from China and it just sinks. It sinks in, you know, especially when you get something that's from a country like China, like there's only one reason why they're making something in China. There's one reason, well there's two reasons. One, because they'd make a lot of things there, so the manufacturing tolerances are very high. They make when iphones, things along those lines, but also because you know, people are going to work for cheap and lived there. Like when you get a laptop, like there's a real thing you do, will you like, you know, you don't want to live the way that people who made this live. Right, but you're going to get it anyway.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       I'm going to get it anyway in any way because you can go one click on the apple store and sensors. It's fucking weird. Works though. Seven cents to make your last name. China. China's actually, because they've made so much money now they're workers are demanding way more, you know, sort of higher salaries also like better work, natural bed. Guess what? Guess what's going on now for the day, but they're losing jobs now. A lot of Chinese manufacturers are gone. You're now got to go to South America and Malaysia and we got to Vietnam. We can. These guys would work for even less. So. Chinese workers are losing jobs to fucking Malaysians and the economy. He's led apple. They run such a tight ship. They had put nets down. So many of the workers were committed suicide nets. Yeah. To company called Foxconn. Foxconn is the company that makes all of the laptops and they make a gang of apple products.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       I think they make phones to, to to make a bunch of shit, but they literally have nets are on the roof and here's the best part. So many people committed suicide that they had to address it and they their, their, their argument was, well, you have to understand these people live here. So if you look at the number of people in consider it like a population. The suicide rate is very similar. Wait a minute, you can play with stats. They live in the factory basically just slave slaves. Slaves were slaves. Have you ever noticed later, but they're getting an

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       iphone stick getting money. They're getting money. They can leave when they want money in the concentration camp. So no, they didn't. They definitely didn't get money in concentrated. You don't. You don't have to be there. You can leave whenever you want, but this is all they're going to give you and you're going to work 16 hours a day or whatever the fuck did you ever know that's legit slaves. No matter what. Would you want pennies. That's real. Slavery and I phones come from this. Are you sure that you got here? How do we allow that? Here's the question, right? What you want your mom to be working there? Would you want your wife to be working? But what it means, that's all she could do. She could just put together and that's what she's going to. A dollar a dollar an hour is better than no money in our Joe Rogan is.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       Yeah, you're right. You're right. You definitely right. And, and by the way, what's interesting about China is that they do have a huge middle class as a result of their industrialization and all the suffering they went through in the eighties, nineties, they, you got what? $400, million middle class workers now who are buying things like cell phones and flat screen tvs and all kinds of stuff. You know what's fascinating to me though is that when was, if you, and I'll wait for when you can tell me when was the last time you bought anything made in Russia, like wow, that's a good point. But just if you could please just vodka vodka socks and we don't.

Speaker 2:          00:04:29       And by the way, I don't know if it sucks, but we, we don't have, we use the American Swedish Baka being paid off by Bella tour before this fate or event. Somewhat. Some anti marketing strategy fate or Russia of doom. They're basically a one crop economy man. They make great box oil, you know, isn't that nice? Well, they were held back for so long, like communism doesn't fucking work. Kids, it doesn't work. And here's the little dust that either as a monarchy, which it is now with bizarre like Putin, you can't, your private property means nothing because the government can come along and go, uh, did you say something about me will take that over? Let's take them over and throw him in jail, and so he was going to open a business. What about first don't let make and God makes first bro, and it's supposed to stay on the animal.

Speaker 2:          00:05:15       Thank you. Piece of shit. Supposed to stay on the animal. That's called virtue signal that you've got that. Great. The population are very disciplined people. It's a. it's a. it's actually a really colorful culture that created a lot of art and the Russians are smart people. Everything else they are and they produced a thing. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what they produce motherfucking ass kickers. Yes they did. They got some serious ass kickers come out of Russia. Who's running boxing right now? Good Nautica, Lufkin surgery. Koval live says, I thought search. I love Andre Ward, but I thought surgery. Kovalev won that fight. He dropped them. Me Constantly

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       press the attack. I just didn't think that. I didn't even think it was that close. I was really sweating the Soviet. The Russians are so macho. The Russians are matched their patriarchal society. So if you think about food and he hunts tigers. He's on the, on the, on horseback with his shirt off. He, by the way, I have to say this because people always correct us, like Loma Cenk goes from Ukraine, different close as it obviously you see that, but that's like saying Canada and America. It's so close, but it's not. It's North America. Bad motherfucker who's skating up in Canada, some unbelievable hockey player. Do you consider American say North American? You consider him as a guy? He's a Goddamn Canadian. You know he is going to kick your ass. He's. He's over here to play hockey. Better. More, more importantly, sir, off of Wayne Gretzky. More importantly, don't forget that the Ukraine and Russia proper, it was annexed by the Soviet Union, the Union of, but it was essentially Ukraine has always considered themselves sort of not part of the Kremlin.

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       They've always considered those own country and I would remind people that a guy, nice guy named Joseph Stalin, a starved the Ukraine and about eight and a half million people died of starvation because he essentially collected forcefully, collected all of their crops and for a thousand reasons and they all about eight and a half million people scenario, but the size of the Midwest. United States is like a Goddamn history teaching. Great on fucking video series. Oliver Stone, the uh, what is it? The something's history of the United States, a secret history of the United States that what it's called, something. It's fucking amazing. I don't watch this. You know, Oliver Stone is a real history fanatic and he, I mean, it must have been exhausted. The untold history of the United States is that it sounds like literacy to me, Eddie. It's Fuck Eddie. You want to look at conspiracies, like, look at the way the world really works and forget all the nonsense.

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       This, this is fucking fascinating and all proven, all. Like you could watch the videos of the people saying what they're saying. You could see what happened after World War Two, like, oh, what's one thing? People out just just horrific fucking history that we have in the world of people just going into other countries with their armies and killing groups of people and just the amount of times that it's happened over the history of the United States when Oliver Stone is like laying it all out with the footage. Damon told history, the United States, so fucking fat Americans taken over everybody taking over everybody. It's Hitler. When Hitler was pushed into Poland, when Hitler was in Africa, like all these, the whole thing, it's chaos. The history of people is the history of people taking over giant chunks of land and fucking things out. We just haven't experienced that over here. We were so young.

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       This country is souls fucking young. It's crazy when you watch this documentary, when you realize like, oh, this calm is like a very rare moment where the ocean is still before tidal waves come smash. Those tidal waves are going on all over the world right now. If you're in Syria right now, you are watching missiles flying into apartment buildings. You're watching suicide bombers, if you're in Afghanistan, you're watching all kinds of chaos all out of the throughout the world. It's just not happening here, so we're being loled. We're being called to this false sense of what a human being is.

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       Fascinating. Also is that you to in order to galvanize armies, to to go see a peak in the fear though on us into that room, but you galvanize young arms, you galvanize armies around what around ideology, around things like communism is the best way to go. Fascism in is best way to go. Christianity is the best way to go. Islam is the best way to go, and those armies have to have something they're fighting for. So that's what's fascinating about. If you read the Old Testament man, it's literally about. It's guys like you guys are fucking worshiping false idols. I got to send the Babylonians and obviously the rockies, you know, destroyed the Solomon's Temple in 586 BC, which was the Jews built their temple. That was their most sacred thing. The Babylonians, you know who they are. They're the Iraqis that they. Iraqis, Hipaa fucking footprint. A historical footprint that's so much bigger. It's crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       The original civilization as far as modern historians. Which uniform first? Mathematics? Yes. Yes. I'm writing for. Is these weird. It looks like an old school nails. You know what an old nail looks like. You ever work in a bill? You ever do construction? Uh, no. When I was a kid we did a lot of construction in Boston. A lot of those buildings are really old and a lot of the really old buildings, they have a different kind of nailing them. It's a handmade nail. So instead of looking like a circle with like a straight line, what they look like is like a wedge. It's like a hard, like flat. It's not round at the top. And they would say that's what the cuneiform looks like. Pull up an old nail though. Pull up an old old construction nail. They looked like a wedge. Four sides.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       So that's what a cuneiform. There it is. See those, those nails? Well that's, that's kind of a rotten out one. There you go. See how they looked like it looked like a wedge. See they're, they're like a little sword more than they are like around rounded cylinder type thing with appointment. Oh, those are all handmade to make. Yeah. Well they used to have some sort of a mold to it, but you would go to a blacksmith or whoever the. No, those are ironman. Yeah, I would imagine they're stealing. I think it's great. I think it's copper. No, Brian, trust me, those are rusted. They're old. That's iron. That's 100 percent iron. You see all that rust on it. Copper doesn't rust. I got. Those are all they have. That's how they would make those. My Dad was um, he was, my Stepdad was a architect so I got a lot of jobs on construction sites.

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       Like that's what I did through high schools to have a job. Dude, lets you know you don't want to work. I'll tell you that for a week, dude. I did an in a fucking building in the summer. So we're, we're building this house and I'm the kid who has to carry the insulation upstairs. Then put it in the Cox and people do that. They don't want to listen to me. They do not like it was bruce. We'll do that tomorrow. Yeah. A lot of people would do that and you get it in your skin and you can't get it out. Get it your stuff. Yeah, and you have to wear a marriage class. You've got to wear a mask because you're breathing it in because as you're putting that stuff up, it's flying in the air like you would see the light would come in from one of the windows and you would see like all these particles in the air.

Speaker 1:          00:12:26       You're like, well, it's terrific. Look what I'm breathing. The worst thing, the worst job I ever had with tearing a house down in Washington dc in the summer and then we take it and bring it out to Lawton landfill and you'd have to cart it off and then we poured the base for a bill, like a big apartment or a building, actually a house. The base with cement and stuff. You have to dig that kind of work. I remember going there, there is no fucking way I'm going to stay in college. I'm going to figure out a way to not ever have to do this. It was the worst shit in the world and you wake up early for some reason. When you work construction you, you're. You're up super early and you're driving in a truck. Yeah. Now stop and think about someone in China making your iphone exactly 10 times worse, 10 times worse.

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       Living in my photo, doing construction, making the iphone. They're just doing the same everyday. The monotony. Working with these machines, they demand productivity. What kind of food are you getting there? It's got to be terrible. If you're forced to live there and you're getting terrible food, they're all packed together like sardines within what? The loop for when this country. We have the same thing on hog slaughter farms and things like that. There's a routine to it. With all those people working there, I'd go crazy. Oh my God. See you all. Dress the same. Chairs are super comfortable. That crazy. Come on, man. I want to work there. You would go crazy and you don't see Madison that like you look at suicide, suicide nets. Look at all these people stacked in together and these little tiny dormitories, housing, dorm rooms. You think guys get really good at like missing the net.

Speaker 1:          00:13:53       Just you gotta just jump further. Just run like a Jackie Chan off the top of the roof. Stoked. I bet they're trying to get a look at Japan who've seen the subway. They push you on that. Push people. I've been there where they did that to us like we're in rush hour and I wanted to go down there to see what it was like and you get shoved to bring that up. You'll see the film in one day. They paid dudes in uniforms to shove you in like a for real. This is happening right now. I hadn't happened to me. It was just. I was like, well, you know what's amazing is how uniform people's behavior is in Japan and how like people are so polite and calm and they get along well in Japan they had to because a lot of people in a very small area.

Speaker 1:          00:14:41       We feel the next trade was done. Guys trying to push people. Is there a similar train come and run up? They can't. They can't have any more trends. This is every day one push. Push that fucker get in there. You start dating your motherfucking so ridiculous right now in Japan. Imagine if you are preparing of so that's just not in their pants. Every time they ride on that thing, can't wait to get published in Japan where you get a lot of guys who rubbed. The big difference is that China or Japan? Japan. Japan is like incredibly populated but really small, but I think Japan did we decide to do. We measure that is the most $5 million and it's very small. Camp people die on the side of New York City and skip on Japan like I dunno how big Japan is. How I might've made that up.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       It's not the size of New York. Tokyo is the size of New York City. Right, but Japan itself in California, how big is it? That makes sense, but it's an hour or two. There are a lot of their different Tokyo. Thirty 5 million people though. He swept that stacked into this little spot and they're super orderly. 8 million. When Curtis Lemay was firebombing Tokyo, I believe about 8 million people in about eight days died from fire. I think it was 8 million or maybe it was a million, but I don't get shit in the Oliver Stone things. What happened in Russia? That's the dark. What happened? Twenty 7 million people died in World War II. Twenty 7 million people, man, and it's very rarely discussed. And then how many Russians died? Two and then they had stolen the next 10 years. They last. Yeah. They had more people died in World War II than anybody. Yes. No one talks about it. One as well.

Speaker 1:          00:16:23       Dude, very flatland. This flat area, the Oliver Stone thing, it's overwhelming. I'm going to have to watch it like three or four times and wasn't there. This was world war two, but wasn't there only a 2 million deaths total from like that must most of them from soldiers. Fifty dollars million. Most of them were civilians. That deaths there are about 50 million altogether or maybe more from a total in the world and World War Two. You know what I'm talking about? Just soldiers though. I think 2 million soldiers, 12, there's probably a lot of civilian death. I mean there were firebombing killed. Most of the deaths by far were civilian according to what I saw. I must have caught. There was a lot of civilian deaths, 100 percent because there was a lot of fire bombing cities like just indiscriminate firebombing, especially in Japan. Like we did some horrible shit to them before we dropped the atomic bomb, but even before we dropped the atomic bomb, they were fire bombing cities. You know, they, they, they killed everybody that was down there. Like the nuclear bomb itself, like if you mean that is so crazy that they were willing to drop. I mean this is where a war gets. You're willing to drop a bomb on a city, not a military base now, and because we're weird because Nagasaki and Hiroshima, remember where I'm the industrial cities that we're churning out a lot of the war planes and there was. That was where the center of their war machine was to remember. We drop pamphlets, we dropped my uncle,

Speaker 2:          00:17:51       my great uncle dropped the pamphlets, the warning pamphlets saying we're going to do, we're going to fucking drive. Is better surrender that here. Yeah. They gave them warning, which that's how crazy nuclear power was and meanwhile they had only blown up shit in the desert and you know, and stuff in the ocean before they really weren't sure what was gonna happen. We didn't know. A lot of scientists didn't know that there was energy trapped in an Adam and and when we, when they actually detonated the hydrogen bomb, we were like, wow. All the theorizing about energy and anatomy. In fact, that is actually true because we just, that's, that's kind of proof positive when you, when you see a mushroom cloud with that kind of power and you're like, oh fuck. We just unleashed the horrors of nature, which is crazy because we've been in war ever since we've had those things ever since.

Speaker 2:          00:18:34       No one's gotten to the point where that comes out. Everybody's like, just keep it on the edges. Come on, bitch. Oh yeah. There's a term for it. Mutually assured destruction. Yep. Matt can be broken down into an acronym. Yeah, your boy, Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson had a really fascinating discussion about they couldn't really get out of the gates because they couldn't agree on what truth was, but that was a frustrating discussion. Very much so. But, but at, they had a fascinating idea of there are certain things that you could know scientifically that none of us should know. And for example, there are scientific truths that if we knew would actually result in our complete extinction. Like what? Like, you know, uh, so, so an example of when we found out if you split an atom, it creates a chain reaction and a powerful force that can vaporize 100,000 or even a million people, right?

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       There is potentially scientific knowledge like that that could have, for example, reduced everything that you know to dust and if that's something that's actually something you could know, is it worth knowing and would it be immoral to know you know, that that's Kinda the, that's where morality and science kind of converge and where you have an actual conversation about certain things are so devastating and it would be the. It would mean the end of your entire existence. So maybe that's a scientific truth, quote unquote that isn't worth having even though scary. Yeah. Yeah. But the problem is the universe doesn't give a fuck about that. Correct. The reality is if someone does invent a time machine and they hit that button, we're all fucked. I mean, it really could happen. It really is something that's, you know, within a thousand years, whatever, you have the exponential increase in technology and power and with what's available and what they can do.

Speaker 2:          00:20:20       It could happen percent. That's why it's so important to have those discussions. You, that's why you know, the atomic bomb, there was a real concern that it was going to evaporate the entire atmosphere of the earth. It was, it wasn't everybody, but there was a small group of scientists to go, hold on, you know, what else could happen? This could kill everybody. And they were still like, we'll see what happens. We don't think so. Think about, think about like, think about responsibility for a scientist like that. Think about that idea. But how about the, when they had the first nuclear reactor, who was it? Who was the Italian guy? The father of the nuclear reactor though. So, and they were at the University of, Oh fuck, what was the university? Where were the, I guess the reactor started overheating. I don't. Jesus. And they had a, the, there was a guy with a bucket there who was just going to throw a bunch of water on it.

Speaker 2:          00:21:07       I mean it was, I can't. I'm Frederick Frederico, Enrico Enrico Fermi. There it is. What a name. That's what it was. Thank you buddy. And she named was in Rico University Chicago. It started to trip out. I would wear only handmade suits. My name is Enrico Fermi, enrico handmade shoes. It was loafers with no socks. He was a genius. I think he died of radiation poisoning, didn't he? Because he might have ingested it. Oh Jesus Christ. Poor bitch. From the time they started the Manhattan project, how long did it take to actually figure out the atom bomb? That's also in the documentary that's in the documentary because we're trying to figure it out, man. It was if we could split the atom and hit critical mass shit, can you imagine what kind of a weapon this would be? So it was a. They hired a couple thousand scientists. They started the Manhattan project, started throwing all this money at it, right?

Speaker 2:          00:22:02       And then the final proof was Nagasaki and Hiroshima. That was it. Did we pull this off? And then boom, they knew already that it works because they had a bunch of tests before. Uh, before they did that, one of the most horrific thing about the test was they would have soldiers run towards the blast because they didn't understand radiation back then, which is so incredible. Like they didn't understand the damage, radiation, those videos you could watch online, Jamie [inaudible] up, or they would blow this atomic bomb up. They add up. I'm a mock town in the distance. They would create these mocks cities to see what kind of damage it would do. They'd put up houses and Shit and they blow them the fuck up and they'd have these soldiers run towards the blast. And the idea would be that after the blast went off, it killed whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:22:45       People are killed and everybody else would be stunned and that's when the soldiers move in so they would fucking crazy towards the bottom. It's the funniest video. They're all dead. They all showed up. They think that that's what killed John Wayne soldiers running to nuclear explosion. Yeah. Punch that. And that's what you just said. Well, it's like a plan. Days after we dropped that bomb does bombs on Japan. When Hirohito, the emperor got on the radio and said, called for the surrender. One man said, it's time for us to surrender every single soldier. One of the Japanese. Everyone I'm willing to die for that cause they. They dropped their weapons and they surrendered it. We took what they were so fanatically devoted to authority and still in many ways are so check this shit out man. These fucking are sitting there watching that in the distance. I mean did that close and what's crazy is like the wind from the blast comes and hits them. There's a bunch of different videos of this. A lot

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       of these were the US army would document a lot of their training episodes and so this is what they would do. They'd get see that? That's the blast from the nuclear bomb. Look at that. Fucking people are standing there in these trenches and there's a bomb going off in the distance. It's so scary that they knew so little about what effects it would have on people and they let these people run towards their death and these people are all running towards radiation sickness running towards cancer. They're running towards this fucking mushroom cloud in the desert. Was that the repercussions? Like when they got home that night, people would feel like there's a bunch. If she'd been. You'll never get the full fucking story as to what happened and what kind of health problems, but John Wayne died because he was filming these Spaghetti Westerns in the fucking in the desert in Nevada near these test sites and a lot of people that were on the crew with them. This might be bullshit. A lot of people in the crew with them got cancer. Look at it. He got lung cancer. No, no, no, no. It was the government who got lung cancer from smoking. Yeah, he did.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       Everybody in the film. There was something about everybody on the film that worked on that film with them also smoked and also to cancer. What the fuck? What the fuck? How long did it take? How long does nuclear bomb goes off? Like just a nuclear bomb just went off before you get sick. How long have you have to wait until you could populate that area again? Dozens of years. Not necessarily going to take your Sheila knocking SOC report. Not as bad as like nuclear waste. Nuclear was the atomic bomb, so waste. It's a. it's a different thing than the thousand years it would take for that. No, no. To take that long. People live in Nagasaki now. They live in Hiroshima in their factories with the nuclear waste.

Speaker 1:          00:25:38       There's definitely plants, nuclear power plants that have nuclear waste it. That stuff gets to like what's going on right now in Fukushima, it's very, very dangerous because they can't do anything about it yet and it's getting worse. Like the radiation levels are higher and Fukushima now than when they've been battling this disaster since what? Two Thousand and 12, something like that. Turnover turnover is a fascinating example of a major nuclear meltdown and it's thriving with wildlife thrive. Nuclear Wolves. Yeah. Shane Smith from vice films show out there. Really? Yeah. They were fucking hunting wolves with Ak 47 commute and mute and wolves. And read your mind Bro. Don't ever play rock paper scissors with them. These fuckers know what's coming. You know, there's people that think that they never figured it out. They never figured out how to make the atom bomb and they just basically firebombed just like they did all the others.

Speaker 1:          00:26:27       Those people are retarded. There's peer reviewed papers, but we were in a war. We were in a race with the, with the Nazi's to create a bomb. We knew the Nazis, the moon, because there are a lot of German scientists came over. I remember as as for example, Einstein. Am I getting confused here? Are you suggesting that nuclear aren't real? I don't know. I'm just saying there's people that think no, but they never figured it out. Those people retarda 100 percent. They ever targeted Dude Oppenheimer Oppenheimer's papers that he wrote on it and the work that he did on it, like that's all anybody could read that anybody can go into that. It's all documented. What they did, the tests, I mean they. There's videos of the explosions, there's videos of them blowing a fucking hole in the ocean. That's so insane that they had these boats, these destroyers placed around the water.

Speaker 1:          00:27:12       They didn't pull that up because I forget what the test was with the nuclear testing. The ocean. There's videos of bombs going off. You can see it. It's real destruction. Undeniable. How do you know their nuclear, not just regular bumps. The difference in the destruction is insane to me. Eddie fucking God. Dude, you're talking about a mile high wall of water. They had no idea it was so scary. If you're a fish, know they lost his fucking boat. They're like, well, we'll just have this boat. Sit around. Look at it. This. We're getting a new monitor. This monitor keeps cutting out. I don't know what's going on. Terrifying. It destroys this fucking boat. They thought they could park their destroyer a certain distance away from this nuclear bombs. So they're like, okay, so if we drop a bomb on them, how close can we be?

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       Turns out you can't even be remotely fucking close. Check this shit. How you see it from the sky. Look at this. Watch this. They set up this fucking boat. I mean, when see Jamie, what are you doing? You're fast forwarding. See if there's got to be a part where you can see it from distance because from distance it's so fucking insane. That's what it looks like. You're talking like, what is that? 30,000, 40,000 plus feet in the air and water, Bro. Dude, that's insane gas, so the water evaporates. Irregular bomb can be the way that is hundreds of thousands of regular bombs. What they can do with these things is insane. Crazy at Nagasaki and Hiroshima or little firecrackers compared to what they have now. Fire fighter aircraft, so it's just not a question whether or not nuclear power nuclear bombs are real. There's nuclear power. That's probably the reason why we're.

Speaker 1:          00:29:02       Our lights are on or that we use nuclear power as as we speak, but what it does make steam. Yeah, I know. It's very clean. It's very fucking hot as fuck and it makes steam as long as it doesn't get out of your little holding pen. It's like you've harnessed a demon and you use that demon to make tea. That's right. Cattle, the power. That's so unbelievably hot. The constantly keep water in contact with it. It makes steam. The steam powered the turbines. The turbines make electricity gets out. Yeah. Well a piece of uranium, I think the size of a pencil, you can look this up, can run a nuclear for six months. You know, it's an incredible, insane form of energy. It's a demon and we're harnessing it and a cement box and we're putting it right next to the ocean drive to San Diego.

Speaker 1:          00:29:54       You have a drive to San Diego and see the nuclear power plant there and all the nuclear bombs and that Russia had. They still have to have. That's one of the great things about where lost shit though. There was a lot of lost material. Nuclear Bomb, Rosa parks and the rosenbergs soul. No one else figured it out. The American. Did you ever hear that American story? So the story. So the. The rosenbergs a husband and a wife sold nuclear secrets to the Soviet because they were communists in this, in this country, and when they sold them, and was it truman? I think Truman put them to death in the electric chair. They both. They were both killed for bait for high treason, but now those motherfuckers sold it to a lot of people in India just pull my amount each other. Remember this too, as they're the rise math Semitism in the thirties in Germany and certain scientists and Jews were getting assassinated, beat up a lot of the German scientists because there was a real renaissance in Germany and Austria, physics renaissance at with along with people like Albert Einstein.

Speaker 1:          00:30:59       They emigrated to the United States because they were like, I don't think they liked the Jews over here, and in Germany. We benefited from that mass immigration. We've talked about this guy on the, on the podcast before, but the biggest crazy scenario, like ironic scenario was Fritz Haber, the guy who simultaneously was winning the Nobel prize for being able to extract nitrogen out of the air at the same time. They wanted to try him for crimes against humanity being the first one to gas people and he created Zyklon a, which was this really fucking horrible smelling pesticide. It was a terrible poisoned, but it had a horrible smell to it and that smell let you know that it was there. The Nazis took it and turned to design con be they took the smell out of it and they use it to gas. The Jews and this guy was a Jew himself and a scientist dude, but he was a painter in the country.

Speaker 1:          00:31:56       He's a patriot. He wanted to help his. He wanted to help Germany, his beloved country, when World War One and said, I think I can help you guys with a gas that will kill everybody, a lot of people and we'll just wait for the wind to shift and he was a patriot in his mind. He was killing the enemy who are trying to take over his country. He was a Jew and then of course in 19 while starting my God and probably 39, they started using this gas. What happened to him in the final sweep? Wound up dying, fleeing Germany, and he had a heart. He had a heart condition. His life was hell man. His wife committed suicide in front of him because of what he was doing like it was. It was off and he left his son with his wife's body while he went off to war to go do more of it because. Right. The whole

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       thing is it's. It's just the. It was a different place. It's a different world. It's not Santa Monica where you're going to fucking starbucks and you get some sugar free latte. People will always starved. We had to worry about the winter and we have to worry about Guano. We relied on Guano on bat shit and bird droppings close to Chile. People will go to war, get bat shit. Do you know that? That's where the term crazy. That's where it came from. Not In Africa. People would go to these places in Africa to take Guano and other people will come from other countries. They would go to war over this stuff because it's the best fertilizer you could use. You just have to get nitrogen into the soil. But Fritz, Fritz Haber and his buddy and the guy who had perfect this came up with a way to get nitrogen out of the air which becomes ammonia and that's how you know drips into a liquid form.

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       This can right out of the air dude, so we don't die of starvation anymore. Modern Day farming and the reason you've never met anybody who died of starvation is because of Mr Fritz hopper. You better start getting more grateful for real high because you're just laughing. In general, they say that 50 percent of the nitrogen, 50 percent of the nitrogen and the human beings today might have come from the hopper method to estimate. Shout out to harbor to hopper. The air that you breathe in is like 80 percent nitrogen. We think of it as oxygen and carbon dioxide. It's mostly nitrogen. Yeah, just really weird. That's why pure oxygen fucks you up and gets you high and it's dangerous. Right, and super good. Super flat. When you're. When you're looking in bars in vegas.

Speaker 2:          00:34:12       Everyone's trying to. I had one Jack Shit for me. Anything. They so stupid. Have you been scared? I was. Fuck that. Fuck that. You got to do it. You'll never leave. You almost died. I went to. I went to fucking look at the biggest nuclear explosion ever equals to 57 million megatons of TNT. You tell him he just wants to bomb. It's like way bigger than its source. That's in the atmosphere member who signed the antibody testing training and the air atmosphere at that. That's incredible. Kennedy and the Soviet signed a pact to not do this in the atmosphere and what James is trying to toss it in the Arctic Ocean. When they did this in 1961 bomb ever tested. God. That's like the final scene in a video game. When you win for them where they made these movies, they made them in Hollywood at the lookout mountain studios.

Speaker 2:          00:35:11       You could look that this is not not made in Hollywood. Eddie. This is a video of an actual bus. Kennedy and the Soviet real. I'm just saying they edit it and had the biggest studio lookout. Mountain studios. It was a. It was a top secret air force intelligence as the one we were talking about up in some dude who works at the video store edit it. Who would have edited that would go to someone who is the biggest, most advanced movie studio saying that that's fake. No, no, no. I'm just saying that they admitted it. They. That's where they put on it and they edit it together, but they didn't change it. They just filmed. I almost died when he dropped that. Everything, everything, everything. Everything. In any anti treat, anti testing, treated the atmospheric testing, I can't remember how to word it, but he looked out the window and said, well, we're weren't detonating these bombs in the atmosphere.

Speaker 2:          00:36:08       Where's that waste co? And they were like, um, it just rains down on people. He goes, well, that doesn't make any fucking sense because we're all. When we were doing it, the Soviets are doing it, can we? And that's when they signed the treaty not to do that anymore. They don't, they don't test nuclear weapons. Nobody knows anymore. Nobody does. But Russia did launch some sort of a missile test recently. Two Treaty apparently saw getting very scary mountains. Very gangster gangster. Well he's, I watch house of cards, Bro. Pretty much get it. Putin's created an atmosphere again, you know, he's just a product of symptom of the Russian mindset maybe. But like I said, he's a hard man. Hard, hard man who makes his country weaker. When was the last time you bought anything Russian? So what's going on? You know, I mean, it might not be a soft time for Russia, but it's a soft time for us. Clinton. Obama said something interesting, he said, let's just just just we can ignore Russia. They make guns and some oil, but their guns aren't even that good. Nobody needs him. You know. Obama said that he didn't really say like stabbing yourself in the finger on the edge. Brother. I live on the air knife or definitely not the edge. He's quoting.

Speaker 2:          00:37:20       Knife came from the Congo and it's probably got all sorts of diseases like justin wren probably hit that in his ass over here. Just stole that from a poor kids. Gold in fucking jail. Me My shift. That's what you would use. Feels like. It feels to me like your fingers would slide right up on the blade. One. Good Stab and you cut your hand. Not The way I hold her brother. What do you put your thumb over the top? First of all, like a pen. You go and click. Click. When I, when I. When I yard fight, when I get into a yard. Shanking fest. I'm slicing. I'm opening you up. I'm fucking. I'm unzipping. My other friend is actually like studied like knife fighting, fighting techniques and what these guys do know, I catch him video to like butter, the slice. You open like butter on zippy. I'll scribe your spine from the front. I kind of go, I can't do this. Adult opened you up to rather pay taxes. Let's show me a video on Instagram, doodling. Look, this guy dead lifting 600 pounds. Just. I'm like, oh my God. My friend John Rollo was sending me, showing me some pictures on his phone, went to lunch other day and he was sending me some pictures on his phone with his duty trains with who's a week just to put 100 percent natural tested. Many times I'll have to see it, homie

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       is he's dead lifting some ungodly amount of weight like 700 pounds or some shit from behind his back behind his back behind himself and lifting us up and he's showing this to me and he's got. He had 600 pounds on his back for a squat with no hands. He puts his hands like this and he does a full deep knee squat. Six hundred pounds resting while he's in a prayer position. Yeah, yeah. No hands. He's just. That guy can do with like a bar by itself. This motherfucker's got like 600 pounds and squatting like this. He's insane. Big Country Fed, white, gray and black guy. Giant athlete. The naked gorilla to my left over here. You said according to your brother, you got to over 700 pounds. Yeah, but not. This is one of those asshole. This guy's 1:40 world records. Four zero. Oh my God. He's just a freak and Rollo was telling me about it and he's like, dude, I'm telling you.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       This guy looked breaks almost every and he's not like the heaviest class. So sometimes he competes against people who are heavier than him and in those cases he doesn't lift as much or anything. It's just really good at this saying, I forget his name was just unbelievable. Physical strength. This is what these guys are into. Like Mark Bell, you know Chris Bell documentary maker and his brother mark from bigger, stronger, faster. These fucking guys, they just. There's videos or their whole instagram's like videos of them pushing a new personal record. They got their fucking elbows all wrapped up and everything is wrapped up and mark's actually get this thing called a slingshot that you put your arm and it's like this thick rubber neoprene thing that you bench in and he's benching 600 clapping and it's great. It takes to get into that suit slapping each other which powder and chalk in the air at all they're trying to do is just like lift heavier and heavier weight.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       It's crazy. I love it. I take a weight lifting class now with from an Olympian, you dumb fucking Venice at the Venice barbell holiday was. I saw you try to deadlift and Austin had died. So sad. I though. Oh, that was when he was doing like four 95. That primal soldier dude, that dude from instagram, it's just ridiculous. Kettlebell routines. He's one of the instructors and this guy is just stupid strong. And he was dead lifted. It was like 4:50 plus 100 pounds of chains, right? Yes, yes, yes. So it's like 50 slash 50 if you get to full. We don't really get the full chain, you know, some chain left. But he's a young warrior who likes the chain. It was great with that damn sap. Do they always works out in the shortest shorts? No shirt on. Fuck. Like that. Body double chicks around the body.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       Now you're thinking about Juan's brother pizzas. Too much ticket. A primal soldier. That's who he is on. There is no, that's, that's Eric. I think that's the wrong dude man. That's his brother. His brother. But one is a based. His brothers. I just saw him. Oh is that the same guy? Now I'm talking about the other guy who wears glasses. Just go to primal. Swole. Go to go to tim level. Soldier. Go to his um, his instagram page. His view of it. Noticing that like when you try to click on instagram pictures from a Mac, sometimes they don't open up a new window. The kid maybe it's a different spot so far. Yeah. Go to the upper left. One kid is doing because I could Ninja Turtle. John Wolfe work me out on it when I was there and Austin Goddamn fucking shitty computer screen. We've got to get a new TV.

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       This TV does not communicate with our computer. Right, but he does all these like flow exercises. Shorts couldn't be smaller and go out and publish. Shout out to short, short, short, short, front, jacked his. Fuck God damn stupid young warrior and his brother Bell Swing and stud. Clotted up. His brother. One is the other head instructor there and forget it. I would never wear a shirt with John Wolf is the shit to. John Wolfe gave me this whole hip series of workouts. He gave me this hip thing. It's all body weight exercises. Just extending your foot forward. You do like 10 reps that way and then you do 10 reps like as a side kick to the side and hold it out in the air and then you do 10 reps left and then 10 reps right in front of you like you did. Circles did a whole dinner with amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       Unbelievable. Then he had me take. John said, let's just look. Yeah. I said, I ask them a question about the mace, and he goes, yeah, and he grabs a 15 pound mason. I'm like, dude, I'm a lot stronger than 15 pounds. Give me a hug and bray. Okay, yeah. Uh, we did five rounds of some crazy shit and 15 pounds was simply perfect. It was worth. And I told him about. I workout with a 25 pound club. You know those Indian male clubs, those 25 pounds steel club, that's it. Twenty five pounds. That's it. But when you're doing shit like these things, were you swinging over your arm like Conan and just hold it in place. It's phenomenal exercise and you realize our biggest weaknesses, the things that are always going bad on people, and that's the connections. That's not necessarily your biceps, right? It's usually like the connection between your bicep and your shoulder, your shoulder to your back, attended our connections.

Speaker 1:          00:43:33       And when you're doing things like yoga and when you're doing things like these club bells, we holding these big steel clubs in front of you and you're swinging them over your head. You're developing like very strong tissue and all your shoulder joints in your elbow joints, in your wrist joints because it's constantly manipulating the, the, the, the different and it's kinetic, the different weight of it. I mean the, the gravity is pulling it this way in that way and you have to stabilize it and you're using all these weird muscles that you don't use if you're pushing a nautilus machine and we're just doing something simple like a ranch. Yeah. You got these isolation things where like you're holding one thing and you're moving it in a certain way by itself. Like whether it's Kettlebell flows or whether it's. I'm using steel clubs like you're controlling like all of your different stabilizing muscles in, in a very unique way. Holding static positions to do that one. It's like a yoga exercise where you're on one knee and he had one leg straight out and

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       your arm straight ahead and just hold that. I just started doing yoga and that I have a whole new respect for yoga. I mean I've been doing it now three weeks and man it kicks my ass. It's an hour and at the 30 minute mark, I'm Don. I got to leave. I walk out. Have you ever been to yoga class that I haven't walked out. Really? Yeah. It's so hard to bring ice water. I do break down after 30 minutes. I get crushed. Crushed in 30 minutes. It depends on how your body and then I laid there and it's so God damn hot. It's like 110 degrees in there. It's ridiculous to stick it out. I have no choice. I have no trust. Every day I'm looking at. It feels like you're getting it done. I actually am proud of myself for going because that's the hardest yoga class.

Speaker 3:          00:45:20       They got a core yoga. They got all different kinds of levels. No heat at all. Little bit of heat. I didn't even know it was an accident. It was just perfect. Ten 30 in the morning, wake up. I just go, go right down the street and it was just kicking my ass from day one, just crushing our early hang. I leave there and I got to. I'm too tired to get in the shower. I was just like, are you good with the Cold Eddie? Can you handle the cold better than you hit cancel the heat? Yeah, but I want to kill two birds with one stone. I want to stick it out and I want to be able to. I mean, there's old ladies that do it, you know what I mean? And they're fine and just holding, holding your arms up and all these poses. No wonder yoga chicks have big shoulders and triceps.

Speaker 3:          00:45:59       You're sexy. Oh Man. All those poses that look, they look so easy in a picture that looked like, oh, they're doing tight. She tried doing. Try Holding your hands up for a 90 minute class. That should a test. You know our your hours enough. For me, I do 90 minutes every week. Sometimes I've done it three times in a week, but I'm doing it at least once a week. Sometimes I do. There's a 70 minute class that they do there. Sometimes it's really good because they don't talk at all. It was just like, you know, it's for people that already know the positions just tells you what to do. Go through it. No, no, no, no. She cheats. Says like begin and, and she says what the position is to begin, but none of that explaining what to do while it's going on and there's a little. There's like some, some yoga places, not the one that I go to, but I've been to some when I start talking about like the mystical properties in this position. This is good for the ascending colon. No know you didn't go to medical school.

Speaker 3:          00:46:50       Did I take. I take classes down in Venice and there will be some awesome, awesome. Like good looking dude who would come in and beads and a great body. He was a Yogi. I. There's one guy, can't remember his name. He's the greatest. He would teach and the girls all loved him and he would adjust you and I swear to God he would. You'd get into a position and he would say, and let's not fight this. Let's just have our own relationship with our own God. And there it is. Love, feel how much energy it does take to reach to the back of the room and had a great voice. And I'd be like, I was like, I'm with his voice

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       to give myself over to la. Was that I haven't been back since I was at this hot yoga. I won't say where it was a 90 minute class and there were, for whatever reason that day, that morning, there's just hot chicks everywhere. And it was, this dude comes in and the girl dates, we goes, he's strict. He's known for being strict and like, well two yogis with relapsed. We go in there. Oh Dude, 10 minutes into it calls me out. Brennan, eyes up front, let's not, let's not go. No, swear to God, you know, I'm fucking balls deep. Get My, you know, my hamstrings. So it was, it was unwarranted. Yeah, hundred percent. And it was super embarrassing. I was like, Hey, call blocking. Yeah. Hey, you know, I'll punch in his face because I was switching legs and I didn't know what everyone else was doing. I was so into it.

Speaker 2:          00:48:18       And so I looked around to see what they were doing. He's like, eyes up front, running, eyes up front. Let's not go. Let's not. God make me so mad because I would be talking with a shitty thing to say if you weren't actually doing that. Do you think he's just hating? I'm not sure what's going on. I haven't been back. Kind of hurt my feelings. Well, there was a guy that used to teach yoga at my place and he was like real sort of hardcore, like a very like intense dude and he, you know, he would teach the class was a, it was headed at a totally different vibe to like, I got along good with them, but his vibe was different. You know, his, his vibe was like, you're like, you're gonna have to tough this out. Military style was a little weird. I was like, yeah, come on man.

Speaker 2:          00:48:57       We're just stretching. That's how this guy with any to calmed down, I don't want to be aggressive. And this guy was saying, he goes, uh Oh, you can only get water when I totally get water. And he goes, once that door shuts, no one can leave this. Did that to fucking. I don't like that. There's a guy, Brian cast, who is one of the more famous guys. He was really smart about it because he opened up his school in Los Angeles. He studied for many years and he said, uh Oh no. Are All, are welcome, and there's no money and be like, what? And he goes, just donation if you want no big deal to have that. Yeah. And you just donate. But he made millions because what happens is people go all the time, they're like, it feels good. Yeah. You're like, you're not even asking for money. The class is open to everyone first come first serve totally democratic. And what you do is people don't like taking shit for free. Most people, most people are like, you know what? I'm going to give you a 100 foot because I really appreciate. I would do that. Like I, I give the NPR because I listened for free all the time. So whenever news from ketamine, hey, how bout we talk about the fights?

That yeah, apparently on the ground in a cold, a Rolls Royce and he had a speed on. I mean, I've been to is they, uh, they asked him about it, he says lies, lies, lies, and then, and then he said women would have paid $1,000,000 for one drop of my sperm. And The

My Yoga teacher would fuck this guy into the ground stretching. Okay. I don't think you were correct because that's right. There is pretty good. He does way hanging to the side of. The thing about this guy though is he's built like a popsicle stick and when you're built like a popsicle stick you can put your body into weird positions because you don't have any muscle to stop it. Like there's certain poses, you know, this one where you go under the arms and you can't do it. It's not happening. It's just too much meat and I'll keep it right here joe.

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       Keep it right here. Try it though because even in trying it you're getting distressed but I don't think there's enough physical real estate in my troll size, arms to fit in there. That's all I got. We got to see him do the Scorpion poses and shit. He was the guy would do well I think we found our new movement called women and people with long arms can definitely get their arms in better positions that because they have more to work with. But that also comes up in Jujitsu. Jujitsu, like the ability to get Darcy and oh Jesus had. He can do that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       I can't put my leg like this guy. Look at this shit. Just do. Took a triangle themselves like that. Freaky. That's pretty cold. Come on Bro. That's freaky. The guy's oldest. Fuck. He know why he's doing this because he's thinking about how much dick. He's going to swing out. This video is dumb. He was doing the shit when he was second warmed up. I'm going to fuck like this. Let me show you. He got up like my Dick is my legs. I think he's still alive, but he was doing it at 75. He was doing. He was on his album. My ass. I put Dumbo. Triangle suck. My Cock is not alive to. He's never going to die at 70 6:40, holding his weight. He's 100 years old here. Did his assets deteriorated beyond. That's going. Wow. That's amazing. It's 30 years old in this video.

Speaker 1:          00:56:00       Look at this fucking spinal flexibility though. That is incredible. Don't fuck with my anger when I just say that is incredible. He died. He kicked you into thinking it was no big deal with me on cook suitcase right there in my. Yeah, I can put them in a tote, gobble, gobble, gobble. I can bring him in a tote and be like, I brought my fucking gobbled from nick my as well for extra stimulation. Stimulation to center of Global Chinese, Chinese just fine. This is how I grew up with from my backside. Notice not a lot of spinal movement. Just gobble.

Speaker 1:          00:56:39       He's talking the whole time. Teaching. This is what I'm thinking of coming in my own mouth. Maybe not today. Today's not that impressed, but I, you know, which he rarely sees though. You really see people that are built like Jack. People that are really good at yoga. There are a couple of guys I want to know. I want to see someone mean I know that Hixon when he was young was pretty fucking fit and he was on that. Oh Ninety one, 95, but he was way better at Yoga than most people know. Like hixon did. Amazing Shit. He used to be able to stand in a full split on a balancing bar with his leg, totally straight up in the air on a bouncing Barney's. There's videos of him dooney and Santa Monica. He's standing on a balancing bar with one light, grabs his other foot and extends it over his fucking head while was a young American students getting muscular.

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       Some of those American students like just got shoemaker who I took a class from. Holy Shit. Built like a brick dominating the yoga game. Now there's still a bunch of studios are all over the place, but I gotta think that that guy being so crazy and all the crazy stuff that he gets in trouble with and all the assault allegations, whether or not they're true, you know, and another thing that he did, you know the thing, that tax evasion thing where they found a bunch of like a warehouse filled with Ferrari's and beat him and he likes Croxley's and shit. He said that he was opening up a school for children to teach them auto repair. So that's why. I mean come on Bro. He's awesome. He's amazing. And he's a yoga guy, like everything's so fucked up about it. He's like, he's supposed to be abused in love and prosperity and it's important to the spirituality.

Speaker 1:          00:58:25       Not your money now. Fuck that millionaire teaching strategy. It's great. Yeah. Now I think he just stays in India now. Fucking America. Is there anyone else killing the game like that? Not really, no. Not that I can think of. Ray Shiva, rea, Max strong. There are a lot of guys who are, have a really great reputation who have a lot of stuff. Was an older lady that taught to be grown there was pretty famous. Danny knows her. She went to Haiti and she's in tremendous shape. Oh, isn't she the lady that runs that? The place golden bridge or something like that. And La. Yes. She's like a coon Delaney. Mass Kundalini is the shit that the people who do it and even denny says, you can have psychedelic experiences on it that if you do it and you get into a certain state where you do the yoga over and over again to enough, you can actually stimulate that part in your brain that produces dmt. I was trying to get a stretch, man. Eddie, your friend. The lady, the lady that

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       you went to Egypt with, didn't she wasn't she? She knew that she was able to do that. Right. She would tell you she'd have psychedelic experiences pay out. So that's people that we had bad. Yeah. She had bang at four in the morning to shake up the, the, the. I don't know that maybe the dmt out state, but she wanted to check in the morning. I know. It's funny, right? He was into it. Well, but the thing is like your brain does produce that shit and so these people that say they know how to do it, it's not outside the realm of possibility. Like it might be possible for you to figure out a way to do it. I've never done it, I've only done it through the drug itself, but there's got to be a way to get your brain to do it. I had a. well it sounds. I didn't even have to explain it, but I swear to God like there was a period of time when I was practicing taekwondo so much and I was like, you know, you get to a point where you practiced enough where you can think you're kicked out and they're going gonna laugh at this.

Speaker 2:          01:00:18       Me, you started releasing dmt is so crazy. You say anything. I'm gonna tell you whatever you're saying I'm going to have a problem with. So I'm going, I'm going and I'm committed. I didn't know whether it was going to say you left off at when I used to practice taekwondo, but I think the way I was stretching my body opened up something where I. where I went. I kicked and I, I swear to God, it's gonna sound weird, but from that point on I got way neater with the way I kept my room and the way I kept my car and it made sense to me. Something aligned and there was such a drug induced, but something happened there and then I thought you're going to say that your thoughts. When many kicks that your arm, you just punch and way harder like that movie rookie.

Speaker 2:          01:01:05       I fell the tree. I felt a tree. A tree was in the way and I side kick the trio. I don't see any giant oak. No. Steve. Alright. Alright, we'll do it. We'll do it dry. Fuck it. We'll do it. We'll do a dry dry. Hey man, we're going to talk about the fights guys. Fuck. A lot of people fall off about Kundalini Yoga. Yeah, let's watch that and then we'll go to UFC of retirement from MMA removed from drug testing pool. That's what I would do too if I wanted to take drugs. Just saying he looks good though, Dave. I wanted to get super jacked again. I'm like, well someday someday we'll work out a deal, but for now I'm going to toss bitches on their head. I like to do that when I weigh about 3:40, so let's get that. Brendan and I were talking about how I liked art for people like Anderson Silva. I want Anderson to take a testosterone and whatever it takes because I want to see the old anderson you didn't like the Dad Bod know and I'm serious like for me, a great like that, who's obviously, you know, getting older. I want to see him fight at the best he can. I miss his incredible skillset and by the way, if he's, he's got the mind, he understands fighting on such a deep level. His body might just not be with

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       fastest. His mind wants to. I want a cat. I want to catch you out because you're supposed to end your career when your body doesn't react to say, look, you can. You can make an argument for the Vito Belfort School of mma, you know, because that's what you get. You get the old veteran with the young body. No. Yeah. I'm talking about when Bryan, when? When vituro rather was at the peak of his, like most latest cycle. Right? When you knocked out Luke rockhold. When he fucked up Michael Bisping Dude, when he knocked out Dan Henderson the first time, he was a goddamn force of science and that's what he was. He was unbelievable. Training, a lifetime of skill. All that stuff is important. First, write a lifetime skill. Lifetime of technique, ridiculous, ferocious warrior spirit, right? He's gonna motherfucking Vito Belfort. Then you add synthetic testosterone and you get a monster. That's what you got when I'm telling you that guy to this day, like that period I, I think is one of the scariest fighters that has ever fought in the sport.

Speaker 1:          01:03:20       I think TRT RTV tour is one of the fucking scariest guys that ever did, but definitely the best one. 80 five on planet earth at the time he was for awhile, man. He was terrified. He was fearless, destroyed rockhold. We'll take both of them. He thought to through to. We'll kicks in his whole career and one of them was he missed with Luke rockhold. The other one. He hit him in the face. We never saw that from him before. He threw some kicks. He threw nice, but he was more of a boxing style fighter and then fucked up bisping's eye with a kick. Yeah, headcase. Unbelievable. Bisbing Simon. Some issues before that as well. But that definitely didn't. No, it didn't help. Like Vito was a monster. Henderson. We get them now. Like it's, it's, you know, even with a Weidman, which is not the same animal fight.

Speaker 1:          01:04:07       Kelvin. Kelvin Gaslin in, in Brazil. Yeah. What do you think about that? Why? Why do you think being in Brazil is a big deal? Um, I can get some help to regulate his body back to where are you saying what do you, when you started your body starts producing estrogen and all that. You can't get it back if it goes to Brazil, right? They're going to go to Brazil for short. Did you go to Brazilian? I just won't go a lot. It wouldn't be the other time. And like with Josie Outta, when they tried testing him, they, they made the guy like, he, he had to stay at customs. They won't let him leave. Like it was super weird. Will tell the whole story. The whole story. You got this the first time they came, he wouldn't do it. He wouldn't take the test because he said he didn't know the guy, but apparently the way it happens, so like, you know, I've talked to people that had been tested that like it's super shady.

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       They come up to you, they'll take you into a room that test you. It's not sterile. They just like, we want to test you right now though. Watch you. When you go to the bathroom. Tim Kennedy said they had watched him take a shower. They'd look at him. She's like, you get home from training and they're like, we want to test you, take a shower. I can't take my eyes off you. They can't. You can't do it that way for a reason. Because we were cheating. You can't. They can't. So anyway, so the all the guy, they're trying to deport him to try to kick him out of Brazil, like the literally trying to get him out of it. It was time to say, you don't have any authority to test us. You're not even from this country. Like they're throwing the kitchen sink at them. Then finally the next day they get them to test, right? He gives them tests and he trips and spills it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:33       Who does, although it's fantastic. So like what? There you go and then. So he has to give him another one and then it doesn't mean anything he didn't do. He didn't fail. Doesn't mean anything, but it's all like these guys like vandelay runs away from the guy. They come to his gym, but go google takes off. Sure. You know, which is the. He got fucked more than anybody ever and the history of that. However, because they banned him for life, which is insane. It's 100 percent reversed that. Nope. Well they did. They made it unconstitutional or whatever the fuck they did. They said it was illegal, but they haven't reinstated them. No. But did you see the. They're about to give cyborg exemption. Well, they see that they figured out whatever it is that she has, whatever personal medical issue that she has and that this drug does help that personal medical issue and since it's not necessarily a performance enhancing drug, what it, what it is, is it's a diuretic.

Speaker 1:          01:06:30       It also is a, it helps when women start experiencing effects from a androgens, like it mitigates some of the negative effects of Androgens is that there's a bunch of different properties that these, uh, different diuretics have and whatever her condition is, apparently they're, they're examining at testosterone a therapeutic use exemption and it looks like it's exonerates her and you know, and all of us who said that she was doing something she shouldn't have been doing. Well, we don't know what the reasons why she was doing it in the first place are. But we know that in her background though, it's not, it's not like crazy to assume other things, but that Duran to me as soon as she won. So yeah, everything's all good. Like how, how do you a Cyborg? She's ready to go get my fucking hand hurts down a little while. Yeah. Isn't that crazy time world champion, right? Or 46? No, in Moitai 10 time world champion. He bring up Cyborg and she's like, Jesus, my hand, it's like world champion if I.

Speaker 1:          01:07:32       You just free to sign up, but you can't say that like right after a fight, like really? I don't think she's afraid of February. That was broken. She said I'm going to fight with the brother and then I'm going to fix it. And she could go into 47 and cyborg would knock her face off. Do you think so? Yes. It's going to be interested in. It gets not say that again. Was going to destroy her. Isn't she attend like a 10 time Muy Thai champion here. Do not care. It doesn't matter. But you saw it doesn't matter what you saw with Cyborg Fart. Georgina barge, right? We're going to bars. You know, won the fight beside board was very brave for taking that five shots. She did, but that's also straight kickbox also. Big Gloves, right? Yes. Cyborg

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       people. Forget how strong she is, how good she is on the ground and the way she hits those kicks are going to do shit. Enjoy. That too. Enemy was impressive, but I just feel like that's you that sure I'm 100 percent yet Brennan Shaw, kiss her death. The champion could do holly brown ear cut. Eddie Alvarez a pig problem for conor. Say that. Did you say cut to Congress? Hasn't sold me yet. Oh, come on. Who is the fuck? Can you guys see the fucking conor mayweather thing? It's getting close. They're saying that it's like literally agreed upon. Amazing. So what do you think's going to happen? Do you think he's going to run into an issue with the UFC? But do you think he's right about the Ali Act? I don't know, but I think we looked at it. I have looked at what I think's going to happen is I think Dana, there's no way Dan would let this happen without being part of.

Speaker 3:          01:09:07       I think they come to agreement with the UFC and Dana's part of it and it happens. Here's a question for you, Joe. Who's going to commentate it? Boxing and UFC and boxing match. It would be a boxing in boxing. Yeah, but you need someone who's knowledgeable on conor mcgregor dedicate that. You can't have so many boxes. No, it'd be way, way better if they did it. Then if the UFC concept. Both you have. I think you have to have one balls, deep boxing expert and one mma. Why though? Because I know, but kind of come from that background. They can give you the history of cotton and all that stuff, but the sport is the sport is boxing, so I feel like you could have somebody who just brush up on that, right? I don't think so. Someone who represents us, would you not do it, Joe?

Speaker 3:          01:09:50       No, I don't want to do that. Really? I want to watch what you guys want to get drunk. That's fair. No, listen, if that's happening, we're getting hammered and we're going to fuck with a companion, but I'd rather do that than be there live. I swear to God I would. I tell everybody I'm like, I love compensated for the UFC, but I fucked up when I started doing the fight companion because the fight companions epic. It's so much more fun when we get fucked up and we're laughing and how I chose the knockout and we're watching the second. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but it's better. It is better. Like being there live is fucking insane. I mean, I enjoyed this past weekend, but I would have definitely enjoyed it more if you guys were there. Yeah, that's the. Yes, you should do. We should make some sort of a deal where we do it like this.

Speaker 3:          01:10:38       Do Colic. Let those other guys take over the commentary and we'll just have this like we'll have like to sound things you can choose. You can choose to be companion. He just go from having an interpreter. Listen man, it's. You get to see people who don't even need a component and have fun. Your companion button you just think is annoying. Sinkings annoying. Yes, we should do that. Should be like the Spanish channel or the span. You know, it should be like a little button. You press and option like you get closed captions. You know how you get closed captions. Fight.

Speaker 1:          01:11:15       Watch the. You just put it on mute and like what everyone else does on mute. I want to hear the slap of the kicks. I want to hear dudes move around. I want to hear it. I want to be in here. See what we're missing. What we're missing is not that there's anything wrong with the commentary, the commentary is great, but we can't really broadcast that Kombucha because it's not our product. Right. But if we were sitting here, we were watching it and we had a raw feed where there was no commentary, just slaps and punches and kicks and you know, and we would also like have our own take on what the fuck is happening rather than the commentators take and you know, if we're wrong, it'd be even more hilarious because for drunk stoned dudes talking shit while they're making each other like mystery science theater that they offered you a deal.

Speaker 1:          01:12:01       But they said no weed, you can smoke weed. He would say, okay, that doesn't make any sense. It's legal. Like marijuana is legal in California. We're adults. We pay taxes for just for weed itself. I'd have to stand up for weed. You know, that's like if somebody said you could do your stand up, but you can't swear, I be like, because of who? Like it's not hurting anybody if I swear it's not hurting anybody. If I smoke weed. No, I'm not gonna agree to that. That's stupid because I'm in a position where I don't have to agree to stupid shit. That's a stupid thing to agree to. Imagine you're working with someone. You're working with someone that I really like you, Brian, but I don't want. You only were in yellow. Okay, you can work with me, but only wear yellow. Do you understand? Yellow is our color.

Speaker 1:          01:12:37       It's how we want to be represented. When we're giving you the ones and Zeros, we want you to dress with appropriate colors. That is so stupid. I can't smoke weed. Fuck you. What do you want? A shitty show. Exactly. What do you want to have less? Real sponsor gets companies sponsored by certain wines. Chateaus bypass on that call for Eddie call. Yes. Yeah. We don't necessarily need alcohol all the time, but every now and then we go off the rails and the bad for the main event shots, color shots about. Well, we're going to have to do is on the next studio. I'm going to have a button where we have a. we're talking over each other button, so like a button. I could press were enough to say it, but we'll see like flames all around us. Oh, it's going bad. Like I like video were there were there were there.

Speaker 1:          01:13:24       Just to let us know. Everyone has a button. When they're talking, they hold a button or dentist radios, walkie talkie, electric shock live. There's A. There's a. there's a light. You can't get talked over. They do have these things, these arms that we have that have a light on it. When that I didn't think was, look, they look good, but now I decided you want. I'm a Dork. I want a little light on these things that light up. We're on the Internet. Makes us. Is it a green light? No, it's red Bro. Will that be something like the one on the air, like Brian said, fire, Bro. I see you. Ryan. Seacrest has one though. Fuck. He wasn't makeup before. He does radio. Was everything. Everything. Do you think his shirt was rips in it? I thought that Puma p 45

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       that killed those out pacas I spent. I spent two fucking weeks for that guy. Did you fuck them? Did you get to small guys about 1:40? Maybe. I enjoy the taste. I don't know what you talking about. We got drunk and his study we were reading was he told me, was he like a guy's guy or were you guys like Jack and he's a nice guy. I didn't really friendly guy. I've done a show before. I said something to the effect of did well this year. He made $30,000,000 that year. I go, what? Well, he goes having a lot of fun, having a lot of fun. He's like a. He produced it. Who produced the Kardashians? She's involved with all that. He's getting paid. He's originally from Finland or somewhere. He said he's like originally not American fucking foreigners. I think stealing all our fucking factory jobs for president.

Speaker 2:          01:15:01       I think he's Swedish. He is from somewhere else. Drama. I'm wrong. He's killing the game though. American idol. There's two hosts and the one guy was like, fuck it. This isn't going into Jordan's secret. Stayed with it. And so he's from Georgia. So Brian just made that Swedish. What would you say? You're completely full of shit. Just sweet and then Jordan, he's from little little Sweden and George. Jennifer Lopez still on one of those shows. American idol's a Jennifer Lopez. The America. No, I think they're bringing it back, but it's been off for a couple of seasons. Oh, Jennifer Lopez is doing that show with Steve Sharp on that show. That's the photos. Did you see? Jay Loves J. Lo at the grammy's. God damn she is fine. She, she, she, she gets better and better and she's older than that. I think she's 59 or late forties. God, she and rose McGowan and my two favorites.

Speaker 2:          01:15:54       As far as physical delivery, physical, those two. It seems weird that you know. No, no. Rose McGowan is on a basic white girl face sheet. Let me say I did something with her back in the day. I did this thing for vh one where I played a perverted fashion photographer that was just in it to get laid. And I had a couple scenes with her. She's cool as fuck. And she's, uh, she's very pretty like, like her face Manson was taken that we did this thing. It was 1996. I think it was somewhere around [inaudible] 97. We're talking about the girl from the notebook. No.

Speaker 2:          01:16:33       Think of Rachel rose McGowan. That's my ass. Oh my God. You got these big hanging out the front. My Dick was showing. Yeah, the idea was gorgeous. This is rose McGowan. Oh, I said to this girl, do you have any problems with nudity? That's rose McGowan. Oh, you got to see her in real life. Too sick. She's. She's beautiful man. Bad shot. Look at Brian. Brian. Brian, look. Oh my God. Damn. You had your Dick hanging out the front of it. Yeah, I did. I had to show her my deck because the idea was I had to say, do you have any problems with nudity? And she said, no, cut to me naked.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       Taking a picture. There was major as being a crazy person that was like really into a with photography. That's hilarious. I was just trying to get laid. I didn't know anything about photography. That was like the Joe Gibbs is made by a friend of mine who was one of the writers on the radio. It's how's Paul says? Do you ever keep in touch with them? I run into him or talk to them very rarely, but up to last time I talked to him was when Phil Hartman got a star on the Hollywood walk of fame. We went down there to be there for it and it was like a whole celebration with a bunch of, uh, Phil Hartman fans. Paul was working on a bunch of different shows. He's always working on different things, you know, I think he did boardwalk empire for a while. Did that show so good.

Speaker 1:          01:17:53       So awesome. So smart man. And he's one of the most unusually talented people I've ever met. He's an incredible vital, hilarious, but she's super smart. That landed in borderline. Who's fuck news radio? Do you ever see news radio? The show? He used to be on one of the greatest sitcoms ever. Dude, he was the coolest guy ever to work for if you ran a show because he didn't give a fuck if you came up with a funnier line like when, when he moved here, right? None, zero. The whole writing crew was just about get the best line out there. So like Dave Foley was constantly rewriting shit constantly. We would write jokes for each other, like we would see something and you know, and Vicky Lewis would say to Andy, how about you try this? She was amazing. It was great to candy Alexander. Amazing. And it was, it was a crazy cast, like super, super, super talented.

Speaker 1:          01:18:40       It was amazing, man. He will kill you with the shit he would do. But I had to do many scenes with them. And you did an episode with them? Yeah, you can't, like it's hard to like keep a straight face. Like if I was supposed to be pissed, like I'd be like, I'd be like Andy, what happened? And, and, and he would say something. He would go and you'd be like biting your face, their face to keep from. I would slap myself in the face in between. Takes to try to get like I didn't laugh. He's so funny and unpredictable. Like he's so talented. Like I did less than perfect within too. Yeah. He would just come out and do shit. And you'd be like, what's he gonna do now? And he was always fucking hilarious and there was Stephen Root, who's like one of the best actors I've ever met him.

Speaker 1:          01:19:20       This other person, he was like this. He would do a scene, he would just become someone else. He just wasn't there anymore. Like he would be Jimmy James, like he would get out of the realm, you'd be Stephen Root, you'd be hanging out with them. He's like this normal guy. And then he'd come on the set with a suit on as Jimmy James and he's Jimmy James was raised. He was weird. He was a real actor. That guy's been acting forever, like highly trained, skilled. Like he was the only one in the cast that had like a real character. Yes. I mean Phil was just an exaggerated fill, but his character like had a different way of talking or different mannerism. Like he had all planned that out. [inaudible]. It's an amazing, amazing show. Chemistry like that is very rare. It's just creates gold. It's really don't know how we got to that.

Speaker 1:          01:20:00       But that dude didn't give a fuck. He's like all about the best line, whatever the best line is, whoever's coming up with the best line. Yeah, but when you work in an like that, then it makes it fun. When you work with like someone's just super restrictive and like, you know, like they don't let you just express yourself. Then you know those sitcoms or two stores. You've been in those environments too. Fucking hard to do. Man. This is so easy to do. A podcast is the easiest form of show business of all time. It really is. It is. And like for doing shit, it's the best form trays. It, it's like the least managed. It's still the least prepared. But like if you're listening, if you like, if I'm doing something like around my house, like if I'm cleaning my office or something like that, I want to listen to a podcast I listen to when I work out. Now you stolen listening to music that I listened, a pug Jesus that we might be balls deep too deep in the world to do so much to learn game. It's all at your fingertips. You don't have enough time in the day to learn shit on the planet, talk like you can go to Sam Harris and listed the smartest motherfuckers on the planet, have listened to people super stupid to make yourself feel better and I'll listen to them. You think this is doing something to the way people communicate.

Speaker 1:          01:21:13       I do think. I do think that the world is becoming less a brutal and ignorant in many ways. For example, you'd find in we went back even a hundred years, but let's say a hundred and 30 years you would find a large portion of the globe that could have a conversation with you on why slavery is necessary and can be a virtuous in certain circumstances for certain people and you'd have no problem finding maybe half the globe who would have a serious conversation with you justifying a form of slavery in today. In 2017, you would be hard pressed to find anyone who could morally or ethically justify the idea that you should own a slave and a North America now in the world also economically not viable anymore. See, like if you could do something like Foxconn and have a bunch of people stocked up inside some place and feed them and house them and they work 16 hours a day and jump off the building so much.

Speaker 1:          01:22:13       You have to put nets around. Yeah. What is the difference? The only difference is they can leave. They can leave if they want to, but at some weird kind of form of of slaves and indentured servitude or whatever it is, depending on the economy. What I'm saying is that you. You would have, for example, if you. The minute you said, I know exactly what you're saying, I know exactly what you're saying. That's progress to an extent where the con was to accept. Yeah, but isn't it bizarre? I mean like what we're talking about that like you get something from Japan or China rather and you know that it came from one of those kinds of factories and you're okay with it. I mean we're all okay with it. We have to be. If you want a new iphone, right? Well if you want any phone android, the android Samsung. I don't know how. I don't know, I'm okay when I don't know. I'm okay with it for the following reason. We went through our own industrial revolution and the fact of the matter is that when economies are growing and can throw a lot of examples

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       of that, look at Korea 30 years ago, look at China 20 years ago, look at all these countries who have, who have gained great prosperity and higher standards of living for massive sections of their population. They all started that way. They all started, you know, it's very difficult to grow your country to become an industrial powerhouse. No, I totally understand that Brian. But it's just weird that we allow people to pay people, like essentially it's not a company in China or you know, it's kind of an American company and a lot of ways of slavery. Slavery. Exactly. Way Cheaper to, to, to have like an involuntary slavery network than it is a va because if you make it involved, like, you know, instead of forced slavery, um, you're paying them so little that they can never leave. You just basically, instead of providing food for them, you're just basically giving them the money that you would spend.

Speaker 3:          01:24:02       If it was real slavery, yeah, you'd have to buy their food and Shit and then you'd have to have guards and you have to pay guards and now the security will feed them there too. I mean, it's real creepy. It's you got to realize that like even whoever owns the company, whether it's Chinese people, the American people, the American companies have these big deals with them for a reason because they can take advantage of those loopholes because they. Their manufacturing tolerances are super high. They really know how to do it. There are, there is a lot of pressure from responsible corporate American companies and they go into those. Those they go in there because they're shareholders find out about this stuff and they go in there and by the way there I would imagine that a lot of people that work at apple is going to sound really surprising and these other companies are pretty ethical and moral and don't and I've very familiar with not feeling good about the fact that their company might have a relationship with a Chinese affiliate who doesn't treat their workers well and in fact a lot of these corporations like apple were very, very.

Speaker 3:          01:24:58       An Ibm for example, were instrumental in going in there and saying, hold it. We're not doing business this way. You're environmental practices. I mean there was a whole article about how ibm, if you do business with ibm, good luck because your vendors, your vendors better be environmentally responsible. Ibm has these environmental standards that are just draconian almost for a lot of companies where it's like, you may be environmentally responsible and you work for us. We're a big client for you, but how about the people that work for you? How's that draconian though? Well, it's not draconian. I'm saying that that a lot of these corporations have to be responsible to share. Yeah, smart, smart, and they go, I don't want to do business where people are indentured. Definitely right to say that, but it's also 100 percent, but hold on. It's still, no matter what you just said that made it look cute. There's still 100 percent fact those people make almost nothing and that's how you get your laptop made. I mean if you want to break it down to reality, the only way you can say whatever you want, but it's the only widget that is is is it possible that this can turn back around and they can start meeting. The idea of American manufacturing is

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       thing. Things that have been kicked around back and forth since this whole campaign got started essentially, right. Was a big part of what trump getting into office was bringing back American manufacture. Great. Again, we all know the story of Detroit. We have all seen like how they're. Oh, there's another fucking documentary that they're doing about this guy who was building a farm in Detroit, the largest farm. They're making a huge farm in the middle of Detroit. They're like knocking down all these buildings, buying up all this land, and they're just going to build an urban farm or what were you going to ask though? What was the question about the realist out to bring manufacturing jobs back? Yeah. I mean doing the idea of it, the idea of like reigniting the manufacturing base of the United States and having everything being American made being a big thing, but here's some stuff like electronics and things like that.

Speaker 1:          01:26:52       Is it even past. So here's the problem is first of all, the reason that we don't pay crazy amounts of reason that the consumers get to pay not a lot of money for a flat screen tv or whatever it might be. The reason crisis seemed to come down. You can go to Walmart and buy a lot of shit for not as much money. There's efficiency, there's a price for efficiency of course, but for the most part, if you go to the. If you look at the infrastructure that over 20 years China has built with those factories that are so incredibly efficient and clean and and have just locked into exactly how to churn out as much product and your company and your bottom line is you're responsible. For example, if you're a public court mandate, you're responsible to your shareholders to make them as much money, as many dividends as you can, and on top of that turn of profit, you're going to make your product for as little money as possible.

Speaker 1:          01:27:38       And by the way, it's also gonna allow you to bring the price down to your consumers can buy. So what I'm saying, what I'm saying is that we all know that infrastructure without infrastructure. I have good luck with the American manufacturing sector trying to compete with the Chinese who have a 20 year head start and I and I, I think that's a fantasy. Not only is bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US as a fantasy, but more importantly, we're not even using human beings with real enemy to unemployment is our automation is not just a 100 million Chinese workers that showed up over the past 20 years. Fox automation, Foxconn, CEO says investment for display plant in us would exceed $7,000,000,000, a lot of money, so they have these plants that are already set up in China. Very high standards for tolerances for their manufacturing, for not just this, but also for clothes.

Speaker 1:          01:28:31       All sorts of things. I made. We just had a meeting with this company and they were saying how they went to American factory because they're looking out source, choose tee shirts, all this stuff, and then went to American factory and then they went to the in China and goes, it's China's like the Bentley or royals Royce have factories in the one that went to America that produces a lot of our American shit. He said it was awful like there. They wouldn't put up with it. The standards are even close. You wouldn't do the people that are jumping out of buildings. Is that a clean place or dirty places? It's

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       clean, clean belting, Eddie. I mean, I know it seems like a fantasy, but doesn't it sound like we should. We should. We should try. We ever happened. It'll never happen to. We are trying to fuck China. Let's bring the jobs back here. We got to at least try at least give trump a shot. We'll see. We are trying, but even trump realizes and everybody realizes that there are some companies that countries that do things more efficiently. Right? So for example, just as a bad example, bananas are easier to grow in the Dominican Republic than they would because of the climate and all that. Then they would be in Detroit, right? Just because of the weather and stuff. So that's kind of the idea behind the global economy. The idea that certain companies do it eat certain countries, have the infrastructure, have the cheaper labor and it's easier to churn out more product, thereby keep.

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       But You keep saying cheaper labor, like it's no big deal. I'm not saying it's no big deal. It just talk about slave labor, this whole country's wealth here. How do you defend? It? Raises the standard of living sorta. Yeah, but starts it. Not sort of Brian, settle the fuck down. It does, but it does in a way where you're doing it off the back of the people that are making $5 a week course. Okay, but that's what we keep saying and you keep glossing over. It went up when I'm trying to explain like why it's a problem to a lot of people that listen to this. You want to gloss over it and Fox News it up, sir. I don't listen to Fox News by the way. Let's get a couple things straight. The fuckers get them. I don't get my news off a CNN or Fox News gets. Who doesn't read news? It's all. Who's your fuckers? Where do you get your news? I read. I read publications and I do a lot of blow shit. I do a lot of bluff. I'm not glossing over anything. I'm trying to say, is this really something that you keep saying it? We know what I'm saying is definitely less than a standard.

Speaker 2:          01:30:49       If you go over one more time, I'm going to freak Brian. You're being very repetitive. Standard of living in those countries has raised exponentially said that of these people that are making things, not of buildings. Brian, we got to Brian. Brian, it's illegal to make those people work like that in the United States for a fucking reason, and they're human beings, so if they're human beings and China and they're working in this horrendous conditions are not insane hours. They are Brian and some aren't. They're living these factory. Some factories. You're 100 percent right. I would know there was some factories. It's just a disco. They go in, they give them a drink. Everybody gets a foot massage work there. I'm not saying I got to not saying that Fox News Dad is coming out of your mouth as I have nothing against slavery. No, I'm not saying that. I believe in slave labor. It's not hard work. I'm just saying that every country has industrialized the same way. That's. They were a bunch of. The factory was filled with a bunch of hot women from Norway that were sweaty all the time of the breasts are hanging out. We've been fucking trying to save them. We can't make them work these hours.

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       I just can't do it, but because it's Chinese people, Brian's legacy economies, the Chinese, the Chinese demanding higher wages to do an export in their jobs to other countries of the week. They can buy a subway sandwich. Footlong maybe off. Maybe I am not saying you end of the week. Those characteristics. You're mischaracterizing little plastic cup and get some water. How much would an iphone costs if we built it in the thousand dollars? Million Dollars. $1,000,000. What do you think? They're like 700 bucks an hour. First of all, we literally don't have the kind of factory, so you'd have to build the factory. You'd have to build this month, so it costs billions of dollars to build one of those super high tech factories too much more. Then on top of that, you would have to hire people as he falls asleep. That's substantial wage, but it could be done. It's not an impossible thing.

Speaker 1:          01:32:52       It was done in China. It could be done over here. They can make it will cost more. It would definitely cause you would go up, but don't you think that the country should subsidize fucking iphones instead of corn? Because all these cuts are putting corn and everything and Corn Syrup and this and that. Everybody's getting fat as fuck and people are dying of heart attacks. Just got goddamn corn port. Hey, protein. Hey by the corn powder. Can I just talk for a second? That'd be okay. All this corn and everything. Jesus Christ, maybe we subsidized cell phone talking to a lot more. They need fucking corn. Talk to Archer Daniels Midland lobbying efforts strong about slaves and how good they are. So Slavery Motherfucker, right? It's a free country. I can say what I want, but you know those, the guys that own these factories in China, you know, they're down to like, they want to assassinate trump.

Speaker 1:          01:33:36       Right? Thanks. So he's really gonna. Pull those, those. Uh, they don't. None of them not threatened at all. It took so long to do that. A loop. No one's gonna know Eddie. No one's going to do it. Then. Let's look. First of all, you hear what he was talking about, like putting the taxes on Mexico to build the wall and stuff like that. All those proposals have to get through congress. Yeah, and good luck. Good luck with all that and especially because he doesn't see. The thing about running a country is it's very different than running a business. There's a bunch of checks and balances. If he's running a business, he's the king. Like there was this thing that John Oliver had on a show, but we were talking about how like he would exaggerate about the amount of floors in this building. You know, you think you're on the 14th floor, but really on the eighth floor because he would like say there's like 68 floors, 58. He just does whatever he wants, but it makes it look more exciting.

Speaker 1:          01:34:24       But you can't, when you're dealing with Congress, that's not going to work because when you run, if you run it like that, see the reason why it's good that there's this brock, your seat in place, bureaucracy in place is that if someone isn't with the right or the left or on their own and they want to run this thing, like I'm gonna bring my own security, I'm gonna. Run out, nobody's gonna be on your side like. And those people have to be on your side. So then you have to figure out how you're gonna work with these people to get things on your side. But you have to do it legally and you're being watched for the microscope. Everybody's looking at everything you do. That's why this guy, what is he, what's his name? Flint that got. He got removed today. I stepped down. He had to step down in a business.

Speaker 1:          01:35:01       What he did would have been mum, mum under the table. Everybody shut the fuck up. They're doing deals. So talking to people to try the Russians. Mischaracterize what you said. What did he do? We should look it up very specifically, but from what I understand is he had an inappropriate conversation with Russian emissaries about sanctions. Whether or not those sanctions would be wet, you know, eased up under the because we have sanctions on Russia because he's a poor fit for national security advisor. Michael Flynn resigned and then scroll down a little bit there. It says, National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, has resigned after reports that he misled senior White House officials about his conversations with Russia. The liberals are freaking out right now screaming into their lockers. Conservatives are, I know president trump has named, but the liberals are fucking. They're ready to ride like shit on fire. It's going to go down to starbucks, kicked the door in retired army, Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg as Acting National Security Advisor.

Speaker 1:          01:35:59       Kellogg previously served as Flynn's chief of staff, blah, blah blah, blah, blah. The embattled Flynn blamed his resignation late Monday on the fast pace of events that led him to inadvertently give vice president pence and others incomplete information in quote about his phone conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U. S Sergei Kissy Celiac. They probably recorded those conversations and if he said anything about sanctions being eased up when trump comes into power, etc. That would be very unapplied guy. I have sincerely, sincerely apologize To the president, the vice president, and they have accepted my apology for flynn wrote in his resignation letter. Wow. This is weird. Really weird. Look at this. Pencil defended flynn's contact with Russia and when it became clear, the national security advisor had not been forthcoming. Series questions raised about his ability to keep the job. This is fucking house of cards, like house of cards is real, especially since Russia, according to both sides of the aisle, was probably involved in hacking.

Speaker 1:          01:37:02       Don't say that you keep saying hacking because they didn't do anything that actually affected the election. They might have done something in affected people's perceptions and let it affected the way they votes but the thumb. But what they did was never disputed. Like when the information they pulled up, no one's ever saying it's fake. They're saying it's true. So what they did, where they showed that hillary was rigging the primaries against bernie sanders, the say that that influenced the election. Yes it did, but it influenced it because what they did was dirty as fuck and business as usual and then people got a chance to look at it. Well, they also know that that russian agents are. It's alleged russian agents hacked into certain dnc computers. So just high level high level democrats. That's all well think there is proof, but the bottom line is even if they did do it, what they released is something that we should know about because we should know the democratic party is against one of the most popular people of the democratic party.

Speaker 1:          01:37:58       There just wasn't playIng ball. That's bernie sanders, bernie sanders, a guy who's legitimately altruistic like seems like. It seems like a guy was legitimately not controlled by money. Seems like a guy who is legitimately looking maybe even misguided by some economics though. economist standards, maybe even misguided, but the idea that he's trying to change the income inequality in this country in some way, shape or form, at the very least, he's opening up the dialogue about it and the Helen Hayes and all the other people are hitting the brakes on that shit and we found out about it, so we found out about the crazy bureaucracy. We found out about hillary talking about marijuana and saying that she's against it in every sense of the word. Marijuana legalization. She's helping people who are spending money because they're going to make money if pod is illegal, so she's essentially making it okay for cops, for jackbooted thugs to lock people up in a fucking cage over pi.

Speaker 1:          01:38:51       You're saying she's not just corrupt. That's a monster. A person who would say that she's against marijuana legalization in every sense of the word. that person is an enemy of history. Like you're a selfish monster who's willing to do something completely irrational just for personal gain. That's it. That's a knock on hillary from day one and there are. There's a whole paper trail though, is so scare of hair corruption and people don't think it's scary because it's pot and pot sounds silly, but it's not about pot. It's about freedom. It's about you doing something that doesn't hurt anybody else in somewhat deciding that they can lock you in a cage because they write some things down on paper and it's no different if she wants to do that, then if someone in this room wants a lot, one of us up for the five of us got together and one of us wanted to lock us up because one of us is smoking pot.

Speaker 1:          01:39:42       It's that fucking stupid. It's really that stupid. It's an insane, insane law and the fact that she was totally down to keep that log going in every sense of the word. That's an insane person. Yeah. Well, it's not just that her clinton foundation was a pay per flight. Look up what's gone now, right? Isn't it? What a surprise that it folded up. How [inaudible] amazing that she no longer has any influence in government and all of a sudden the all those donations of folded up. What a surprise that that was an altruistic organization, but now that they can't grant anybody favors, all you have to do, don't look this up now, but if you're listening uranium one, deal a whitewater and travelgate, just those ones and look up how corrupt, and this is why a lot of people have a problem with the ideologues on the left, could they won't acknowledge that, so everybody that sees that and sees the deep, deep, deep, just integrated corruption that it's just almost inoperable. Corruptions, right? They see that and they don't want to admit it because they say trump is bad and if you had, if you talk about it, they said trump is bad and they have valid concerns about trump, but that doesn't negate all the problems with her place tries elective because the democrats decided to nominate somebody

Speaker 3:          01:40:53       who in 2008, the democratic voters already told you they didn't like. They didn't trust women, didn't trust her, not just men. Women didn't trust her. So at the end of the day, you guys, you know, the democrats put up a candidate that people didn't trust. They just didn't. She just had a history oF tufts. She talked anytime. Award came out of her mouth. I didn't believe anything. She's just the most insincere bad actors out there. Her husband, he was mad. He was believable. You wanted to believe bill clinton, but he was. He was just better at line, but she's terrible at line, right it. She's terrible. Do you believe in talking you about it is? It's hard to imagine that the system is so fucked up that it's missing key players so badly that someone that flawed could get to a position where the country has to choose whether or not this insanely flawed person gets to run the country like that's crazy intelligent. Many people vicious and our chat and all these smart people, they are so. Exactly, and that's the problem and rightly so. Why would you want that shitty job?

Speaker 3:          01:41:58       Because I'm pro slavery. You can't do what you used to be able to do with that job. That job was a good job when you were jfk. It's not a good job When you're fucking obama. It's not a good job. Stressfulness, you're, you're dying out there. See obama just having the time of his life, no party fucking much week to week, nonstop edibles and thinks about drones. Didn'T he stopped smoking in the middle of his presidency? No. Before I thought, I'll ask you again. Do you think eats edibles and thinks about drones? I've to my president. I'm not going to answer that question. It's not your friend anymore. Yes. I don't know. Donald tRump's our president. It's true. No. Just see that girl got tattooed on her on her side. I put it up on my instagram. She's got it tattooed on her side. Trump is not my fucking president.

Speaker 3:          01:42:40       Yes, I live in America. Bit. That's your president, but hoW deep is that? Imagine going down on her. He pulled her shirt off and you're like a democracy vibrant. Saying that trump is not my fucking president. Tattoo on someone's side makes our democracy vibrant because that's not correct. Freedom of speech there, but the writing down on your body forever. It's crazy because in four years they'd be Like, yeah. My last last night during while Donald Trump was running for the republican nomination, I really didn't pay that much attention to. I hear, I heard crazy shit that he said about mexicans. He said this and that, and I'm like, damn, he sounds like a crazy. Didn't really pay attention. But when, uh, you know, he won the nomination, he was going against hillary. I started to Pay attention, but then you always hear about shitty set in the past.

Speaker 3:          01:43:29       Although I never heard it. I just bought when he was running against hillary and they were debating, I agreed with to me just seemed like an honest shit talker. That's what it seemed like on honest shit. Talker, you know, he's not politically correct. He said some abrasive shit, but he's being an honest and hillary wasn't being honest at all. So last night I went back and I said, you know what? People keep saying all this shit that donald trump's that I go, let me, I want to youtube. Sorry. The library was closed, but I went to youtube and I punched him. Donald trump's worst quotes and like the, the worst number other than I smoked, smoked a bowl and I'm like, let me, let me fucking find out what the fuck he saying and he's, he, he talks shit. But I agreed with most. I didn't really think anything was bad.

Speaker 3:          01:44:13       I was like, is this a pro Donald Trump oF video? like, because people always hear that he said like the worst shit. Like he's saying shit about mexicans. What is he saying is to calling them wetbacks and what does he saying? They exaggerate everything and I think a lot of now and I'm like, wait a minute. I went back and I swear to god I had a check because I was just going through video after, is it pro trump or against trump? This worship to me sounds like a, like a boss, you know, he's a talker. He's up in the guide. Then I went back and watched the ct was saying while he was running against ted cruz and rubio. Those guys seem like they seem like they'Re hypnotized. They're like mk ultra know what they're going to say.

Speaker 3:          01:44:59       Yeah. I never had a problem with trump of what he said, my product that's robberies, that he doesn't totally real. Yeah. I. My worry about trump is that he's. I think he's very, very narcissistic, but I also think he doesn't seem that informed or that interested in knowing what he doesn't know. That was always my way. Surround yourself with. I don't know, it could be a double cross. I'm not sold on trump, but the one thing is, thank god it's not drunk. All the payments in the past and I haven't seen you do that in a long time. I've been here for awhile. I had to get here from meeting an hour early, so I've been drinking my hit my wall. I was just happy that hillary didn't win. You know? That could have been anybody on the other side. I just all the shit on hillary and her camp, the people that run her shit, that's too dark for me.

Speaker 3:          01:45:42       I don't want that to keep going. The thing. So she could have been running against bozo the clown. I would have been bozos. Bozo, bozo or deez nuts. What a lot of people did just to just two things that are good about having someone like trump in order in, in office. One thing is that people are going to get energized. Now they realize that voting works and there's real consequences to not voting and the person that you maybe didn't want, and then also we have to reexamine our electoral college system that was created back when people couldn't fucking communicate with the representatives. You couldn't get to Washington. Can you just vote on your email or your computer? There are 100 percent. Should be a way that you vote online just like you can just email, email. That's your email because you have a social security number.

Speaker 3:          01:46:25       Everybody has one. That's what you should be able to enter to enter into an app that everybody gets. You have a photo, you stand there. It takes a photo of you, takes your fingerprint like it does when you order something with apple pay or some shit and vote. It's not hard. It's not hard to do. They can do it. They just don't want to invest anytime and they can control. it's way easier to control controlled groups of people. AS soon as you have everybody that's over 18 having access to vote instantaneously, their phone, you're gonna get a different result and you're going to get people like justin bieber becoming president, like really like you don't understand like we have a popularity contest. That's what. That's what being the president. It's fucking ridiculous. If you look at the amount of people that are on instagram or on twitter, like people that have like 49 million followers at any given time, one of those motherfuckers can string together some really good sentences and we're like, george clooney for president will fucking do it.

Speaker 3:          01:47:13       We don't even care if you're good at it. Katy perry, we'd be so powerful and so amazing. I know she can do it. Lady gaga could be the fucking president of the United States. Mark my words. She was on the superbowl. She said she was $100 million. Okay. Selena gomez can be president. I'll vote for right now. I don't even know who she is. She's dating the weekend. I'm so lost. I'm so out of the former. Next. The problem you can solve with the electoral college is that if you do it just by popular vote like that, then that's one issue with it, but also the fact that states that are not very populated would get ignored by their, by the government because they don't get ignored when it comes. Yeah. It would do when it comes ignored when it comes to passing bills that help them.

Speaker 3:          01:48:01       We're getting funding or subsidies, but also maybe they'd have to stop god fucking card and putting it in everything and get with the times that he's dying from corn. Brian, there's hope that corn fed on hillary. I like that. Oh yeah. I never liked the spark that was. I was under the impression that pro libertarian brother, um, I'm a pretty conservative guy, but there was no, there was no good choices. No, I couldn't pick what he wants to do it. I'm down to give trump a chance to turn the economy around. No, he might after. There's a lot of programs going to go after them, but I'm not sold on trump, but I liked what he said. I like that he's honest. He's definitely, he never said he never called mexicans wetbacks or anything like that. He just said the same shit clinton said about immigration in more of a abrasive way. That's all. He was more abrasive about it. Well, it bill clinton, she said all the same shit that people are upset sucked in the lighthouse. That's not a big deal and it's not a big deal. Whoa. I said, let him go. I'm a. I'm a political. Jfk. Jfk had an affair with Marilyn Monroe was married.

Speaker 3:          01:49:12       He had an 11 affairs during. That could be bullshit. That could be disciplined. Oh, well here's my question. Here's my question though. Get chlamydia. Should Donald Trump say anything positive happens from this? It's going to be. It's going to inspire other people that are like unconventional type candidates to run that might be better or more likely to time. Trump. trump. Trump. Trump thinks the economy is doing well. He'll get another shot. You know, it's not like. You know what? You know. What I like about trump is the cia is so against him. like john dot brennan,

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       the director, he's the director of the cia. He's against him. Then it's a good thing for brian to list some good about trump. The fat guys against peo, I believe. What happened with this fella that used to be head of the cia is appointed by the president. It's a sibling. Sibley and appoint appointment. Ujamaa brendan. Right now you're usually a civilian who runs the cia and you're appointed by the, by. The lady says John O'brien. John will brennan's the director, right? It's a pump peo, isn't it? Looked at was he was obama's director director. And he doesn't like the president. Obama didn't like the problem. Luckily you can punch that up, put it into trump. Trump appoints the head of the cia. So he has his boy decided to. If he does, he does. He just read it and said it and halpern hood. The deputy director was, uh, under investigation for running black sites.

Speaker 2:          01:50:42       So, you know, if you wanT to talk about a controversial under secretary again, halpern is if valerie harper and she is, she was not operative who ran a lot of the extraordinary rendition sites. The black sites where a detainees under american supervision were tortured. She ran that, she was there. She, she was brought up with the senate arms, the intelligence committee, and questioned. What do you think it's like to bang a chick who runs a torture operation? We better go hard and tried to look for pictures. I couldn't find pictures of hard in the fucking pardon the paint. Go hard in the paint chips. He's a controversial character man, but I'm not into dope. I don't scratch me. Nobody. I'm not going to choke you out. I can't shake. I don't like this. 50 shades of grey has got people confused as fuck. Shades of brent's from working in a fucking office. That's what dutch shit's from. Correct. Being suppressed. Work in the cubicle. Constantly worried about human resources. You get out of there. He wants a bitch to tie you up and shit in your mouth.

Speaker 2:          01:51:48       Dry data to dominate tricks. Right? And uh, in New York. Crazy dude, she brought me to her quote unquote dungeon shelia fancy gimp suit. No, I, she liked it. That was kind of dominant because I don't know if you guys know I'm an alpha male, but she had a chair that I tell you this. I did this. She had a tear. Yeah. You could tie your balls. Yeah, go ahead. You'd sit in a chair and theRe was a hole in the chair and your balls and cock would hang between the chair. Oh, I bet she would put a a a ring at the base of your life where you're cocking your balls, meat and then you'd be chained to the floor and then she'd do whatever the fuck she wanted. When she said that her biggest clientele were all lawyers. Mostly lawyers. There were something about lawyers like to be dominant. Did she kick you in the balls? Be a. I didn't do with you today. There's a lot of. Those guys brought me there. Sometimes they're super superintendent seeing those videos. brian, both they're guys.

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       When I worked at the strip club as a dj, there was guys that would come in and they would sit in the lap dance booth and want the girls in nam and the ball fuck is wrong with them. That was one a year. Every year. One free. Sure. Some guys like to be caught. They liked to be electrocuted, like to like to feel. I think there's also some real scientific inquiry into this and they think there's some people feel pain differently. I mean if you're. If you can be born with something wrong with your body, right? If you could be born with some sort of a birth defect, why can't you be born with some sort of a defect in the way your body senses pain and apps? We're just assuming like, you know, I don't like pain. You don't like pain. He's like, fuck payments.

Speaker 1:          01:53:28       be off with everybody. I think some people are numb and pain gives them like a vital shot in the arm to let them know they're still alive. That's why people a lot of depressed people like tattoos. Yeah. According to richard, Richard Walter, who's a big time profiler for sadism, he's guy wrote the double helix basically on, on serial killers and what makes, how a serial killer becomes, you know, and he solves a lot of these cold cases, but he's an fbi profiler, deals with the worst cases, like the real, the real estate. And he said every, it's always so certain. So there, there, there's certain people that get off on the act of killing, right? And in fact they'll almost kill you then bring it back to life. The real sick fuckers. But he said all of those people eat including cannibals and things. They all are getting a sexual charge out of whatever it is.

Speaker 1:          01:54:17       It is. They Do. So regardless, it's not, it's power over the person, but according to him, there's always, yeah, there's always a sexual drive for us. So yeah, like the one guy who they found, uh, this terry was a cannibal and he couldn't, he killed, killed his two wives and they caught him because he, you know, he just would do all these terrible things and he couldn't feel when you found him, he had add happens. I think that this is in the forties, fifties. They had hat pins in his ass and his balls. He had pins in his balls and hat pins stuffed in his ass and he was walking around and he said that basically he had trouble feeling anything, anything. And so he would stick these needles in his balls and they found him with that's. They're like, wait, why do you kill an eight people?

Speaker 1:          01:55:02       You torture people. What? Let's start with your mother. Well wait a minute, you got hat pins in your asshole. Did you hear about the guy in Canada? Her balls brought the guy in Canada that had a mental episode on a bus and they brought a knife with him in bags like plastic bags. Killed this guy cut his head off with a knife and then eight his eyeballs on the bus beheaded, a guy on a crowded bus. People on the bus, they were sleeping. It was late at night at this guys fucking head off eight his eyes, they deemed him mentally ill. They gave him medication and they just released them. Hello Canada part of Canada, windsor can do shows. Windsor, ontario. Where was it? Where was it says manitoba. Manitoba, sorry. Woke up. Toba. Uh, I don't know if people woke up or not, but there was, there was cops that were outside while he was.

Speaker 1:          01:55:48       The guy was already dead and he was eating. There was cops and first responders that wound up committing suicide apparently. See if that's true, but that's what I had read, that it was such a gruesome horrific scene that some first responders committed suicide, but people like I, I got in like debate with people online about this. They're like, look, he had a psychotic episode as long as he takes his medication will be fine, and I was like, well, even if that's the case, the fact that someone could ever in their existence and their time and their consciousness on earth be capable of sawing someone's head off with a knife and then eating their eyeballs on a bus. you can't ever let them out of your sight because he never did that until he did it once. He never did that until he did it once and then he did it once.

Speaker 1:          01:56:29       Now you know he can do it, so for you to let him go, I don't care what you say about mental illness that is so irresponsible, irresponsible, and not have a relapse. We don't know how to react to the medication. IT never happened before. Then it happened, which means it can happen. I feel the same way about pedophiles. If you, if you, if you raped a child and you go through all the therapy in the world, I don't care. I pay it. I can't let you in. The audience are so fucking nice tonight. That's what it is, that people ate the eyeballs and didn't know any better. He feels bad. It feels super bad. my bat to the nice canadians are the nicest people I've ever come across. I think they're the nicest nature. Pretty cool. They're amazing. They're so fucking nice. Yeah, and that's how something like that flies over there.

Speaker 1:          01:57:14       They have a social justice warrior president or prime minister trudeau. He's hilarious, like the refugees get sad. Do you know gavin? Yeah. Well god has been, you know, he lives up there in montreal. He's a professor in montreal and he just highlights all the ridiculous policies that this guy keeps promoting and the stuff that he gets behind and the things that he. I mean he, he like what they're doing up there is like, it's really strange. You can get arrested if you say things about certain people, like they don't have freedom of speech the way we have it. They have like these human rights councils that decide whether or not you should be able to do shit. Hey, so if you get heckled by some lesbians, you call him a dirty dyke and say go eat her asshole. You dirty bitch or say something crazy like that.

Speaker 1:          01:57:57       You could get arrested and then sued and lose and that happened in vancouver. He says there's lot. They have crazy laws as far as like using gender pronouns back that Jordan Peterson, Jordan Pearson is a big part of that push back. Without him, a lot of that would have just been swallowed up by the academics. He's one of the first academics to stand up and go, hey guys, this is fucking crazy and this is just controlling people and when you start controlling people like this, it goes down this dirty road and this dirty road is a dictator. There's dirty road is like ideologies and dominating your patterns of speech and the whole marketplace of somebody say genda exactly what the agenda of equality that great fuzzy in topeka and the sky and if you listen to Jordan Peterson, he knows so much about marxism that it shows you like, oh, this is a pattern of human thinking.

Speaker 1:          01:58:49       It starts off by people that were really well intentioned. they're intellectuals, they're very kind, they're sympathetic, they're progressive, and they want everyone to be nice, so one of the ways they do it is to be really evil to people they think are not nice, and then you create this fucking war because they look at them as predators and they're sort of like infantiles date. The problem is that people on the other side don't look at it that way. So you're starting this thing and you're creating to shored up defenses in walls of offense. You, you start, you push in, you start multisoft cocktail and universities that have given speeches by guys who were republicans. You create a like that. Uc Berkeley. What happened with milo? I didn't get pulled them out of the fucking building to save his life like people are writing. Did $100,000 with a damage to the school forward thinking.

Speaker 1:          01:59:36       I thought. I thought berkeley was so tolerant on what a surprise. As long as you don't fire. They made cars. Portland milo was there and so he got shot sometimes shy by us. Yeah, no, it's, it's crazy and if you listen to what he's saying, he's saying some racist shit, right? Not nothing compared to the reaction. Then it's getting nothing. He's mostly a half of a troll. He's like half of a comedian when he says things, he's bitchy. He's a bitchy gay guy, the column a nazi and he's a fucking gay jew. It is one of the funniest things ever. They're calling this guy nazi and a white supremacist slogan of his tour though. It's 10th a dangerous faggot tour, but he, he's gay, he's gay, and he talks about his love of black dick. You know, he taLks about how the system, he's a writer and a troll, but like an intelligent troll and a british guy who's got people on.

Speaker 1:          02:00:27       If you look at what they said it was because he said a rude, racist shit organized some sort of an attack on leslie jones, but he didn't do it. Like, if you look at what he said, if, if how responsible is someone who cracks a joke about someone. Like he said something about leslie jones wouldn't be the first time I was. I was turned down by a black man, like, like something along those lines like bitchy but funny. And for that, just for that, for saying that, because she was mad at his review or something like that, was his followers started sending her horrible come maybe, but what, how much of that can you push onto him? He can't control that. You can't control it. So I'm not with what I'm saying is if you look at what he actually said, if that's grounds for a band, we're dealing with some extreme censorship.

Speaker 1:          02:01:13       So you've got to figure out like when is he responsible? So he did he say, hey guys, go get him. no he didn't, but you know who did do that is leslie jones. There was a tweet where leslie jones, someone was attacking her and she was like, go get them to that person. Like to. Which is like, look, that's her prerogative too. If you want to be a cut. And started attacking this woman who's a very hilarious comedian for no reason. She, I think she should be able to say fuck you and do it publicly and say go get him her fence. So my point is my low never said that milo literally never said go get him, but yet he was sort of held responsible for things that other people said, you can't. There's so many crazy people out there. The idea that you can control them and then you could just like say like people who like bryan county, you are responsible for those people.

Speaker 1:          02:01:57       You have to set a good example. We're going to kick you off our platform. That's essentially what they're saying. Crazy sweared Their prerogative, but pull up to what he asks. I think it's interesting. you know that you're not going to change that. We always have to remember that if you disagree with the other side, the idea is to try to get them to agree with you or try to come up with some kind of a consensus so you can move ideas forward to move the world forward. And what we have with this kind of reaction to milo is if you're going to do $100,000 worth of damage in your protest, well that's fine and milo have to be escorted out and you won't listen to them and you close your mind. You're not moving anything forward or making anything better though. You're juSt creating a big old division.

Speaker 1:          02:02:35       And I guess you guys can stay in your echo chamber. They all stay in their echo chamber and nobody will listen to each other and we won't learn anything. Well that's just a product of being raised in this system, this two party system and this ridiculous idea that there's us and them and now that they're in, there's this, you know, all people have to fight back and you have to punch nazis. So this crazy shit that people are saying. But when you listen to what milo actually says, even if you disagree with them, which I do all the time, like I disagree witH a lot of what he's saying. Ha, there's sam harris put it best. He's like, half of it is like a performance. It's like he seems insincere a lot of the times and he's very acutely aware that is generating response and the things that he's saying that they're like, you know, that they're saying that he's racist or he's just, it's terrible white nationalists or something like this is just making stuff up so that they can start attacking him more freely because it's easier.

Speaker 1:          02:03:26       What he said is definitely controversial. Controversial he said is some of it is definitely rude. Some of it is preposterous. Some of it doesn't make any sense. Like he's, he's pro circumcision because he doesn't want dicks to have extra skin hanging off of him. He says he'll fight with you about it. You know, he's, he's, he's a catholic. I think he is. I'm like, okay. I Believe that. He's like, absolutely, catholicism is the best religion. it's the moSt amazing religion. I'm super, like, he's crazy. Okay. So you started making in front of jones and we wrote an article. First of all, let's say one thing that he wrote an article, uh, where he did a horrible, mean critique of the new ghost busters for women. and he said essentially that it was like a feminist film and he pointed out some really important shit. He's like, every guy in the movie is a fucking idiot and every woman's saves the world.

Speaker 1:          02:04:10       And he's like, it's kind of ridiculous. So he, he says, I'm so he writes this. So she was getting hate mail from his response, I guess from his thing, racial abuse that she was getting. And he said, everyone gets hate mail for fuck's for fuck sake. One tweet read another one called jones, barely literate. Later, she shared fake screenshots. Oh, he shared frakes screenshots that made it appear of jones. We're making profane and offensive postings. Twitter didn't saY exactly why it band. He annapolis only telling breitbart writer that he was permanently banned for violation of the company's rules prohibiting participation in or exciting targeted use of individuals. So what makes that like, okay, I could see like if he was post retweeting things that, that were very rude, I would love to see what those things were. Probably pretty see how rude they were. Maybe they were silly.

Speaker 1:          02:05:01       they were racist. They were bad, they were bad, they were crazy. They're all making it appear. That was jones link there, jamie. Scroll back down. See where it says it. Made it appear of jones. We're making profane and offensive postings. Click on that. Let's see what it looks like. What it. What was actually said. This was not me. Okay. Okay. Uncle tom. Fag nero needs to get his racist ass out. My mentions shit like this makes me think we need to gas these goddamn faggots to death. Okay, so that's not really her fake. Yeah. Somebody made a fake. That's kind of fucked up to do to leslie jones. Terrible. Well, how do we know? Okay. You got to assume that he knew that that wasn't him. He posted one that that wasn't her brother. Right. But hold on, hold on, hold on. We got. Assume that.

Speaker 1:          02:05:50       Go back to that again, jamie. you got to assume that he knew that that wasn't really hard. Right? You don't think that he really thought she wrote that. so if he retweets that, if that's a fake account, what's the dif? Okay, so it's just a photo that someone put it or did he. Someone else did it and he tweeted it. He retweeted it, I guess. Okay. So let's see what the other ones are. Although it says it looks like it's verified as well as dog. Did he retweet this? If someone sent it to him and he. He retweeted it. Okay. Here's one less dog. You're ghostbusters just in the first to have an opening. Oh shit. Super racist. Whoa. It's awful. So he retweeted that. He retweeted that. Okay. Yeah, that's not cool. That's pretty fucking rude. Okay. What, what else we got? That's, that's, that's, that's just shitty man that I not like.

Speaker 1:          02:06:35       Just that makes me want to put this on him. He's definitely got some issues. She's lashing, he's got some fucking issues. We were good. We get it. You get it. Well that's. He's definitely got some issues like that. That's not a cool thing to do, but what he's doing, he insights talk and because of that, his. His book is now number one on the amazon piece trying to accomplish what's the book property sale and no one knows it has books not even out yet. Yeah. It's really, really interesting guy in a lot of ways. He's very smart. I talked to him off air. He's a very intelligent guy. He's very cordial, very good to talk to. I really enjoyed talking to him and we joked around a lot when we did the podcast together because I grilled them about certain things I think are ridiculous and eventually gives them. Starts laughing with you. He's a very smart guy, but I don't know what he's doing. I don't know if this is a real as the real him or if this is him doing a performance or if it's combination of both or if he's finding himself in the midst of this hurricane of negativity and popularity, which would it be just assuming that he's bullet proof that he can't be influenced by this fucking crazy or deal that he's

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       going through and occasionally do shit that he shouldn't have done. like reposting some horrible racist thing. He's young. I mean he's maybe 30 something. Right? How old is he made a point. That's a really interesting point you just said that made about if this is like in transition like so. Sure he is. He's a growing just like all of us are and even like it depends on how you can catch somebody in, in a moment where they can sound if you already sound like themselves. So he's young. He's fucking smart dude. I'm telling you. I believe it. I just feel like, yeah, I definitely disagree With retweeting that racist picture of leslie jones looking like a gorilla. This one guy who said something, he was at the when, what was the theater in France that they shot up during a performance? He was in the band, I believe christ.

Speaker 2:          02:08:18       Remember when? When those guys opened fire, the fatal famous famous, yeah, death, metal, whatever. And he said something about islam right after that. He was like, he's in and he was emotional and people had died and it was this concert and he saw some all kinds of stuff and he said something that they picked up and he did an inteRview because they just did a documentary on it and he said something really interesting. They said, you said something about islam, do you have any regret about that? And it was pretty racist. And he saId, alright, well look, first of all, I love people. We have a lot of muslims fans and anything else said what happened there was my emotions were so heightened and there was a, there was a, there was a span of time where I was thinking in a very emotional, uncharacteristic way that I usually am my. I had, I was hot off of something tragic and I didn't even know how to make sense of it to. I don't want you to reread what I said because that's not who I am, but in that sliver of time, that's how I was feeling and I lashed out in paint. It's very honest way of putting it is and I thought that that's why we have to be careful about taking quotes and then applying that to a peRson's entire character.

Speaker 2:          02:09:36       This was a guy in the band after he. He said something about islam, but. But it made me think about that. We do this all the time where we say, you said that one thing you said a sentence, let's, let's highlight that and let's just say that's who the man is. You know, you gotta be careful. So sometimes you'll be held accountable for what you're tweeting. You're doing well. We can't always give everyone a pass, but all he's just going through a rough time. It's all good. It's held accountable too. That's true too. That's true too, but we also have to recognize that like at 33 years of age, especially, dude, I was a moron when I was 33 and if I had gotten drunk and I decided to retweet some shit, thank god twitter wasn't arounD theN I want to say the student is that young and if he's a smart, yes it is. We say stupid shit all the time. Who was doing stupid shit. I've know. Retweet anything raCist. Thirty three. Oh, you're not racist, but with him, this is a pattern. Maybe you don't get a free. Here's the thing, man. He's his whole thing is courting controversy. That's essentially what he's doing by saying feminism is cancer. He's

Speaker 1:          02:10:33       organizing a fistfight, he's calling them out and he's organizing a verbal fiscal saves probably on adderall, so he's talking to 100 miles an hour. He's really articulate and he's gay and he looks fabulous and he's got bleached blonde hair and he wears clothes and when he's killing it, like on stage, he's a very good orator. So he's engaging them in these debates that he's got carefully thought out, responses, carefully thought out sentences. He definitely knows what he's doing. He definitely knows what he's talking. How was your conversation with Henry Rollins? Speaking of articles, kitten little pony with this racism thing. Oh, I love that. He's a good looking guy. Handsome fellow. Hell yeah. It's profound love of black dick. He talks about all the time, which is also one more way that they have a hard time attacking him because he's a gay jew that loves black dick. Like he's got the spectrum covered. He's like, there's a triangle sensibility that's around him.

Speaker 1:          02:11:29       Brian's. These are good talking. One time brian know you're all right man. I think you can't. This is. This is what fascism is. You can't enforce your view of the world on people through violence because that's what you're doing when you're a fascist and that's what people need to understand. Like you can't just use the word fascist when it applies to right wing people. If you're keeping people from communicating, you're keeping a gay jew from talking shit on your stage and you can't just counter what he saying with someone who's better at talking shit. That is better points. So instead you want to throw a chair through the window at fucking starbucks. Look, stop. You guys are fascist, fascist. Even if you think you're right, the way you're doing it is 100 percent wrong. This isn't the guys on a nazi. He's not someone who's, even if he has said a racist thing in the past, he's not the first.

Speaker 1:          02:12:22       Every fucking comedian has said racist shit. let's Dog herself had a bunch of racist shit. They pulled off her twitter page. We don't hate her for that. She had a bunch of shit about white people. Just generalizing about white people in general. If you ever did that about black people, you would get blackballed from hollywood for life of course. But we will allow a certain amount of stupid shit to come out of people's mouths if we think that you're not a bad person. Yeah, and if you disagree, if you disagree wiTh somebody where you beat it, I'll say it again. The way you beat a bad idea is with which you don't do, is you don't start this fucking meme of punch nazis. like everybody keeps saying punch nazis like, don't say that. You're talking shit on there though.

Speaker 1:          02:13:03       You see that girl get maced in the face and the girl with the shit up make bitcoin great again hat and they came up at mesa mesa in the face because it looked like a make America great again. She fucked up. it doesn't matter man. They fucked up. Guy peter in the head with a sign and another guy macer in the face. The ruthless to they weren't ruthless with is our boy jake shields. He was at the protest that didn't get maced. He's lucky to get maced in the face on the trailer. You need more. You need more than mace to fight. Jake shields got problem with macy's. You can't see. And if people just jump on you, you can't look. Jacob, probably jack, 90 percent of them that come anywhere near him you can't see and someone hits you over the back of the head with something.

Speaker 1:          02:13:43       Yeah. These fucking people are doing exactly what they would hate. And when I see people, like there's people that are calling out for who they're calling out for a military coup, they're calling out for them. I've seen more than one person say this, like the military needs to step in and take our country back. And I'm like, holy shit, this is patrick swayze movie from the eighties. They're thinking exactly the way of fastest would or a tyrant would. They just have a different target. But that's what I always say to people. It's amazing how many people think exactly like their enemy, exactly like their enemy. I want to kill all of them or whatever. And yet they're just. The only difference is they have a different target. But it's crazy when you have a legitimate contest, right? You had a legitimate popularity contest and one guy wins and you're not happy that the guy wins.

Speaker 1:          02:14:26       So you want to start riots like you might. You might have fucked up and not voted, or you might not have done such good job picking a candidate or you might have had the wrong campaign, but you have to accept when someone wins. Otherwise there's no fucking point. And having his contest, we have this contest every four years and if you don't accept to one, as long as it's not this, the cheating, whatever the cheating happened, it probably happened on both sides. Whatever legal shit they got away with whatever shenanigans and the pr they did to him with the whole, uh, grab them by the pussy thing and all that. I mean, there's, there's a tax left and right on both sides. He came out ahead. People aren't happy. I might understand that people aren't happy, but you can't think that you can start a riot now because you didn't want him to be in there.

Speaker 1:          02:15:09       They had a stupid fucking contest. he won stupid fucking contest. The problem is you're having a stupid fucking contests to see who runs the world. And also it's important to have a little compassion for the other side in this terms. Like I constantly hear trump voters being characterized as homophobes rednecks, dumb hillbillies and all that stuff because they're in there. They're in the mix. There's always there. And they're there. They're in the mixing on both sides, the categories. Here's the thing, it might also be worth taking a little bit of a human approach and looking at trump voters and um, maybe a lot of trump voters may be a lot of trump voters who are good people didn't like trump that much either, but they liked hillary way less or maybe hillary's talking the way obama has been for the past eight years and their lives haven't changed for, and they were desperate to seat anything else.

Speaker 1:          02:15:53       Work, be a little compassionate on why a lot of people voted for trump because remember this country voted a black president in and a lot of those voters were white, uh, t two times in a row. Well, but in order for him to have one, you have to have some people that voted for obama last term that voted for trump this. correct. There's a lot of people that thought it would be a better thing to have him other than her. Yeah. so there were no racist. They're not all, you know, homophobes they, they were. That's why I was always really careful about. I was always critical of trump. I was very careful not to be critical of trump voters because you know there are a lot, but you're not being honest because there are dummies in there too, just like there's dummies in the. Hillary cannot present there on this.

Speaker 1:          02:16:32       That's why those stereotypes exist. When you talk about the latte sipping hillary supporters who literally know nothing about what the negative things she's Done. If you say anything about or you're a sexist, I mean there's a lot of that going on too. Those are real people like the real ridiculous people on the left and the right. They're all real. You know, so the hillbillies that love trump. Look dude, I've seen it, man. I saw a video where this guy got pulled over in an altercation with this guy hit and this other guy had gotten some sort of a traffic altercation and this guy comes uP to his window. He's calling them the n word and he's saying, trump, man, I'm with trump. Trump's president now. And it's that type of person that like there. There are people like that that want to let you know that this is their guy now because they're white and that this is like a racist thing.

Speaker 1:          02:17:16       You think their races winning. Think there was kkk people that voted for hillary, like a special group kkk for hillary. The kkk people are there like. Let's be honest, how many just straight up racists and how many kkk? P 2000 official kkk takes. There are a lot of 200,000. I thought I saw that sounds. I wouldn't doubt if there was a million in the south. I think there's definitely probably a million racists. I'm trying to fish clan members. Joining an organization's on knowing how many ufc fans are. There is a lot, but if you had to join an organization to be a ufc fan will be far less of us mean buying the paper, review the hood and go to a fucking flame. Had to go to a bonfire. 5,000. What more than 40 different clan groups exist. Many having multiple chapters or clavier burns. That's cute and cute and a few that a presence in a large number of states. There are over a hunDred different klan chapters around the country with the combined strength in members and associates that made total around $5,000. Oh my god. they're a little bigger than 10th planet.

Speaker 1:          02:18:23       Bigger. That is so crazy. I don't even know if they're smart enough to be anything. I think that they are. A lot of times People are just sort of guys who want to be part of a group and you know, they. They've been told something, they don't do any research and they're just dicks and there a lot of just shitheads who want to be part of a hate group. A lot of problem with black versus white is the same problem as left versus right. Black versus white, left versus right. Share that fucking team thing, man. They share that team thing and white people want to think that they're on one team. Black people want to think they're on another team and we fuck each other up doing that. It's so human. Human, human, human beings are very tribal. I mean, anthropologists tell you that all the time, that human beings are tribal.

Speaker 1:          02:19:07       EveryThing. It's about time, like this generation is cut that shit. No, this is literally not. What do you mean? But I'll tell you, I don't think it's aBout time. You know, with jared diamond who's, who wrote guns, germs and steel, great, amazing guy. And he Said that he fascinating that when they were studying different tribes in papa new Guinea that had been isolated so they were, they weren't really influenced By western culture at all. And what would happen was they have two tribeS that would get along really well and they even inner married and you know, they, they shared things and everything else and as soon as there became scarce resources like water or game and one side's very existence started to get threatened for. So for example, maybe this one tribes closer to a water source and the other water source dried up. So what'll happen is it's really amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:19:56       It's very quickly the tribes will start making up stories about each other. Yeah. We've talked about this before on another podcast. Know we talked about this, you talked about how they decided in a very short amount of time the other people were bad and they went over and kill. Yeah. So I think that's human nature, man. And I think when you start talking about getting along, getting along, you can't afford certain people you can know. That's the whole point. Like right now, life has never been easier. So what I'm saying is it's about time that this generation like figure out the people are just people that it's fucking stupid for all redheaded people to join together and form clan, you know, fellow people working. I agree with that. It's just getting through. It is, it, is it, it's more getting through today I think than ever before in history because there's one that, right?

Speaker 1:          02:20:44       Yeah. Because it's like, even like if you go back and watch those old bugs bunny cartoons, you know which ones they don't show something that's funded by your will. They don't show that dude that much. I bet they showed a lot and they don't show. They don't show pepe le pew fogbugz rapists gun ugly feeling. That's gunk is a rapist. Motherfucker will fuck that cat members, so fucking ridiculous. It was just trying to kill that cat. Always imagine if you went outside a skunk was trying to fuck your cat, like your favorite cat and some wild skunk. Just all sweet cathy. Pet behind her ears and you love her is dirty skunk. This fucking chicken. Eat and monsters conceIt. Chickens. By the way, here they break into chicken coop, so I caught one trying to get into my chicken coop. Carnivorous. There are 100 percent predator skunks are predators.

Speaker 1:          02:21:34       I didn't know that. Yeah, we think of them as the ground nesting birds. Rats, rodents, chickens. The fuck up your chicken. I'll get in. He couldn't get in. We chased them off though. He stunk up my whole fucking yard. Yeah, we know how to show. Showed me the deer eating the birds that were stuck in the fence. yeah, the birds. Isn't it weird that you could be driving on the god damn freeway with your windows rolled up eric tight and pass through a cloud of skunk smell? How does it do the gods? I'll tell you exactly how the same way the with the skunk smells so strong that your reaction to it is like a bloodhound reaction to persons sent like electricity when you. That's how we can understand like how bloodhound works and probably bloodhounds probably even better than that, but parts per million.

Speaker 1:          02:22:16       Whether or not you can detect it. Skunk smells so bad that in parts per million they can shoot it in the backyard and you could smell it like literally a mile away. Wow. Well that's how a dog works. Yeah, like a good bloodhound. They'll fucking smell you a mile away. They just got to figure out where it's coming from. They'll run that way. Nope. It's getting weaker. they'll go run that way stronger. I think it's electro. It's a smell. It smell. It's hard to go through the glass. So jetson. Well, how do you breed that? He would run out of air if that thing was airtight. Do you understand that you're coming into your filter's not airtight? Well, how come you don't feel it when you're driving? Because it goes through a whole system that's inside your dash breach? No, no, no, it gets backed up, it gets backed up and then it comes through filters.

Speaker 1:          02:22:58       Like you can open the filters to the vents, come through and then you can actually feel the breeze blow on you when you're on the highway where you can close that shit. But air still gets in. He gets into the cabinet. I'm saying, I'm going to guess that it's electrical. Well, you should definitely guess driving a flintstone. Coach burns by my online. We have libraries. She'd go online with your phone. Just stay off youtube. You're that your slave. Stay off flat earth. Sixty nine. Youtube made by slave labor. I'm not going to throw this away to prove that. I don't believe in slate made these phones. What was the name of that company that made like, um, phones that were sustainably resourced and what was the company called? It was like ethical phones. They like, they tried to make some green phone or it's okay man, this guy makes 50 bucks an hour and everybody's happy.

Speaker 1:          02:23:53       Well, isn't that a family? Is they work three days a week? They said anyway, isn't that isn't the material used? Isn't that mined in the Congo? The sticks? Yes. LittlE kids with sticks have to pull it out of the rocks. It's called tran. I got to talk to my mom. They get it in a couple of different places, I guess where else to get it? Afghanistan and they found trillions of dollars worth of minerals in Afghanistan. Hey guys, we just. I can't believe this is here. Amazing. It's like they. It's like they had a like a whole x on a fucking map the russians were doing. We were digging. Then finally they, hey guys, can't even believe this, but guess what? There's like trillions of dollars worth of minerals here. I bet they're just saying that they're just there for the opium and they're like, no, no, there's minerals here.

Speaker 1:          02:24:36       Unless we struck minerals. See, this is where there's a flaw in your thinking. They're going to take both of those things. They want it. They want both of those things. The mother opium for fucking sure. Sturgill simpson played a song on saturday night live about the opium trade, like they let them get away with it, but talking about how Afghanistan as like a front front run by production, it's also a country music star, so they're like, oh, that's all good. You killed it on the ground. A lot of poppies, bad motherfucker, dude. Say grow 96 percent of the world's opium that we were over there. Yeah, for sure. Just for like freedom freedom. We don't care about opium or even minerals. Those minerals here. Wow. Amazing. We pulled out, but we're going to leave behind a vacuum. Big ass it to a battleship. We're going to fill that motherfucker up with every six months. Scroll heroin in the United States. Greenhouses. No.

Speaker 1:          02:25:35       Hold on. What is that jamie? Would you pull up extra cost to make google phone in the us? Only four bucks. Holy shit. That's not the iphone. The iphone would cost to a moto x. Oh, years ago in the bathroom. Okay, well that's four bucks. More on the biggest cost that says is that there's a. In China, they have at least maybe in one plant. They're up to 30,000 industrial engineers to help the workers. if something goes wrong, they're saving mad cash and they also know what the fuck they're doing. They've been doing it for a long time. if you started that up in the United States, like there'd be a lot of trial and error. You'd have to be willing to throw away a lot of money. The phones would be shit. Come on now. Think about it. Feel like an american car in the eighties. The iphone in America first to build it now costs $2,000.

Speaker 1:          02:26:26       You're right, but what does the cross now it costs a thousand, right? Well, no. Now the phone's like $700. That's the comparison that. What is an iphone seven s? What does that crossed? They haven't made that seven plus rather sorry. The next one. Are they going to ever bring that back? But you can get an adapter or use adapters. You know you get a lightning adapter, sticks it in as a regular hole in the bottom of it. I heard that the iphone eight, there's supposed to be flipped capable of bring about the flip flip. That's going to make it a book no plugs to. It's all wireless charging, which is maybe or maybe not true, right? It's going to be terrible with electricity is going to be in the air. We're all going to die. That's when tesla was talking about putting electricity in the air.

Speaker 1:          02:27:11       You create habitat out there like radio. You're gonna generate things. We're going to be walking around with like tesla coils bouncing off of that could have been real if they already aren't we already walking through a sea of electricity. There's definitely a lot of electricity around us and there's definitely wifi in this room. We might be in the ocean of electro magnetism, right? Yeah, bro. Think about that. What's powering your muscles? Your muscles are pounding. You lucked into some electrical outlet. Well, you know what it is. Electricity is definitely a part of us. There's a lot of shit going on. There's water that's important. Electricity that conducts through the water. There's all the vitamins. Jeff city in us, jesus, jesus, jc, but the love of running on wireless electricity. Sure. We're watching like a bunch of cricket phones. What do you do? You think that wifi and cell phone signals and all the signals that are around us all the time, they just didn't exist when people were first created by hippie.

Speaker 1:          02:28:19       Good lord. How bad is it? No one's. We're not dying. We have no idea. Because remember the bluetooth they'd put to your ear like, I probably shouldn't do that. Or didn't they find that cell phones were bad sleep next to and put it next to your ear? Yeah. People say that it fucks with your karma. She one of them. One of them things. Well, what happened to brain tumors the day they let that go? Is that real? But hidden. What's her name? The fucking singer. Didn't she have? Um. All I want to do, he just has that sheryl crow. Didn't sheryl crow say that she got a brain tumor from doing press on a cell phone and the nineties she thinks that. So gave it to her because it's on the same side of her head kind of fucking press tour where you. It's crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:28:58       I talked to him. I talked to a dude who had cancer of his bone and his hip. And it was right where he kept a cell phone and the doctor said that there's reoccurring instances that he's dealing with with people had cell phones. Scotty get a bone graft, bro, get a cut of counselors side. They had a cancerous chunk of his bone off and then they had to put a bone graft from somewhere else in there and fill it back in place. And he was saying that this doctor was telling them that all these guys that come in and they have those hip things for cell phones, like that's the side where they would get cancer. Most girls usually put the phone in their back pocket. You're going to see a lot of asks cancer tumors. Tumors could be. I wonder if we get some dick, but when your fingers get the most tumors, where's the hand cancer?

Speaker 1:          02:29:45       My hands feel good. It just doesn't seem to be bothering anybody else. Let's get enhanced cancer. You know, maybe just got a weak hip bone. You fucking pussy. You maybe need to walk it off. Yeah. Maybe it's just incidents as shit. Goddamn cell phone to your hip. Like a psycho. But did you see sheryl crow? Did you find that article? She actually had cancer and she didn't want to get the tumor removed. Whoa. But she got an inner dome on the same side is where a cell phone was and that's why she thought that it was from doing press. She get to go hippo face. How dare you? Back when there was no internet, you know. And you had to do press for radio or for radio. And you had to do press for an album that was coming out. Yeah. You just call people up and do interviews.

Speaker 1:          02:30:25       That's what they. That's what you did. Leave this sheryl crow. My brain tumor maybe related to cell phone use. See the chosen fucked up picture or tuition. What's been trumped that doug just fucking spray or no doctors that will confirm that crow said monday. Well appealing on the premier of katie. The new syndicated talk show hosted hosted by katie couric. Hilarious. I do have a theory that it's possible that it's related to that she spent hours on the old archaic cell phones. Well, she's probably right. There's no doctors that will even confirmed it's part of a brain where she often held her phone. Have you ever noticed, have you ever been. Let's talk you up to something else, but it might be true be, but it could be that that's what happened. That's totally possible that she had that phone up to her head and broader brand stretch. More about what your.

Speaker 1:          02:31:22       Maybe there's a couple of days maybe there a cover to cover and there's a lot of people are trying to test it on. Here's. Yeah, here's the other. No, I'm just guessing, but radiation. The doctor. We're to just talk over them. Are you gonna? Let them talk. I'm listening to him, but he's gay. He's getting me thinking about something because he's got them out here. You go like a cover up. Jesus christ. He was in the middle of the talk. I would just force over. I'm just bullshitting. Well, you might be right. Maybe the grappler on. I just want to know what happened to that. I mean you would think it is. I would believe that it is dangerous. I don't know, but maybe it's not. I hope it's not, oh, that's all bullshit. But I mean, does anybody fucking. No where they haven't been around that long.

Speaker 1:          02:32:00       Like how long have people been using cell phones? The way we're using them now where you're constantly on them. Twenty years. Has it been eight years now? I remember yet. Twenty minutes. Smartphones, smartphones were the thing that did it. Was it o seven? Zero. Eight? Yes. So from then on people are like slowly but surely getting more and more integrated into using that electronic device and constantly being either because before that there was no twitter or facebook or instagram or any of that shit. Yeah, there was no like answering questions on google. So you and also you get taxed and send calls forever. Right. There was no internet until 2007 and nobody was going online with a trio piece of shit. I'm like, yeah, it was falling. That's why black pain was so important because the email, no one was on the phone a ton. Texts actually people have had their phones at their heads for longer since like what? Since probably 92.

Speaker 1:          02:33:05       No, sheryl crow became popular in 94. I remember that because I had just come to la and all I want to do is have some fun. Was like on the radio back then it was a big jam so those phones were just. They might as well been plutonium and a fucking a lot of gold cup where they're like this. He held those pitches ahead, but actually I read this thing about how when radiation, like from a phone or whatever, I guess the idea is that it can break apart certain like mitochondria or d dna strand. What is it, where it sounds like some bullshit it'll take. It disrupts certain from the library, bro. I can't remember. It disrupts things in that process. Can actually cause sometimes cancer. So it's pretty hard to kind of draw a through line because there's so many different calls to.

Speaker 1:          02:33:53       So there's the reality that what causes cancer to use not going to cause cancer to him. I'm not going to cause cancer to another person and my would make you sick. Everybody's in their own weird biological makeup. Oh yeah. Some people are super susceptible to all sorts of weird diseases that other people aren't, and there's also environmental factors like maybe what you work is kind of fucked up too, but maybe working in a gas station or something like that, or you doing the auto repair and you're fucking breathe it in paint fumes and shit, and then on top of that you're dealing with that, right? That that could just be. It'd be a combination of factors. It kills your immune system factors here, it's like when you smoke cigarettes, not everybody who smokes even a lot for a lifetime gets lung cancer. some people just don't.

Speaker 1:          02:34:32       They live into their nineties, smoke considered crazy, but then there's also the reality of living anywhere in high population centers. You're being poisoned. Everybody around us is being poisoned, if not a whole lot to fuck. Yes, 100 percent. You come over that hill and you look down into the valley and everything is brown as fuck. You are breathing that you are 100 percent breathe in your household. You see it when you get down, but you know how I can tell because there's a place near, um, like there's a place where you drive over between like topanga and like to soda, like that area wHere you could like look over and you could see tHe mountains sometimes, like maybe like when neck coming down to one [inaudible], one, you can see the mountains sometimes and sometimes you don't see the mouse defrays the fucking shit hides mountains, the snow covered mountains that you could get lost on and die in and you don't see it all.

Speaker 1:          02:35:29       You see brown, that's digital breathing that. That's right. It's been like that forever. And la, it's the valley. It's a whole mixture to but it's way worse. It's way worse now than it was like back when people are on horses and shit been told me in front of our producer guy, he said that uh, before people even settled in southern California, the indians called southern California that landed the smoke smoke or something like that. Right. So, and you see, I've noticed this since I was a kid. Sometimes you can't see the mountains. There's too much smog and then a storm happens and then evidence clear and then it just a cycle it. I thought that that was. We were going to come to a day where it would never clear up. It would just be so bad after 20 years, but it's actually way better.

Speaker 1:          02:36:22       The air quality in los angeles is way better because cars are way better at cars are cleaner, so eventually the wind just. We'll clean it. Here's, here's something real crazy flip population. A porsche nine slash 11 turbo. The air that comes out is cleaner than the air that goes in. If you drive it in la. Wow. What's really a porsche nine slash 11 turbo. It's carbon. It's carbon emissions are so low that the air that it takes in until those turbo charges goes through the combustion engine and comes out the exhaust is actually cleaner than the air it's taking in. How about this crazy statistic? The average carter, the average car on the seventies, it made it more pollution sitting without its engine on in a driveway because of fuel of operation than the average car on the highway today in los angeles. That's brand new.

Speaker 1:          02:37:07       You remember we used to hear the gas slosh around back there. Yeah, like if you had a car, like an old car and you like took a turn. He went a little sideways here. The gas slosh around fucking shitty car carburetors before we had catalytic converters smelled it inside the car. He had a roll the windows down. When you're on the highway, it's not bad, right? so magic markers a dig. That stuff shouldn't be. They'll smell a sharp. So anybody that's worried about being poisoned, you definitely be employed and we're breathing in brake dust 100 percent. It's not good for you and it's gonna. It's gonna shorten your life and might only short your life by a few years. It might make the last few years of your life more uncomfortable, but if you go somewhere where this is not the case, you go to like fucking deer valley, Utah.

Speaker 1:          02:37:48       You go hang out up there and look out over the mountains. I'd rather there than live there and my parents just kill me. Threatened parents. That's why I brought it up. You fucking awesome. Other. They love it. It's beautiful, man. It's cool to visit. No, the problem is we got to get more cool people to live up in a place like that. That's right. That's what you gotta do. Like we're in the wrong spot. Like the people that we know are all awesome, but we're definitely in the wrong spot. The only thing that's good about this spot is it warm is no bugs, but the real problem is it's warm. There's no bugs. Like one of the reasons why the indians call this valley to smoke is like fire is fucking normal for here. Things are supposed to burn down and then they build back better.

Speaker 1:          02:38:29       I mean, this is like, it clears out entire forest, like controlled burns is something that forest service is due because you have to burn down a certain amount of the old shit. Otherwise it just becomes kindling and then when the fires do come, they're unmanageable and then on top of that, the carbon needs to fucking be recirculated into the earth. Like it's a good thing. These burns and that was. That happened for millions of years and now because there's no burn, it's like it changes the environment like this place. Places that the used to have burns and now they control them. Something like the force goes away and then just go with these big dry ass grassy shitty areas over hundreds of years of doing this. It's, it's so weird, man. It's like the way people live. We think that we could just stay in one spot and this spot is going to be fine.

Speaker 1:          02:39:16       That's never been the case anywhere on earth switches supposed to move. We're supposed to be nomadic. You have to move back to find out, dude, you can't stay right next to the ocean. That fucking that malibu coast is a joke. Those people with the fucking. Oh man pose. This is my spot. Bet you're on the edge of the great water next to you. He said, giant monster of water. It's miles deep. Three quarters of the surface of the earth and your life on the edge. His mind get off. Don't you? Frisbee in front of my hedge. We like pick a spot like some crazy stupid crap. It's like locked itself on a reef and it's claiming to revise its own. That's what we're like. We're like standing by the ocean with your $20,000,000 house in malibu. Kicking surfers off your front, but you're by the great water the fuck out. Go to the hills at any time. That could be an earthquake and the big Wave way to Arizona

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       to come over the malibu and checked in the houses out. fuck yeah. I lived there for awhile. You didn't like dude? No, no, no, no, no. My daughter broke her arm at school and we couldn't stay at this place because it had staircases that were really steep and there was one that went down to the ocean. It was one of them electric stairs and it was broken and so it only went like this. So you've got a climate like a fucking ladder. It was sketcHy as fuck to get down to the ocean and it just was too dangerous where her arm was broken. Yeah. You love malibu though. I remember that. I love the air. I love the looking at the ocean, but I don't want to live there. I don't want to live next to the big water ties because when you're at high, this is what happened with me and the message.

Speaker 3:          02:40:55       We've got high one night and went downstairs. There's this downstairs to this house. It's like literally the water's coming in right under carrie and we were sitting in, me and her were like looking out the window and I and I looked on her, go, fuck this place. Fuck this place. No, no, no, no. You realize what it really is like when you're right there at night in a house overlooking the ocean. It's real nature reveals itself to you because you can be really complacent when you see everything. See when it's light out, you see everything, you look up, the sun is shining, the clouds are moving. You see birds, you look down at the ocean and you go, wow, this is so cool. It's so calling being by the ocean, but when you're at night, it's black and there's nothing out. Then you realize, oh my god, that's all water. That's all water, water to do it. We stayed there and we rented it for three months. I stayed there five times.

Speaker 3:          02:41:58       What part of it? Because my daughter broke her arm, but part of me was like, oh god, so high that I realized the nature of it. It is a big, dark monster of water. They're totally unfeeling and teeming with life. Oh yeah. Most likely. If you look at the habits of nature, most likely when things become too dominant, something comes along and tries to take them out. When things take too much from one environment, they wind up starving, are going extinct. This is like the constant cycle of life, right? Fellows. Here we are standing next to this great wall of life that will been sucking out with nets, kill it, everything. Imagine if you could go back 500 years and just look under the water and see what it looked like and then go back to today and look under the water and see all the fish are gone. How many fish there must've been created. She meant, you know how clean it must've been everywhere before we were pumping our shit and when I was scuba diving into hedy by a couple months ago. It is. You look out and all you see is fucking schools of fish. It's like finding the va. There's no difference. I swear to god. You see sharks. I looked into the literature for sharks there. Lemon sharks don't. Sounds cool. I was always like,

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       dude, it's like tying in with life probably the whole ocean. Yeah. At one point in time, coral when you touch the coral, like there are things in the corner like he, he told me to just just put your fingers and it was this big flower was beautiful and it just disappeared. It's like a magic thing that it's the most scuba diving. I was down there for so long that I almost got nitrogen poisoning. Really pleasant way to die actually. You just go, you just. People will take their regular out of, give it to the fish so they can breathe and die. You guys super slim a bitch. But I was down there for two hours man. And I'm telling you, you know, you never see when you scuba dive. What fish? What do you think? What? What aniMal do you never see? Chickens you never see.

Speaker 1:          02:43:55       Not at blue. Well you can see whales. You never see dolphins because they don't like the bubbles. And you will. And I talked to dr. Has been scuba diving for 40 years. I said you ever seen dolphins? He goes, never now to smart. Why? So they see the bubbles and that was probably like, I just don't like it. It sounds like shit. and then probably they probably don't like it that you could stay under. No, don't go to the top and then get the fuck out of there. Yeah, I don't know. It's very interesting day. We saw a whole school of them as soon as we got up in the water, they were all. Well yeah, those are the little ones to the gray ones ever seen the malibu all. Maybe they hunt them. Melbourne. I'm sure some people do. They hunt them because they killed tuna.

Speaker 1:          02:44:29       That's one of the things that the japanese do. They're not really eating them as much as they're killing them in order to like. Because they, they get it. Like, you know, you've got hundreds of dolphins. They find a school to another decimated. So these tuna men, you know that like they used to. If you watched jiro dreams of sushi, have you seen the doc on netflix? Really interesting. But one of the things that really struck me was how he was talking about how when he first became a sushi chef, how easy it was to get the tuna and how much tuna there was and how it stuck radically diminished. We got famous. You silly bitch. We all weighed in. Really? His place is a tiny little ass place. But I'm talking about from the time he was a young man. Now he's like in the seventies or something like that.

Speaker 1:          02:45:05       I think he might be dead actually. No. Yeah, his son runs. Yeah. He's no longer alive. He died after the movie. I think so. I think he's dead. I know his son was supposed to go next in line. You could have that job. Miserable. Yeah. Everybody's like, fine. They find beauty in it. And I understand. I watched it. I get it. It's, there is some sort of a beauty and the meticulous, meticulous process of creating the perfect food. Exhausting though. Unbelievable. Uh, what's the name knit? What's the fucking doesn't in general when you're me, the sushi. Wait to watch you eat it. Yeah. Freaky like, get the fuck out my face, man. I just want to talk to my wife. Yeah, I want to do a six month waiting list to that. Um, do you think that that's different though than eating at a restaurant or you go to a steakhouse, the waiter comes, everybody's pleasant. It makes the experience better. You sit there, you cut up your food, you have a conversation. But if you're sitting in front of that dude, it's very different. You gotta be like, gee, this is a completely different sort of experience. This guy is crafting some sort of culinary artwork for you in the form of these bite sized morsels of perfectly

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       aged fish with a perfect sauce on it with a perfectly cooked rice and he's been meticulous about this process for so long. Like you're, you're taking in Some sort of a weird vibe. I wouldn't want to do it all the time. No one wants once every 10 years be great. The other thing is you're going to walk away starving dogs a form of mastery that you should always experience [inaudible]. I think it's mastery and artist rates and fat sushi. That's trends. It transcends rice. Fish, rice. You see the documentary. I know. Yes. I did. Nice fish. That's like saying anything you can do, you can simplify it, but don't you think that life is about the variety of choices that you have and it's good that you could go to a place like this and have these weird bites of clam mixed with a weird sort of a seaweed wrap on top of it and some perfectly cooked rice with a little bit of you listening to benihana.

Speaker 2:          02:47:02       right. So ron is when the steakhouse, they cook in front of, you know, benihana. They cook in front of that. This would be like a sweet fish or sugar. Sugar fish. Yeah, but it's like a little art form. It's different. It's like I liked it that I liked that. I liked classical music sometimes. Man, I liked it. It exists, but if I went to a Henry Rollins concert or something like that and someone was playing classical music, I'd be like, well, this doesn't work. Yeah. You go see metallica and there's a classical music band that opens up for them. You're like, well, okay. Right. Or the opposite. They have to go on after like slayer, slayer, and then classical music. Yeah. What doesn't mean the classical music sucks. It means it's like right now it's not the place for it. It's not my frequency. Right. Want to fucking t bone.

Speaker 2:          02:47:43       So sometimes you want a fat porterhouse, you know, you want mashed potatoes and gravy and sometimes you only want to sit down in front of this guy has been working his whole life on crafting the perfect kind of sushi. Correct. And he's going to judge you while you eat it. Yeah. This is going to serve you. I love that. Oh no. You have to eat. You need a certain way yet. And he wants your response and then delete. Yeah. A certain way. What's a certain way? Like I'm not sure man. Who walks the dog? He just gives it to you and you eat it. no, no. So why did I, w I was in Italy and I considered the, the one that won the number one restaurant in the world, you know, like initially and gives the, gives an award to the best restaurant once a year.

Speaker 2:          02:48:21       Right. Woo. And we actually sat with the chef and he had like this, like this thing comes out and it was a bond was like this bond with eel like barbecued eel. You'd be like, usually like, what the fuck is this? It was, well when you, when you bite into it, you don't ever say, oh that tastes just like, you don't ever say that. Well you don't even say that. Tastes kind of like you just go. Never smelled or tasted anything like that in my life. That's the most unique fucking flavor and experience I've ever had. And that's why he's always been in the top for the past five years has been in the top three best restaurants. Finding sandwiches. He makes the craziest shit. He'll make a grilled cheese, he'll make a grilled cheese and it's like, oh, it's a grilled cheese. Well, no, it's not actually, it's what's called a perfect grilled cheese

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       and then everything else is trying to be a grilled cheese. It's like, that's. That's good. He'll do simple shit. Little simple things and change your whole fucking life. Some bitch. Nobody's changed my life with a fucking grilled cheese sandwich was so ahead of himself. I'm just telling you so when you get grilled. So it's a fucking grilled cheese sandwich. Butter and jelly. We had a sliding was a slider. I had cheese sandwich once with short ribs, barbecued beef, short ribs in it. We should go eat. Do those shorts that morton feldman with Alex Jones. Good lord. They're good whole lee. She's not as good as this guy. You fuckers fox, you don't know shit up. This is why trump won. People like you, people like you and your fruity talking about god damn elco neaten it and slave served from Chad, but it was cheap. I mean, any one of these, if they gave you an option to buy the phone in the United States, but the phone might be a little more wonky and cost 500 bucks more, or you could just keep it going with slave labor, slave labor, but I got to talk to my mother, talking about the slave phone says, I'll take that.

Speaker 1:          02:50:18       You're going to take that. That's the one that's made in this meticulous chinese factory by people that make a pittance. They do it right until someone who works in America can enjoy their football game on sunday and get their fucking coffee break and by their ram truck and have a good house in a suburbs. You won't pay $500 more for your fucking phone that you got attached to your hip to give you bone cancer while you drive your car. You faggot american $500. The exact same phone, exact same exact 100 percent on 500 bucks. Yeah. Do you think the average person, the average person would pay $50 more? No, I think $50 more as an achievable number, like $800. Difference between the 800 and 1100 and most of the time it's getting subsidized by your cell phone company. Most of the times, like you buy a contract, you get a phone for a discount, like you buy an iphone from verizon or what have you.

Speaker 1:          02:51:19       You're not spending the full 1200 bucks or whatever it is at cost. You're spending a part of that and the rest of it gets paid off over the years of your contract. Yeah, you can get a five year contract or whatever you do, but no one ever keeps the funnier it's traded back in. That restarts jack you back up and then within a year so he can get a new phone for free. You can upgrade for free. they want to keep you hooked to the fucking tit. some the things I don't see how you can get better at certain things like I don't like that tests out there. I don't know how you make a better technological car. There'll be better. For sure.

Speaker 1:          02:51:52       The first edition, they'll well, they'll have much more integrated navigation systems, navigation systems that have augmented reality. This is a big thing to do and now with phones where they're coming up with applications where you could hold a phone up and you a little bit of a scan your neighborhood and find out where the stores are, who could lift it up and like you can go through the mall and it'll give you reviews of each store. Like augmented put balloons, like cartoon balloons. Like this is the juice factory. They have awesome orange juice, you know, and won't point right there. Ready? Yep. So this is going on right now. like this is like ready to launch stuff. Yeah. So. And this is just out of your phone, just looking, lifting up with your phone. It's going to get in your car, so that's going to be in your car.

Speaker 1:          02:52:34       There's going to be way better internet. first of all, like podcasts, like the stuff that you guys are doing, it's going to replace radio essentially is going to be no reason to hire someone to rent a building to broadcast a signal when you can just get all the information from, whether it's our combat sports podcast or news podcast or government. It's going to be on the internet, it's going to be like a direct line right into your car. It's ridiculous that it's not there on every car already because it's free. Like everybody wants something for free. It's like it's right. You can get it at any time. That's going to be 100 percent the case. It's going to be very difficult to sell radio or even the idea of a radio signal and just a few decades it's going to be. It's going to be like Payphones.

Speaker 1:          02:53:15       Payphones don't exist anymore and be like block. The other thing that we were talking about with manufacturing is I think it's more likelY that we're going to end up having a three d printers, massive three d printers, so we'll be able to order what we want. That'll be made right in our, in our jurisdiction and our town, and then you know, it's a. It's a three minute drive to your house with that or you come and pick it up at this main depot. Right? Well, they think that's the number one problem with automated. Like these artificially intelligent computers and all the different things they're going to have where they have robots are building cars and shit. The number one problem is going to be the loss of jobs for skilled workers, so all these people that are currently doing these things like automated trucks are going to replace truck drivers to ups, drivers, truck drivers, all that shake.

Speaker 1:          02:53:59       A bulk of a huge bulk of mosT male male and blue collar employment is think they can go from san francisco, New York with no sleep. I mean your packages, they can't hit things that literally they see have cameras all around the. The backoff. They've shown a diminished rate of accidents with automated cars versus how you're driving. I drive my cAr, my job, but still not to do that though. Do you ever do it? You said it all the time. Do pay attention or you just don't, but I do. I come to do that. Could you put porn on that big flat screen in front of you? You got some guy died, right? So I've been doing it. Yeah. He's going to self-drive jacking off to porn and died. I'm pretty sure she imagine if that was your shit, like what do I like to do, bro? To get on the highway, bring it up to about 75. Sorry, sarah pula. do those people love to do things like that in public? Just all. All he watches is gagging videos, just likes running mascara and snotty noses and blah, and this guy's spitting on his own dick on the highway.

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       Of course, those window, he's called brian count. Can you jump in the back seat like can you show now? Apparently I think what was happening, this is what I heard. I don't know if it's true, but guys would get drunk. They would put there and that their address into their navigation, the take them home. I don't know if that's. And there'd be. They crawl in the back seat and I think tesla found out about that. That's a big liability. It's not ready. It's not ready yet. Yeah, but if you let someone decide that they can press automatic driver, you can't decide when they compress it and when they can. Like either it can drive itself perfectly or it can't. It's got to get better, but if you're drunk, okay, but if it does get better and you're drunk, is it irresponsible to let it drive home?

Speaker 2:          02:55:48       No. I mean it seems like it doesn't really work. Does it really work? If it doesn't really work, why the fuck do you sell in it? Why are you selling automated car that doesn't 100 percent of the time. Every fucking single time work. Not ready yet. They shouldn't. They shouldn't have released it. When it can kind of work. You currently can only do it if you're in car pool. If you're over 70 to case you gotta, you gotta let drunk shabbat. What happens to me is when I do self drive, sometimes it'll just stay. Did you? Are you amber? We'll you can't or science. You try to do it and go. Not here. like it won't work. It tells you that you just can't. You click the thing twice towards you and sometimes it's not available. it's like you have a freaky girlfriend, but every now and then she turns you down.

Speaker 2:          02:56:30       Just to give you that little element of mystery, like is it going to go down or is she gonna get mad at me for no fucking reason whatsoever. Keeping you on your toes. Goddamn this freaky bitch. That's why don't we get done all these tussles about. I'm not really. Don't like the tesla. Well, kids, should we wrap this bitch up and fun. I want everybody to know we didn't talk about fights at all. You. Okay. Let's go over to feel drained. Drained, germane to rhonda. Me should have one or do you think that she should have been deducted points? She should've been it. Worst case should have been a draw a. I think the right thing to do was holly should have won. Even deducting those point. You have to do that. Those points and I think even germane realized that when she goes, I'll give holly a rematch right away because tainted.

Speaker 2:          02:57:16       She's like, I'm not a dirty fighter. Like she knows what she did was fucked up. Only won that fight. You think, well, well holly definitely got the only legit knocked down. You know, she got that. She landed that question mark kick. That was beautiful. Beautiful. She hid it behind the shoulder, came over the top planning. I gave holly the wind for octagon control, let you landed more leg kicks and she had the only significant strike in the, like the big st, like germain to random. He did more damage when she connected, but she didn't connect as much. But then holly did do more damage in two instances. One with the question mark kick and another time she dropped her with a straight left. Yes. That was one of the best punches of the fight and that was in the, I think it was the fourth round last round was. IT might have been the fifth. She dropped her and it was a. It was a big moment. So you could say that that and the head

Speaker 1:          02:58:02       kick round two different rounds or both? Easily 10. eight, right. You dropped him with a head kick and the someone with you don't think so, but you understand there's new rules. The new rules will give them. See which one? Which one's off balance ahead. No, no, no, no. She said herself. She was nasty, she said herself. She was days and there's a picture of it on mike winkeljohn or jackson winkeljohn. John's a instagram account where you see how well it connected. It's over the top. It's just shindig. Don't do it. She went down from that. That was Legit. But holly almost kicked her in the face while she was down so she might've. you're allowed to kick them in the chest though. What's interesting is like if she saw that her hands were down, she could've just changed the angle a little bit and hit her.

Speaker 1:          02:58:45       He or she has the skill to do just a good rule or a bad room. I think the new one handed rule is perfect. I think that's perfect. So what does that. What does that one hands down you can still kick them, but if two hands or as soon as one hand comes up, you can kick him in the face. But don't you think? I think to get rid of it, I gouging a hitting after the bell and even growing kicks. There's zero tolerance policy where if it happens, we got to the point 100 percent up to the ref anymore because ralph's don't want to change outcome with the fight. So there they're so skewed to deduct a point. What she did to holly is ridiculous. She's been twice already. Too many fights. She hit her so hard. It changed outcome of the fight. Yeah. Holding onto one. she rocked her with a giant righthand at the end of the bell and it was bad. It was bad to the point where we all went, oh, like daniel cormier was next to me. horrible. It was the first time I did commentary with cormier and uh, an annex like the three of us together. It was really good. chromium was great. It was interesting.

Speaker 4:          02:59:40       pens will kind of judge. You got judged in the fight, but some, some judges would look at it the way you guys are looking at based on what you guys said. And some would say the right way. And then someone said, yeah. And then when others would look at it like, okay, holly was trying to take her down, look like she was avoiding the standup, couldn't take her down, she had her against the cage. It was like some judges will look at that as she doesn't want to fight standing and she's not able to get the fight to the ground. She's kinda just holding against the cage for safety. Some people look at that as losing around and not winning around. You'll know what I mean.

Speaker 1:          03:00:13       she wants to get free. It's octagon control. She wants to get free and she can't get free. That been holly's holding her against the rules. That's the only way. That's how they judge a fight. That's one way to judge a fight. The problem is is that that referee didn't want to change that come to the fight. They're so scared of the backlash. They don't. They don't do it. So you need to take that power out of their hands and go. Three was separating people when they were clenching. There's a lot more on the New York should not Have those big fire. You can't believe what you just said. I'm surprised they let him even do that title fight. They have to. It's New York state. New york state is going to appoint their own referees and a certain amount of fights and I don't know how many. I don't know how it works.

Speaker 1:          03:00:55       I don't know what the agreement is, but that's often the case when you go into state athletic commission, the Joe Mccarthy, herb dean levine, you have to some of the best in the world. Mccarthy or herb dean come out and make a statement and John John Mccarthy said, uh, they should have issued a warning bride away, like a strict warning on that first one, which I disagree with, and he goes on the second one, I would have took a point. They should take an appointment right away. Yeah, I agree. I agree for absolutely the second one, but I think the first one was so egregious crap, boom combo to take the point. I'm just not buying that, that you know, like I get the heat of the moment. You can't let that happen. I get that you're in the heat of the moment, you want to kill and destroy it and you're to random me and you've got 46 million more tie and you're a 10 time more thai champion cause you're a fucking killer.

Speaker 1:          03:01:42       She's a killer man. I mean that's what she is. But there's a rule that was the rule. You know, you know what was going on, you know what was going on. You've been in 46 fights before that. You never did that. So all of a sudden you do in the heat of the moment to see immediately, twice immediate rematch. That one $45. Shit. I think so. I would say you have to have immediate rematch too, but germane to randomly look, everybody knows the cyborg is looming in the background. You know, cyborg is always going to be there. There's no winner in this. I mean holly should have one, but you have to fight cyborg next. Enjoy that. Yeah. It's, it's to be really no winter. It's going to be really interesting to see what the choice is. Whether or not to go straight to a rematch or whether or not they let cyborg five, 45 and nightmare for her to suck down to know 40 years she's done 45 many times.

Speaker 1:          03:02:25       It's not easy. Here's the deal. As you get older and you do it more often, your body resists it more and more and more and the fact that they make her. I still maintain to this day, they should have never asked her to go to 1:40. They should never have been trying to get her to 1:35. They should have just either have a featherweight division or don't. She said she could do it though. Oh, she's so crazy. Met with her and she was like, yeah, we can do it. So that's cool man. There's so many fighters that that dropped down a couple of weight classes. That's a normal thing in mma. So big. So big brother. You get smaller and smaller people. Forty five, 48 class. She could make 45. She's done it before, but even now, like as people get older again, like there's a lot.

Speaker 1:          03:03:05       It gets tougher and tougher and they can't do it anymore. You know? Some guys just can't do it anymore. Just hendrix is exactly the johnny. This sunday we're doing a fight companion or are we doing it? Let's do it. Oh sure. You here sunday. I'm going to be in nashville. Nashville days. Thursday, friday, saturday. Everybody comes to me this weekend, but then that sunday I fly back sunday but I haven't seen my family in. Okay. We'll see him in the morning. Make waffles and I'll see if I can do what time? probably 6:00. I think 6:00 because it's 7:00. People will freak out. You got hector lumbar. Johnny hendricks? Yeah, that's what I was gonna. Say Johnny Hendricks fight and hector lombard, his first 185 pound fight that fight for johnny. It's not a good thing. No, goddamn lombard. Looks so jacked right now. I haven't seen a photo.

Speaker 1:          03:03:53       There was a photo of him like a post-training, like flexing his abs and I. He so jack them at 85. He can just eat whatever he wants to cratejoy that Johnny Hendricks hendricks is powerful and explosive and 85. He never fought at 85. He's had such a hard time sucking. It's management. Johnny five. Jesus fucking christ. One person who wants that guy. He's so jack. He's lost his last two though. Yeah, but he lost a damn fucking henderson and who you lose two before that. Oh, the old magnet magnet. Neil magazine was oppressive because he had neil magnet out. Amazing. Crazy. That was amazing. You look how tough neil magnet has to be to survive the onslaught of that first round. Like he got cry. He wants to fight with jorge mas. We don't know what the fun one, but it's in my head of him in the rankings.

Speaker 1:          03:04:49       Now he is. He got his shot at number five. Why can't you know? Neil's ranked seven or eighth. Why can't you get a shot? Here's the fight to set up mazda doll versus damien maia for the number one contender, but this fucked up to damien has already got damien's only one though. Number one it because they have to have this fucking rematch. Robbie, lots of good mac. That's a good match because he probably laughed bad blood this summer and they'll black. No bang. Help those two. Hold on. Wouldn't you rather see cowboy versus robbie lawler? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Know what? I don't want to see it anytime soon. Cowboy, take a goddamn break. How much of a time? At least six months. Six months. Six months, no training, no. In pursuit of the title right now. It's kind of chill. It's got nothing to prove. He's amazing. He's done this thing.

Speaker 1:          03:05:38       I wonder if there's a way where you can tell how long a guy should take off after they get a severe knockout. Like a wonder if there's tests that they can do where they can tell you, you know, you fuck up your meniscus, they give you a scope and they go look. Just be real easy on it. Exactly. Yeah. They have like a time limit and they can look at it and then they can do an mri afterwards. Hey, you're looking good brendon. So we're going to authorize some light training, but please take it easy. Let's see how we can do it. The reaction drill. Kenny, did they do it? Uh, it's a test reaction to in football we used to do, if you've got concussed you, uh, before the season you do the test, see how fast you are, and then if you got concussed, they make you do it.

Speaker 1:          03:06:15       See how fast you go. Whoa. And then you do it two weeks later to see what is it comprised of? Uh, it's like, it's like the, all these different objects and you have to touch it when they blink and then you've got to put patterns together. Oh wow. Oh, lIke, sorta like that. What was that game? Simon? Yay. There you go simon. But with shapes, shapes and colors, and then you'd have a certain timeline if you didn't. Forty six seconds. If you're a concussion, did in two minutes, is it two weeks later you're back to your normal. that's really interesting that we have it that way because some people would argue that there's some stupid motherfuckers out there. It doesn't matter if they're concussed, there's still going to suck at that worst than you are. Well, If they say, let me back, and guys a moron, he can't remember his own fucking name and you let him play every week.

Speaker 1:          03:06:59       We're shooting coach. I'm sure there's better ways brain we just can't get into. But that's the thing is, is not better ways. one of the scariest things about cte is they can't really, really check to see what you have until after dead. How is that the case? How come they can't see that with mris is that mri just aren't as effective yet that matter doesn't show up, does it? There are a lot of issues in the mris they did. They did an mri on a dead salmon and certain parts of the brain lit up. So you got to be very obvious. Jesus, maybe, maybe it's gone, don't necessarily tell you, uh, uh, like when they say, oh, this part of your brain lit up when you were doing this, when you were thinking about this, this a little bit misleading, it's not. Why is that like a shock that like some area of their brain, even though the body's dead might have some weird connection to the great beyond while they're sitting there at the fulton fish market on a pile of ice, like there's some part of their brain tuning into the god force of the universe and we just say it's over four men.

Speaker 1:          03:08:00       Look no gills. We already go to him. It's over and he's there and his little fucking fish head traveling through dimensions. I always wondered why when they cut your head off, when, when to kill a tree, when they cut your head off, they'd see people mouthing prayers while they were still doing it. Good. So as you are you conscious of your brain as oxygen, you get your head cut off right away, but who are you looking? Is it possible for your head and your brain to be looking at your headless body? For sure. No, it is. Here's the deal because when you head gets cut off, the blood's not pumping through your head. It's gonna. Stay there. Okay. Your second. Just some of it's going to spill out. whatever's there is going to carry oxygen to your fucking stupid brain for as long as you stay alive and it's only gonna be a few seconds, so if you're lying there and there's still blood in your brain, you're looking over at your head, you're like, oh my god, and coming out of your mouth because you're not attached to your lungs anymore.

Speaker 1:          03:08:55       Yeah, that's what they did. Shot in the heart. You die like right away, like you have all those. No, you don't. You don't die right away. You guys really quickly. Your body takes a few seconds. it takes a few seconds, but if he had a shotgun, just blow a hole through your chest. You would. You wouldn't be alone. In Texas. You still get the oxygenated blood in your brain. Although when you get your, your, your head blown off the road when you're going to be severed that quickly. It doesn't knock you out though sometimes. I'm sure in some cases there were there they said that the the size of the head would still be mouthing prayers as it was. I can only imagine, man. It was just always a well known that when you her head cut off to be saying things, but I bet there's a book called a history of the guillotine. Could you have imagined this doctor? Imagine being a town square. They decided some fucking pickpocket needs to get his head caught off in front of everybody and get to see. That was the containment. I know, but how crazy is that? Imagine watching

Speaker 2:          03:09:54       that big thing dropped down on someone's head and the fucking head hit the basket. We're still in to it. Those ices vetoes are bigger than effort. It's more views than ever. Didn't Mississippi? Just it. Was it Mississippi? They just passed a law allowing firing squad executions. Again, that's some redneck shit. Sipping. I think it might be Mississippi. Every message y'all. Are they having problems getting the medicine or the. Yeah, so they just plenty of bullets down there. Fuck it mean it is kind of weird that there's like a good way in a bad way to kill. People still have public executions and they had the guy, they're really the sword and he comes out and you brought out and I believe you're there, you're, you're, somebody says a blessing over you. You were able to say some prayers and then I believe my dad witnessed this a couple times.

Speaker 2:          03:10:43       It's a public thing. And you squat down. Dad witnessed this. Yeah, because there's officers right there. You get on your knees. So he's just sat up there. And why did he go out and watch it? He could actually see some of it from his window. Apparently his office window but prime spot. But yes, he was there and he saw it and my mother saw it too. And so the guy would be his hands, I believe were tied behind. His back is forced to squat and what they'll do is if they're good, they'll jab you a little bit. So you stiffen and then boom, really quickly the head comes off. so they jab me in the back and they say your body so you don't sway. So here, you know, and then it comes right off. Or they still do. They still have the death penalty in California.

Speaker 2:          03:11:19       Um, last ad they do, but they haven't killed anybody here in quite a while. We're these the kill people with gas chambers is the most evil, not extra city electricity when it doesn't work. What's weird is that like real violence, like bullets is what we frowned upon the real effective way. Like shooting someone that had put a gun. Right. Blow it away. Yeah. The most cheapest, easiest way for some. That's ridiculous. It should attend humane for sure. What works. But so a gas chamber is supposed to be humane. I'm saying shoot him. It's obviously cheaper than the way to go. Are they doing, are they using the gas chamber because I try to be humane or, or are they trying to be evil? Get figure out a way to do it where it seems more systematic than a bullet will also be more injections. So I think now lethal injection is the most common.

Speaker 2:          03:12:08       Was the gas chamber, is that, was it to be humane in California or is it to be an evil and we're going to get revenge on you? Kill. I believe that public execution, as it was done in this country, whether it was through anything, whether it was hanging, whether it was electric chair, whether it was gas chamber, there was always the idea that it was supposed to be done at least by the state in a dignified manner, not enough, not, not in a way that constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. For example, what's, what's uh, so you would never talk to somebody to death. You try to make it as quickly as possible, as systematic as possible. The state says you have to die. You give your life up for the crime. You committed an eye for an eye and that's done in a very sort of antiseptic, systematic way,

Speaker 1:          03:12:52       but you fucked up. You know, you fucked up when you're strapped to a chair and you're looking up and all the people that were friends with the person who killed are staring at you and they're about to cook. You go about to fucking screw this electrical down on your bed. You can't listen to even more fucked up, but you can't see them. I think the reason they don't shoot you in the head is to that you know the family. If the family wants to have an open casket, funeral and all that goes out the window if you killed. No, it's. We know what's really fucked up. The whole thing was that they give you your choice of what you get to eat. Oh yeah. You get a last meal. You get to pick your last meal. Oh yeah, you can fuck you in ell sandwich. We keys and shit yet man. Kevin, nice beer and ice cold beer with it. This guy asked me, how would you like to go if you had a choice? Electric chair, gas chamber or lethal injection. Packable greens, so that in there as well. Lethal injection because they put you to sleep. first 50 will run. What about between electric chair or gas chamber? Fuck, I don't know. Electric. You have to choose one. Fuck. Come on. Get off the table. You, you, you go into convulsions. You foam at the mouth.

Speaker 1:          03:14:06       I like how they have to hit you again. Sometimes hit them again with the electric chair. It didn't work and they tried it twice. It didn't work on the dude and now they can't kill them. Do you bleed to death? We talked about this before. Those killings and faces of death. Some of them are definitely. They're all real creation. Some of them are definitely real. There was a really, really real one where they have this guy from the middle east. They tied them to two different trucks and pull them apart. That shit's real documentary. It was on youtube that set the whole. It was about the guys who put it together. They're being interviewed. The guys, they'll do everything and they show you how they did the monkey brain. They said, oh, that's definitely fake. It's all fake. All of it. Where they eddie, but it had.

Speaker 1:          03:14:53       Hold on a second 80. That's not true because like that fucking judge shot himself on television. What's that guy's name from that song? Hey man. Nice shot dwyer, dwyer. That guy is in faces of death and that guy really shut the fucking ones. I don't remember which one he was in. I saw something with the guys who put it together, that directors or they put it together, they're talking about different people in the scenes and they're going through it, but there's a guy who jumped off and he definitely. That was a lot of people that dIed. I think the whole thing was faked.

Speaker 1:          03:15:22       It all knows my child. No, they didn't see. They had some real footage and some fake foot is. They have some real live events. I saw a documentary about each scene. Oh, then we'll just chalk that up. Is true. It was on youtube though. I do. I'll admit that will lend it to know that it's already 6:30 for got sick. I take care of my dog. Take your dog. So sunday fight companion, 6:00 PM pacific time for travis browne vs derrick lewis and hector lombard versus Johnny Hendricks. Those are actually two pretty good fIghts. That should be interesting. So that sunday, hugh fox. Bye everybody.
