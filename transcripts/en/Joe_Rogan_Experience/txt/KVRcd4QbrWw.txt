Speaker 1:          00:04:19       experience

Speaker 2:          00:04:20       podcast. So a few years back, my friend Gordon has to,

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       who's a, a guy that I met on the Internet, said, Hey, do you want to have dinner with Hixon Gracie? So I said, fuck yeah man, if you are a Jujitsu practitioner, um, there's, it's very rare in a sport. I guess there's a few sports, like if you think bike racing, you think, you think Lance Armstrong, unfortunately now, but that's the name, but the universal name that gets thrown about in Jujitsu, there's the last name, which is gracie. And then once you get to know Jujitsu and you understand Jujitsu and you get, you start training, everybody always wants to know who's the best, who's the best, who's the best universally regarded as the all time best is your father, your father, Hicks, and Gracie. This is not much debate amongst Jujitsu people. There's debate as to who's the best right now. But I talked to Henzel about this one time and uh, and Enzo just shook his head and he goes, he's a motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       It goes, he's a motherfucker. His is laughing. It's like he's the best. He's the best. And when a guy like henslow's says something, I just listened, you know, so what is it? That's when I met you, you're, you were with your dad. And we went and had some dinner and then we went back to your house and we watched some fights, which was amazing to have your dad break down what, what guys are doing wrong and what's wrong with their positioning, what's wrong with their approach and what his approach is. And for me as a student of martial arts and as a fan of martial arts, it was a huge honor, you know, and you were like 16 or 17 back then. Yeah. Something like that that you were into rap music and all kinds of different shit. And so from that, um, you know, I've, I've run into a few times over the years when, when hoists fought Matt Hughes and a couple other times you've become yourself, like one of the most prominent Jujitsu fighters in the world today.

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       Um, and that's so cool to see. It's so cool to see a young kid with aspirations and then put in the work. And it's also cool to see the son of a great man become a great man himself, which is very difficult and it doesn't really happen that often. You know, a lot of times the sign of a great man lives in the shadow of his father and sort of fall short. But, uh, you and your young life, you're 25 now, 25 and your young life, you've already carved out a great name in Jujitsu with your own accomplishments. You're widely considered to be amongst the very best in the world at Jujitsu. And how does that feel?

Speaker 3:          00:07:17       It feels great, you know, now finally, after so long of, you know, because I knew when I was a little kid that I was going to have to be a fighter or be a martial artist and have to, you have to really be as much as my dad wants to make it feel like he didn't put pressure on me. And, and you know, he did. You know, people say he teaches invisible Jujitsu. Well, I'll talk about invisible pressure, you know, like, yeah, like at an early age when first when I'm a little kid, I can kind of always see, you know, how much my dad trains and how much he, how big he is a part of what he does in the world and how much people respect him and how much recognition you get. So from a very early age, you know, you want to replicate that and you want to do, you know, what your father does if it feels like cool to you.

Speaker 3:          00:08:11       And it's always been really cool to me. Of course when I was a younger up until like 12 years old, I used to skate a lot in Jujitsu is kind of whatever. But I knew that in the future that that was what I was going to have to do no matter what. So, you know, it came to a point where I kind of put skateboarding aside and uh, I had gotten hurt skateboarding a bunch of times and I was like, you know what, I don't, I don't care about skateboarding as much as I do Jujitsu. I'm not going to be as good as a skateboarder as I can be with to which this kind of all clicked for me a one day with my brother, you know, we, we were talking and everything and this was like one of the last conversations we had and, and he was always like, you know, you could, whatever you do in life, you do it one percent, you know, you, you, you do it the best you can do it.

Speaker 3:          00:08:57       You know, if you're going to be a dentist, you'd be the best dentist. If you can be a skateboarder, you'd be the best skateboarder. But the only difference is right here, you have an opportunity to do Jujitsu and you have the best road. You have the best dad. As a coach. You have the best at all, the tools you need to really be the best you can be. And it would be stupid for you not to really take advantage of this. And that kind of happened when I was 12. And um, after my brother passed I kind of really, really put effort into that and I kind of really made it my mission to make him proud and to make my dad proud and I kind of knew what I had in my hands and, but at that age you never know how good you're going to get and you never know what's gonna happen. So I just kind of dedicated myself, dedicated myself. And then, you know, when, when we met each other I was still fully dedicated but I still hadn't achieved, um, you know, anything really. And I think like with the, with,

Speaker 3:          00:09:55       for me, like in life when you, when you, when you, when you try, when you try, when you try, when you try is you only get what you think you're going to get way later. You know, like I put so much dedication into it by 16 years old. But I hadn't seen any of the, of the fruits and I hadn't seen any, any necessarily like big reward from it, you know. So it was basically just the passion of being able to train Jujitsu and being able to, to do what I knew was my mission. And

Speaker 4:          00:10:23       um,

Speaker 3:          00:10:26       I kind of lost my track a little bit of what I was going to say, but, uh, so basically from, from that age, you know, it was, it was, it was always like I knew that I had to do that, you know, as much as, as much as things would always. Like there's always little things that go in your head that you might want to like change your or whatever. But in my mind it was never an option not to, to do Jujitsu and never an option not to be the best I can be and to be the best in the world. That was always like where I was going to be. I never had a plan b. I never had a, Oh, I was just going to try this and then if this doesn't work out, I'd never had that from you. As always, this was where I put my energy.

Speaker 3:          00:11:03       And so I kind of just put my energy into it. And um, you know, from a very early age, from 12, 13, 14, everybody knew me as crone Hixson Hixson zone or you're hitting. So I already kind of hated that. I hated being called Hixon son. I hate it being called Hawkins over. I hated being called somebody that I wasn't, you know, and like being recognized for something that I didn't do somebody other than who you are. Yeah. So I kind of always knew that if I wanted to to climb out of this name and climb out of the shadow, I would have to work twice as hard. And it was, it was going to be a real obstacle for me to get past this. And that's what I, in my mind, that was my ending goal no matter what I want it to be my own man. I wanted to be able to represent myself and my family and everything and I wanted to be able to be remembered as somebody who kept it going, kept the legacy going.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       For folks who don't have any experience in martial arts, I'll try to explain this to people. There's, when you really stop and think about the history of martial arts, there's the most important moment, in my opinion of modern martial arts was hoists gracie entering into the UFC in 1993 when hoists gracie entered into the UFC, we saw for the first time in a real application, we saw what we had always wanted to see in the movies. A smaller man with technique defeating larger men, a smaller man. You're utilizing leverage in utilizing his skills to defeat everybody in front of them. And from that we got introduced to the name Gracie. We got introduced to your father. We got introduced to Leo, your grandfather, who was the most important figure in all of martial arts. For folks who don't know martial arts for the longest time, for thousands of years, there was all this debate about what was the best style, whether it was a karate or whether it was Kung Fu.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       There was all these different people that swore that their master could defeat a thousand men and unarmed combat. No one knew what the real deal was until the UFC came along and that was when the world got introduced to the name Gracie. What is it like growing up in that environment and when did you realize that your family was different than everybody else? I mean, you come from the most important family in the history of martial arts. Martial arts is what every man wants to be able to do. Every man wants to be able to find himself. Every man wants to be able to kick ass. The most important family, in my opinion, is the Gracie family. There's no comparison.

Speaker 3:          00:13:42       Yeah, I mean you don't really, you don't really think about it like that when you're in the gracie family, you kind of just born into this thing where it's all about martial arts and it's all about dedication and discipline and you come from, you know, tradition. So you don't really think about from the outside point of view. You know, for me it's just been a very normal thing to train Jujitsu in the living room to talk about how to defend yourself, to talk about, you know, the average and health and all this. This is just very normal for me. It was never knew. He seen somebody get in a fight. It's more interesting than it is. Like Oh, a shock. So it's never been nothing big. But you know, the older I get the more I kind of realized how big what I'm a part of and how important it is and that only motivates me more to really step up and be able to keep this going because, you know, my grandfather was a, was a crazy dude, you know, he would challenge anybody and his goal was to represent just to, and to prove g two is the best and that guy weighed 135 pounds and he was not a physically fit dude.

Speaker 3:          00:14:44       And you know, it goes to show how powerful his spirit was. And, and what he did, he changed the world. You know, he, he made it so that a weak person could defeat a bigger opponent and you know, with my dad, with him leading everything and taking charge and trying to spread, you know, he was a very, very important person in all of our lives. You know, he made it possible for, for a weak person to be able to defeat a bigger opponent to, you know, have the self confidence to believe in something other than physical form. You have to believe in the leverage. And, and he, you know, he, his theory and his, what he put onto his children is what gave not only the leverage and the technique, but also put physical abilities on top of it. So my dad got all the theory of the leverage and being a weak person and how to survive if you're weaker.

Speaker 3:          00:15:35       But my dad wasn't. He wasn't weak. He was strong. So he used the technique and the leverage and the strength on top of it, which created a monster. You know, he created, you know, somebody who is physically strong but trains like as if he was a very lightweight of not a physically strong person. So he's able to really maximize his potential and me coming up into this, you know, again, like it's always just been a fun thing and something to be a part of and it only kind of really clicked that, that, you know, the older you get, the more we realize how part of it. And sometimes I kind of look outside of myself and I kind of take, man, I'm in a, this is crazy, you know, this is like a movie, you know, like my grandfather was this legend and my dad is this legend. And, and you know, like I'm the only son and, and you know, it's like a movie, like an hour. Not only am I the only son, but I'm also being able to be able to prove that I did still in the genes and it's still a powerful thing that we're dealing with. So I, I, I'm overwhelmed sometimes. I kind of looked back and I very grateful for the situation and obviously God put, put me in this situation and put us in the situation for a reason.

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       Now I'm most recently you won the Abudabi submission championships, which in the world of grappling is the most prestigious Nogi submission title in the world. And for folks no gooey, there's two different types of Jujitsu, Jujitsu with the Kimono, you know, the, it looks like a judo uniform, that's the g, and then there's Jujitsu with no gate, which is a much like wrestling or the type of techniques that you would see in the UFC because they're not grabbing clothes very different, very different. And as far as, uh, the, the pace of things, but Abu Dhabi's the, this, the most prestigious championship in the world. So you accomplished like you hit the top of the mountain, you know, you, uh, you became much like the others in the Gracie family before you became a champion. What, what was that feeling like?

Speaker 3:          00:17:41       It's a great feeling, you know, it's just no complaints about that. Um, and you know, I think this, in my perfect world, in my dream, if you would've asked me if I would have wanted the Abu Dhabi, I would have said, of course I would have wanted it probably much more times by this age if you would ask me when I was 15 years old. But, you know, in life it's not so easy, you know. And, and for me in my life, everything was easy, you know, purple belt was easy, Brown belt was easy, so I never had had this obstacle of challenges and I never really had to dig deep and figure out what, what, what is, what am I about really? So my first one, everything was undefeated as a purple and brown belt. And then my first match has a black belt. I lost, I got my ass whooped and it was a mix of a bunch of things that I came to my conclusion of why that happened.

Speaker 3:          00:18:33       But in the end I think that I was just not mentally ready for that. And I let all these outside things affect me. And anyways, I lost the fight and really dug deep to see what I was going to do with my life and, and you know, after you, you realize what happens and how you can prevent it and how you going to get better. Then you start to really work hard for what you want to get in. And I, after that moment I kind of started to really become a man and really understand sacrifice and how to work hard. And if you want something in life, you can't depend on anybody for it and you can't ask anybody for it. You have to go in and really work hard to get it in. And that I think I started to really become a man as a black belt.

Speaker 3:          00:19:16       And that's when I really put my energy into it. And you know, I've, I've lost tournaments, I've won lots of tournaments and sometimes I lose because of points. And I, I've never really been about points. But, um, ultimately I feel like now after so long of being on this journey of this hard path, I finally kind of started to find myself in the past couple of years and I'm finally getting a, getting the results that I've, I've wanted a long time ago and I realized a lot more about life and about myself then then if I would have just won everything. So that's a great situation to be in. And um, I work really hard for this first place, a metal. So it's gonna be hard for somebody to take it from me.

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       That is an interesting thing, isn't it? That you need defeat in order to really inspire you to the greatness inside of you. You need to feel adversity to rise to the occasion. Of course you fought was Sergio Moron who's a very, very good black belt and he's fighting in the UFC now, one of the best Jujitsu guys in the UFC. Really fantastic technique. That's a, that's a guy that you're connected to forever now because of that, I thank

Speaker 3:          00:20:23       him in my mind. I think I'm a lot and I got promoted like two weeks before the world championships and my dad's always like, life is about surprises in about challenges and he's like, you want this black belt? And I was, had submitted 55 straight and like, yeah, I want this challenge. Let's see. The little did I know it was going to fucking shake my world and um, but I, I'm grateful for and it's great, you know, I have no, no complaints in our and I wouldn't have changed anything.

Speaker 1:          00:20:53       What is it like growing up being in your, you're going into this world of martial arts with a guy like that as your father. Like what kind of advice did he

Speaker 3:          00:21:03       best advice? I mean that's, I think that's what made me who I am and be able to really become my own man at this age is the advice that my dad gave me was such a, you know, it's easy in life to be drifted by things and to be drifted by what people say and what you personally think and say and feel. So, you know, always been able to have. My Dad gave me a good advice and be able to be my father and to teach me how to be a man, not just Jujitsu, not just being good at technique, but being able to be a good person, being humble and being, doing the best that you can. Um, I think that's what, what allows me to become great at Jujitsu and what allows me to become great at whatever I do. And you know, for me, I never really had that much training sessions with my father.

Speaker 3:          00:21:49       People think he was there coaching me everyday training on the sidelines with water bottles and all this shit that never existed in. But one thing I do is I am very grateful for is when I started to train really hard at like 12 years old. My Dad was in training at the academy and my brother had passed and he was just on his own search, you know, so he disappeared from the academy. But every night I'd come home and he would be there and he wouldn't ask me how was school. He would ask me how was training and I would tell them, oh man, I got smashed or this happened, or I got stuck in this position, so at the dinner table or at the front of the TV, he would give me an answer to my problem and he would give me advice, you know, whether it'd be about Jujitsu technique or whether it be about what happened here or how to, how to react to what this person did. And so my learning magic Jitsu really growth happened over food, over, you know, watching tv, you know, that's where I really learned what I learned and then went back and trained at the academy and practice what I was taught. So, um, most of my Jujitsu I learned through verbal, like just like conversations at the dinner table and being able to, do, you know, from that really

Speaker 1:          00:23:08       your dad had a, that approach which was different than voices approach and different than many other people's approach. This approach of mastering the physical as well as mastering technique. You know, your dad is an accomplished Yogi, is very physically strong. That was one thing that really separated him from a lot of the other people in the Gracie family.

Speaker 3:          00:23:29       Yeah, I definitely think so. I think what separates my dad from not only everybody in the family but from most fighters is his, not only his mental strength, but his spiritual strength and he's a very spiritual person. And um, I think that's huge, you know, especially now in my life, realizing how important that is a part of me, I think being spiritually connected to yourself and connected to whatever is above us is, is, is something that really sometimes things you can't explain happen when, when you're that connected. So my dad has always been a very spiritual person. You know, he's, he's doing all the things that he does for his purpose, you know, if you talked to him for about money, money is just secondary to, to what his beliefs are. And so as opposed to some people who they will go against what they believe in or they'll go against their spirituality for a paycheck. So my dad, you know, never, never did that, you know, he never took, you know, sponsors for, for beer or whatever, you know, because he doesn't believe that that's necessarily the image that he wants to go with. And I think he's a very spiritual person and he and I still, even today I'm like surprised with how much of a, how much honor and, and you know, like, you know, it's just weird to describe how, how, how good he he's done for Jujitsu. Really

Speaker 1:          00:24:56       the growing up in that atmosphere. That's an incredible role model to have that as your dad, this guy that's got such a high moral standard and he, how did he get into yoga? Because that's another thing that really separated him from a lot of other martial artists and really opened up a lot of people's eyes to the beneficial aspects of yoga.

Speaker 3:          00:25:16       So he got into yoga with this guy, Orlando Kearney, who is a Brazilian, a yoga guy who basically his whole theory was breathing with your movement. So being able to. Because Yoga is usually you breathe in, you stop and you kind of breathe in. You just do your movements and your kind of just static, but he kind of incorporated breathing with movement and being able to like, he would be like, oh, I'm gonna, I'm an animal. I'm a tiger. So he would walk like a tiger and you breathe and you look and he would visualize himself like a tiger. So he started to be able to to not only do that as animal, but he started to transfer it over to Jujitsu and being able to. Because this theory, the guy's theory, Orlando counties theory was animals are perfect, you know, they move and they breathe and they don't get tired and everything is in sync.

Speaker 3:          00:26:06       So his whole theory was, the better you can do that, the more you can replicate that, the more you're going to be able to be efficient with your, with whatever you do. And the yoga for my data I guess was a huge, huge part. And, you know, since a little kid he kind of always told me about breathing and yoga and I never cared and just kind of brushed it off until when you get older and you start really having difficulties when you really start searching and really start having problems, then I started to start to breathe more and now I think that the breathing is a huge part of my, my myself and it's a huge part of my growth and it's a huge part of me being able to be in, be in tune with what I'm doing. So I wouldn't take away that for anything. And I think that's probably one of the biggest, you know, additions to my, to myself that I could have added.

Speaker 1:          00:27:00       Yeah. The Yoga breathing is a thing. Pranayama, is that what they call it? I don't know. Uh, yeah. Prada Yama is a, is a huge part of, uh, what a lot of people are missing when it comes to the idea of yoga. They don't, they don't understand that deep breathing and breathing exercises are there. They're very difficult to do. It's very difficult. And it becomes like a factor of motivate you can do this shit to write shitty dad does with the abdomen. Of course. Yeah, I do that. Um, what is that, that, that crazy video if folks who haven't seen this is a documentary called choke. It's an amazing documentary and it was back when Hickson was competing in Japan. Valley Tudos was like 1995 or [inaudible] 94 95. And he, there's a video that really like opened up a lot of people's eyes of him doing yoga and moving his stomach around with these weird stomach exercises. What, what is that? So your diaphragm.

Speaker 3:          00:28:02       Well, I can kind of explained. But basically your, your, your lungs are like, oh, like bottles, they start screaming at the top and then they, they fill up to be big at the bottom. So when you normally breathe you, you're only filling up a small portion of your lungs. And when you get scared or when you have anxiety, everything is shortens your breath and then screwed. Yeah. So that's what normally happens. That's what's very normal for humans. And being able to breathe through your diaphragm is filling your lungs to the, to the Max and, and being able to control that is so your diaphragm is a muscle and you need to train it like a pushup or like anything you do, you need to train your muscles. So the more you train your muscle, the more control you have over it. And that is just being able to have the highest control of your diaphragm muscle. And when you have that kind of control, you can filter your body out easier as opposed to like right now, if you don't train it, you can't even like use your diaphragm. So

Speaker 5:          00:29:04       sure

Speaker 3:          00:29:07       that just that simple movement is, is it difficult, uh, is a difficult thing to do. You have to train to do that. And then being able to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       So what you're doing as you're breathing in deep and then you're pulling your diaphragm in

Speaker 3:          00:29:27       that actual exercise that you do is you exhale, you have no oxygen in your lungs, and then you use your. Then you just kind of massage your diaphragm and you kind of just have that kind of control so you're just practicing like how to move it because when you're training and you're tired and if you have to think about to breathe, its already too much so you should just have it. It's like a one of those things that start fire. When you push out, it's when you open it up, it fills up naturally, so if you learn how to breathe through your diaphragm, you naturally are going to filter way more oxygen and you're going to have a. everything's going to be better. I like that's the reason why I can train as long as I can train and why I can stay clear. And normally a lot of people they they get cast out or they or they feel like they're going to pass out or or they get anxiety. So being able to breathe correctly is a huge part of my growth. I think.

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       Learn that from your dad. The diaphragm breathing. What does he call it? What it. Is there a name for it?

Speaker 3:          00:30:25       No, because we're not necessarily like yoga crazy, you know, super into a specific type. I think I just use yoga for my benefit and I'm not like a ride or die of a certain type of yoga. I just kind of use yoga for my, for, for what I do for Jujitsu and how to become a better person so I don't know exactly what the name is or anything. It's just being able to breathe and being able to use my diaphragm and being able to stay calm and learn how to manage my energy. So that has helped me not only with Jujitsu but anything new I do or if I'm going to come here on an interview, if I start to get nervous, you know, I breathe in, it goes away. So the breathing has helped me become, is given me an opportunity to do everything that I can do.

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       Yeah. I do a lot of deep breathing exercises, um, in a sensory deprivation tank. And one of the things that I do is a long breathing. Like I'll, I'll have an inhale that lasts a minute and then the exhale last a minute and is a, it's a discipline, like you have to force yourself to maintain that pace because you get to a panic. He just want to fuck this, but you can stay alive and keep doing it. You can do it and you can still stay alive and keep doing it, but it's, it becomes this weird thing where your body starts freaking out. It's like breathe, motherfucker, stop breathing out, breathe, breathe, breathe in, breathe out for a minute and then breathe in for a minute. Breathe out for a minute

Speaker 3:          00:31:49       there. Yeah, there is different types of exercises. I know, like sometimes if I'm, if I'm trying to stay calm, I'm going to breathe slower. If I'm trying to get energy, I'm going to breathe faster. If I'm trying to maintain a high pace, I'm going to, you know, it's like a car when you drive a car, if you're driving slow,

Speaker 6:          00:32:04       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:32:07       but if you drive fast cars, so you need like when I train, if I'm in a very intense, I'll breathe loud. Like so to make sure I'm getting enough oxygen to, to keep up with what I'm doing physically. So I definitely am very grateful for being able to have that a part of my life. And it's cool, man. It's really good.

Speaker 1:          00:32:29       I only experienced that breathing for the first time in Jujitsu after a lifelong martial arts. I'd never heard anybody breathe like that until I started training and uh, at John jocks academy and hearing people, you know, hearing like black belts roll here guys, really what the fuck are they doing it? But yeah, it was a white belt. I was walking around with everybody doing it was, it was such a strange thing. And John Jack explained to me that, you know, when, when you breathe out you will definitely breathe in, force yourself to breathe out and then get rid of all the car. Yeah. The bad air in your body and breathe in fresh oxygen. And that the forcing it out is something that people don't concentrate enough on.

Speaker 3:          00:33:08       Yeah. When you normally want to breathe, you breathe in and then that only fills up that top part, you know. So if you, I mean is there a lot about it, but I think it's definitely a huge part of my success today and it's also a huge part of my dad's.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       Yeah. I would recommend to anybody who is interested in this to go and just look up various yoga, breathing videos on youtube and just follow along with them and you'd get a great benefit from that and it's something that people don't really think too much about, about concentrating and controlling your breathing. And there's also a great meditative quality to that too. I'm one of the first breathing exercises I ever did when I was really young. So many told me that you can meditate by just concentrating only on your breath, just not, not even a breathing exercise, but just breathe in good and out bad and think of nothing but those things. I think as you're breathing in, you're taking in oxygen and as you're breathing out, you're just pumping out in with the good out the bad. I just think of those things and think only of your breath and by forcing yourself to concentrate on that, it sort of filters out everything in your life and it all becomes like background. Everything else sort of calms down and you get this feeling after you're done doing that. If you do that for an hour, everything else sort of like the. The importance of things that you thought was so big and so crazy in your life and all this is fucked up, but what am I going to do about that? It seems less important after that.

Speaker 3:          00:34:32       Yeah. I think the breathing keeps me in touch with my spirituality and being able to breathe. Like I've gotten into some, some super gnarly trances where I'm, you know, really connected to whatever is above us and that's through the breathing so that like being able to breathe and like after your training or during your training or however you like to do. It has given me like a huge, huge benefits and I, I connect myself too when I'm training, like being able to breathe puts me in a, in a very animal like state where it's like me against you. It's not, I'm not thinking about what you're doing. I'm not thinking about, oh, I am thinking about what you're doing, but I'm not thinking about things. It's more of like a feeling and that feeling. The closer you are to that feeling, it gives you almost above your mind above you can actually think it's more like a of a, of a animal instinct and that like since I started to really incorporate the breathing and the connecting it to my Jujitsu, it's given me way more.

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       Well, there's a, a whole group of people that use breathing. It's called holotropic breathing and they use it to achieve psychedelic states. They have achieved psychedelic states for sure. Like what's the most intense state you've ever achieved while breathing?

Speaker 3:          00:35:54       Oh, I mean I think a couple of times after training when I'm really exhausted, like I'm very, very, very, very exhausted to a point where you want me to stop training like 30, 40 minutes before and then after I'll do a breathing, breathing in and out and I'll just keep going into the breathing and as I, as I start to breathe and start to get more in tune, there's nothing exists and it's just me and I can almost see the particles in the air and I can. It's just like a sensation that, you know, I've only felt a couple of times but I definitely have gotten in touch with like, it's very, it's very intense to like to get to that point where you just feel. It's almost like you can see the air. It's almost like you can see and like all these little things and it's pretty intense.

Speaker 3:          00:36:40       So I've gotten to that point a couple of times or three or four points were where I feel like, wow, I can actually feel the energy. And it was a great thing, man. I'm like, after if you feel high and you smile and you're like, man, this is crazy and crazy that you can, how much we're capable of as humans and how much will do is so big and you know, you think about the actual world and how the actual world is, is like this planet. We should be in touch with something above, you know, we should be able to in touch with how this got to this or how there's Waterhouse Salami. All these things that we today are like, oh no, that's this, that's this or this is that. It's so much more. You can explain shit, you know. So it's like really? I go a lot more about my feelings these days than anything else. You know, over my rational decision. I kind of try to feel how things are. I feel how people are feel, how I feel, how I, how I feel about this training session or whatever it is. I kind of try to go more about feeling because that's never failed me before.

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       So this, these breathing techniques and he states that you achieve the, they give you a sort of a fresh perspective. They give you a perspective of recognizing the greatness and the beauty and the magnitude of life that sometimes escapes us and our normal everyday path where you just sort of take for granted that that's a door. This is the house go outside, that's the sky. It becomes normal, but these breathing techniques and the just the psychedelic states that you achieve from them allow you to almost like a reset button.

Speaker 3:          00:38:16       Yeah, it's pretty cool, man. I really recommend breathing in for anybody who is doing anything in their life, whether it'd be something you know, whether you're trying to get through a tough situation, whether you're arguing with your girlfriend or whether you're stuck in traffic or whether you're trying to stay calm while somebody was trying to choke you. The breathing has given me and it took a long time. It's not like, oh boom. I started breathing. I got it. It's actually took a long time before you really value it because when my dad started telling me this, I kind of didn't care and I was just like, whatever, whatever. He's got all kinds of. She's always telling me Shit. So, but after, you know, the older I got, the more I kind of started to have stress and have to deal with this pressure and then I kind of started to do it every once in a while and then now it's at a point where the past few years I've really stepped it up a lot and it's really a big part of my, my, my training and my and everything. I do. So even when I skateboard now, I'm like trying to breathe and I'm trying to like, keep, keep everything in tune so I can do the best I can do

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       the last time. Um, when, when we had a dinner together, your dad was still talking about competing. He had, he had stopped, but he was still thinking about fighting. He was still, there was people, you know, there's always a threat on the underground is one of the big themes in the underground is Hixon by Armbar. They would, they would joke around about anything, you know, who'd win Godzilla versus King Kong kicks in by arm bar was, it is, it was just an inside joke when someone, something could be answered. Someone just right Hixon via arm bar.

Speaker 3:          00:39:54       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:39:55       did, did he have any regrets that he didn't fight any of the big name guys that he didn't continue? We were talking about him fighting fader. He, you know, he was, uh, he was saying that if he did fight someone who would want to fight fate or who is the champion of pride at the time.

Speaker 3:          00:40:10       Yeah, I think that, I don't know if there's any regrets or anything. I think it was just a time in my dad's life where, well, right after my brother passed, you know, he, he got offered to fight Sakharova and it was a big, big payday and it was a big, big fight. And of course my dad being the man he is, he wasn't going to just leave the family to go train for a fight and take his selfish needs into consideration. So he kind of just took her, which turned away the fight and kind of gave his energy to the family and try to do what he could to help everybody. And after that time passes, there's still like some, some people wanting to have them fired and he was maybe five Fado and maybe with this. But I think after that moment he kind of just, the time passed, you know, his fighting that time had passed for his, even though he was still possibility for him to fight, I think that he necessarily.

Speaker 3:          00:41:07       He was ready to fight and as a man he was ready to die. But I don't think that necessarily it was. I'm glad that he didn't fight after that. I'm glad that he, you know, it happened the way it did and he retired the way he did and he still has the greatest image. So I think that it's, I think it's a great thing that it went away. Did you know, like, my dad is a great fighter and he's great mind and that separates him from everybody else, but I think that everything went fine even though whatever happened, I think that he didn't need to fight. He didn't need to prove anything to anybody else. And even if he did fight, win or lose, that would have been his hammer his best, you know? So, um, I think my dad did enough from when he was 15, when he was 40.

Speaker 3:          00:41:56       He proved enough people wrong. He did what he had to do. He was ready, you know, you don't know where. It's like nobody knows what it's like to be having to be ready to fight, to die at any moment. Motherfuckers come in your academy and they challenge you. You got this guy telling him that he doesn't believe in Jujitsu. So nobody knows what that feels like to have to be ready. Everybody now, Oh, you want a fight? Okay, give me three months or six months. I'm going to train for my fighter, but to be, have to be ready at any time, any moment, no matter what. You know, that's where my dad lives, like from 15 years old to 40 years old. So he needed to retire, he needed to be able to not be ready. He needed to be able to release and I think that was the best thing for him and it was the best thing for his life.

Speaker 3:          00:42:36       And now I think it's all good and it's just a very tough situation, man. I lot of people don't know how serious my dad took. Of course people know how serious but you only see the glory, you know, you don't see how he really is as a man and how, how you, you really make it your life, you know, and fighting is a big thing is probably the hardest thing to do. And you know, that guy was ready anytime, anywhere where approved, very approved. The family was, was better ready to prove that he was better and you know, that's what gives me inspiration to, to wake up in the mornings and do what I do. And I only really do it because of him and my brother. I only really compete because of him and my brother. I only, the more my motivation is to keep, keep him happy and to keep this family remember instead of just, Oh, the gracies work good when nobody knew Jujitsu, but now everybody doesn't.

Speaker 3:          00:43:29       They're not the nowhere. So I, I think it's important for my life. I've already kind of am willing to sacrifice my life and willing to sacrifice whatever I feel and how I like things to be for the bigger objective, which is to keep my father and my grandfather, you know, alive and well in their legacy. Will you there for any of those challenge matches? When Anjo came to the, uh, I was. So Joe, I was a little kid at that time. I was like maybe four or five years old and um, I remember the days happening and it's happening. I wasn't there at the specific advice because not even my dad was at the time and my dad was at home in breakfast and the guys came and called them. I was like, dude, because in Japan were invading the academy. So my dad got up and like got ready to go to the academy and that was like another thing like you just waked up that I was going to be another day for him to go on a bike ride and then motherfuckers outside the academy ready to challenge you with all this press and you know, if you lose, it's just as like a real fight, you know, for folks don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:44:31       That's

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       one historical match that apparently a gordon has just said he seen is a Yogi and Joe who is a pro wrestler and MMA fighter in Japan just showed up at the academy and Hixon took him into a back room and beat the fucking shit out of him. And Your Dad, you know, he, he came out and Yohji Andrew's face faces, photos of his face online. We can see what your dad did to him. But I've heard all sorts of stories about the way he choked him and all sorts of, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:45:06       True story, true story. I seen the video many times and I used to bring my friends over when I was a kid and show them the fights and everything is in Joe's face up on that screen. So the story behind that as he came into the academy and, and it's a long story, but I'll kind of sum it up, but basically came in to challenge my dad and my dad was like, okay, fine. So he shows up at the academy and they kicked all the press out because he didn't want them to film in case whatever happened. So he kicked all the press out and then just the guy on Joe and his manager were in the, in the academy. My Dad was having a car or my dad's black belt was having a class where there was a bunch of students there and yeah man, just like everybody says, my dad beat the shit out of this guy.

Speaker 3:          00:45:45       Like this guy came in and my dad instantly took them down, mounted him up. And in the beginning of the fight, the guy turned his back to try to get put to sleep because he realized he was going to lose, so he gave him his back to get to sleep in. My Dad was like, no, you're going to take more punishment, you're not going to get put to sleep so easily, you know, so he kept beating them bad and it was like, it was hard to see, you know, as even as a kid and he broke his nose, you can hear his nose break and it's a pretty big beating. And then after he fought, put them to sleep, he called the press and the press came in and took pictures and everything. Andrea went back to Japan saying that he got jumped by the academy, that we all jumped him. And then my dad had filmed it, brought, brought the video to Japan, was like, look, this is the fight. Showed all the press. And they were like, oh yeah, they all like, you know, thought it was very bad that he had lied and said that he got jumped in front of TV. So anyways, yeah. That fight is true and what isn't it put that online? I don't know. That's a good question, but I think he just because it's martial arts history. Yeah, I'll, I'll talk to them.

Speaker 1:          00:46:48       Itunes. You probably make 100 grand, you know, sell that thing on itunes for a buck and you probably make $100,000 easy. Easy. I think so. I mean maybe I'll promote it, let me know man, let me know when it's up. I'll put it on twitter. I'll put it on the podcast. I'll let people know I pay a buck to watch that. Right. I'll pick 20 bucks to watch that Shit. That to me, that's one of the great challenge matches in martial arts history. I mean there's your dad versus a Hugo Duarte on the beach in Rio. There's like a few of those that you can see. You know there's a few of those which is fucking crazy. I mean they were duking it out on the beach in sand know pretty, pretty, pretty wild. You could see that, but that wasn't the prolonged beating. You know, he let him up after he kicked his ass.

Speaker 3:          00:47:38       I think my dad, because there were so many videos of everybody fighting the gracie in action videos had came out, all these videos were out. I think my dad just wanted to keep something for himself and wanting to have some kind of power because everybody had taken all the footage and everything was used in whichever way, you know, my dad probably never got paid a cent for the gracie in action videos are or anything. So I think he was just wanting to keep something that he had power and, and, and it was good, you know, at this moment he has no value to that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       Yeah. A dollar 99, 50 bucks. There was also from the outside, there was always the um, the talk was always, especially because uh, you know, I've been working for the UFC since 97, so the people that I was working with like Campbell Mclaren and all those guys, they had been there from ufc one and they were, you know, they'd said that the reason why I'm your uncle didn't put your brother in our, didn't put your father and instead put hoists in that. The reason why he did that was because he couldn't control Hickson. Hickson was just, you know, he was the best of the family. Everybody knew he was the best of family, but that Horian knew that if he put Hixson Hixson wasn't gonna, you know, Hickson was going to do whatever you want it to. He was, he wasn't going to listen to him and he wouldn't be able to control him the way he possibly controlled everybody else. Is there any truth to that or what is it?

Speaker 3:          00:49:02       So there's a lot of different things that happened in that kind of time and Arrow, you know, one reason why he's fought in the UFC and I, my dad, because my dad was the best, you know, my dad would tap out hoists with one hand and in his belt before his fight. So there was no doubt of that. One excuse I think was that Horian looked or hoist look more frail. He looked like a more of a normal guy. So they wanted to make him. They wanted that to be able to prove that you do to is better. But ultimately, I don't know if that's true or not and I don't know the exact reason, but basically before that situation, a Horian and my dad had a, had a, uh, they kind of started to separate. They kind of started, you know, to go their own ways.

Speaker 3:          00:49:46       And I think in that situation, again, I don't know, 100 percent, but that's what I kind of thing happened and I'm sure horry and felt more control over, over, over hoist. Then he did it with my father. My Dad was kind of already starting to find his own way and do his own thing. And um, yeah, I dunno, I don't know too much about it because we never really talked about that far back. But even I think I have talked to my dad about it, but I forget because that's not really that important these days for me.

Speaker 1:          00:50:14       Well, you know, Horian gets a lot of. Whoops. Whoring gets a lot of grief. But I mean he was such a great promoter of Jujitsu and if it wasn't for him doing that, it wasn't for him putting on those gracie in videos and promoting them. And promoting Jujitsu and promoting Gracie Jujitsu. It,

Speaker 3:          00:50:33       yeah, probably has a huge part of what Jujitsu and MMA is today that um, he definitely made his value huge because not only did he create the UFC but he, you know, came to America, he spread it, he, he, he was the one challenge doing all the challenges in doing everything. So he was the reason really. And my dad was just a soldier, was the guy that one representing and ready to do what he had to do and you know, it's like Carlos and Leo. Leo was the representative and Carlos was the guy who kind of took care of the academy and it was the theory behind the diets and the theory behind the names and stuff. So I think neither one of them, I think they're both responsible for, for the movement. And yeah, I think it was a great thing. Horian, they, he did like even as academy, look at his academy day, it's like a museum, you know, he has, it's like a five star hotel with shower head look at my academy and it's nothing like that, you know, my academy is, it has some pictures and stuff, but it's not focused on that.

Speaker 3:          00:51:35       My focusing is on the match, will retrain what I teach. I'm not focused on promoting and being able to sell Jujitsu and being able to expand. Why the gracies you know, like for me, you come in, you're gonna be, you're gonna come to me and telling me if you know and you want to. And horian was, he did a great job in expanding and showing the world in your face. Like, here, look, this is what happens when this happens and this. So he was a great tool for the family and a great, you know, he, he made it happen. You know, he, he created a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:52:08       Yeah, all of us fans of Jujitsu or Horian Gracie, a huge debt of gratitude without a doubt. And also because he produced his sons that are also great promoters of Jujitsu and the great the Gracie breakdowns I one of my favorite things about after submissions after this, a submission in the UFC, a Henna here on will get together and discuss with, with great technical explanation all the various aspects of where someone went wrong, where things went right, what was the proper adjustment, what they did to get out of a bad situation. Really very, very educational. And if you watch that show a UFC ultimate insider, it's on UFC ultimate insider. It's so great because first of all, henry is so good at explaining these things. He's so articulate and so charismatic when it comes to these breakdowns of positions is so much enthusiasm. You know, you watch these guys talk about these things and it makes you want to train. I mean, it really does. It's a, it's really good stuff and it just shows how much is going on with Jujitsu. For folks who don't know, there's so much going on, you know, for people don't know they're looking at. They think, oh, this guy's trying to choke that guy. And he's trying to stop it, but it's all about the and the intricate details of leverage and movement. And these guys do a real good job breaking that down.

Speaker 3:          00:53:31       Yeah, they do do a great job breaking it down. And personally for me, I've never been one to teach online or through magazines or through stuff. I think I believe the Jujitsu is a lot more about feel and I don't, I, I kind of don't do that. I kind of disagree with myself teaching online or through videos and all that stuff. I kind of, I want to be able to feel and look somebody in the eyes if I'm going to teach them Jujitsu. And so yeah, that's my philosophy behind that, but you know, they're doing a great job of spreading it to all those people who can't get to them and they do what they do. I'm not really a to in control of what they do or how they do it. But I know for myself, I, I kind of don't do that and I kind of stick to my academy and where I teach and I focused on that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:54:20       Right. But what I'm talking about is their explanations of those guys are in mma, who rate

Speaker 3:          00:54:26       for the native, you know, those guys, they, they, they explained to the T.

Speaker 1:          00:54:32       it's one of the more difficult aspects of doing commentary is explaining not just recognizing positions and what's going to happen, but explaining to people positions and explaining what were the defenses were the offenders and doing it all in real time while the mat scrambles are going on and trying to like, you know, you know, what arms and Japanese at the left arm with his left arm and you know, you got to process all this stuff and you had, does he have his hand, his hands locked. I can't see. And try to put it all into together and then explain it to the layman to explain to the person who doesn't train at home where it's just a massive bodies. You know? That's why I just focused on competing and training better for me. Competing training and teaching. Yeah, well I like that philosophy of looking someone in the eye and, and training because there is that aspect of if you put a video out there you don't know who's learning your shit, you know? Yeah, of course. Very personal, right? Jujitsu and it's very personal.

Speaker 3:          00:55:25       I think so too. You know, and while I'm still competing, last thing I want is my enemies to be able to see what I do and see how I do things. So yeah, there's no way I would do that.

Speaker 1:          00:55:35       One of the interesting aspects about you and your Jujitsu career too, is that there's a lot of variation in Jujitsu and Jujitsu styles. There's a lot of new stuff that's come along, a lot of new techniques, a lot of new strategies, but your, your attacks and your Jujitsu, very much like your father's. It's very much traditional Jujitsu, you know, and there was a, there was a time when Vinny Magalhaes was on the ultimate fighter with a Minotauro Nogueira and he was talking about minotauro. Nogueira is Jujitsu and he said it's very basic, very basic features are. I mean it's all got really mad at him, but he, he said he didn't mean it in a bad way. What he meant by. It's the basics but honed to a laser sharp edge. Like there's nothing wrong with the, they're the foundation of Jujitsu and when I watch you compete, you're using the real traditional techniques of Jujitsu. You're not. There's nothing like a tricky that people haven't seen before. It's just Jujitsu that's done to perfection.

Speaker 3:          00:56:42       Yeah. I think that the tricks they work sometimes and they work if it's some good moment, you know, like these, these new things that happen in these new ways to defeat your opponent. So I'm always looking for a situation that's going to work all the time, you know, so these tricks, the good positions or stuff, they demand a lot out of you and they only work if that situation happens. So I'm not concerned with trapping myself into a position that's good for me because I count on not being in good positions. I count on being in a bad position. I count on being in another position, so for me I'm, I'm, I'm leaving my training sessions open to, to what may happen and I don't like try to get to a certain position and then began my training. That's what I feel like happens most of the time.

Speaker 3:          00:57:33       It's due to these days as you want to get to this grip, this grip and then from here you're going to start training. So to get to that position where you have your special grips and everything, it takes a lot of energy and it takes a lot of strength and I kind of based my attitude so on leverage and techniques so that it'll work when I'm fresh, when I'm tired, if I'm fighting a guy who's bigger than me, it doesn't depend on physical strength. So that's where kind of my dad kind of forced me because I didn't always think like this and you kind of given me the, not only the, the technique and the leverage, but showing me that it's possible proving to me firsthand that it's possible for you to beat your opponents with leverage. To not use dream to say, so my like, you know, been been promoting this like little mini warrior in my mind for a long time of how to be not only mentally but physically in training wise and spiritually and it's been, it's all helped me in and he's a great, huge part of, of, of my success.

Speaker 1:          00:58:33       One of the things I took from the conversation with your dad, we was talking about the various aspects did you did too, but he was saying that first and foremost, one of the most important weapons that he has is his defense. That is always safe. He said, at any position, I'm always safe. He doesn't that. He concentrates on that. And then the other thing was that when he moved from one position, I never forget this conversation. He goes, we all started point zero from zero in the neutral point I moved to one and when I get to one, I'm not going back to zero.

Speaker 3:          00:59:08       It sounds like he said he's a very interesting person, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       but it's true. If you watch his fights, he rarely loses positions. There's no sloppy scrambles know. It's one of the things that I criticize people sometimes about an MMA, like guys leave too much space. They go for things in a way they're not in control of the position and he never did that when when he would mount a god, that motherfucker would stay mounted when he mounted the guy was just a matter of time before we got an arm bar or whatever he got for you.

Speaker 3:          00:59:35       Yeah. It's pretty cool to see that the, I guess like everything in life, everything goes back to the basics and I didn't like plan to have a certain type of style. I didn't like, Oh, I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Just try to train this style. Just submissions only. No, I didn't plan that. I'm planning and it's not like I'm going to start a fight and I'm just going to go for an arm rocker. I'm going to go for a crazy submission from nowhere. It's not like that either. You're not gonna get that, but my training sessions are to like you're. My Dad says to get to the next better position to get to the next better position to get to the submission. So I'm never stopping my mind, I've never stopped in my training, I don't stop in a place and be like, okay, I'm going to breathe here for a second or I don't do that.

Speaker 3:          01:00:18       I kind of always am looking for the next place to get to the finish line and that's created a very aggressive style because I'm always looking for the next place to be and it's not necessarily like, oh, I just go for submissions from anywhere. No, I'm going for. Sometimes it may be to pass the guard or maybe to do to get his leg off my hip or whatever it is that may happen. So it's not like I'm just thinking about submissions or I'm not thinking about doing crazy. The tricky stuff, it's just that those stuff may not fall into what I'm mentally trying to do. Your objective, my objective, and I think that's the biggest thing. I don't think too much about it. I just think about how am I going to get to a next better place? How am I going to put him here? So it just comes kind of naturally at this point. I can't even. Not trained that way if I try to train any different way, my Jujitsu sucks so it's become A. I'm glad. I'm very grateful that it's become like this and I have this type of style and I had gotten as good as I got with the basics and with what I with the tools that I had. So I'm, I'm super stoked.

Speaker 1:          01:01:26       That became an issue in Abu Dhabi with a lot of wrestlers that wrestlers would take guys down and just hold them in positions and not go for submissions. Just try to go for points and you know, and people would get furious. It'd be like, well this isn't Jujitsu, but some people felt like the only way to compete with these guys is to do what they're doing is to fight smart. The only way you can win is to, to, to fight on points. Would you rather lose on points then when? By holding a guy down?

Speaker 3:          01:01:55       Yeah. I have lost like, that doesn't bother you. It does. I mean you don't. You show me a good loser. I'll show you a loser, but you know. Yeah. I rather lose on points with keeping my mentality always with the objective to get into a better place then to stop my game and to find out how I'm going to win this match while using the time on my side. So I have fought matches where I lost when I could won, I was winning on points and then I went for something or I try to advance the position, then I lost it and then doing and then whatever. The guy swept me and then I lost because of the time right now. So I have lost matches like that and it served as a good learning experience and everything and you know, yeah, I'd rather lose on points then to sit there and stop the game and wait for the time to, to, to run out because I will. I don't know if I would feel like shit, you know, I feel like deep inside me I have a thing that I feel like really bad if I don't try to go for the next position. I feel guilty almost. So like my grandfather's.

Speaker 1:          01:03:06       So you were your Jujitsu and your, um, your, your path is clearly a work in progress and even though you've achieved the great heights of being an Abu Dhabi world champion, while you're training and fighting, you're always competing with that very specific mindset. So any setbacks are just going to be educational experiences. You learn from those setbacks and then next time you even greater, which is why when you came in, was it second place in 2011? A third, third place, 2011. They came back and fucking dominated in 2013. That was a big leap man.

Speaker 3:          01:03:38       Yeah, that was good one. It was a good. I think honestly, I think I was ready for it and maybe if I would've won in 2011, it wouldn't have been the same. Or if I went in 2009, who knows what would happen. But you know, I feel like now I'm ready. I don't make more excuses about anything and if I don't win, it's my fault. If I, if the guy was good enough to stall me out, he was good enough to start me out. So I have to come up with some thing to be able to be better than he is, so I don't really take it in, criticize them anymore. If the guy just stalls on me, I expect that the guys are not going to want to fight me into. They're going to want to start and get some points in, feel good. I expect that and I trained that situation and I'm ready for that. And so far so good. You know, I've been on a, on a good, good run lately.

Speaker 1:          01:04:24       Have you ever seen the video where Eddie Bravo and I were talking about your magic? Dad was great for folks who don't know in the finals that dude was trying to stall crawling out and starts making chicken noises. He's gone. And for a Jujitsu Guy, I mean, do you want to talk about the ultimate mind? Fuck, you're not just fighting against the son of the greatest ever, but the greatest ever is making chicken noises that you. Yeah, that was fucked up

Speaker 3:          01:04:56       because. Because it started. When he did that, I was like, man, now I can't let this get to me too. You know, because my dad is over here, like of course I have to kind of try to keep in the final match. I fought a guy who I had beaten many times before, so, um, I knew that I could win, but if I were to start letting myself believe that I was gonna win, Oh, I'm going to win because I had already won. It was going to completely mess up my mind. So I went into the fight like he was the most difficult fight of my life. And when my dad started to get Fred, I knew he was going to back away. I knew he was gonna start me out and it was not getting to me. I was just like trying to do what I could do.

Speaker 3:          01:05:37       I'm not going to go crazy because he's not wanting to fight me. I was expecting that the reps were gonna warn him and take away points and I was going to let that happen. And Yeah, when my dad was like, when you did that, I was like, I was like, man, I kicked chrome. Don't let it get it to you. Don't let that shit get to you, man. Don't think, don't let him. You have to make it so that me. So you and your dad are fighting together. Not against each other. I didn't want to let him where he said like affect my train of thought, put more pressure on me to have to do something. So I kinda kept my cool and thank God like shortly after that he, he got a point taken away for crystal clean and then he went for the take down and I got him in a good guillotine. So it all worked out as well. And that victory right there, right there is like the happiest moment of my life. That's the greatest feeling ever. And I think my dad still still so happy. I mean I haven't seen my dad that everybody that comes up and talks to me, he's like, you're dad hasn't been this happy in so long and to see him so proud and so, so stoked to finally achieve that number one place is a, is a good thing.

Speaker 1:          01:06:45       It was such a beautiful poetic moment too. When the guy shoots for the take down, you immediately lock it up like this is why this guy was

Speaker 3:          01:06:51       stolen

Speaker 1:          01:06:53       right into the jaws of death. You lock that thing on. Perfect too. That was beautiful. I mean he tapped out within like a couple of seconds. It was over.

Speaker 3:          01:07:01       Yeah. When he went for like. I mean I, I have, I'm dangerous from a lot of different places, you know, but when he went from my leg I was like, thanks buddy. I was like this great Christmas present and like boom, everything fits so good. And, and uh, it was, it was a good good. I mean it was a great show in, in, in that success of that competition kind of just came from a lot of I trained my ass off, like sacrifice everything. And you know, in life that's what you gotta do when you want something, you know, whether whatever field it is you have to kind of really see what you wanted. And I saw my potential and I used it and I kind of, you know, anybody who saw me trained so hard. I trained for that fight. I was ready to win.

Speaker 1:          01:07:46       Yeah. You want to see something crazy. Pull up a kron gracie Ninja training. It's some bars in Santa Monica that's. I saw this the other day. Somebody put it on my message board. On the thread of this particular podcast. When the podcast was announced you, do you do this often? Is this wild video of you climbing up on these bars in Santa Monica? You climb to the top and then you. You're swinging like here's the video he climbed.

Speaker 3:          01:08:13       How often do you do this? I mean, I live in Santa Monica, so I go there all the time and I kind of always do just like some workouts and I like to be at the beach and in the ocean, but this is just like a joke, you know, like it just kind of a little trick, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:08:26       Yeah. Well this little trick, he's jumping nine feet from one bar to the next swinging and then catching with his arms like a monkey. I mean this is some wild shit. Dude. This is on the chimpanzee shit

Speaker 3:          01:08:39       that day. Nate was the one filming that and he was super stoked on it. And how often do you do that? I go down to the bars or at least like once or twice a week just to kind of, you know, I do the ropes or climb the ropes for my forearms and I do some of his stuff, but you know, that's never like the biggest part of my training or it's never the most important thing. It's always come secondary to training, Jujitsu and my specific stuff I got going on. But when you train all day, everyday you got to find ways to keep yourself entertained and keep yourself enjoying what you're doing. And I hate being in a Jew. I had been in a gym. Weightlifting, gym. Human. Yeah, weightlifting gym and I hate being in there like working out and so if I'm going to go on a bike ride, I'll go outside. If I'm going to run out, go outside, I like to feel the fresh air and kind of enjoy myself while I'm in this kind of hill that I live in.

Speaker 1:          01:09:28       It's kind of held perpetual training, you mean? Yeah. How much physical training do you do besides the Jujitsu?

Speaker 3:          01:09:35       I do a lot of energy too. I do a lot of everything I run, I bike, I swim, I do.

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       And when you do it, like what are the objectives? Like when you, when you do you're running, are you monitoring your heart rate? He doing sprints, eat tabata intervals. Like what do you, how do you ever. I do all the different types,

Speaker 3:          01:09:52       you know, sometimes I do just a long distance run while run an hour and 10 or 20 minutes straight and then the goal would be for that would be endurance and then I'll do some days where I'll just do sprints upstairs or some days I'll just do a bike long bike rides or you know, all those things. I kind of just, some days it's more explosive and some days it's more long distance and I just use it as a tool, as an addition to two other things I do and I felt like since I really started to put my energy into other things, it's made my Jujitsu better because the more in life when you sacrifice in one direction, no matter what it is, it gives. It makes you better. I don't know how, I don't know what it's like something with the universe where no, even if you say, oh, I'm going to wake up at six in the morning to go do 20 pushups and then go back to sleep. That is gonna make you better at what you do because you are going to start to create this energy to, to achieve your goals. So once I started to really dedicate myself, not only with Jujitsu but with breathing and, and physical strength and, and technical strength and mental strength and all these different ways that I can build myself as a, as the best I can be, it really went to show, you know, it really made a big improvement. Since that moment.

Speaker 1:          01:11:08       Do you find that the physical training helps prevent injuries? Do you find? I do.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       I think it's important. I think physical is training should be done at a right time because if you get a white belt and you start telling them all right, you got to be physically strong and you tell them to start working out and running and then he's going to create. His training is going to be based on his physical strength. So my advice is the physical strength is to, uh, to add to your technical ability. It's not to take away from your technical ability and make you rely on your strength and really make you rely on your physical attributes. So I always kind of don't push for, for guys in my academy to work out until they reach a brown or black belt level, then there they can, they can start adding to their technique because if you get too strong, I've seen happen many times where guys will take steroids and then they'll get so strong and they'll lose their technique.

Speaker 3:          01:12:03       So I never wanted that to happen to me. I knew that the strength was always gonna be there if I, if I worked on it. So I think it's important for you to build your technique and then secondary, you know, your strength can keep, keep your technique going because of course if you don't have any physical strain, your technique will, will, will fade, you know, so you gotta have enough strength to keep it, to keep it going. Do you have a trainer that helps you with your physical strength workouts or do you just know? I got myself, that's, that's how I count on all that you've learned over all the years of martial arts. Yeah. And like I said, you know, like it, it took, um, you know, when you're, when you're training for fights and when you're, when you're getting ready. My Dad left to Brazil when like, oh, when I was 18, so I didn't have a coach, I didn't have nobody.

Speaker 3:          01:12:51       My Dad was in another country, I didn't have a coach, I didn't have a strength trainer, I didn't have nobody to give me any kind of advice. So for a long time I was kind of like, oh man, this sucks. Like fuck, everybody should be helping me. My Dad should be helping me. I should have a trainer, I should have fucking somebody, you know, write my stuff down and I should have all this stuff and you know, I should be sponsored by Nike and I should have, you know, like all these things that like, I compared myself to Colby Ryan. But um, as you get better, you realize that stuff's not going to happen. And, and I kind of got to a point where I kind of stopped making excuses and I kind of started to blame myself for, for, for my own success. Not blaming other reasons, not blaming because I didn't have this or because I didn't have this or because my dad wasn't here, so I'm grateful for my dad taught me as much as you can for as much as he did and got to a certain point where I stopped blaming.

Speaker 3:          01:13:49       I stopped blaming anybody for anything and I kind of just put all everything into my hands. So that was my, what I do now and how my schedule is now as a result of a lot of years of being on my own and being. Of course I've had help here and there, but nobody fully embraced being my help. So of course I picked. I picked from the help from I can get from wherever I can get all this guy taught me this one thing, I'll do it. So I kind of go around and using my experience to make the best training that fits for me and I've kind of finally got to that point where I know how to train hard to. I don't overtrain to where I know I'm in shape to where I know a mental. All that stuff was kind of starting to really combine well based on what I feel and based on how I have lived my life and how I've competed in how I've put my body in stress, so I'm able to kind of get a good understanding of where I'm at.

Speaker 3:          01:14:41       When your dad went to Brazil, was he, was he teaching in Brazil? My parents got split up and then my dad went to Brazil to go recharge his battery just to hang out. Yeah, to go. He just his. His analogy is, his explanation is, you know, you put a coconut tree in America. It doesn't grow, Cook and you put a cup in Brazil in coconut grove. I cannot explain why, so he was just to make some coconuts. So I think he just wanted to feel good and kind of be his on his little retreat and it worked well and now he just moved back actually a couple months ago. He's moved back here and now he's kind of after eight years of living in Brazil, he's kind of got more motivation to be here in America and be a part of my life. And I mean, he's always been a part of my life, just, I just don't, it's not like my dad didn't help me, but he helped me up until I was like 18, gave me everything he could and then he let me be my own man.

Speaker 3:          01:15:45       You know, he, he let me do everything on my own, make my own decisions. If I wanted to do this, I could do it if I wanted to do that, if I wanted to wake up at 3:00 in the afternoon I was going, I was my own man and had the freedom to do everything. So he gave me the option to do whatever I wanted and think, God, I was able to really embrace that and use it to my benefit and it'd be able to do what I did with that kind of on my own. You know. Does your dad still train? Um, my dad teaches when he doesn't train so much where he actually goes and tries to get better. He's a, he's kind of physically can't do it because he's got like 800 years in his back. He looks like a, you know, he, his, he's physically burn out, you know, you, you, you train at the highest level for her whole life with no.

Speaker 3:          01:16:32       When you say Hernias, you mean herniated disc? Herniated, herniated discs. Yes. So it's got his back's a mess. Oh yeah, he, he, his doctor said he shouldn't be walking, but he walks so he can't train as much, but he does put a gear on and he'll show move here and there and he'll do what he has to do. And um, and I think he's happy with it. I think he's now he's gotten to a place where, where he is okay with being retired and he's okay with not being the frontline and he's okay with, with being at the stage where, where he is, you know, he knew that the time that he had to be physically, it was up into this age and you know, I guess when you start to, to fall out of your physical shape, you want to fight it and you want to know I can still do it.

Speaker 3:          01:17:19       I could. And I think now he's very happy being the icon that he is in being, you know, he helps me with what he can help. He trains with what he can do and he's still the man like w when he comes with me with theories and, and, and training stuff. I mean, man, it's like nobody else has the mind that he has. Even if you put his brain on anybody's body, there will be a champion for sure because he has a, an old. He's a very great sense of how do I adapt to anything. So sometimes I'll come up with a move or I'll be like, dad, this has been giving me problems. And even if him not training for 10 years, he'll still feel how to defend it or feel how to deal with that or to have a greater understanding of how to be.

Speaker 3:          01:18:02       So I think he's just better now this time of his life, he's incorporating different things. He's not focused on training hard that time for him. It's past the time for him to fight his past. Now it's time for him to watch me fight. Now it's time for him to watch himself, you know, teach or watching, being an icon, you know, start, you know, what does he do for exercises? Oh, he serves and he and he doesn't exercise and he'll do his little workouts and stuff and he's still, he's still very active but he's just not going to go and train rounds after rounds. But he's definitely very healthy and physical. A person and I mean if I have eight hurting your despite his age and I'm able to do what he did, I'll take that. No problem. I'll take the eight and he has to be in the best in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:18:51       Note any day of the week. So. Well they uh, they can do a lot for those things now. Yeah, I mean he's going to doctors and if you have any, any advice? He definitely certainly do. The, uh, Regina King that I had done was because of a bulging disc and made a huge impact on me. And it's also the same thing that a lot of football players have done. Like Peyton manning had done on his neck and he had two operations on his neck, was ready to retire, went to Germany, had the blood spinning procedure done, and now I was playing football than ever. That's great. Massive a antiinflammatory properties of it. And the good thing about it is it's using your own blood so it's not like you're introducing a steroid or any unnatural a substance into your body that's going to cause an adverse side effects.

Speaker 3:          01:19:33       It's actually actually your own blood. It's amazing to see with his body how it's been, how well he lives in, how he's happy to. He says, if I can serve and I can do the things, if I can train once a week and do the little moves here, I'm okay with that. So I don't know how far he's trying to step into actually being feeling like 20 years old again, but I'm sure he'd be interested to hear what you have to say. Well, just pain relief and just the, uh, the uh, replenishing of his body's ability to move correctly. It would be a huge impact. Um, I know a lot of guys that

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       are getting towards his age though that have done Jujitsu for a long time, have similar issues. Ricardo Laborio told me he has seven, seven desks, you know, and you know, like standing next to Ricardo he's Kinda like hunched over and leaned down and when we were describing it, you know, you could see like he has like a winston, his face, he's just thinking about the pain, but still trains still goes out there every now and then roles and just loves it and can't help it. That's the problem is Jujitsu, so fun. It's too bad. Your body's not indestructable to patty. Can't tap out, but your bodies, you know, rubber indestructable. He created like that for a reason. I bet. Yeah. My Dad was still be mopping floors have, I'd be like, this is my time now. They give me a break. What was the last time your dad like really seriously rolled? How long ago was it?

Speaker 3:          01:20:56       Uh, I dunno. All I know is the last time we seriously rolled. I got fucked up. This is bad because I just got my black belt and I was like, all right dad, you know, at this time he was still kind of not. I mean he's had hernia disk for a long time. I, he probably had her $800 disc when he was fighting. Really know. Yeah, he, he's probably had it for a long time. It's not just dealt with the pain. Yeah. He's dealt with pain his whole life. And um, I don't know exactly what, what is, what the exact he has or doesn't have. But um, yeah, like when I was 21 years old, 19, I just got my black belt and I was like, all right dad, let's go. Since you're out of shape, let give me three minutes, three minutes and we'll go as hard as we can for three minutes and let's see. Because after three minutes then of course I'm in better shape and you are not training so much. So I don't want that to be an issue. And uh, when we train man, he got me in like a minute and a half and I was so pissed. Come in with a foot lock and I was like, yeah, all right. He's still the man

Speaker 1:          01:21:59       that was the last

Speaker 3:          01:21:59       family we really rolled. So, um, yeah, I mean he's a, he's a very. I mean he's just a real Samurai. You mean you didn't know where they put it? He's just all around. It's not an act, you know, he's definitely in his bones. He's ready to die today. If something happened, you'd be ready to die for what he believes in. And I think that's why I, I believe in what he says and I believe in what I do and why I do what I do with so much passion.

Speaker 1:          01:22:25       Yeah. He's the real deal. And for folks who you want to get a sense of it immediately, even if you're not a martial artists, the movie choke, go watch the movie choke because that's, you know, Hixon when he was, I mean essentially not quite as prime because he was in his late thirties at the time. It was probably, it was better when he was even younger than that. But you get a chance to see the physical preparation when he's sitting up to his neck in an ice glacial river and meditating. I mean fucking freezing cold water and he's just breathing and concentrating. Ace Hoyle, he gets in, he gets his foot and he's like, fuck this. Everybody else is like touching the water and go, oh, this is crazy. Your Dad's in there up to his head.

Speaker 3:          01:23:07       Like, like, it's nothing like he's in the Jacuzzi. So yeah, I'm. That inspires me, you know, and I.

Speaker 1:          01:23:14       Well I remember him getting out, you know, happy and praising and thank you. My Lord are loving it. The know he embraces the challenge of it and the braces. Just the wildness of being in a, in a glacier river and Japan and the whole deal, man. Yeah, he really does it. Now. You are starting to, you're doing a lot of training with. I know Gilbert Melendez, he's a good friend of yours who thankfully just got reassigned to a new deal where he's going to compete against Anthony Pettis, who's the lightweight champion. They're gonna fight after they coach the ultimate fighter together, which is a huge thing. Um, and you're training with a lot of the other oil or get out outta you. Had enough ever folks who don't know, you know, toilet Gracie, so one of the greatest submission artists of all time to and very, very successful in competition. So you know, when you see the difference between how a Hixon deals with it and how heuler deals, but that's when you really get a sense of what a special person he has. And by the way, no one's telling him to do this. This is all his idea in your mom's calling. Oh fuck. Yeah. And my dad never had it

Speaker 3:          01:24:21       coach either, you know, he never really had nobody there all the time. Time. So that gave me more motivation to. And also it gave him the confidence that he could let me be on my own and, and I was still going to be all right if I was trying to be all right.

Speaker 1:          01:24:35       Now what I was going to say is you, you've done quite a bit of training with Nick and Nick Diaz and Ronda Rousey. Did you do some training with her as well? I've never trained with Rhonda actually. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:24:45       Um, I've trained with Nick and nate a lot and Gilbert and jake quite a lot, you know, so those guys are a big part of my training and I've helped him out all out with fights and

Speaker 1:          01:24:55       Rhonda trends with those guys on a fairly regular basis. Right. She's trained with them a few times. She definitely was up there more before, I think. I don't know how much she goes up there now. But are you planning on fighting and MMA now? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:25:07       I am. So I actually, after the ADCC I kind of, I'm kind of starting to focus more on mma, kind of want my energy to be driven towards fighting professionally and in man. Yeah. That's where my energy is going these days. And what motivates you to want to do that? Like I said before, this has been my. I knew I was going to get to this point when I was a little kid. I never saw Jujitsu is my final mission and um, I was just waiting for a right time and reading for myself to be ready for whatever obstacles I can get to on this specific situation. So now I feel mentally ready and now I feel the motivation and now if you would ask me when I was 20 years old, if I was ready to fire me, I, I wasn't mentally, not physically, not technically, but just mentally ready to do something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:25:57       So the last thing I wanted was to be traumatized. And uh, now I feel like no matter what happens, I'm ready to, to, to embrace whatever it happens and I'm ready to fight. So negotiating scene with the best situation for me to, to take advantage of this moment. Now, how have you adjusted your training to prepare for mixed martial arts? Some minor, some minor adjustments. Nothing too crazy, but I think of course you go. There's different obstacles and different things that you got to worry about when you're just dealing with rigid soon when you're just dealing with mma, you know, of course you can hit and stuff, but I think generally my fights, the way I fight is, is more of a fight and I, I kind of, not a sport, I'm not trying to be sporty with my Jujitsu, so I don't think the transfer over will be that big of a jump as it could be for some other guys. People who more points oriented, people who are kind of. They want to stay in their columns. I'm very comfortable in the, in the storm. So, um, I think that'll help me when I, when I fight.

Speaker 1:          01:26:59       That's something. One of the most important attitudes to have in life is to embrace the storm you're comfortable in the store and try to figure out how to make yourself uncomfortable all the time. There's always time for relaxation after that. It's all over, but don't avoid the storm

Speaker 3:          01:27:14       that's going to make you really asking. Then you're going to see who you are when you can deal, how you react in those situations.

Speaker 1:          01:27:19       Absolutely. Especially if you embrace it, it becomes a part of who you are as a human being that you do that, that you take on those challenges. What about striking? What are you doing as far as striking?

Speaker 3:          01:27:30       I'm working on and a little bit here and there. Um, you know, don't want to give up too much of my training. But uh, yeah, I mean, I think Jujitsu has striking, you know, there is, it's just Jujitsu strikes when it's beneficial for you. It doesn't teach you to sit there in the pocket and just bang out with anybody. But if a striking is definitely a part of Jujitsu and I think it's going to be interesting to see what I can do, you know, I'm curious and I, and I'm, I want to, I want to see what, what happens, you know, so just like anybody else, I'm very curious to see how much you do digital is going to play in fighting and how, what's going to happen? Is the Jujitsu going to be enough or is he going to have to do this certain type of training? So I think, uh, my training with nick, nate and, and Jake and Gilbert is sufficient to, to really put me wherever I want to be.

Speaker 1:          01:28:24       Now your, your, um, your uncle who is said recently, you know, that you don't need anything other than introducer. Is it all these different people that the train wrestling and all these different aspects of striking that you really don't need it just trained Jujitsu. Do you, do you agree with that or do you think that in modern mixed martial arts it is important that you cross train? It is important that you prepare for full mixed martial arts competition or do you think that the highest level of Jujitsu is still sufficient fish

Speaker 3:          01:28:52       it, I think Jujitsu is sufficient. I think it's sufficient to be the best martial arts. I just think that rule is make it so that it's not necessarily possible. So the rounds, the gloves, the rules, you know, those things all change the sport and it changes the situation. Standups, yeah. Like if you have no gloves, nobody's going to be throwing those punches that guys throw these days. So you're going to break your hand first punch, you throw the guy, ducks his head, you're going to break your hands. So I think that all those things change it and when it changes, you have to be ready to adapt to what changes personally. If you put two guys in a cage in Jujitsu is enough, but when you put on the gloves and you put the time and you put the rounds and you put the, you know, all these things, the steroids, so it changes the situation and, and you know, guys are more willing to just throw the hardest punches and knock you out because they know that the round is going to end because they know that their hands not necessarily going to break.

Speaker 3:          01:29:57       So if you asked me what's the best martial arts, I think judy who? Of course, if you ask me what is digital enough? Yes. It just depends on the rules. If you tell me, okay, it's a two minute round and the guy is gonna stand you up, or do you know? Of course then you have to learn how to box. You have to learn how to do this, and personally I'm deflection of punches is always been a part of Jew to be not necessarily being able to strike. I don't know necessarily if I'm gonna be knocking guys out, but I'm going to be able to defend my goal into the Jujitsu. Go in. The principle is to be able to defend whatever the guy's gonna do. If the guy's going to punch you, you have to be able to defend the punch. You have to be so I don't necessarily think that you have to be a great striker to to win mma and to be a champ, but you have to be able to defend yourself. You have to be able to know where the punch is coming from. You have to be able to know what's going on. You have to know about stuff. It's not like, oh, Guy Trained Jujitsu for 20 years and then he goes into a fight. He's going to get, he's going to get beat up, you know, so it depends how you train and what your worry is and how well you adapt to

Speaker 1:          01:31:02       whatever's going on in the fight. Your Dad always said that, that he doesn't train kickboxing to become a kickboxer transit to know what they're doing. Yes, exactly. So I feel comfortable. So who were you talking to? Are you talking to organizations? Can you tell me? Uh, yeah, I'm, I'm talking to right now. I'm negotiating with Japan. Nothing's for sure, but it's looking good and I'm trying to see if I can get a, there's an opportunity for me in Japan. So what organizations are left in Japan right now?

Speaker 3:          01:31:31       Don't, can't really say too much right now, but basically it's very shortly we'll, we'll know going

Speaker 1:          01:31:37       on with that. And uh, well for folks who don't know, your, your dad was a huge star in Japan. Yeah, they had a comic book based on them. I mean there was a lot of fanfare and publicity and they, they embraced him, especially when he won the Japan valley. Tudos, I mean, your dad was an enormous star over there and I think that, that sense that you would want to compete over there because they would be very interested to see.

Speaker 3:          01:32:03       Yeah, there's a lot of benefits for me starting off in Japan and, and uh, you know, the just a lot better for me at this moment in my career to start off in Japan into, to really build myself the best I can. And I personally like fighting in front of Japanese culture because, you know, they're, they're, they're a little bit more martial artists. They come from like a Samurai background, so they really care about what you are, they really care about what you stand for, they really care about, um, if you sweep somebody in the middle of a tournament, they're going to clap, you know. So personally for me, I, I appreciate that and I liked that about Japan and um, I think it's just a time in my life and of course, if Japan were to ever like, you know, have a movement of, of, of being able to bring mma back to Japan. I think a possibility will be with bringing me to it because that's gonna. It's of replicate what my dad did. You know, how he brought it to Japan. So I think it's, for me in this situation, it's, it's a great opportunity and I'm trying to go for that.

Speaker 1:          01:33:10       Yeah. For people who don't know, your dad was the star of pride one. I mean that's what got pride kicked off. That was the, uh, the big launching pad after he had won the Japan Valley Tudo. And then of course pride came close to me. It was an enormous event in Japan, like they had put on 90,000 seat shows several times

Speaker 3:          01:33:33       60,000 Tokyo dome sold out huge.

Speaker 1:          01:33:36       And somehow or another it stopped. It's one of the great mysteries of martial arts and I don't totally understand Japanese culture. I guess they get really into things sometimes and then the things fade away. But uh, when we were there and we did the UFC there a couple of years ago, it was my first time in Japan and I was amazed that the audiences, they were awesome. They are amazing. Like when the fights going on, they're so polite and then when something happens like a transition or sweep, everybody applauds. Like it's like, wow, there's like, it's really cool. It's like I, I really appreciate how much they love the, the technique and the martial arts aspect of it. But as far as like a crazy crowd, there's nothing like Brazil. There is nothing like Brazil. This last event when Machida fought most saucy, I watched it at home. And uh, when, when Bruce Buffer says it's time to whole audience does it with them. I mean there's like 18,000 people.

Speaker 1:          01:34:36       No one cheers. Like a Brazilian crowd. No one cheers. And they're there at the very first fight. That place is packed, packed. They're getting their money's worth. Fuck. Yeah. Fucking fired up, man. We got there early and there was already just a giant line around the block to the arena. And then when we got in it, man, the energy in the air was it, it was a huge, huge, huge thing. That was the last one that I was at in Rio. But um, there's no crowds like Brazilian crowds. The Japanese soccer, they come from the soccer backgrounds, so they're really into that. Japanese crowds are just different in their own way. Completely different. Very, very different from the Brazilian crowds, but different in their own unique way. So does. Is there a timeline on when this is going to happen?

Speaker 3:          01:35:22       Basically we're going to know very soon, very, very soon in the next. Probably the next time I see you. It will be you. I'll have an answer and so I'm just waiting. I don't want to give up a date or a time. I don't want to put too much energy into, into that because I hope it happens so much that I don't want to spoil anything. So see. And it's going to happen very soon. So I'll let you know. I'll let you know. Don't worry, be able to. Did you watch the UFC this weekend? I did not. I just missed it. Damian Maya,

Speaker 1:          01:35:52       who is a very excellent representative of Jujitsu, fought Rory Macdonald and got beat up. Who, what happened in the fight? Well, Damien took them down the first round of mounted him, but uh, he couldn't submit them. And Rory defended, got back up to his feet and then started kicking the shit out really. And was Damien just trying to

Speaker 3:          01:36:13       stand up with him? Yeah, yeah. Well there you go. I mean, I like Damien. Damien is a, a good guy, you know, and he's like, uh, I've always had respect for him and we've always had a good time relationship. Um, and he's always been a representative of Jujitsu in a great way. Um, so I think the more he, he focuses on that and the more he tries to really use the J to, the better he's going to be because he's a specialist in Jujitsu. He's not a specialist in striking. So it's tough to, to try to be an excellent person in a different sport. I think he should try to focus in on, on, on being the greatest Jujitsu fighter and an iron man. I think that'll be beneficial for him.

Speaker 1:          01:36:57       Well, he was trying to do that. I mean he was trying down but he couldn't take them down. So then they're getting his take down stuffed. And then he was forced to stand with them and rory kept kicking him. He was just kicking the shit out of him.

Speaker 3:          01:37:07       That's why I'm curious, you know, I'm curious to see for myself how it is, you know, fighting with guys who don't want to go to the ground and see how I'm going to be able to deal with it and I don't know. I have zero experience in mma so I'm curious. I'm curious to see what happens and I'm curious to see how really difficult it can be and where my, where my technique is going to play a role in how it's going to be because you never know. That's why I'm, I'm really open for the, for the challenge. And you know, my, my, my blessings for, for Damien, hopefully he can find a great tactic to beat his opponents and be guys who are trying to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:37:42       Do you look at him as sort of A. I mean he's a very high level Jujitsu God, you look at him and as, as an example of what can be possible and not the pitfalls and the possibilities.

Speaker 3:          01:37:52       Yeah, I mean I think if somebody can defend his takedowns to something, then there's definitely a technical reason why that's happening. And I think that like personally I admire the guy, the guy's a, an exceptional athlete and he's a great fighter and hear everything, but I don't look up to his Jujitsu. I don't look up to anybody that you did to that is fighting these days, you know, I don't like seeing anything that, that is exceptional, you know, I see guys that are good, tough and guys who make it happen. But I'm impressed with my dad's Jujitsu. That's where I feel like I'm going to try to replicate. So as much as I'm a, I'm a fan and admired and all these guys are, they made, they got to where they got with the tools that they were given, you know, we are all given certain amount of tools and how will you use them? So I can't take anything away from the guys who got far with the Jujitsu striking or with whatever. But um, yeah, it's definitely like you're going to be able to see, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:38:54       who do you think is the best representative of Jujitsu right now in mixed martial arts?

Speaker 3:          01:38:59       Uh, I mean, there's a lot, a lot of good guys, you know, there's, you know, the classics, you know, like, Damien's very good. You know, Jack is very good. Those guys are guys who, I have friends with, guys who have been competing in tournaments in

Speaker 1:          01:39:11       Sergio Mariah's to his Jujitsu. I mean, he hasn't gotten to that level yet. Uh, you know, the, the level of opposition yet. But his Jujitsu has been very effective in mma. His, uh, his submissions or uh, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:39:23       I actually haven't seen him fight really in MMA, so I don't really know too much. But his Jujitsu and Jujitsu tournament is, is, is good. You know, he's a tough guy. He has a specific type of style. But again, I'm not impressed with his Jujitsu, you know, like I'm impressed with him as a, as a whole, you know, he's like, oh, the guy can make it happen. He can defend. Well, he's an exceptional athlete. The guy is very strong, very explosive, but you know, I don't see him as an exceptional Jujitsu fighter. What's missing for him personally? Yeah. I mean, again, like, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:40:00       No, but when you say, I mean you look at a guy who was like a high level world champion caliber fighter, but you say you're not impressed with his Jujitsu. What is not impressive about it?

Speaker 3:          01:40:08       Um, uh, I don't know because I had never seen him fighting MMA, so I don't know what he's doing in mma, but when I fight him, I fought him once he beat my ass and then I fought him the next time and it was a very even match. I thought I won that match and I got. I felt like I got gypped. But

Speaker 1:          01:40:27       did they give him an advantage? It gave them an advantage of the last five seconds is so squirrely for folks who don't know. There's weird scoring and Jujitsu. Jujitsu is zero to zero. One guy can get what they call an advantage and it's very subjective. And uh, you know, people I've seen fucking bench clearing brawls because of a advantage scoring.

Speaker 3:          01:40:47       What I feel about impressive Jujitsu is why am I so impressed with my dad's got to, is because he outsmarts me. He technically beat me. If somebody is stronger than me and they pass my guard or they submit me, I am not impressed because of that. I think that the guy used this tool to beat me or did whatever too. But that doesn't mean he's a better Jujitsu. Doesn't technically a impressed me. So, um, it's very difficult to impress me. I come from my father. My Dad has been technically outsmarting me for a long time, so it's hard for me to be impressed with, with Jujitsu these days and that's what I am trying to do. I'm trying to do that is technical and it's way harder for you to technically outsmart somebody then for you to just know I'm going to get it and just take it and the guy defends and then you just rip right through it.

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       So it's a different approach to what I believe digital is about. And that's why I feel like I'm not impressed as much as other people or how they see he got that arm bar. Yeah. But, but he got an arm bar because he's much stronger than the guy. The guy has no defense. And so I feel like it's a mind game and however, well you use your chest pieces, you know, that's what's gonna make you the results. But I don't take anything away from surgery. Mariah's, he's a, he's a great fighter and he's an exceptionally healthy, strong person and he's able to use the tools and he's able to use Jujitsu for his benefit. That doesn't mean he's not good at Jujitsu or anything. That just means that if you speak specifically for Jujitsu, is he, is he using his strength or is he using his technical ability to, to beat your opponent? And that's where I say that. That's why I say that Mark Coleman wants certainly share this. That was the match that I draw with them. He was like four, four. And then, um, I lost on an advantage at the last second.

Speaker 7:          01:42:41       You were rocking the Old School Samurai ponytail. Just try that out for a little bit. Nobody told me it was really gay, so he kept going for a little bit. Your Dad had that back in the day, man, that's a tribute. That's attributed haircut. You'd get a pass. You get a gay pass. When I realized it was really,

Speaker 3:          01:43:01       so I kinda cut it. But did he get in the way? Yeah, I just got in the way and it just kind of wasn't really my style for. I was for awhile. I did. I had to do with it and then that was it. I was gonna say that Mark Coleman wants told me strength is technique, strength, two technique for some people and that's for some people they. Everybody has their, their belief, other people, other digital guys. They're like, you know, if the movie doesn't work then use more strength. You know, if the moves don't work because you're not using enough strength. So I'm not. I don't come from that theory. I don't come from that belief and I come from a leverage and technique background. So that's why I feel the way I feel. It's not because I feel against anybody and I'm not trying to point fingers or, or try to say that I'm better than anybody, nothing like that.

Speaker 3:          01:43:44       I still have a lot to prove, but if you honestly ask me if I'm impressed with the Jujitsu I come from, I'm picking son, you know, I, I come from the best. If I'm easily impressed, you know, that's not a good sign. Who impresses you in Jujitsu today? Um, what really impresses me is guys who are smaller, being able to really defeat bigger opponents like Marcella Garcia. My celebration is a very, he's definitely a great fighter. You know, I fought him twice and he's one guy who technically is great, you know, like I have nothing to say about his technical abilities and he's, he's technically in the game, you know, he's not overpower. He's not using his physical attributes to beat his opponent. So I'm impressed with that. That's, that's a great thing that he has. And um, yeah, I mean the technical ability is where I feel like is the line for, for, for greatness. And then, yeah, Marcella Garcia, he's, he's great. I, I love, I love fighting him, you know, that's one guy who I will fight any day that it's great to be meshing with that kind of talent. So, um, yeah, he's a great example and he fought, guys were really big and right there. I almost got him, Marcella had him in a guillotine for, for good minute until my forums cramped up.

Speaker 3:          01:45:08       But um,

Speaker 1:          01:45:09       if there was a professional avenue for Jujitsu of Jujitsu was like golf or baseball or something like that. It was on television all the time. Would you be motivated at all to enter into MMA?

Speaker 3:          01:45:21       Um, yeah, I think so too because I think it's more of a real fight and I think it's more of a challenge and I like challenges and I like to, I like to challenge and I like to see what's going to happen. And personally I think that Jujitsu takes away a little bit from the full fighting for fighting because it's punching because there's no punching in because there's other tools. So the less rules you have, the more you can actually present yourself in and use the stuff that you have within, you know, the fighting spirit and find out ways to stay safe and in personally digits, who most of the Jujitsu these days are very boring matches and they're very, you know, point oriented and they, they, they kind of, you know, it's, it's not as interesting to watch because guys are not really, they're there for the wind for the point and um, it's not motivating for me, you know, it's not motivating for me to compete in a fight like that. I'm motivated to, to embark on this new journey of MMA motivated to, to see what happened, to see how the fight fight goes, what I need to do with what happens if this happens. And I think that's a great thing.

Speaker 1:          01:46:39       Now when you see guys like Jocko, right, who were great Jujitsu artists and now entering into mma and just drunk arrays, winning a lot of his fights with kickboxing. Yeah. And a lot of guys that he's fighting, he's not able to take down. So some sort of forced to stay on this track with them. Would you take away anything from that? Do you learn anything from that?

Speaker 3:          01:46:57       Yeah, I'm trying to learn. I think Jakarta is great and I really like him a lot as a human being and as an athlete I've been his fans and she was before, you know, in Jujitsu, he was always a kind of a real cool guy to, to watch and he's a warrior, you know, that guy has a, has a strong spirit and he's a very strong hearted person. So, so whatever he does, he's going to be good at. And however he does it, he's gonna be, he's gonna make it happen and he charged her courage is use the tools that he was given to to get the best results that he can get. I don't take anything away from him.

Speaker 1:          01:47:33       Darn it mean by tech. Do you personally get something from watching him? Like, dude, you learn something from his. His approach? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:47:42       Me Personally, I'm kind of trying to always analyze in more importantly, I'm trying to see where I fit in on this. You know, I want to see if it's really, if how I'm gonna deal with somebody who's not letting me take them down, how am I going to get them down, how am I going to find the way to win the fight? So I think it's all in the air and we're going to see what happens and I can't wait to start to, to test myself in these waters and get these challenges and find out ways to find out ways to win.

Speaker 1:          01:48:09       No, other than Gill and Jake, how many wrestlers? Yeah, as you're

Speaker 3:          01:48:13       working with. I mean, in my academy there's always been great wrestlers and great judo guys and great everything. They all come in and out of my academy. So I've wrestled with the best wrestlers and I've wrestled with uh, you know, I've been in the mix with a lot of great athletes and um, yeah, I mean they're, they're, they're, they're a part of the training, you know, they come in and when I go up to train with nate or Gilbert, there's lot of wrestlers. And I think that's just one more tool. One more, one more training session. One different types of train, sometimes you train just tonight you're taking. Now sometimes you train to take somebody down. Sometimes you just trained Jujitsu. Sometimes you just train defense. Sometimes you just train one position, so you try to build yourself as a complete as much as you can.

Speaker 3:          01:49:00       And of course my specialty will never be wrestling. My specialty will never be boxing or kickboxing. It's never going to be my specialty, so I'm just like, Jack, his specialty is not going to be stand up. He's great at standup, he's knocking guys out, he's doing great, but that's not his specialty. When you ask him where he feels the best is going to be Jujitsu. So I feel like my best is always going to be Jujitsu as much as I trained the other stuff and as much as I feel comfortable in the other place, I want to bring the fight to where I'm where I feel great. That's why Anderson Silva was champion for so long was because he was able to keep the fight where he felt comfortable. He was able to keep the fight on his feet and in that, you know, elusiveness, he was able to win if he was like, I don't care, I get taken down and let the guys mountain and do this stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:49:50       And then they didn't fight to get up. Then he would have lost a long time before. But because he was so well at being able to stay in his where he's comfortable at and keep the fight where he wants to keep it right. He was an exceptional legend, you know, for, for so long and you know, that's something to admire. And, and I, I see guys, a lot of guys are just just general. A lot of guys are just really good at everything. Nobody is a special ed specialist in anything and suffer some here and there. But generally mma is just, you're just good at everything. You're not specialized in something. So I think for me, coming from a martial arts background, not coming from an MMA background, not coming from. I didn't just start doing this because I saw her on TV. I come from a tradition in my tradition is due to my tradition, is his technique and leverage and that's what I based my whole life on. So if I'm going to fight, I'm going to use that to my benefit. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:50:47       there's one pattern that we do see in mma all the time, is that when a guy gets truly excellent at any one aspect of fighting, that will always be that advantage when it gets into the octagon that it. It always is a significant advantage over people that have never competed in that individual form. Like, like for example, like if you take a guy like Anderson Silva is a total specialists to stand up striking specialist being his whole career as a standup striking specialists in order for you to get that good as he was at a whole lifetime. It's a whole lifetime. Yeah. So that's. I don't got to live

Speaker 3:          01:51:24       right now. Do what I got going on. Where's your academy? Where? Where do you teach? I teach in Culver City right next to apply to the way a Jefferson and centinela.

Speaker 1:          01:51:34       It was called the chrome grace home. Now. Do you find that teaching makes you better at your too?

Speaker 3:          01:51:41       Yeah, I've been teaching since I was 15, so everyday I teach even till today I still get better and I realized something that could be better or realize how I can explain something better or realize how I can see a different side and teaching for me has definitely been a huge part of my growth in Jujitsu and I see people who just trained and don't teach and I see a big difference in the people who do cheat and how much more knowledgeable they are and how much better they can be from that.

Speaker 1:          01:52:07       Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it, that teaching someone who doesn't know something forces you to think about almost every single aspect of it, including parts of it that you could sort of take for granted and it seems to translate not just what you do too, but kind of any. Anything that you teach people?

Speaker 3:          01:52:23       Course. Yeah. If sometimes you do something naturally and it just feels right and then when somebody asks, oh, how'd you do that? Or how'd you get out? Then you have to like sit and you have to program your mind to do and know what you're doing instead of just reacting. You know, you have to know like, oh, this is. I knew I did that and I know. So I think it's a teaching for me has been huge and I really, really enjoy teaching much more now. You know, I really enjoyed teaching. I really enjoy making people better. I really enjoy, you know, as a teacher I am able to see what a person needs and see where, where, where he's weak and try to make it better instead of coming in with a class like in my mind, oh, I'm going to just teach this class, I'm going to just teach this move.

Speaker 3:          01:53:10       Now I'm looking specifically to see what this person is lacking in and how it's going to benefit. Some guys are too hyper, you have to calm down, breathe. Some guys are too slow. Wake up buddy. Come on, let's get it going. You know? And so I think the, the, the good teacher is the one who kind of adapt to the needs of the student for the, for the goal of being better, you know, I'm not necessarily trying to make you feel good. I'm not necessarily trying to make you believe something. I'm trying to make you better at g two, you have to get better, you have to be a little bit better every time you leave me, you know. So, um, I really believe that the more I teach and especially for me personally because my dad left when I was 18, so I had all these students at the academy, you know, all these were all my training partners.

Speaker 3:          01:54:00       So I had to teach these people to be better so that I could have good training because if I didn't have, if I was, they're like, oh yeah, just do that move. Yeah, keep going guys. Keep going. Open training. All right. But then I will not have great training partners the way I do now. I have great training partner now because I was like, okay, how is this guy to beat me or don't let me get to this position and I'm very passionate on letting these guys get better to tell him. I'll tell him, man, dude, the way you're going to pay me to do like this and I'm making these guys better to try to beat me so that one they stay motivated and to. So they gave me great training because I can train now in my academy for four or five. I don't need to go to train with these other because I have guys who know exactly what I do and I tell them exactly how to defend it and I'm working that and the better I make them the better they're gonna make me.

Speaker 3:          01:54:51       So. So you were teaching at Your Dad's academy when you were 18? You were basically 15, 15. I started teaching, but I wasn't running the academy. I wasn't teaching the classes at 16. I taught like once a week 17. I started teaching a couple more times a week. By 18 I was fully teaching everything and running the whole academy. Wow. So that's what you've been doing essentially for a living? Yeah. Wow, that's crazy. So for the past seven years that's been what you do will. Since I was 18, I've been, since I was 15, I had been all the money I make is from Jujitsu. So yeah. Wow, that's incredible. So now when you teach 'em how many days a week you teaching? I teach once a day. Once a day, yeah. Do you have daytime classes? It's someone else teaches. I teach once a day and then some days I teach twice and then some days I, I the afternoon class and so I kind of scatter it out to where I can get to every teach two days in the afternoon and then I'll teach every night and then so some days on Tuesdays I teach twice a day but.

Speaker 3:          01:55:56       But yeah I teach a lot and I also teach enough to where I don't over teaching get kind of. Because I've taught before where I teach every class and that's training, you know, you give a lot of your energy, you teach it, you know, you give, give, give and then you have nothing for yourself. So I've found my kind of remedy of how much I can teach to where I still feel good about myself and still have enough to do the things I need to do. So I teach, you know, Monday through Thursday nights and then I teach Tuesday and Friday mornings and then salaries, open training and so I kind of give myself a time to not have those responsibilities

Speaker 1:          01:56:32       now. How do you structure a class? Do you, do you sit down and write out what your objectives are for each class? Do you structure them in on the fly? Like as you get there, do you have specific things that you want to work on? Certain drills that you think that people are lacking in? Like

Speaker 3:          01:56:47       everyday is different and it depends a lot on my mood to a. Some days I want to do a specific training for me, so I'll do like, oh, something that I feel like I need to work on, so then I'll teach that move and I'll have something I know I'm not the greatest asset, so I'll teach that move and didn't try to really research and see how I can make it better and then work on that move. Sometimes I see what the class needs and what, what the, what. I feel like those people who are in that class, how are they going to get the most out of that class? So some days it's, it's like that. Some days it's not. Some days I come up with stuff on the moment, some days I'm kind of like thinking about something all day. Everyday is different and uh, are basically. I never write anything down before I kind of just do everything on the spot.

Speaker 3:          01:57:33       And basically my goal when I'm teaching is to make my students better and to make them a gain. You know? So how I'm going to do that, I don't know. I'm just going to kind of see and feel where, where it is, you know, sometimes I have a lot more beginners. I'm not going to teach a fancy or something that took me 20 years to figure out. I'm not gonna teach it to somebody beginners, so if there's a class in, it's mostly beginners, I'm going to teach him mostly beginner stuff. There's a class in, it's these guys want to all train, then we will do all these trends. So it depends.

Speaker 1:          01:58:05       It's an interesting aspect about Jujitsu that most people that have never trained, but it's very difficult for them to grasp the depth of technique. There's so many different techniques and there's so many different techniques that transitioned into other techniques. It's for the lay person to kind of understand it. It's almost impossible. So when you, when you see someone like yourself that has a deep knowledge of it and then teaches and trains and competes, you got to kind of pay attention to it for many, many, many hours before you even see how deep the water is.

Speaker 3:          01:58:37       Yeah. I feel like the more you learn, the more you realize you don't know, you know, and it can always be easier for, you know, like if you're training and you're having trouble, if it's difficult for you to beat your opponent, then it's, you're doing something wrong, you know, it should be easy. You should be able to outsmart your opponent and it should be easy. Jujitsu is easy really. So if you're having a struggle with any kind of training session or anything, then that means you need to improve on something else to make your life easier. So I really don't think that there is ever like a cap where you're going to be like, oh, I know everything and I, I, it gets to such a small detail and then it gets to like the timing of not only being able to know and to do what you do, but do it at the right time. So it's very complicated. So complicated. I've cried so many times trying to figure it out. Uh, identity still to this day I feel like, fuck, I'm only like maybe even halfway of where I want to be.

Speaker 1:          01:59:35       Dennis Mckenna, who's a very brilliant guy, an interesting expression when it came to learning things, he said, the brighter the bonfire of enlightenment, the more surface area of ignorance is revealed. So the more you know, the more you realize God, there's so much shit to. No, it's true and it sort of applies to everything, but I think one of the unique things about Jujitsu and one of the things that I've gotten, not just for myself but from other people that I've inspired to begin Jujitsu and start training Jujitsu, is that they say that it makes everything else in their life better. That they say that the, the Jujitsu training, the difficulty of it and the learning about themselves has helped them in virtually everything they do.

Speaker 3:          02:00:18       Yeah, I definitely agree. I wouldn't. You couldn't give me a billion dollars today to take away the Jujitsu. I know, and you know, that's it. There's no way, you know, like how I feel as a man, how I talk and how I am. He's 100 percent because of Jujitsu and that's just something that I'm very grateful to be to have landed where I landed in the footsteps of following my father's footsteps and it's just a real Jujitsu will for sure. Save your ass it one way or another. Not necessarily a physical fight, but also being able to deal with yourself, know about yourself and and it really improve yourself as a whole because it's very easy to get trapped into like a daily life schedule and you kind of don't even tap to your potential. You don't even tap into discovering yourself and realizing all these feelings.

Speaker 3:          02:01:11       I feel alive when I could compete and when I trained for a fight and when I know I got to fight in this deadline and if you on this day, you're going to show up whether you're going to be ready or not or whether you're sick or hurt or this day this is going to happen. So to know that that is going to happen and to be nervous and to train for that and to put so much energy and wake up early and do a and drink this special juice and do this and, and you know, eat healthy and all this stuff that only makes you know more sure of yourself. And when the day happens, you know, like then after. So it makes me feel alive. I, all these feelings that you get before you fight or when you're fighting or training for a fight. It makes me feel alive and I love that feeling.

Speaker 3:          02:01:56       Now if you take away competition from my life, I will go crazy. I'll go, I'll go crazy. I would just wouldn't know. What days would you seem like? Repetitive. I have no passion. I lose my drive. I kind of just start going down a dark hole. So I think that Jujitsu competitions really makes me feel alive and every time before I feel nervous and then after when I win or lose it, it's just a, you only gain. And when you know that you're going to have a fight, you gained. Because you know that you've got to be at your best, so you always like, how am I going to get my better? You're never good enough, and then it's just so. It makes me feel real good.

Speaker 1:          02:02:35       Well, one of the things that I feel is missing in today's society is that people can get by really easily. You know, all you have to do is show up for work, do your job, go home, eat food, go to sleep. You don't have to struggle to acquire that food. You don't have to really go through life or death scenarios on a daily basis. For most people, a life or death scenario is incredibly, incredibly rare, but those scenarios are sort of replicated inside the gym on a daily basis. When somebody, some Jujitsu black belt is mounting you and he's choking the shit out of you. Survival is the key thing. It's real. It's real. Like, you know, look, look, if, if I'm rolling and you know John Jocks on top of me and he's got an arm triangle and I might black out, I'm 100 percent certain, he's not going to kill me. He'll tap me, you know, I'll go. Even if he chokes me up and go to sleep, I know that I'm going to survive. But you don't feel that at the time when you're, when you are getting choked, that is life or death. It really, truly is.

Speaker 3:          02:03:40       Can't fake those feelings that you feel when you're training and you put yourself through all these situations. And I've been put to sleep many times in training, you know, and you know, that's a crazy feeling. You know, it's a crazy feeling to like

Speaker 8:          02:03:51       I don't want it to have been. I don't want. I'm going to almost get out and I'm going to own more than.

Speaker 3:          02:03:57       And then you just wake up and you mother fuckers are laughing at.

Speaker 8:          02:04:01       So

Speaker 1:          02:04:03       that's, that's feeling

Speaker 3:          02:04:04       that you cannot replace. There is no other way that you're going to be able to feel that unless you personally are like living in that moment and no matter what, there's nothing more intense than somebody trying to choke you. You know, your natural, so you, you feel those feelings and, and how you deal with those feelings are going to really dedicate your life. And that's how I kind of am able to read people, is how they deal. How do they deal when they're under stress? How do they deal when they're winning? How are they deal when their. Everything's going good? Are they the same person when they're losing them, when they're winning? How do they deal with when somebody out tomorrow? So I've kind of always been really curious to see how people are and how they, how do they react, you know, how are you going to react when somebody beating you, how you interact with somebody who's, when you're, when you're winning, when, when you're stronger or how are going to rack when somebody is weaker and you're just trying to help.

Speaker 3:          02:05:01       So I think it's a kind of a great, um, experience. Jujitsu reveals character. Oh, I have no more about my students, didn't they know about themselves, you know, I will tell them exactly where they, uh, you know, I know everything about them because I've trained with them and I know what they feel, how they feel, when they're feeling great, how they feel when they're feeling weak, when they, when they, when they're winning, you know, I know how to feel if you're a coward or if you're, if you're, if you have hard, if you've patients, if you have dignity, all of these things are, are things that I can feel when I train with you. Just give me five, 10 minutes to train with you and I don't know more about you than probably you yourself, unless you're very experienced person who is yourself. So, um, and that's what I kind of judged my whole basis on is how I feel, how I judge somebody on how they train. I don't judge somebody by how they talk to me, you know, sometimes I'll get people who the super nice and they're super and super respectful in person and they were just the perfect person. Right? And then when they train, they just the, there's this malaise from them. It's weird, you know, you're like, Whoa, that malice is for real

Speaker 1:          02:06:11       malice towards other people or

Speaker 3:          02:06:14       just not how they were when they were normal, you know. So when they're able to act, they're able to put this show on for whoever, but when they're training, there's no way you can hide your personality. So. And it goes the other way too. It goes other people, sometimes people are very cold and rude and, and, and, and that's not necessarily them, they just don't feel necessarily when they train their, they're respectful and they and they, you know, they're trying to get better. So there's a lot of different ways that you can kind of feel people out. And I just kind of do my judgment on their training. I don't really care what people. Of course I care, but I don't judge too much on what you say and how you are. Of course I feel it, but when I train with you, I'll make my final decision.

Speaker 1:          02:06:57       And on that note, that's a beautiful way to describe it. I love that. I love that statement. When I train with you, I'll make my final decision. That's so true, man. That's so true. You learn so much about someone when they train. Now, as far as your goals, you've achieved world championship status in Jujitsu. What are your goals from now?

Speaker 3:          02:07:18       Uh, my goal now is to focus on MMA and, and to be the best I can be in mma. So that's my new mission. And so you have aspirations to fight in the UFC? Yeah, I mean right now I think the Japan is the bed is the better opportunity for me, but you know, whatever, if it's UFC or you know, I'd love to fight in the UFC has the best fighters in the best organization. So of course I would like to test myself against those guys.

Speaker 1:          02:07:44       So you want to try other organizations first, get your feet wet and mma and then eventually jump in.

Speaker 3:          02:07:49       I don't know exactly, but all I know is right now I have Japan to negotiate with and I know that of course wherever the best fighters are, that's where all want to be.

Speaker 1:          02:07:58       What do you, what do you think about guys like, like [inaudible] grace here, for example, he's a perfect example of a guy's, a very high level Jujitsu guy who just hasn't really been able to get that much going in mma.

Speaker 3:          02:08:10       Um, I don't train with him so I don't really know. Uh, I know that he's a legend in Jujitsu and he's been able to really excel energy to, um, but I don't train with him. I don't know necessarily how well he, what he does or anything. So, uh, I really hope that he's able to excel in mma and I really hope that he's able to, um, show what he's about and bringing the game to his game. And I saw a fight with him with the Kennedy, I think it was and I just felt like he wasn't able to find his place and he wasn't able to find, um, find himself in the fight. And I don't know if that's lack of training, lack of advice, lack of knowing what to do. I don't know what it is really. And I'm curious to see if that's going to happen with me too, because it gets also Tim Kennedy to Tim. Kenny Kenny's really good verizon animal. Very good. But

Speaker 1:          02:09:05       he's really a dangerous guy, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:09:07       a lot of stuff. Way cuts and this, that's how they start to. So there's no real, I don't know, and I'm not the owner of the truth to be able to tell you what he's doing or why he's not or what. I Dunno. He's different than me. He's a different sides of me. He's a huge guy. Um, I would love to see him just whoop ass, you know, I would love to see them do really well, but his thought was a little different than mine. You know, he is bigger. He, I'm not. I have to 100 rely 100 percent rely on my technique and my leverage. And, and uh, we'll see what happens. I'm really curious. That's why I'm in this is to see and to prove to the people what I'm about. So I hope harsher winds and I hope he does well and I'm hoping he's able to find himself and really be able to be where he's at, which is the number one place, you know, that's where he deserves to be.

Speaker 1:          02:09:55       Were you there for any of horrors, MMA fights? No. He, um, he had some disastrous, disastrous results in MMA. Get some really high level guys were, it seems like maybe he took some fights that maybe wasn't quite prepared for. Um, do you learn from anything like that when you see him fighting? Guys like he fucked kid Yamamoto. Right? And kinky, pseudo and real, real high level guys.

Speaker 3:          02:10:23       Yeah. I don't know, I, I just, uh,

Speaker 1:          02:10:26       but he's another example of a very technical Jujitsu guy. Very high level.

Speaker 3:          02:10:31       I'm curious, you know, I'm curious to see. I'm going to be about in mma really for me to say sit here and tell you and be and act like I know what I'm doing and like I know the rules and I like, I know that the truth behind everything is bullshit because I don't. And I'm in it just like you're curious to see how I'm going to do. I'm curious to see how I'm going to do too and I hope I do well and I hope I am able to, to, to, to do everything that I want to do, but I don't know. I don't know if that's going to happen and that's why we're going to. That's why I go there and test myself because if I knew I was going to win, I probably wouldn't even fight.

Speaker 1:          02:11:05       Well, that's a beautiful aspect of what you're trying to do. The fact that you embracing a challenge that you are, you are gravitating towards the most difficult thing you could possibly do. And I can't to see what you're saying. You know, it's beautiful. The attitudes, beautiful. Your, your, your thought process behind it, the reason why you're doing it in the first place. It's all, all the right stuff and all that stuff. Thank you.
