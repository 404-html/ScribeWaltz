Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Boom. And we're Lively's gentlemen who has special guest. Well, Jimmy didn't think he was going to be here. This was a total surprise. This is awesome. Yeah. I'm shooting something tomorrow and I want it to watch the fights. I'm like, at this point, I didn't think you'd be in town. You're always off. Like every time I call he's like guy, he's a way, he's hunting, he's unreachable. Um, and I was just happy that you get back to me. Yeah, dude was perfect timing. Uh, you know, we uh, decided a while ago, well I was supposed to be out of town too. Um, and then, uh, decided to come back and make it back in time for this. I'm like, wow, we should definitely do a fight companion. So we decided to, but uh, Eddie was available, luckily should be what? Be watching the UFC. Oh, we are going to watch two different things at the same time, folks, this should be fucking complete.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       The deal is that the Canelo Alvarez fight is supposed to start at eight o'clock. That's what they've been pushing. And, uh, I think they're doing that because they're trying to get a lot of people in the east coast to buy it because after 11:00 PM you're like, Jesus Christ, I want to go to sleep. You know, because they were doing them a lot of times, like 9:00 PM nine 30, it's fucking midnight, New York. It's crazy. You're tired. Even Saturday people can do it, but it's like, it's tough to, when it goes out and 1112 o'clock at night, it's not wise, especially with boxing because boxing has weak. Undercards not necessarily saying that this is a week fight. Right. But even if they have a good undercard, what do they have? Like two fights, right? I mean, how many fights they have. You don't want to see more than that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       No, I'm not going to pay per view. The worst part is when you, when you watch one of these fights on the east coast, by the time you get out the arena, get your car, it's, you have time for one drink maybe, and then they shut down bars. Well, the good thing is really east coast, they shut down bars at four in New York for a year. You can go back to the hotel room, take a shower, take a little power nap, and then you're ready to go to the after party. Writes over it like tenish it's way better. It's way better. I never watched boxing anymore either. Like I watched Conor and Floyd just to watch it, but I never watch. Uh, but I think I watched the last triple g fight. That's it. I watch all of his fights and I watch it all Canelo's fights and uh, you know, it's weird. So when you're watching a guy started slow down, like I watched him Miguel Cotto fight and he won. But he's getting hit more than he used to get hit. It's like 36 now, you know, I don't think they have UFC style testing though. They don't have like Usada they don't have a Jeff Novitsky so these guys can get away with a lot more. It's a little slippery with like, I don't think they did steroids in boxing. That's hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       Illegal Dude. You know what, you got to see it. Caerus I don't know how you say it is an ecourse or oh, you are? Yeah, but I would say that it's one of those words that have only read the documentary. It's fucking amazing. And it's all on this Russian doctor that was like one of the top guys over there for steroids and how, what, how much shit they can give you and you still test negative. Holy Fuck. These guys are wizards. This is, they take this guy who's the, uh, the main person in the documentary and they, they just pump them full of steroids. He's like, I want you to have a full cc of this and five of, I mean, shooting like six, seven things in his past filling an experiment. Yes. Oh, can experiment with this Russian guy who's response. One of the things they said was that out of the Russian athletes, there was some estimate in the high nineties of percentage of people that are on steroids who wasn't on steroids.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       Well, he still like to this day in Rio, they were actually the Olympics. We're thinking about banning the entire Russian team. They'll like, their anti-doping program is so sophisticated and so state sanctioned. Well, can they pass Usada testing though? Could they pass that lol? No, I mean it depends because they see the sought of thing. They'll show up at your fucking house, you know, like you have to give your whereabouts at all times. Yeah, they'll, they'll catch you. And the other thing is they keep your piss and to keep your blood and they keep it for a long time. I think like seven or eight years. And they actually just busted a guy who won the Olympics, I think in tooth, I want to say 2008 and 2012 or something like that. But uh, I think it was two guys. I don't know, maybe Jamie could find it, but they, they took away their gold metals, these Russian wrestlers, they busted them eight years later, way later that they didn't have a test for whatever they were doing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:17       So that's what happens. It's like these guys are one step ahead, but then the test catch up, you know, and then they find stuff in them and they retroactively go and grab your shit from from years ago. It's like when they saved somebodies head like Ted Williams hoping they can find a cure for whatever he died from and bring him back. That's why they freeze your body or freeze your head. Right. That's so crazy. The freezing the head thing is so bananas. You're like, well listen for $5 more we can keep your body. No Dude, you know I'm taking a chance as it is. Let's just go with the head. Just the head. Yeah, just the idea that they're going to just keep your head frozen and then you need to get like they don't wake you up amongst the first people you get woke up after they figured out how to reattach heads to bodies.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       You get woken up way later. Like I figured I'd just had a re animate dead bodies that won't be that big of a deal, but then attach heads on a new body like that's a couple more decades. Lets you talk to Ray Kurzweil. He thinks we're going to have that in 15 years. It's very wishful timeline. Is it possible to be such a famous fighter, you have s you're rubbing shoulders with a powerful, the elite. You're so famous. Is it possible for, for a fighter and have so much fame that he has connections to the Illuminati? No, the people that tell them our group, the people tends to steroids. It, he would never get busted. Like it's totally winky, winky. Certain foods. Is that possible? It's totally possible, but it's just super unlikely because there's too many pieces involved. Too many people would know and it's uh, also there's no benefit to them.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       They would have to be getting paid shit. Tons of money. It's just so sneaky like that in order if you have, cause you, what if someone dies, you know like what if someone gets a ship eight out of the winds up dying and turns out that these people got ahold of money and that's what allowed them to not do drug tests on this guy. And this guy was on Jews and then he goes in and beat someone to death. It's Kinda hard to keep anything electronically. A secret. I mean, the head of the CIA could make a fucking email disappear. This the Russians, no one got buses to returns driven. Matter of everything gets out. No one goes to jail. Please step down. Now he had to step down because he would have you, I'm just saying what you say Jim. I missed it electronically.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       You can't, nothing's a secret anymore. Like we're not always his name. The head of the CIA who was cheating and he got busted that stupid email. Yeah. Betrayal of trust yet. And he was, you know, a war hero? Yeah. He ran the a, the whole, what they call it, the uh, the theater. He was a, do you know the story behind him though? How he got caught? I think you're investigating someone else, right? No. He was hooking up with a chick and the chick was a little mouthy. Didn't she write his book? His biographer? Ah, I think there was her and I think there was another one and the other one. What might have been a part of some freaky marriage situation where the husband and wife banging other people or something. It was, it got, it got heavy enough where it was weird. Yeah, and the one of the ways they got Patraeus out of there was like through some sort of adultery clause, which is hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       It's like a morals clause is one of the best killers in the military and you're telling him if you bang on the chicks we won't let you kill people. All information that's coming from the mainstream. Who knows what really how those guys tell the truth knows what's going on. Yeah. Who knows what that is, why they made him do that. Like what? What pieces might have fallen into play Frank Underwood's style that allow that to happen. Who they piss off Elliot Spitzer piss somebody off 10 years ago and they went and digging and they got him. Well Spitzer went after the banks Spitz. It's really a shame about Spitzer because in any other era, Eliot Spitzer would have been probably like a big time hero, like some sort of a like clean him up cop type of guy who's like looking out for the good guy. The problem is there was some serious or proxy because it turns out that he was actually targeting brothels as well as visiting and which is just, yeah man, you can't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:08       Like it's just, that's even, it's one thing if he just got hookers, sure. But the fact that the guy was arresting all of those [inaudible] out of his way for it. Yeah. He's a real douche and it's like, that's why I love to see these guys who legislate against gay people get busted and restrooms and stuff because you're actively trying to fuck somebody life. Oh, for sure. And it's always those people. It's always those people that care so much, they get angry at gay people. You know? It's just such a classic story writing. They're hiding, hiding their whole life that they're, they overdo it just so that no one sniffs them out. It's such a classic cliche that you see it. You're like, Oh God. So, so obvious. Did a great documentary on politicians who are outed, like who were anti gay but got out of there as being gay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       You know what it's like. It's like that really scrawny type of male feminists that's always like sticking up for women and saying like, of course you are like, it's such a cliche. It's, it's almost the same cliche as the gay guy that's it hates gay marriage and hates gay people because he's trying to cover it up. It's usually these guys that are like overwhelmed with lust. The women seem so impossible to, to get with that. They, they morph themselves into this like a semi real human being that only looks out for women's issues all the time. 24 seven. It doesn't see anything wrong with women ever. You know that guy where it's like you're not even real anymore. Yeah. It gets you to put on you because then you're, then you're fucking allowed to walk among them and be comfortable and they trust you and they call you an ally.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       You're an ally and they fucked the allies. So everyone wants to be an Alpha course. Watch the UFC. Ah, Eddie Brown like boxing, but luck man, they keep punching each other. Ah, it is interesting how it becomes way less interesting. Right? Yeah. I haven't watched watch anymore a good, well I watched Mayweather versus a Connor. She thought that was interesting. I was in Iceland for that. It was like five o'clock in the morning. He was in a bar and it was fun to watch because of, you know, again, I wanted to see if cotton would do okay but Mayweather against anybody else that have no interesting cause that was fun. That was lots of fun. I like watching that guy fight period. I'm always, I watched may whether even if it's a boring ass fight cause what you're watching is some guy that just can do things that other people who are not able to do. He's, yeah, he's going to be one step ahead. I just don't enjoy them. Like I watched the uh, the pack. Y'all fight in a bar and I was like, Ugh, what am I you one round from the next? I look exactly the same and what channel on to 19 to 19. Thank you sir.

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       So what we're going to do folks is just go back and forth from the fight. So you got that c you're totally hardcore MMA fan. Would you consider yourself, I love the podcast. That's her Matthew, the UFC podcast fan. That's like the expert and I'm like the guy who can do the more humans I use every UFC or you're going to try to watch unless you've got something going on. I watch most of them. I usually watch them the next day on the uh, fight pass cause I'm usually doing gigs Saturday night too. Matt is Great. I love that too. He's such a great guy. He took Eddie and I into his gym when in like 2001 or some shit. Remember that he took us to his, Jimi picked us up at the train station. We took the train in the long island. He took us, picked us up in the train station, took it to his gym, showed us his apartment in the basement where he used to pee in a jug because he drank so much water he couldn't get out of bed cause he needed his sleep because he was fighting. So he would just carry a jug and put it right by the bed and just piss in the jug in the middle of the night. It was hilarious. Matt Serra is awesome. Yeah. And he's such a real guy. Like he's exactly that guy all the time. He's great. He's great. What a great move it is to have him on that. Dana white looking for a fight show and to have him on your podcast. Well he had the podcast first and I think that they asked him, couple of people and

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       when he, when Dana brought up my name, he's like, yeah, I would love to it because we got a long while. So it's a fun dynamic. I mean you could just fun and you guys got jelled with each other. You know, you gel. Yeah. But you could see it's like you guys are friends. It's fun. That's like a big thing, man. You know? And I think people underestimate that. It's one of the reasons why these TV shows sometimes are so stale and flat. They're stiff. Yeah, well they don't like each other. Then our friends with each other, you know, like people like when they see people who actually like Goldberg and I like when we used to do broadcast together Goldberg's my friend, like I really liked that guy. And Jon Anik, same thing. Annex my friend Dominic Cruz, my friend, like I hanging out with that guy.

Speaker 2:          00:12:35       He's interesting. Paul Felder. Like I could hang out with these guys. That's big man. You know? That's why people like these kinds of podcasts. That's why people like, you know, anything where people get together and they can hang out and you feel like a real camaraderie versus like entertainment tonight store is back and boy and see angry. Yes, he is. Mike Thor's back in the newest, most amazing version of Thor. Let's take a look like those people don't, even if they are friends, you can't tell. It's, it's unwatchable and it's unlistenable and it doesn't feel, it feels like nothing you can connect to, so I don't know anybody I speak to like that. Exactly. I was going to tell each other to shut up on that show. I wonder if w with wonder woman now at the forefront of sports and technology and shut the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       Yeah, it's annoying. They have like these pre scheduled scheduled promos that they do. They feel so stale and everything's just stay. Well that's why even on TV I go back and watch old Dick Cavett Shit like interview bishop prior in 1985 I'd rather hear a real conversation with dead moments then like a late night TV show now where everybody thinks they're on fire every time the camera's are on this terrible. Most of them. These like entertainment shows like shows on entertainment, like pool. That's hard to get right will you used to be that the networks had all the power and there wasn't ever a PR a content problem. It wasn't like, damn, we need content that was slots. There's Thursday eight 30 Thursday, nine o'clock they'll slot. There's just those slots. That's it. We got plenty of motherfuckers trying to make pilots and that's never a problem with content.

Speaker 2:          00:14:10       Now it's the opposite. Now they need content so more people can get their shit out now it used to be totally controlled. TV has always suck. You can't watch aid. We Watch TV shows that we grew up on because we had no choice. You would. I would watch TV going, okay, what's the best of this? These terrible shows. I'll just watch that. You're like, fuck it badly just to love think some of them were good back then to right now, the fall guy. Watch now. Watch a Paul Guy now I can't probably doesn't. Hold on TV. Didn't have to be good. You're right. He had all the control now. Shit, it has to be good and now you need content. The $6 million different world

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       holds up. The Sasquatch episode reflect the Big Foot Douchey, just thing ever on television and I couldn't wait to watch the fight tomorrow. Louis Martinez, Sergio, more eyes. This is a great fucking fight. Gomar Huisman is a stud wrestler. Fucking serious athlete and [inaudible] is one of the best Jujitsu guys in MMA today for sure. Tapped out chrome Gracie and its first black belt match. He's a legit anybody that he's the guy that set up then mounted triangle. Right. Nice and slow. Yeah. You know what he said once about one of his opponents, he said it would be more likely that he got me pregnant than submit me.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       He was talking about an improvements in is striking. It's like in striking, I think I have the advantage and in the ground it would be more likely that he got me pregnant and then you submit me. That's how bad ass that mother fucker is. But Camaros Huisman is a stud and he is super legit. Fantastic wrestler with really good striking, very strong guy. Very dangerous. Could be future superstar world champion guy type of guy. You'd have to take out Leeanne Edwards, just Edwards actually doing really well against him. It seemed like in the first round and then like you know once he had them on the ground he was finished. So see us, he's a savage. You got to watch a match ISM ground and pound vicious from wrestler. He can do everything, man. He could submit guys, you know he's, he's a super stud wrestler but he absolutely can do all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:16:18       What are his best American top team guy? So he's like a black belt in Jujitsu. No wonder what he is and Jiu Jitsu. I wonder like if he's ranked, but you know like there's a lot of guys that aren't ranked like Michael [inaudible]. Michael Kass in my mind is like a black belt but he's not even ranked. Should that fight him and stop your thing? No, definitely not. Never. You don't stop chokes. Why would you stop a choke? You let a guy go to sleep so he's up. He's actually fit. If the guys unconscious, he was clearly not unconscious guys get out of shit. You've got to give him an opportunity to get out of shit. His arms were like this man. You're right. Stop it. Cause there's no next move. Yamasaki stopped it early. Yes. He should have let him go out. Yes, yes. But a 100% Yamasaki everybody, any black belt knows when a guy's about to go out his before he goes out, his hands go like this and that's what happens a lot of times.

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       If you let go with the choke, you pop right back up and say you're all totally correct. But Buddy, she did let him go to sleep. Shit, let him go to sleep. And here's the other thing. This is our absolutely also possible to some guys when they're getting choked, they will concentrate just on their neck and they were tight enough their neck and they won't do this and fight around with it. They would literally put all their energy and concentration on the neck and avoiding the choke by just squeezing and holding on their neck. If they think they have a little bit of blood flow, if they could force a little bit of blood flow and they think that they can stay conscious longer than the guy can squeeze, I don't buy it for the long haul. I think the on the long haul, a guy like you know, someone who someone is a really good fight, like a Damien Maia Guy, he's gonna fucking put you to sleep.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       You can't, you can't do that on him, right? The question is can I do it on Kevin? But even I don't want him to go down. He's very good. Even when you're tightening your now, but he's not limp if he's doing this, okay, this is, his arms are here, right? So if he's concentrating on his neck and his arms are here, if he really does decide to stop doing this and just try to just concentrate on his neck, it's not a good strategy, but it might be something you would use if you thought you were fucked. If you thought you're fucked, you in a really bad spot and you really can't peel his arms off, and he goes, you know what, I might be able to just power through and he might not, he might've had a tap or it might even want to sleep or he might have gotten out.

Speaker 1:          00:18:27       We don't fucking know because guys have gotten out of some crazy shit. In fact, earlier that night, the woman who got it right. Yeah. Who I fuck, I forget that fight. What was that fight? Find out? Um, what the card was on the Kevin Lee Michael Key s a fight. But the point is it's not dangerous. It's not like a, an arm bar or taking punishment on the ground. Like when someone takes a couple of extra shots on the ground that aren't necessary, that that's bad. But if someone gets choked out, that's not bad. It's not bad. You've got to let him get choked out. You're not preventing anything

Speaker 2:          00:19:01       damage. Glen. Um, who just, it just a, that fight that should have been stopped on the, I want to say it was one of the prelims tug. Gavin Tucker. Yeah. Guaranteed against brick land. That was bad. I saw Dana tweeting. I hadn't seen the fight yet. He's like this referee. And then when I watched it fight like this must've been the fight. He was talking. Well, you know what the thing is, is that it was a slow beating work was giving him a slow beating. He just kept beating him up. It was, there was no giant big bombs, but it was a cumulation of bombs. It never ended. It just, he was so workman, like in professionals. Very, very impressive victories. Is that why he didn't get, I thought he should have got like a, a fight of the night or, or performance of the night. I mean, I thought that that was a pretty amazing, and he didn't get anything for that, which were the girls that, uh, almost choked the shit out of each other.

Speaker 2:          00:19:43       Was it flees, Harrigan, Justine Kush? Yes, it was. Was that seen Keshon fleets Herrick? Is that the fight where she shit or know who on that? Uh, I believe police did right? When did that happen? Yeah. Philly's won last week. No, that, no, that was a couple of months ago. I was asked to fight that fight that Kish had that allegedly she hit herself. Oh, whatever happened. Yeah. I Dunno if she did or not. It's supposedly that can be grounds to stop a fight. Now it's like in the rules like if they, you shit yourself, it's too dangerous cause there's all like scratches and shit. Yeah. If you have cut so you can get like the worst staph infection known to man and plus you may make a move to avoid being put in that. That's going to put you in other kinds of danger. Like just you, you want your face mushed in that you may do something right. Your neck and Jennifer is a very good point. If someone's going 69 on you, if you're in like north south position, which is legit position and this dude just shit himself. That's super rude. Yeah. Yeah. It's a bad place to be. But hey man, it's life and death in there. [inaudible] he would go,

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       this is a good fucking fight

Speaker 2:          00:20:46       is like Ooh, what's going

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       to happen here? Fight. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:51       Dan Merkel Yada dance lemon down. Yeah. He's the only 500 pounds now cause gigantic policy. Huge. He's like at least six five and he's not like a tall thin guy. Users at giant for real though. He's probably 300 pounds easy. Very interesting. He's one 74 51 of the first round, (504) 094-0840 seven if you want to sync it up with us. 42 41 we're rise is missing a tricep on his left arm has got one missing. I know he's got a bicep misery. What happened? What happened to the tricep? His uh, arm tour and he never got surgery on or if he got surgery it never came back. But look, you could see it doesn't really have a tricep on his left arm. It doesn't start when he got hurt, he got hurt to the bomb. Oh Shit. He's in a lot of trouble.

Speaker 2:          00:21:45       He's a, he's in a lot of trouble and get on top of it and the get that he's hurt and he's on his back and he won't get on top of it. Yeah, but that's smart. Like make them stand out with your team to let off on him. But he's on his back on his back. He might have a chance to do something standing up. He's getting tooled. I'm agreeing with you, Joe. I'm just, it's smart. Mariah's recently. Yeah, it's smart. I mean, wouldn't you tell them if you were Comoros coach, fuck cow. You're like, don't go in the rounds of sky lit up, kick kick his calf because not theirs, isn't it that chance? He's just gonna wrap his arms around you and catch his breath. Oh, 100%. How do don't get any my sweep you, you might, you might think he's more tired than he is.

Speaker 2:          00:22:22       He might recover quicker than you think. Next thing you know, he's got deep half on you and next thing you know, Ooh, he's swinging and he might have a better shot on his back then he does standing. Hey, how long before someone starts doing sidekicks and front kicks to the calves and to the, to the shins. How long before like a Shin Kit comes back like in school? Remember when that hurt? Like a motherfucker. Kids would kick kids in the shins. Yeah, but I think that after that, that civil, I've been fight and get on your toes. You have done, if you curl your foot back in, uh, like a front kick,

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       oh shit. It's illegal kick, right? Yeah. I think it's legal. If you could sidekick the thigh, if you could, uh, we'll kick the head. How, how has anything to do like illegal. It's Hilarious, right? Yeah. Well in almost mean how many people that get hit on the back of the head. That's one thing I was noticing about boxing tonight. Guys will complain while they're in the middle of an exchange of a punch hits the back of the head. I touched the back of their head like, hey, you're cheating. You're hitting me back here to fucking hit me back here. It's almost like an excuse for getting hit at all. You fucking never see that in the UFC in stand up. He never see guys complaining about getting hit in the back of the head. You hear about it on the ground. You know, like you hear about like sometimes when a guy is trying to finish someone, they'll hit him all over the place and sometimes it'll hit the head whether it's on purpose or not. They only know, but standing up you never hear it. What did you think? That referee

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       is? Pretty Tall. He's out. He's out. Oh Shit. Wow. That was sensational. I told you tomorrow Huisman is legit. That that dude is seriously talented. Upstanding up was a smart move. Yeah. He could be the one. That guy could be a legit world champion. I believe he's undefeated too. Here's one loss. Who's his loss too? He was like, it was his second fight or something. I think he's in a long, long winning streak. Who's his lost to jamming Camaros? Man, I'm a problem. I said, oh man. For some reason I thought it was like Nigerian. He came when he was young. I asked him about it that he's faced. Serious wrestler, serious athlete. Siri did get everything so thick is speed and the thing is man, he didn't even start out as a striker. Jose, he wrestled in college. He got submitted way back in CFA 11 in a second profile.

Speaker 1:          00:24:47       Boom to look at the speed on that shit. What about the shot? Hello? Take that too. Is that Dan just giving this guy an extra second to see if he didn't stop, stop his eyes rolled back. I just wanted to see if the guy was conscious cause if he rolled and then he was looking at him and he had his hands up, he would let it go. Stop it fish. So you don't think it should have been stopped before that car? She had to get that second floor. You know what one extra punch. It's a violent sport. They could have stopped it but he could have recovered. That was the perfect stop it. She got to let it play out a little bit and it's hard to do. Dan's one of the best in the business though. He's so good. He's on t he liked you very rarely have complaints about Dan Merkel, Yada fighters hate I'll fighters hate.

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       Dan stopped early. You know Jay Gavin Tucker actually said that he thanked that referee for not stopping at chance, but that's just the guy was too tough for his own good. That's just first lost though. I mean he's a really tough dude and like he, he, there was no way he was going to quit but it isn't. It's like orbital socket all fucked up. I mean he's going to have a lot of things wrong with him. He got beat up real bad. It was a bad beating. He took a beating for, I mean the first round it took a while before, you know, it got sort of lopsided. But then from the second round on it was pretty obvious that Rick Lynn wasn't getting tired and you're just pushing this crazy steady pace and just Gavin could not keep up with them and Rick was long and he couldn't get close to him and Rick just had this very workman Lee approach just cap on him and the dude just started breaking.

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       Just the guy who knows a guy who's been around for a long time and then the least the way Frankie Edgar beat up on y'all, y'all Rodriguez and your guy, he's been around for a long time. Who knows how to beat the hot young guy coming up. Well Frankie Edgar's on a totally different level cause Frankie can keep this ferocious pace that's so few people can keep up with like yeah, he thought he could, might keep up with it. He thought like maybe when I get in there I'll be able scrambled this guy, I'll be able to keep up with them. My gout ground games pretty good. Probably worked on get back up to his feet, probably thought I'll surprise them. I'll surprise him and when we're kicking standing up, he's not gonna be able to deal with my shit. They just realize there's levels to this thing.

Speaker 1:          00:26:49       Frankie Edgar is on that world championship level. Is that what he's thinking? Probably is like there's no way Frankie's didn't get close enough to me. I'm going to be able to keep him away from me. Well or catch him coming in or Frankie might try to exchange with them on the feet and he has a chance to land something or maybe it's takedown defense is better than you know. Frankie thinks it is. There's a lot of thoughts that go into your head when he tried to pull something like that off, but it was, if you are as a manager, there's not, it's not the fight to make, it's just not the fight. It's the one of the worst fights to make. It's good to find out how you do against an elite wrestler, but not the elite wrestler. The guy who is a lightweight world champion, now he's coming down to one 45 was the only guy has been able to beat him as Aldo. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       here's the decision I think, right? Yeah. I mean, Frankie's Goddamn world class, although might have his number, I don't know. But that doesn't mean that Frankie can't beat a lot of guys. He fucked up cub Swanson like easily his world championship level. But sometimes like guys, just for whatever reason, can't be another guy. Like Joe Frazier was always a world championship level. Boxer could not be George Foreman. If they fought a hundred times, George following would've beat him a hundred times. Yeah. And that's got to get into your head after. I mean, I mean, John's called me only twice and plus all this stuff that happened there is always that one guy that you just can't do anything against theirs. There's guys that have a solution to your style, you know? Do you remember, um, sugar? Shane Mosley? Sure. Vernon Forrest. Verna Forrest just had this solution to sugar. Shane Mosley, I believe he beat him twice, you know, and it was like one of those things where Vernon didn't look the best rest in peace.

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       He got shot actually is a terrible story man. Cause that someone was trying to rob his car and he tried to stop someone from Robin as cotton that shot him. The gas station in Atlanta. Is that the guy I'm thinking of? Yeah. Yeah. Chase the guys still like he chased him in a fucking pop them. It was, yeah. And apparently he was a super nice guy. It's just a really, really sad store. But he like, he could shine against Shane in a way that he couldn't shine against other people. Yeah. But then like Ricardo my org and knocked him out. Remember, I don't remember if I Believe Mountain Mel Mayorga knocked him out. Definitely beat him. I believe actually my Shane Mosley, one of my first UFC event, he was there. It's, I'm, I want to say it's 2008 2000 I might in a rampage fight 2009 mm.

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       It's weird to watch boxers and those things and how they react. It is weird, right. But watching Bernard high, stepping on a behind bug, Bernard Hopkins and Yale, he had critical things to save a bunch of guys rolling around. It looks gay. And then watching him and his trainers watch the guys on the ground that they were there watching the standup, they were fine, but what they really got impressed with was the stuff on the ground because that's the stuff he can't do. So it was interesting to watch him kind of watch his opinion change as he was there. Right? Yeah. I mean they have to talk. The problem is there's like these, these camps like look at that. Boom, look at that right hand. Good Lord. That was clean. Like you see him shaking his head. He's totally out of it. There were the timing on this. Oh, that's so good. Uh, but you know, people just get lumped off into camps. I get what sports better. That's so silly. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:54       It's so silly because boxing at its highest level like tonight, well we're going to watch and just hopefully like five or 10 minutes they're walking out now. Oh Shit. That is a very compelling, do you know that's one of the main differences right there. What you just saw we spend, that's where the main differences between UFC in every sport is the, the way that fighters treat the fans and interacting with the fans. You just don't see that in any other sport. No, it's true. They, and there was a lot of events where people get to meet fighters, they do a lot of events, a lot of signings and share it and go meet him and hang out with them, getting invested in them and you get connected to them. So then when they're on the prelims and the under car, you still want to watch them fight.

Speaker 1:          00:30:30       Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot, a lot of good things. The UFC figured out that boxing had fucked up and now boxing is kind of take picked up the slack and a lot of ways. Rob Font, powerful rob font, he's a Markdale grottos student. Very talented guy and they also figured out giving you the fights that you want to say. Yup. Let's just give you the fights. Don't make it wait five years, like, which we did with uh, uh, Tyson Holyfield just put the fight together. Make it happen. You don't have 10 different promoters working on it. Yeah. It's hard to do that with boxing, you know? Sure. I mean, this Canelo a Gennady Golovkin fight. This is a unification middleweight title fight. Let's go to her right now. It's uh, it's very fucking hard to get these things to pull off.

Speaker 3:          00:31:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       It's all the behind the scenes people. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:31:21       Back thing is not working.

Speaker 1:          00:31:31       Hey, real quick. All right. You think the bathroom is saved now? I gave it the mandatory hour. Yeah. That's a good hour. All right. Let me try to find this. Jamie. What did, where am I supposed to point? This fucking thing? That side. Okay. Now it's working big fight for branch. Huge dude that they give him Luke Rockhold. It's kind of crazy. Is this his first fight in the UFC? No. No. He used to be in the UFC a while back and then, um, I guess I'm going to have to keep doing that. So to 19 button or something. Yeah, it's not working. Um, one 23 maybe. Okay. Hang on a sec. This is the most boring part of the podcast ever. What did you just ask me? David Branch. He fought, I'm Gerald Harris way back in the day. Gets slammed and code. This is like his first fight in the UFC. He was in a, Gerald Harris has guard and he slammed him and knocked him out cold. So it was a good fight up until that moment. But he was in, his guard is trying to his guard

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       and he got just body slam and got knocked out from it. Yeah, he got picked up in the guard like a Rona rampage. Gerald Harris a stud. He um, he didn't get picked up that high. It wasn't like that. That's the craziest shit of all time cause that wasn't the guard. That was a trial bridge. Think of that. Crazy. Extra higher. Ooh, that's terrifying. That's the most terrifying slam of all times. We watched that the other day. He did? Yeah. We watched the head. The head collide as he slammed into the ground and you see Rampage's head smashing der Rhona's head dude. Nobody could spell rampage. Slam people. All right folks, so Gennady Golovkin just walked out. I got all those belts. Motherfuckers. A lot of belts. Like a 23 or 24 first round knockout streak to be something something preposterous. Not Cruiser checking account. They're bull champions. Not Heavier.

Speaker 2:          00:33:36       The well Gennady Golovkin it's been fighting at a heavier weight class and a Canelo fought Floyd Mayweather I think at one 52 and I think earlier in his career he fought lighter than that, I believe. Early way earlier too though. Fans? Yes. He was a young guy. When you were, when you went pro like real young. What? What's that? He had 23 straight chaos in the first round. Gennady Golovkin did, is that what you're saying? Yeah, 23 straight chaos. But then he went to, I don't think they were on the first day. They weren't. No. Okay. First. I'm just adding to his legend for no reason and how it's making sure most of them, he would break guys down over fight all the hype and the Promo. How it blew him up. He's at like from that fight. He's like a national hero. Couldn't hello? Kayla was already a national hero.

Speaker 2:          00:34:23       Not Quite as big as he is now. Yeah. I guess the main with if I made a big, but when it just beat the shit out of Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. That's terrible. Terrible fight. That was sad to watch. Yeah. My mom didn't know who Canelo was before that. Mayweather fight. Now she worships him. I don't love the daddy that it'd be honest with you as Mexican as it gets. Isn't it sad to watch a guy like Julio Cesar Chavez Jr fight a guy like Canelo? Like you could tell one of them, oh dude, this is supposed to be the ones in the family business. He's not that good. You get knocked out just now. You got to heat up that. He went into a defensive shell. He just stopped firing back at all. It was just getting tooled on, you know, he reminded me of the kid and the bad news bears.

Speaker 2:          00:35:02       Remember the kid when he had you holding the ball and he's so pissed off at his father and his father slapped him in the face and he won't throw the ball home. That's what he reminded me of jargon. That fight just like fucking just kind of stand there letting it happen. It was hard to watch man. I was like, this kid doesn't need to be doing this. Like he doesn't really want to do it. Didn't it seem like he didn't want to fight? Yeah, he definitely didn't want to fight the head like a panic attack. No. I just think you realized that there was just a level of commitment the canal possesses that he just doesn't and he knew it in the, there's like tells in their interviews like Max Kellerman does a very nice interview when he sits down with two fighters and he sits in between of him. He asked some questions

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       and Alaskan questions and they have this like translate thing back and forth. But you could see like psychologically Canelo had a big advantage over him. You know, Canelo was just saying, look, you know, his, his fight career, it's been a disgrace. I fought the best of the best. And uh, he, his, you know, his father was amazing and it was an incredible world champion, but, uh, he's just never lived up to the hype and you could see like, you know, he was like, well, we'll know. Yeah, it's not going on back. I'm going to know. That's a very poor comeback. Was He good though? Was he like before Canelo he's always been good. He's always been a fighter. No, he's, he's, he's lost to some fighters, like maybe one or two. I can't remember how many people, he's one of the best. He's just, and he just can't, he can't get that belt.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       He was better I think a few years ago, but he was always been, he's always been a very good fighter. Like he's not a bad fighter. Like Julio, Cesar Chavez, Jr knows how to fight for sure. He's just not at this guy's level. But do you think it's because like their fathers are both, well, I'm thinking about Marvis Frazier to or your guys whose fathers, when you grow up with boxing money, it's a little harder to be motivated then kind of like that for sure. You don't have that kind of confidence, you know, that kind of means streak. It's not a coincidence that so many of these guys grow up in impoverished situations. But here's the thing, Jon Jones I don't think grew up in, I mean his family is still together. I think he had a comfortable financial childhood. I might be wrong about that, but I mean his family is all together so it's, it's, it doesn't like some guys are just better at it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:11       Yeah. But I think there's is much more the other way. Then there are guys who grew up comfortably. There's some like bill and Bam, they still lay in bed. They said grew up pretty comfortable and wealthy and was still like the biggest animal on the cool. Totally happen. You could have a kid that has all the money in the world, but they just have some psychotic drive where they just want to be the best at something. They want to prove they're not pussies. Let me even get, it could be that or it could just be, there's people that just really love testing themselves. They just really love competing and they get, you get a few steps ahead, right? Like you, you do it for a little bit and then you really start getting into it and then you get into it more and then it becomes, you come to your favorite thing to do, becomes your identity.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       Like even if you grew up with money, you could still become obsessed with something. Sure. And if you could come obsessed by being the best at anything, it's possible. It's just not as likely. It's way more likely when it's a poor kid, they grow up, you know, with a sense of urgency. He grow up with a like this knowledge in your head that hey man, it might not always be okay. Like there could be a real bad time. And a lot of times your motive for going after it is different too because you, you really do remember what it's like to have absolutely nothing. So your motive is to avoid that. Again, it's that, that's a very powerful thing. It is a very powerful thing and you can't fake that by like boxing. It's too much shit in the ring. There's just too much business happening and look at all these people and it's very unnecessary as 30 people in it Kinda, it's Kinda like that in music too because the thought is that you have to grow up and not in the same kind of, you know, impoverished or like just a serious, a broken family, lack of love.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       But then you have Chris Martins, singer from cold play. He breaks the mold, like Valedictorian, you know, brought up with money and a just a happy lot. You know, he's just, it's just one like make them, yeah, exactly. Bayless that's there. By the way, the referee, I think who was shitting on Conor and Floyd fighting, who'd want to see that? It's two different sports. Kenny Bayless. I'm pretty sure that's the ref that they, that they did not want. Oh, that's funny. Well, you know, a lot of boxing people want, like I was saying before, they want to defend boxing. They want, you know, they want to be on team boxing. And honestly, I played apart that a little bit when I had this thing with Lou Dibella very good in that, by the way. Well, it felt like it was pretty easy. It wasn't making very good argument.

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       It's terrible argument. The problem, the other problem is, I mean, you know, if I really went to war with somebody, I said, yeah, I got that guy. It was a terrible argument. And I'm a fan, like does the dump truck, I'm a fan of boxing and I probably know a lot. I bet if he and I sat down and we just start talking about classic fights, Hagler Hearns you know, sugar ray Leonard, Roberta it around, like he would realize like really quick, I'm a legit boxing fan. I fuckin love boxing. How many rounds did Hagler Hearns go was at three. Yes. Yes. What did you draw with Third Hagler? Oh, I don't know. He had that fight with Mayweather though, where Mayweather just Mayweather did a genius thing. First of all, I made him cut a lot of weight and him get down to one 52 drained him up a little bit and then you know, he caught him before he reached the level that he's at now.

Speaker 1:          00:40:14       Like when he fought Amir Khan America, he fucked Amir Khan up dude with a haymaker of her right hand. And you know when you, when he landed that bomb and put Amir Khan to sleep, you've got to go. Okay, this is a guy that's now at the fucking peak of his game. So when he fought Mayweather, Mayweather caught him right when he was getting into it. You Know Ryan, when he was coming up and that may where the fight I think took them over the top. When you fight a guy that's a slick and it's talented fucking fast and the timing that may whether has, and you realize like there's levels to this thing. It's the Lufkin fighting it the way he normally five. Oh yeah, this is his weight, man. He's the king. This guy's a beast. I know the guys behind him look exactly like him too. The good thing about this fight is what's interesting is Gooden. Golovkin. Some experts believe that he might be slipping slightly and Canelo is coming up. And the idea is that a year ago go, Lufkin would've fucked Canelo up. This is what a lot of people believe, but now Canelo was better and Golovkin might have faded a little bit. What's the age difference? I think Lufkin is, he's older for sure, but I think he's 35 see if you could find that young. Jamie. I want to say he's 35 or 36 yeah. Oh, he's still Lufkin is what?

Speaker 1:          00:41:30       34 I think he's coming Thursday 35

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       okay. Yeah, so that's like the law is if, unless he's Jewson that's the last of the squeeze. Eight years. Yeah. When you're around. No, but I mean when you're around 35 like that's when the decline happens to almost everybody. Right? 36 it's slips. 37 slips more. 39 40. Very rarely see a 40 year old champion that's not on the sauce only now. That's why Randy coture was such an amazing, I mean, that's really what Bernard Hopkins was the most impressed Jesus. Yet he went into his fifties and he still was out boxing worldclass fighters and drop in them. You know, I mean he got fucked up by Joe Smith, but Joe Smith is a monster. The final thought we get knocked to the rain. How scary. How old is he now? 52 or 53. And he was 50 when he last thought. If he was 51 or 52 in his brain, his Pr, I've interviewed him. He's perfectly coherent. Like there's the, I don't know how he, here we go round one, ladies and gentlemen. Eddie Bravo prediction. I'm going to go with the Mexican too. You got to go with your people. I understand. Um, Norton I got to go with fuck Lufkin have to. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:42:40       I feel like either one of these motherfuckers could shock the orthotics. Don considered white. Uh, well, yeah, I mean it's definitely white. If you go to a black neighborhood and try to say the n word. Yeah. That's all you need to know is are you white? Well, can you get away with being in a black neighborhood and using the n word or that type of credibility or do not. If you're Wesley snipes dark, you can get away with using it anywhere in the world, right? Sure. So Canelo's white Canelo was actually Mexican, but he's got red fucking hair. It's crazy. It's like holes. Kazakhstan is considered white then why wouldn't Canelo be considered white? But he is white for sure. I mean he's rushing or you know, part of the former Soviet Soviet Union, China and it's right by China. Well, you know, a lot of these people have Mongolian and them. A lot of these people there, well no, it's like an Asian, but it's um, that's gangs con. I mean Gingiss con, they, I think they said some insane number, like 5% of all the men in Asia or all the people in Asia have gang is cons. Jeans. Jesus is, he's jumping loads all over the place. Everybody and killed everyone killed. Like, you know, they don't even know how many millions, but somewhere between 20 and 70 million people died directly by his hand. You and his daughter was named. Which one? Shaka chocolate cones a fee.

Speaker 2:          00:44:03       I met her on a falafel place in New York, being Godfrey chased her down the street and ran it by me. God love comes fucking this one in 200 of the whole population. The world is directly descended from Gaviscon. Look at that. Oh my God. What years was he a, was he alive because he was like the $1,200 a hundred percent of China. Yeah. Oh Dude, this is a great fight. Huh? Golovkin just double

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       jab them.

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       Ooh,

Speaker 1:          00:44:34       that's a strong jab. That might be a big factor. He's used that jab before on guys and shocked him and out Jay outboxed him. Uh, Lemieux he did that with, he came out and started popping him with the jab and a lot of people didn't expect that he can. Outbox is shit out of people. He caught him. Yeah. Oh yeah. Those are blocked though. Those nothing's happening there. Those are getting blocked. The Jab is what you got to keep an eye on. C in order counter, right hand of Canelo triple G. Yeah, he is bigger. He's taller. We'll see how that keeps landing. His face is fucked up and it's the first round.

Speaker 4:          00:45:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       He's getting lit up with that straight jab.

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       He's shaking the attitude. He shaded a lot. Well, he gets angry at people and starts talking shit to him and he puts his hands down and lets them punch him in the face. When he was breaking this one dude down, as he was breaking him down, he put his hands down and started walking towards them and letting the guy punched him. Just moving his hands slightly and then fucking digs in on him. He's a mean guy man. How blocking. Yeah, he's seen ecology that amazing though. When you drop your hands, a lot of times guys won't react immediately convinced as a school yard humiliation of a guy doing that and you missing. It's really weird to watch professional fighters not always just go right in and when someone's hands are down. Let me help you out with that. There's also a reason when you drop your hands, you don't know where the punches are coming from.

Speaker 1:          00:45:58       It's a different thing. Like it's very tricky. When someone drops their hands, you have to be very careful because things can come from anywhere. It's one of the reasons why Tommy Hearns when he jabbed, he kept his hand down here and pop it up in your face. It's do you don't see it as much. You don't see it. It's quick. If someone's standing right here and you see this and you see that you see the hands a little bit more there, it's a traditional pattern that you understand. When someone has their hands down low and they start moving, their head shift can come wild from all over the place. How many cards has a triple g headline? Only a few. He's been mostly like an HBO fighter be but because his, his paper views didn't sell well. Like one of them only Gennady Golovkin I forget it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       We fought, but he was like 150,000 buys. It's unfortunate because he's fucking look marvelous in there. I mean, his name is Gus guys. He beat Kell Brook, Kell Brooks. Very good. And he broke him down. Yeah, no, he's a black guy from England. Really bad ass world champion at a lighter weight. He was world champion I believe at welterweight and it came up. Oh look at this Kennel. I don't like all that wasted energy right there. A little too much emotion. He, I mean he liked rooster them, got behind them. That's a lot of energy. Just blew there. And I find a lot too during in Connor met with a lot. I think that was different though. You know, these guys are way more identical in terms of skill and career, but I'm seeing Golovkin get the better. These exchanges, they just showed him both jab at each other at the same time. Stiff,

Speaker 4:          00:47:29       you know, the,

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       the age could really be a factor. You know? Canelo has never really taken a beating. He only had one fight that he lost and that was that fight with Mayweather. And he really didn't get beat up in that fight. He just got out boxed. Is that a decision? Yeah. Unanimous. Clear Mayweather just showed him what's up. But he didn't knock him out. You know what I mean? It's like Canelo's beating the fuck out of some really good fighters. He's super dangerous puncher and Golovkin has been a way more wars than canal Canelo has. Canelo has figured out a way to avoid wars and just put it on people. It's just fucking really good, man. This is for boxing. This is like as good as it gets

Speaker 2:          00:48:13       because Canelo is still getting better, you know? Ooh, that's a sweet jab. I mean, he's 27 now and this fight is gonna make them better too. You know, he's only 27 Golovkin. If canal managed to Kale him and he's 35 could be the end, you know? Or at least the beginning of the end. He's not 25 but Canelo almost is. And part of the appeal is that he's 37 and now there's something that undefeated firelight, those three g's on his belt. That's it. That's dope. Well, he's undefeated for a reason, man. He's a fucking master. Gucci should sponsor him. Nah, it's all right. Just like we want to have your gs or the free masons. Just the other one put over your day. Just put, put our gs up top and then your g over the Dick who bloat the watch company sponsored his Dick. Look, isn't that funny that people care about that? Like, yeah, like that the UFC WWE like didn't want that lot of people felt, felt like you guys see too much of that on boxer shorts. It bothers them. Like, I don't even notice it.

Speaker 3:          00:49:15       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:15       I didn't even help with sales. Or does it just get into your psyche? You don't even realize it's in there? It's a good question. I remember back in the day, um, cigarette companies used to sponsor fighters.

Speaker 2:          00:49:27       Like boxers used to have cigarette companies and their shorts. Forget who did that. You know what it might've been Mayorga did. Ooh, fuck. Had a cigarette company sponsored them. Cigarette company sponsored boxers give ever see the old way they would sponsors cartoons and they would show Fred smokey a Winston. Like they would have like fucking a, what's that? I hate that show. The Flintstones. Do you hate the font style? It makes me sick. The spies from why? I don't know. I just always hated them. Why? It's a weird one. I'm not a big cartoon guy, but that one I particularly at that left hook the body son. Ooh,

Speaker 2:          00:50:06       boom. Good love came with a crisp straight, right. This is good as it gets for boxing man. It really is. You know you got a guy and Golovkin undefeated 35 and now that blast and everybody wanting that big fight and then kill Navajo Alvarez. This proud superstar steps up. Wants this fight and just stay the fight. They both call each other out. They both want, I mean canal is always said he wanted to fight the very best. He's bleeding glove. It looks like he's looking at another one behind it. Wow. God Damn. Go off gins. Good God damn. He's good. He landed some shots there, man. Whew. That was an interesting combination the way through the left hook and then through it again. It's surprising. Left Hook. The second left took in particular, he's forcing this kid to box with them. I mean the slug with him. That's his style of fight. Canelo is a really good counter striker and what's what's going on here now it's Golovkin is just really coming to him and Canelo's this is like a perfect fight in a lot of ways. This is like the kind of fight you would hope.

Speaker 2:          00:51:16       But this Canelo want to stand there with him and trade punches. Well he wants to counter strike but it mean glove is going to come towards him. So he has his opportunities. I mean it's, it's a brilliant fight like as far as like what, you know stylistically it's perfect. Has, uh, has glock could ever even really been in trouble in a fight? Not really. He's been punched a lot though. Never been dropped? No, I don't believe so. I've never even seen him like stunned. He did have a really good fight in his last fight. Can you put Golovkin record up so I can remember homeboy's name. He's had a couple of very good fights where, you know, people are coming to him very, you know, enthusiastic. Last Friday for his Sherman was less, I don't, I Daniel j Dash Jacob. Daniel Jacobs is the one that's the, that guy that was a really close fight. Awesome, awesome fight. But it was unanimous decision for Gennady Golovkin but Daniel Jacobs is fucking for real white guy, black guy. He's super good. So it was like, it was a big win and you know, everybody could tell watching the fight that Jacobs is super legit. I mean, we already knew it coming in, but so even though he did knock 'em out, it's still, he's still one damn Canelo's fierce. Fierce. Both guys are fierce. Oh, that left hook to the body. What? Hello? They're both so good man. Oh that EPR cut. Damn.

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       See. And then the other thing, you've got to think of his age man. The reality of age 35 with some wars behind them versus 27 with really no wars. Just smashing a lot of people.

Speaker 3:          00:52:57       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:59       Really good trainers. When the same trainer, since he was a kid, what he's showing me, Jamie, what's going on? Is that the UFC, oh my God, you're amazing. How can we can't put it on that TV. Oh, we got to fix that. Who are these guys fighting arm triangle. Oh, Craig Gillespie. Jason Jaws.

Speaker 3:          00:53:28       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:53:29       well folks, we are, we should be on Twitter at the same time. We should be periscoping. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:53:37       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:53:40       I don't use any of those live. I want you to a while ago on Facebook. I just, yeah, I know it's supposed to help, but I just can't do it. Yeah, just it's sometimes it's too much. He keeps going back to the arm triangle. He lost it last time you went back to now. Oh No. He lost it against like he's going to under jack it again. You go right back to it. Easy on us. He goes right back to it. Look at this shit. You could tell. You know. I knew he was going to do it cause he's so good at it and at it. There's no way he's going to, he's going to wear him out. He's got to keep them in the chopping block right there. He's got to not try to finish them. Just keep them on the chopping block. What do you think of that way of defending?

Speaker 2:          00:54:10       That was a nice way Dan, when you grab the escrow. No, that's the thing. You've done doing it the way he's doing it. Oh, he's out. He's gone. It's over tap. What was that? What it a ghost. Angeles finished off by Neil. Maggie with uh, yes he did smushed them round four. Here we go. This is to add having the UFC play here too. That was dude. You turn it on at the perfect time because you don't, you rarely see an under Jack Battle in the UFC like that battle. He tried it three different times. You rarely see that. You don't ever see that. That's Greg or Gillespie. He's a fucking beast man. Greg Ward Gillespie. Yeah, it's a bad mother fucker right there. He's at least I have some good mount strategies. He wasn't trying to beat him up. He was trying to show shots in the body. Oh Man. Can Ella just hit him with a hard left hook to the body and go, let's see if they show. These guys are going at it. Man. This is crazy. This is a fucking warm man. I mean you like, we were watching like an all time classic boxing war right now.

Speaker 2:          00:55:20       Ooh. Maybe that jab that hit him. It looks like I missed him. Did I hit him? Huh? Popped him fast. Ooh

Speaker 3:          00:55:34       hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:55:35       Eddie Bravo. Would you be watching this if it wasn't for us? Yes, because he's Mexican. Ah. Did you know it was gonna Start at eight? They always start around eight, eight 30. We'll hold the money. Eventually they started like nine. They decided to start this one early. Okay. Just to make sure that people in the east coast, Ooh. Golovkin with that Jab. You think that was the thinking to like, let's make sure people in New York and Jersey and Florida can order this for sure. That's what I'm, oh dude. Oo, this is distractible Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:56:05       All right. That's a good idea first. But

Speaker 2:          00:56:08       um, he just did that thing by the way. He dropped his arms a little bit too. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56:16       It's boxing them up. He shook his head as soon as they shake their head. No, that means yes. Yeah. Does that ever mean guy isn't hurt when he shakes? Because why would you tell him you didn't hurt? You're not hurt. Well, it does kind of look, he ain't got shit. You could say that a guys, but the problem is when someone actually hits you and really dangs you and then you do it like never. Well, maybe the Noah's saying, no, you didn't knock me down. Not this time. Maybe that's what he means, baby. It doesn't seem like it. Almost mostly what? It seems like that didn't hurt. Like that ain't shit. You didn't get me. No one ever says he didn't knock me down. Yeah. Except in like a Jake lamata movie. That was exactly it. Very close up on the rings trying to Fucking Ooh, Jab and that counter right together. These guys are so well matched. Ooh, look at that tight left hook by triple g. He's hurt triple gene. No. Canella you think so? What makes you say that? Because it keeps going backwards into the ropes

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       body shot that you were talking about. Right when that landed, he was, he looked at his eyes, he went, oh shit. You might be right. Might be right. I keep forgetting. These are three men around and know they're weird, right? Yeah. You get into it, you're like, I'll fuck the bell. You know what's interesting about that? It's easier to go five minutes boxing than it is to go three minutes of wrestling. You have the shoe fc is like five minute rounds and boxing is three minute rounds, so they just got used to it. But one thing though is if you give a short around, there is a good argument for a shorter round. That argument is guys can go faster and harder in three minutes then they can and five cause they have to conserve themselves. Right. Do you feel like boxing over the last year is making a comeback or not?

Speaker 2:          00:57:58       For sure, but I think boxing isn't a good place. Right? It's making a little comeback. Yeah, and it might have something to do with the fact that there's a rivalry going on between UFC and boxing. Like what sport is better? Yeah. I think it's bringing more attention to boxing. You know, by the UFC fans, they're paying attention a boxing because there's this debate. Maybe it's a good idea. We'll could argument maybe the UFC and boxing up. Well, it's also boxing in a real good place right now. There's so many good fighters Chanko I mean these two gentlemen, right? You really do a three minute round you have to say, I mean with Jujitsu and all that, but I was thinking is maybe a five minute round a box here. It'd be kind of interesting, but I think they're doing it right, honestly, because I think you know, you could go hard and fast for three minutes and maybe it will ensure a faster pace for the majority of the fight. Then if you made God's fight five minute rounds, how often did they get out of ten eight rounds in boxing when guys get dropped quite a bit,

Speaker 2:          00:58:52       it's pretty common. It was uncommon for a long time and MMA, but it's more common now. While that was good head movement there by Canelo, that's either the rule changes, right? Yeah. Canelo avoided most of that. He's, he's good. Really good defense there. His defense is tight. Good movement. Ooh, that's a good right hand of the body.

Speaker 2:          00:59:16       It's just like to get to this level. So it's this, what's exciting about this fight is that to get to this level, there's so much shit you got to go through. It's so rare that a guy comes out this good, you know, like there's so few of them and it's even rare that you get two of them finally fighting. Yeah. Like this. Who else? Who are the top paper view boxers and you're looking at it right now, man. This, yeah. What flooded. Who else? Voids are tired. Manny Pacquiao is not drawing the numbers he used to in his last fight, he fought and he lost to like a school teacher. You know, his time is basically done. Where did he go to fight? That was a Australia. What about in heavyweight division? No paper view there. Well, Anthony Joshua was a huge star in London and in England and probably in Europe and the UK. Uh, in America. He's a big star with boxing fans, but sorta like how triple g's a big star with boxing fans. Canelo's a huge star with actual Mexicans like across the board. And maybe, uh, you could say that about Anthony Joshua with England. I, you know, I'm not in England. Could very well be, oh, look at that right hand over the top. He said No. He said No.

Speaker 5:          01:00:24       Ah,

Speaker 2:          01:00:25       I dunno about that. Boxing needs to do to, to keep the upward. It's just hard. It's just hard. He got guys like Terrence Crawford. He's a bad motherfucker. He got Loma Chenko. You've, you've got some good fighters. You've got Andre Ward is one of the best in the world. The UFC light or the, uh, boxing light heavyweight champion who's also the US gold medalist in boxing. He's a beast. I think we got to do is get people the fight that they want, not make them wait for it for two years. In three years. That's easier said than done. It's what helped the UFC. I think much of that. And they're shaking the hands at each other. Oh, this is crazy. Canelo's weighing some shots. He's throwing them hard. Mat. Oh. [inaudible] glove glove gal out a little bit. Maybe glove again. Glow. How'd he say it? Come on off. Kin Calavo again. Colif kin. Ooh, this is a good fight. Oh, dropped his hands. You got popular jam. Cologne in the back of his pants be June by June or pianos. Yeah, that's a cologne. This guy Norman used to wear it in a department store I worked in and he was arrested for stealing. He smelled good.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       Oh, that's hilarious. This smells. Yeah, he smelled great. I was like, what is that? He's like, by June, people are weird with their fucking colognes, right? Yeah. I have a whole fucking shelf. All of them to, yeah. Yeah. I just, I don't know why I liked them until the compensation I think I used to wear and your car. Oh God. Yeah. It was great. That was like fucking, there was like Guido stuff and like, like 1988 1990 he thought he had where it get laid. Yeah. Girls like CEO's. Yeah. Like it. For some reason they love it because I get you got to where it got away with their like, I don't like a girl to wear perfume at all. Like I really don't like, I like natural. I like the fruity smelling like a, the the sweet look at this perfumes. Ooh, not the ground up his son.

Speaker 5:          01:02:15       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:02:16       Yeah. No, I don't like any of them. I wanted it to smell like a fucking gorilla. Hello? Canelo shook his head, but that, that was a bomb that he got hit with it. Grazed them. It's weird. Male perfume. It's weird that we accept that, you know. Oh, look at that right hand. Damn Dude. The Lumpkins porn it on. Oh, Golovkin is landing some shots, man. It's only the sixth round. This is just the six round. I don't know.

Speaker 6:          01:02:47       Oh, Canelo's was fired back.

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       That's a hard shot to the body. You heard him to the body. He heard him to live. Oh, and he went back to it. Golovkin is in trouble. He's hurt to the body. He knows it. Yeah, man. He does know it. He hit him with a right hand and he's landing.

Speaker 6:          01:03:04       Oh Shit. What a turn around.

Speaker 3:          01:03:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:03:09       It's so hard to recover from that liver shot too. You've got to keep moving, but you're diminished. You've been hitting the liver. Jim, I know you've had a lot of guy's leg kick you and choke you. I don't think anyone's ever purposely punched me in the liver. I've had a lot of things done. They're all in pleasant, but they say that's a pretty bad one. It's horrible and to fact I, I'm pretty sure that happened just now. Gennady Golovkin and you could barely tell watching him fight. Ooh, get hit in the chest. They're little high.

Speaker 2:          01:03:38       Who's a good vibe? It's so back and forth. Yeah. I punched the guy in the liver and the fourth grade didn't do shit. Yeah, you got to work on new techniques. On the fourth grade means you were nine. How you should actually hit the liver. Totally, Bro. Crushed it. It's a horrible thing to kick. Well, people, do you think it's a bit of liver need? Deliver might be the worst. That's one of the worst need to deliver. As horrifying as a Rhonda Rousey was so good at that. She would tie girls up in that judo clinch and then just need the fuck out of their body was ruthless because she was so good at the like upper body control. She could tie you up so well from Judah. Oh God. He Columbia with the right hand of the body. She would just get ahold of girls and then she started fucking Newcome with knees to the body. She did that to Sara Mcmann. God Damn, this is good. Yeah. This is really so tense, right? I can't think it happened here. Fortunes can change the drop of a hat. Okay. Whew. Canelo is firing them. Huh? 44 49 to 44 power punches. God dammit. That is so insane. Favor of Golovkin. Is Rhonda coming back you think? I don't think she's going to wrestling. I think it's over. Yeah, I think so. I don't think she wants to do it anymore. You know, for whatever reason you could break that down psychologically all day. You know, Matt Serra had a great line that, uh, I never forgot. He said a long ago

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       that everybody likes to be the hammer. Oh yeah. But nobody wants to be the nail. Yeah. If you, if you're the nail, can you come back?

Speaker 7:          01:05:27       Okay. Yeah. And there's always going to be fighters out there that you can't take down. You're going to be forced to stand. Sure. And the level of striking right now with the girls is at an all time high. And if you ain't top of on top of your striking, even if you get really good, it's still Russian roulette. These girls are, are many like chef Chenko and Amanda Nunez. So Dane, was he going to do, if you can't take the person down, you have to strike. And then it becomes a kickboxing battle. How good is your kickbox kickboxing battle where you hope and pray that something goes wrong and you get it to the ground. And you know what? Rhonda has good striking. It's not terrible, but even if it was great, there's a lot of great strikers out there. So at the end of the day you're going to be forced to when a kickboxing tournament at the very top, it's going to be very hard. She didn't wrestle her whole life. She's doing judo at an Olympic level. She has great takedowns. She was able to rag doll most of her opponents, but right now man, it's going to be very hard for her to take these girls down right now. She's going to be forced to strike. So then it becomes a, you know, she could win some, she could lose some. How many people did she beat that Stryker is as good as Holly Holm? Ronda Nunez? None.

Speaker 1:          01:06:37       No. None of them were as good as her. The only one who was closest cats and Ghana and she caught cat really linearly. First round, right? Yeah. With an arm bar. Cat just charged data and got caught in an arm bar. Yeah. I think Rhonda said, I think you just catt deserved better that like she, she knew that that was just a kind of a fluke. You know what cat said that the reason why she charged out, I like that it's cause like she took a furious beating and that Amanda Nunez fight. She won the fight but she got fucked up and that first round like real bad and she was like, I didn't want to go through that again. She goes, I just want to charge at her and get ahold of her.

Speaker 3:          01:07:08       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:07:09       Imagine of Ronda Rousey decided to on the girl she couldn't throw or take down. Plan B is that flying guard pool. She had the guard for it. She has an amazing guard, amazing arm bar from the guard. Her plan should have been, in my opinion, to get the fight to the ground, try to be on top, try to use your Jido. If that didn't work, we have to go to Poland. Guard. Other option with someone like Amanda Nunez is that's not going to happen. You don't think she didn't pull guard on the [inaudible] as you know on anything, you're going to get eaten up and punches. When he tried to get close, Amanda's got some long got us arms. In order to pull guard, you've got, uh, you got to pull off a legit shot to get them to react, to get them to sprawl. And that's when you pull guard. When you're under him and they sprawl you time and perfect. It's a, it's a technique. It's just like a takedown. Was that the biggest problem of Rhonda, Rhonda? This game? Your game was all right. The guards. Amazing. Just like in that fight with that Sergio Mri, he was on his back hurt and, and his opponent wouldn't get on top of this. Let's pay attention to this cause some shit is happening here.

Speaker 1:          01:08:10       Golovkin cracked him. We're, we're still gonna be able to watch the Rockhold fight to ou. So exciting. Yeah. It's only eight 30. This fights nuts, man.

Speaker 3:          01:08:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:27       He's really impressive. Off the ropes to Golovkin. I know Alvarez. Oh yeah. Well he's impressive. Everywhere they bolt are. I mean, these are two legit world champions. That's why this is so exciting. I haven't seen it off a glove down on the ropes much at all this fight because he's been taking it to Canelo and that's his style and when that's what's so interesting about this setup is that everybody knew that Canelo's a really good counter puncher. Scott. Real good timing. He just seems a bit too small. Canelo yeah, well that Chad really there's a size difference man. There's definitely a size difference but he's thick, you know? I just think frame wise, I think you're right. But I think the money is where he's at. You know? I mean I think this fight, he's a big, big money fight. Did I don't know how many good fights there are for him at 54 what big names there are. I think he struggles to make that weight too.

Speaker 1:          01:09:23       Who Glove given no Canelo I think he struggles even to make six day and this is what this is 60 I think one 54 is a real struggle for him because that's what may, whether got them down to one 52 mainly with, it's so smart, like just lose a little bit more weight. We'll talk a little more way this little hallway. And uh, the thing about Connor, like what, what he did to Connor for a smart too, which was just make them fight, make them work, get him, get him tired, and then start putting it to him to start piling it up, wiring them out, piling up, wearing them out. And when you saw me with her unloading, you're like, oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. He's fucking Floyd Mayweather. He's one of, if not the best box or hour. And Connor did catch them with a couple of things. Ooh, look at that. Jab Son. Oh No. Hbo Paper. You went blank for a student there. They all panicked. Can Imagine. Let's see. What do you think here?

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       Definitely losing the rounds, but he, well, he's putting up a good fight and I was losing. Oh yeah, yeah. He's, he's got like 19 more head shots for a gloved hand. Yeah. They have Golovkin ahead. Three to s three, right? Three point 65 to 68. But the thing is, it looks like a Lufkin is trying to put him away. He's not just content to beat him. He's putting massive pressure on him here, you know, I mean, and you saw canela take a big deep breath and as we get into the eight, nine, 10 1112 Canelo fades a little. He fades a little, he throws hard power shots and I know he keeps working hard on his conditioning and he works harder than anybody, but it's just, that style is exhausting. Well, plus Galafi wants to put him away because he hears people talking about his age too. I mean, you know, everyone is saying is he, does he have it anymore? It's just slowing down. Yeah. That's a consensus. Oh, shots to the body. Good shots of the body

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       by Canelo. Well, he might've heard him again. He might have heard him again to the body. Go Africans not firing at UPMC.

Speaker 4:          01:11:23       Ooh,

Speaker 2:          01:11:25       it's catching his breath. Yeah, you got it. Rip to the body due to food. This is such a good fight. This fight. If every boxing match was like this, boxing would be huge. The thing is genius about Mayweather. He's, he managed to never be in one of these. Yeah, he really did avoid everything. Avoided it. All of it. He never got beat up. He'll get hit clean like seven times, eight times his whole career. He's made the most money made way more than anybody else combined. Like double or triple at least, right? Oh yeah. And to me he's for sure the number one money maker ever. Oh, without a doubt. Yeah. Close it. Let's put them into a billionaire, a category in the neighborhood, you know, who knows exactly what the deal is and, but dude, they got 6.25 something million paper views. That's insane.

Speaker 2:          01:12:12       I wonder what he's saving up for. I wonder what he wants. And he doesn't quite have enough modeling is balling out of control. Does he owe taxes too? I think he owes money. He owed a little bit before this fight, but by basketball teams. Oh look at that upper cut. The big thing is, um, him not going too crazy and spending it on and blowing it all he does. He doesn't seem like the, I think they have one more fight by mansions and shit. All sorts of Rolls Royces. But, well, you know, when he got quality cars, he was like way deep in the TAC. Oh yeah. Nice Opera Cup. I can know. He was definitely like a big tax trouble before we got bailed out with a fight in the past. Do you think they rematch? I think they rematch. They should. Why not? I think Connor would have to beat somebody good in a boxing match and he would also have to have a real training camp, I think.

Speaker 2:          01:13:03       I think boxing's over for Connor. Oh, I don't think so. That is one more fight like that. It gives, people will buy it. That just kind of went to the 10th round. He got fatigued. It there's still a motive for people to buy it. Yeah. I mean, look, he, he went the very first fight against the greatest hour. There's so many lights to bag. You're right. Yeah, you're right. You're right. There's that too. But the thing is if there's a legit big fight, like say if Canelo Alvarez steps up and says that he wants to fight Conor Mcgregor, I don't think Conor, I'll do it. He might realize, I think Connor made me realize, you've got to specialize. Well actually you can't do both. Especially the difference between Canelo and Floyd. Floyd was just a brilliant boxer. Canelo is a murderous puncher and he'll fuck you up, he'll hurt you. There's also a promotional difference to Kyron. Floyd are pretty much they, they're very similar guys and they both understood what they were doing promotion wise. I don't know if Canelo is that God, while he's not going to promote it that way, but he's got, oh look at that upper cut. That's his genius. It's, he's got the support of the American people does love Lufkin vs Mcgregor.

Speaker 3:          01:14:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:14:15       Ooh, look at that. Africa. I, um, I don't know if Mcgregor would take that fight. No, that sounded good. Fight for him either. Neither. Canelo Orga Lufkin's a good fight for him. It's a terrible fight for him. Those guys are different. They're, they're, they're, they're this, you know, like, look at what, the way these guys fight, especially with this is how go Lufkin fights every fight I bring, big drama show. That's what he calls it.

Speaker 3:          01:14:44       Dude.

Speaker 2:          01:14:46       I mean, this is one of those fights were going to be looking back on Sunday. Look at those shots of the boss. This is one of those fights that we're going to look back on and go, you remember when we watched that fucking fight? Holy Shit. Look at it. He just shook his head on him. Golovkin is putting tremendous pressure on him. He's trying to break him.

Speaker 2:          01:15:06       Yeah. He's keeping him against the ropes for 80% of the fire. It's not just that like it's a pace that he's fighting and he's trying to make them wither. He sees something. You think he sees him Fetty yeah, he sees him trying to catch some breaks. He's still super dangerous, but Golovkin catches. He's seen Canelo trying to catch his breath and that seat is splayed out on the seat in between rounds. His feet were all out. Yeah. See if I, if I know this, and I don't know that much about boxing, I know that Canelo has what people think of as an endurance problem and it's not, you know, it's not a big mystery. He just kind of fades a little bit. Who we just got tagged. He just kept tagged. He might get fired. Oh my God, that was bad. Or the big right hand.

Speaker 2:          01:15:47       Oof. It's not that he doesn't work hard, it's just that his style is just so explosive and he's got so much muscle that he carries around. That style requires you to be in fucking sensational shape. Well it does. It does. It mean anything that is a counter puncher cause they're always getting hit first. So you've got to take a little bit more to, no, not necessarily. His defense is outstanding. Like look at that. Look how good he ducked under that right hand. His defense is amazing. It's just like he's never been hit like this before and not with a guy like a Lufkin is just putting it to him. He's been hit by a guy like Floyd who just caught them with good clean scoring shots. Snapped his head back a couple of times, but nothing like that. Like a mule kicking you in the face.

Speaker 2:          01:16:26       This is a different thing because Golovkin is trying to break him. He's not just trying to win. He's putting himself in danger. He's putting himself in danger to prove that he's the best. And that's a different thing. That's a different kind of person with, he's not making the kind of money that these guys are making. He's hungry. It's fuck. See that upper cut. Ooh Baby. And again, he's not making the kind of like superstar money that he just saw Conor and Floyd meg and the only way that he can make it as to being big drama show. And so he's just coming from for death once again for this fight. Who knows is, I think it's probably depending upon the paper view. Sales. Yeah. I literally have no scale for what these guys make. I, I have no clue. You were gonna make it a couple of million elements. Millions. Canelo is

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       a superstar. He's going to sell. I mean he would sell fucking a million paper views. He was fighting the Uber driver and I'm not joking.

Speaker 4:          01:17:19       Ooh, Ooh.

Speaker 1:          01:17:22       So he's a bigger draw than GALACTICA. Oh yeah. And I was getting five g tripleG is getting three. Nice. That was amazing. He's 2 million more to know if you know how famous he is. It makes sense. Yeah. He's huge. Right? That guy goes, Viva Mexico and every, the fucking roof almost falls off.

Speaker 3:          01:17:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:17:41       I'll tell you what, man, Mexicans and Irish did. They make you reconsider the idea of patriotism. Very, very proud of people. Like when you hear the Irish people that were in town in Vegas, when Connor was fighting, you ever see that video of Mandalay bay, the whole Mandalay bay? What's the fight? Wasn't even there. Okay. The whole Mandalay bay filled, I mean to where you couldn't walk with Irish people and they're all singing together. Yeah. It was insane. And that wasn't even where the fight was being held. We showed him at the garden outside in November. It was fucking, I was with Matt Serra was freezing outside and these maniacs have short sleeve shirts and tank tops. Yeah. Didn't we walk to the garden together there today about coming, leaving the guard? It was, it was freezing that night. Would remember. Yeah, that's right. There was protest in front of Trump's apartment. Yeah, that's right. How Fun was that? Oh, it was awesome. We had a walk, little Jimmy, uh, me and a cam and weren't you there young? Jamie was Tony there to Brendan mischief maker was there.

Speaker 4:          01:18:39       Look at that. Oof. Oof. Oof.

Speaker 1:          01:18:47       God Damn. Look at those. That left to the body in that right over the top. Holy Shit. What a fight this is. But we had a walk because there were so many people protesting Trump. Oh, he's done. He's got hurt. He got hurt. He stumbled. Woo.

Speaker 3:          01:19:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:19:05       Canelo hit him with something. Oh, look at that jab. Oh my goodness. Oh, it again.

Speaker 1:          01:19:13       Oh my God. This isn't your fight back. This is a fucking fight. And this is the 10th round kids. Oh my God. This is amazing. I've hardly ever has to hold. Yeah, pull them apart. Oh my God. No. These guys are going for blood. Golovkin is a fucking savage man. Savage. He's kind of like 82% Genghis Khan blood. Right? If you've got a gas, you're right. The rats are good point. The Ref is not stepping in that much. He hasn't had a chance. He just no need to. This is a warm, yeah. Especially the way Golovkin fights, man. What a pace he puts on you. You just don't get a chance to breathe. He just on you like he stays in a phone booth no matter what, and there's no brakes. He pops a jab, you step back, you're right back on. You look at this,

Speaker 1:          01:20:00       he's just right back on him constantly look at this pressure right hand. But you've gotta understand how terrifying this is. You're fighting a guy like this that doesn't get tired, continues to push on you, and like that's why Canelo has to take some breaks here. Then you start just trying to get out of his way. He doesn't really want to be up against the ropes like this. He has to fight like this. He really doesn't have the energy to just meet him in the center and go Kablooey at each other. So go, go Lufkin's pressure and constant forward movement. That's a big factor here. He's controlling where this fight takes place. A weapon. Yeah, it's ring generalship. He's completely controlling where the fight takes place and he showing much more desire to win. He's trying to stop Canelo Canelo's trying to catch Golovkin as he's trying to stop them.

Speaker 1:          01:20:47       There's two very different things happening here. It doesn't mean that canal can't still put the lights out on them, but what's way more impressive as what Golovkin is doing? He's just swarming a man and could see Canelo called grabs him after that. See that? That's right. He throws that shot and he grabs them. It's cause he's wilting lilies. He has legs. Just give out there dude. He's wilting. He is. He's getting fucked up. He could still come back hard because he's a fucking animal and he's a world champion. But the bottom line is he started to fade. We're in the 10th round. This shits getting weird. Look at that. He's still got some good head movement though. I'll tell you that. That was nice. The Cardio is tremendous, right? Credible, tremendous. Guloff Kins cardios we'll glove gins and other big bear guy. Is it? Yes, he is a big bear guy.

Speaker 1:          01:21:32       Goes to big bear to train. Same as L. Kukui. Tony's a savage dude. I've, I've watched that guy trying for six hours straight. Tony Ferguson has cardio is fucking through the roof. Through the roof. He's an animal. Should see the shit we're doing up there. Crazy, crazy. She loved big bear man and said peaceful up there. It's cool. What do you do? Love it. It's fun. You could work out there at a very high altitude, low oxygen content in the air. They say Eddie, honestly the best thing to do is not to train up there. They say the best thing to do is live up there and to train like down, like to go down to like sea level, like drive an hour, go down to sea level, train there and then go do what everything else up top because your body will adapt because the altitude, especially when you're sleeping up there but you'll have more work output.

Speaker 1:          01:22:19       You'll get more work in with your body at a seed level. Yeah. What do I know? I'm not a scientist son. Do Tony? Donny more work there. Tony goes forever. No, I'm sure, but I mean he could be even better. It's what I'm saying. I just think that that's what the science is. I mean, it doesn't mean anything. Tony's obviously adapted to big bear. Well fuck, that's such a good fight, man. Such a good fight, Kevin Lee. Kevin is, it is a serious threat. You know, he's the one who not taking him lightly. Very serious threat. They're both very serious. Look at their opponents. Tony's been through some, you know, he fucked up Edson Barboza, Josh Thompson, Rafael dos Anjos, those are big names. Big giant fight. Dos Swan was very fucking impressive. Very impressive. That was an incredibly impressive fight. And then the other one that was really impressive to me was a, the Barboza Phi because Barboza standup is top of the food chain and Tony was cracking him and then finished him in a crazy bloody Doris who was it wasn't that all bloody and everything on that Doris.

Speaker 1:          01:23:25       Yup. Yup. And Edson Barboza is considered probably top three most dangerous strikers in the UFC. Oh yeah. That guy will light you up with wheel kegs head. Kevin thinks he's so fast. He's so powerful. Here's the first wheel kick Kao in the UFC. You know in the highlight you could see a Ra should fear in the background going like this? Yeah, like as he gets hit and cracked. Terry, he hits Terry. Adam with this crazy we'll kick is the first wheel kick Kayo in the UFC and it was the perfect one. Why it all those stock? It seemed like all though I noticed it in the Frankie Edgar fight, it really stopped kicking or throws a lot less as he oh good question. It's a very good question. It could be because he's got injuries that don't allow them to kick anymore. It could be that it's easier for guys to take him down when he kicks.

Speaker 1:          01:24:10       Huh? You'd have to talk to him. I'd like to talk to him, but he didn't use it very much. A Max Holloway. But if you go back to like the Uriah Faber fight, it was like his biggest weapon. Yeah. But I noticed it against frank Yeager. I'm like, he's not throwing a lot of kids. Yeah. I wondered why. I thought Frankie was probably try to time those kicks in. The rematch. That made total sense to me. What didn't make sense as how he didn't use them that much against Max. But you know, max is a motherfucker man. When he said he wants to box now Josie. Although, yeah, yeah, I've heard that. But that doesn't take away from the fact that an MMA fight, his kicks one of the most deadly weapon weapons in the sport in his prime man. He was so fucking good. But like everyone, it's just like they reach a time, oh, golf can caught him with a right hand.

Speaker 3:          01:24:50       Ooh,

Speaker 1:          01:24:52       this is a crazy, crazy fight, man. Like you usually don't get these fights. 96 95 Golovkin power punches landed. Wow, that's incredible. These guys are just bad. The cards Atlanta too. Oh, the good left hook too. You know. [inaudible] I mean a Canelo router is absolutely a champion and that's the reason why it keeps firing back and he won't wilt. And he keeps using good head movement, but there's no doubt about Golovkin is putting it on them. One more round. So exciting. And then we get to cool to see David Branch and Luke Rockhold. How are we? So lucky I'll at this some Jesus shit going on. Yeah, I don't know what that is. That's got, that's got to be, or else can I ask mom or something. She was like, this is got that moment. Come to Jesus moment.

Speaker 3:          01:25:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:25:47       Um, Sandra, it looks so much better at one seven. He doesn't he, I missed that five but he did get an a, I'm trying to, I saw this, the finish put a smash on Neil Magni put the smash. That's how big his legs. Let's a big giant, massive, yeah. Well he's filled in. This is what he gives body supposed to look like.

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       He was starving himself. It's terrible idea. I mean, he was a beast at one 55 from you smashing guys and running him over. But he got to a point where he really could not make the weight anymore. I mean, he was real in real bad shape. When you made the wait for Eddie Alvarez, he's thick man, so thick dude. And at one 70, I mean, he's a fucking animal. He kicked Neil Magnus legs out from under him and then he got on top of them. And just put the smush on them. It was just so high level. How did he get them down? A dumbed down with kick kicked his fucking leg out from under him and then jumped on him. Yeah, just jumped on him. It was a, it was a beating. I mean it was an Ellis golf. He has to know. I need to knock out. Yeah, he's got know 12th round.

Speaker 3:          01:26:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:26:49       Ooh. Behind the ear and the clinch. Ooh, look at that upper cut in the clinch, pulling the head down, going MMA on him. That Jab of fucking Golovkin is so slick.

Speaker 8:          01:27:06       Oh goodness. Can Nasa with the by how? Shit combination yellow with the Combo.

Speaker 2:          01:27:15       Golovkin caught him with a left hook. Goddamn Golovkin Lufkin has a chin man tell you that. An unbelievable chin

Speaker 8:          01:27:25       show shit. Oh Shit. Oh Shit. What a crazy fun is on. Oh my God, this is amazing. Oh, and Canelo landed her right hand.

Speaker 2:          01:27:36       This is a crazy fight. Holy Shit. Look at that top flower. The Jab and the right hand real tight in the clinch. It's constant pressure. Minute 30 to go. Does he take over? Does he take over? Does Canelo have enough to sustain arms down swinging and missing? Trying to catch some blood in there, throwing some punches that just don't have the steam on him anymore and Golovkin and of it has to know he's a head and he's still coming after him. Yeah. He's a fucking spider dude. He's like a spider trying to suck the blood out of a fly just on you like almost like just so predator, like just constantly look, it's not backing off. He's not boxing. This is not a boxing match. She's trying to fuck him up. That's the Golovkin style that makes them so exciting, man. That's why Mexican fighters love him. They do, right? Yeah. Yeah. Mexican fight fans are big triple g fans to the point where his last fight, it was a Mooc was grass. Yes. He knows man because he fights like a world class. Top of the food chain, Mexican boxer and a lot of ways.

Speaker 3:          01:28:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:28:48       God Damn, he's good. This is fucking fantastic. Yeah, those are just hitting the gloves. Yeah. Canal was tired, man. He's real tired. There's still 20 something to go, but he's still hanging in there. Man. That's that world champion heart still swinging. It doesn't get any better than this for boxing. Especially like after the Conor Mcgregor Floyd Mayweather fight. This is a fight that like, hey, this is how it's done. Yeah, this is the real deal. I mean obviously Floyd did it how it's supposed to be done, but that wasn't two fighters on the same level. Look at this. This is crazy. These were absolutely glorious. It's fine. These are both great moments. Or boxing though. The, uh, Mayweather Mcgregor on this ship, both really, really great for boxing. Brendan Schaub, I should say this, before the decision gets announced, said that if Golovkin didn't win by some ungodly lopsided beat down, that he could lose the decision crew because of corruption.

Speaker 2:          01:29:43       He goes, cause that's how boxing roles and there's way more money and Canelo winning. So that's sad. Now that we know that [inaudible] sponsor. That's true. Well, apparently the audiences are like half Mexican. He's a superstar in Mexico. Just a super steady talking about Canelo. Yeah. So let's see if Brendan shop predicted this correctly because we think it has to be Golovkin the rap, the, the unofficial scorecard guy had it for Golovkin by several rounds. We think it was go Lufkin clearly. Although Candela fought a great fight, have there been bad decision if Canelo wins have there, what was the last time there was a decision like that? Tim Bradley, Manny Pacquiao who won that and I believe Bradley one, but pack, y'all should have one. And then came back and outboxed him. It was worse. It was worse. If I remember correctly, I said, what was the reasoning of that? Boom, boom, boom. Oh Jesus, they're shown hello. Oh my goodness. This is the last round that was Chanel just tried to put it to him and glove and he's like, come on, come on, come on. I'm from Kazakhstan. Boom. Just boom over the top. God Damn just war here. Leave that had just paid back every punch he took in a combination. Just sharp jab to his jam. So snappy. Okay. Turns it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:02       Give me a guest. Eddie Bravo for sure. Glove again, for sure. Right. Unless there's, unless there's corruption, like Brendan says, he's not crazy to say that. I doubt it. They're getting garage pad. We're, we're saying this, look at this. They got at one 16 one 12 for Golovkin Hara. Let him in here. Harold led. They gave that last, Lufkin ran away with it. They gave ten nine on that last fight. I mean that last round to fucking know Canelo yeah. You know what I really like? I don't know why they did that. I like how these girls just stand there and smile. They're doing really good job. They're always smiling. It seems easy, but it's hard. You got to be frozen and fucking clapping and it drives me crazy. I hate it. I love it. I love the f their focus, they're focused on not being even remotely normal.

Speaker 2:          01:31:49       This Adelaide bird, the job, their focus, their job is to stand there and smile in Assam psychotic way. If they were a guy, like if they were a guy, if you were, if they hired a guy to stand there in a nice suit and tie and stand there like this, could you fucking imagine how crazy it would be if you hired guys to stand behind fighters with giant smiles on their face and just not, especially if they were in their underwear. Just imagine that. Imagine guys in a speedo standing there like ripped, like holding it to caught tay sign with a big giant smile on their face that happens on Santa Monica Boulevard going, it doesn't happen during a big final paper view. Any Bravo, you silly goose one day when, hey, let's hear the volume. Let's here it is this a split decision to know told you son. Oh boy, they fucking boxing fucking stinks. Toads, you son boxing in Shaw. Apokyn is the sage. Brendan. Brendan Schaub as a sage fucking stinks. Why is he mad? Cause he knows. He knows he got fucked. You know Canelo well he's going to feel terrible now. He knows he got his ass Catsa draw. There's no way. That's how it was that a draw?

Speaker 2:          01:33:13       No, it's, hold on second,

Speaker 2:          01:33:17       he's asking to see if he was happy then that would mean that he thought he lost. So the fact that he looks pissed that smart. He's gonna shoot a one. This is bullshit. He's tiny notes. [inaudible] 69 I think he's mad because he didn't win. He threw 200 punches. Didn't win. But he's definitely mad. Did he got outbox and they made it a draw? I did 50 more punches. Yeah. The fuck is that a draw? It's not even close to that though. There are punches different though. There you go. That's the difference too. Maybe I'll go higher percentage. Oh, I can't stand it. Yeah, but it's a higher number. Landed two one 14 and one 10 and total power punches.

Speaker 2:          01:33:58       Yeah. Yeah. Uh, all right. Jab, weird thing though. When you're looking at numbers wise, I mean it's one, it's one way or looking at it, but like one big shot that's a power punch and then another power punch. It doesn't do anything. They're both power punches. You know what I'm saying? Like one shot that really fucks you up and your legs go and you get wobbly. That's a power punch and another power punches his shot that lands in the same spot but doesn't do anything. They're both powerful. Are these colors mean? What are the, what is it? You know what I'm saying? What is the blue ear? Maine. I don't know. Look at the number of punches that, uh, landed on [inaudible] face. Hundred nine on his right side and a 95 on his left to 10 landed to one 27. Yeah. Big Difference in how many landed to the head getting 40 level or landed way more he made, made, said only four shots were landed to Canelo's body. That doesn't make any sense. Is that what it really what said and see what he says here. Let's hear this

Speaker 3:          01:34:56       tonight.

Speaker 9:          01:35:00       What happened tonight?

Speaker 2:          01:35:02       What happened tonight?

Speaker 9:          01:35:04       Today? Really Big Mexican day. All my friends romance about

Speaker 2:          01:35:14       good move. Go right to the Mexican fans. Fucking smart move. Oh,

Speaker 9:          01:35:18       able to neutralize you, especially early in the fight and have success late when it looked like you and started to build the lead. I want to,

Speaker 2:          01:35:30       we probably can't play this without getting yanked off of a youtube, so we're going to go to the other way. How? How is it first of all that I didn't think that last fight was a, I mean that last round was a ten nine Canelo no. How was he not fucking angry about this? I mean, why am I angry about it? Don't we get shit? Big Drama show two 19 if he wins, he retains his belt, so nothing really changes for him and he gets all that money. Now that your record in the rematch is going to be insane. The rematch will be insane. Those dollars to 19 good job by Brendan Man. Fucking good call. Yeah, box. All the fighters were amazing, but the organizational, it just stinks. Brendan. Nailed it. Can you hear this? Are you, are you guys hearing this? What? No. Okay. What am I hearing?

Speaker 2:          01:36:16       What he thought? Oh No, no, no. The TV, you know, I don't want to hear in here. He's not saying I got really lucky that they gave me that draw. I don't want to hear what he's saying. If he thinks he wanted his stupid still owes a great fight. Amazing. I love it. I don't eat, I mean I do care, but I don't care. I do care that I think that I thought they're going to go off in one, but I don't care. It's great fight. I like seeing great fights. I don't, decisions means less to me as I get older because I looked at it and like, okay, what am I doing? I'm basing like how I feel about something based on an inaccurate assessment by people that don't necessarily know what they're doing. Like what I take advice on whether or not an episode of game of Thrones is good from three people I thought were knuckleheads.

Speaker 2:          01:37:01       Like what if there's like three judges for TV shows? Like, well the game of Thrones finale, you know, I gave it an a 100 you know, let's go to these judges don't we decided it gets a 40 no fucking way. Right? And you go to school the next day like, dude, you hear fucking game of Thrones final got a 40 bro. We lost it. Got a little ridiculous at the end. Shut your mouth. Oh my gosh. Let's see. One show. Come on. Okay, let me ask you a couple questions. I loved it. I remember when they first escaped the white walkers didn't like the water. Have something to do with it. Like pick out on a boat and it's for some reason they can't get in water, right? That's the thing, right? Right. But their eyes are you spoiler alert in the fucking oil or something. They at something. Don't do something about the water. Right. They can't hang it. There was a few horse when who the fuck tied chains around

Speaker 7:          01:37:56       that dragon and dragged it up who went scuba diving in and tied that dragon up? You'd probably have to assume who had the are they that's wrong. They're not that strong because those dudes are fucking them up. They're not that strong. Who's carrying those gigantic chains down there underwater? Tie Up the dragon and drag it up. Who's doing that? Well, they're all dead, so they probably don't give a shit over a kilometer. They couldn't go. They can't get into water. He's right. So how did they do a big hole? A big hole? I'll accept the drag. The accepted slept. Very good point. It's a drag and I can accept. That's a very legitimate happens when they hit the water that I don't remember. I don't like water but they don't like it, but no ties to drag him. I'm getting to ships, so islands like a keeping them from going to an island.

Speaker 7:          01:38:36       That's why these other guys are like, fuck this, I'm going to an island. I'm going to wait on the iron island. Is it possible that just one of the things down, they, they cannot get into water for some reason. They established that several times and then all of a sudden they cut. They don't, they don't show how they tied this God damn dragon up with the chain. It's like one of those chains that you hold navy ships to port, you know, and who typed them up. They just cut to then dragging them out. Watching that dragon get pulled out. I can suspend a little bit. I can, I can live with the inconsistency of the dead people dragging the dragon out of the ice water. I can on consistency. I can live with that. But I'm, I'm with him. I didn't even notice that when I was in a show.

Speaker 7:          01:39:17       I didn't need that. They went in the water and I love game of Thrones. Ma'Am. I haven't this shit that just got me fucked up. Yeah, they fucked up. It's a big hole. You're right. Big. Hello. God Damn it. You're right. Maybe like in the last uh, episodes, they'll show how the fuck they tied that dragon up or maybe we should set up big ass. Stupid whole. Yeah. And did anyone catch it? And you know, what do they say? Fuck it. Let's do it anyway. Bothers me is we're led to believe that these, these different kingdoms like a king's landing and all that are like, like for like countries away. But man, they are traveling to damn quick. They get from one city to the next city that at the wall and then they meet and then the snow in The Bahamas walking over mountains like, dude, this, this can take months. She told double. It's like, it's almost like that whole kingdom is like, like Redondo Beach, West Hollywood, North Hollywood comped in 20 minutes. This is Mike Perry was supposed to be Mike Perry versus a Tiago Alvarez. He could get to Florida. Right? Is that what he said? He couldn't get out of Florida others? Is that what happened? Yeah, he was stuck in Florida and my parents that we came up early, so I don't want to hear that shit.

Speaker 7:          01:40:32       Is that really what happened? I believe so, yeah. That's terrible. Do you ever think like when they showed the army's walking through like fucking no man's land, like who's carrying the fucking food and where? Where's the water? Hey Bro, you're fucking my high. What are they taking shirts? I always think that the budget is taking shit. That's a good point. Like where, what kind of sewage system do help

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       you? Just walking across deserts and shot shitting in ancient Rome. Taking pisses in every scene in the background. There was a big issue in ancient Rome, like they, people got diseases cause they would shit in the streets. Let's talk about that. Let's bring that in. Making it more realistic. I see more shit. You're right man. Like come on. Like explain how these fuckers are eating. I'd love to see Khaleesi dropping a deuce off the side of that fucking castle. How great would that be? That'd be great. Oh Man. Maybe the queen maybe like she's shots shots, tight shots where they show Khaleesi on the tracking. I don't care for that. Remember the Superman TV show? She's the mother of dragons. You don't think she knows how to ride a dragon? I was barely going and she's barely holding on. Somebody's watching you in a Jujitsu match like, oh come on man.

Speaker 2:          01:41:42       He strangle that guy with his legs now and then she got to fall off the dragon every now and someone almost too. I drag. Oh No, that was the Harry Potter ride fall off. She's got to fall off one or to once or twice. Come on, man. She's just like barely grip. I hate those shots when they go to her of riding the Dragon. It drives me nuts. John Wayne shows are both gay for each other cause I thought that was the most awesome. Don't get me wrong. I love it. I love it. When she was riding that dragon, I was standing up cheering cause it looks green screen it look better without it kind of weird that all the rulers are women. Like what kind of some feminist shit? Murder. Just keep that murder coming and I'm happy. Look at it. So let's look up fake that Louis.

Speaker 2:          01:42:25       Dude. Come on man. That's terrible. Hold it out of that dragon. Do you know how many spikes would be inside of her pussy right there? Yeah. I mean we're here. Where is it safe to stick your box? You're going to ride that thing between bikes. Look at the size of the spikes. How gross the yard. Scary and pointy by disease group strength. What's credible? Never show her training strengths out of this world. She should have like a rock climbing wall in her castle. Maybe she takes one of those spikes and she puts it down in her posting. She's lamps hold of it and that's how she goes the whole time. She just has a spot she had locked in like a ball and socket joint. I was just another really bad one, but it's called dragon's way bigger than that. Like yeah, the dragon's way, way bigger than hate the way she's holding on and you're right.

Speaker 2:          01:43:12       Our whole, when they show the drag and sometimes it looks tremendous. Huge. Yeah. This is old episode. That's like a Moray Eel, right? It might be smaller than it might be younger. Oh, that might've been earlier days. Oh, you're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. Okay, I'm wrong. Did you have any that she used it to kill a bunch of people, man. Some people know some of the last episodes. Didn't she get out of the chain? Look got big. It was there. Oh my God. That's a full grown drag. Okay. Hold on a second. Look at that thing. Dude, that's bad and moving to the dragon is amazing. I know that motherfucker CGI, but when that, when that White Walker through that spear, I was like, when it missed this the first time, like, oh cool. I know. I feel like it's alive. Leave versus forgot me with the drag and Johnson versus Borg again. It was a virus though, right? Did they kept him out? He's missed weed a lot. Oh, he's Ms. Wade a lot. Ray Borg is miss wait several times. And uh, I don't know if he got sick while he was cutting weight, if other people around him, but it's just, you know, got, you can't, boy, it's a big opportunity to get sick for and it can happen for sure. But yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:44:21       I guess they have to do it again. They are, they already trained for it. Oh, well. Well one of the judges gave it one 18 the one 10 for Canelo Adelaide. Yeah. Adelaide. Bert Adelai bird did that. Was it? I mean, what's that about her record in the UFC? Terrible one 18 and one 10 for Canelo had they bird. That's so crazy that a woman or a man, she's a woman. She's very nice lady. Wow. There's that fucking bad she's going to get towards for that. No, that's terrible. How she stays offline and they have no, but they have no accountability. It doesn't matter. No, it doesn't. Nothing happens to them. They just keep right on being fucking horrible. That that's terrible. Yeah, it's not good. I better pissed jeans. There was one woman who got, she got in serious trouble for several really bad decisions and she wound up retiring because it was like people were threatening our life.

Speaker 2:          01:45:18       Mike Perry's a bad motherfucker. He's scary. It's hard. See that Jake Ellenberger fight if I dunno, a casino owner or whoever is running like the gambling, the guy at the top of, he wanted to it just say it in a different, yeah. If you wanted to rig it, would you go after? How would you do go after the judges or the fighter? You got your explanation. Two explanation for the game of Thrones thing. Okay. Multiple tweets have come that said that they can't swim, but they can go and water. They just sink to the bottom. Oh, so they sacrificed them. Yeah, but who's carrying those chains? They're not strong enough to carry those strings. Those chains were gigantic. [inaudible] steel is, can they get hundreds of them dragging him? They just sink. But wait a minute. They drag the dragon. How did their strong, I have to drag the dragon out.

Speaker 2:          01:46:03       Why are they strong enough to take the chains in? A lot of doesn't make any sense. There's still less holes now or whoever to put them down there is still done. Make sense? He just sacrifice them. Let them stay at the bottom of the water. They can't get out. That doesn't make sense. So they're just walking. Just walk out how you're going to just walk out hard. It'd be to chain him up. Even if you had cranes and all this shit. The chain. Nothing up. You'd have to have James Cameron down there with that little submarine trying to scope it out for awhile. Done that shit up like the titanic. Keith Peterson. Another excellent refereeing. That would be way harder. Titanic. A dead body. No, it wouldn't be hard than the titanic. Titanic's like miles deep into the water. Yeah. 13,000 feet down. Yeah, some. It's crazy. How good its deal and as shit to hook on. You could just look, go hook it up. This, Ooh.

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       My concern is usually, does it usually look like that? No, he's going Jersey shore for this fight is, he's a ruthless guy though. Super Powerful fucking knockout artists. Very dangerous. Yeah. We knocked out Ellenberger. I was like, wow, he's just real reckless and angry. Allen Joe, Ben handled them know Joe Band did a really good job. He had one last smart. I think that's his loss. I think that's as lost. But you know, that's a good fight for him. Joe Ban fought a technical fight and beat him and for a guy like Mike Perry was super dangerous up and come and do. That's a good fight for him. Learn something, you know, got leg kick there. As long as they just learn, you know, as long as fighters don't get discouraged, fights like that are always good for them because then you just realize there's a higher level and the only way to reach that higher levels. You gotta you gotta see it woo fuck room or is this live? I was alive.

Speaker 1:          01:47:46       Yeah. Yeah. Kids, fucking ferocious man. Look at that knee to the head. Look at this. Fucking fighting him off. So good tie right there. Hey, good, good. Moitai good clinching, but most importantly, like just relentless attack. Look at a boom, that elbow on the clicks. Boom. There's any, that's it. That's it. Ruthless. He's a ruthless motherfucker. That guy is relentless and it's just like all attack. It's all attack, all full bore all out. Just trying to smash you all the way. The guy that's going to beat him is a guy like Joe Ban who's going to fight a very smart technical stand up fight. Like Joe Band did a lot of footwork, a lot of movement, but he also made him pay. He made sure that like when it comes charging out, I'm like, you're not gonna get away with that. Like boom. We would catch them with some stuff and you realize like, oh, this guy can hurt me.

Speaker 1:          01:48:37       It was enough for him to keep Perry off. I'm a look at this shit. Elbow and tight. That's nice. That's nice. I'll get this dough. I limit limp Ville population one, Bam hammer fists to the back of the year. Did this guy have any kind of camp them? No, he did not. I don't see a lot of Thai clinches. Well remember Anderson and rich Franklin knows enough for like 10 years. Do you think it's because, because obviously it's a clinch that has a thousand levels and we need a lot of work. Do you think it's because most fighters don't specifically work on developing that clenching, controlling people from like clench and their training camps or it's just something that's low percentage in MMA? Not, it's not that it's low percentage. It's there's less of a chance of getting in an MMA because you're essentially allowing to got to get double under hooks on here.

Speaker 1:          01:49:27       I mean if you think about what you're doing when you're clenching someone's head, Anderson was so good at it, man. He had such a tight squeeze and it's like anything else. Like you know how like some people just have a sick Gabe cable grip. Some people just have just a six squeeze. They didn't have a, yeah, our fight or spending time developing that for short and Thailand. They, they stayed in Thailand. They specialize in it. They're working on it. They spend time on it. Yeah. You don't see it that much in MMA. You think it's good, take it to its low percentage. You're committing to this, right. You're committing to this guys are too good. You know, you give a guy a double under hook and he's tripping you and he's on top. But people don't want that and it's also guys are good at keeping their hands on the hips.

Speaker 1:          01:50:08       That's what rich Franklin fucked up. But there is a reality though that if the guy has, like if you have your hand on a guy's hips and the other guy is like got you in a Thai clinch, he can't elbow you from that clinch while you're grabbing on his hips and you're not really going to be in a good position to stop it if he's fast. It's a very good position to be in. You know, if a guy is worried about your knees and he does commit one hand or maybe even two to the hips, like you catch them with a couple of hard ones. A lot of guys will just switch to elbow like right from here. I am. And it's a ruthless ruthless thing. Elbows are so nasty. It's so, it's really kind of amazing that we cover up the knuckles because you break your knuckles a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:50:47       You never break your fucking smash bricks with your elbow. No problem. Nobody ever breaks or elbow fighting unless you get kicked, you know. But like hitting somebody, you might get like little chips, like Anderson had a bunch of chips in his elbow that he actually had to get removed, like bone chips and shit. Stuff that snapped off on the job on. I'm sure a serious problem with that, with this album. Didn't Gerald? I think Gerald's treatment had a bunch of floating around shit and his elbow to a lot of guys get that. I think he was the third choice for this too, I think. Really? Yeah. There was one guy they had, um, and he couldn't do it and I guess I don't care who is second. Will you watch how fucking ferocious Perry is? You realize why Tiago didn't want to take this with no camp or far with a fucked up camp? What was talked about his camp. Didn't he have a full scan to get out of Florida for the hurricane? You know, if that was like a week before the here yeah. Pulled from the fight. That's what they both came from. Farm that that's I think what uh, what the reason he gave was,

Speaker 1:          01:51:45       let me make sure that's right. He's talking to some shit about Tiago right now.

Speaker 9:          01:51:52       Everybody

Speaker 1:          01:51:53       Center. Everybody wants to see me beat up Robbie Lawler look at them. Wow.

Speaker 9:          01:52:02       This week

Speaker 1:          01:52:04       everybody wants to see me be a Robbie Lawler. Ooh. What a crazy thing to say. What a great fight that would be though. Good Lord.

Speaker 9:          01:52:10       Hello.

Speaker 1:          01:52:14       This is a fucking interesting one. If he really does do that, if Tiago doesn't fight him and then he wants happen, cause he didn't get hurt in this fight at all, he just swarmed them. And K Odom, he could probably fight again in a few months. Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:52:27       Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:52:27       I wonder what they're going to do. Are they gonna read match or make the remake remake rather the Tiago fight or whether they really do give this kid Robert Ponds and Aveo cause a good fight that guys, that's actually who I thought they were going to wind underneath. They put them up an Nelson. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:52:44       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       I don't hear any of this nonsense. Yeah. Yay. We go into the game. How can we, what do you give a fuck? You just knocked a dude unconscious it enjoyable guy though. Yeah. Ferocious fighter. Yeah. Just like his style is just a marauding ferocious, full attack. Reckless. A lot of lot of, uh, confidence in his ability to take a shot. A lot of confidence and ability to knock people dead. Like boom, landed that and like that's it. And then these great fight would be him and Alan Jobe on again. What the history. Um, yeah, it could be, doesn't show up on and have a big fight coming up. Uh, does it, why do I think Alan has a big fight coming up? Maybe I'm making that up. I don't think I am now. I think something was just announced. I Dunno it saying that uh, uh, Jago lost his dog and was living with family.

Speaker 2:          01:53:37       I with his family at the gym because of the hurricanes and then he'd be like, oh maybe you didn't before camp Mack, right. Yeah. Fuck all that. Being at the gym with your family and he's got a kid, a really young kid. Yeah, I get it. I think clinching insane. Insane. He's a beast man. And that's how Alan fights too. He's got a serious crunch to the fucker right there. That's the picture on my phone. I took my girlfriend off and put Francis in Ghana cause look at his hat. I love it. He's like, Edi mean up in that bitch. Here we go. Did they find anyone for him by the way, are know Francis after dusk? I

Speaker 1:          01:54:11       don't know. They don't know what's going to happen with junior. Uh, what the substance was. They said it was a very small trace amount of a diuretic. Um, so it wasn't like a steroid, but a lot of times guys use diuretics to mask steroids because it flushes it out of your system quicker. So like I say, if a guy's doing something he wants to test negative. Apparently you can flush some stuff out with diuretics because he just drains all the water out of your body and you keep pouring more water in. It flushes things out quicker. I think. I don't, I don't understand how that works. Diuretics are illegal. Yes. That's what, uh, cris Cyborg got popped for a diuretic. Um, but then they gave her a use exemption cause she has, who has a legitimate reason for using it, like a medical condition. When are they know what he took over.

Speaker 1:          01:54:58       They never know. They know what he took or was it the process of they have to, it has to play out. Like what did they think happen? What's the evidence? Like they're very, very thorough about it. As one of the things I really appreciated about that Jeff Novitsky is that he, one of the things he said about John Jones, he said before you judge him, we have to let this process play out. And he's right, like it can play out. Not yet. I mean they, they got the B sample, the B sample is positive as well. Um, but it was a lot of weird shit was going on. Like a lot of his chiropractor was tweeting that John passed the blood test free. John and like this is so irresponsible because like anybody who looked into it even for a moment would realize that they don't even test that stuff in the blood.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       They only task for that stuff in the urine. So there was no, like when they said his blood test was clear of it, it's because they didn't task for it. It's a, it's a urine test. So like it was so disingenuous. So then they waited, they got the B sample, they tested that. Yup. Same exact stuff. So it's in there. So the question is now, not whether or not it was in his body, but how did he get in his body? There's a big issue with a bunch of sports guys. What, what does it, baseball guys, they're getting popped with that stuff. Brendan Schaub brought that up as well, that apparently that stuffed Taranto Ball, Toronto and a ball, whatever the fuck it is, tee ball is in a ton of supplements. You can get in a lot of that GNC over the counter muscle builder, bullshit, all those testosterone boosters and your mind could be, but you're not supposed to take that shit.

Speaker 1:          01:56:35       You shouldn't take that shows you have to come back off a suspension. Like shouldn't you be sending everything? And that's, that's, it's crazy. But they're tainted supplements are a real issue. But obviously the thing is don't take any fucking supplements and unless they're absolutely approved and certified and you know, and you can get supplements that are approved and certified and then there could be a random bad batch that's, that's totally possible. That happened to somebody. Um, I supplements where a guy never really took a steroid but got popped because something was going to supplant that happened at Tim means to means took some shit from a GNC. Just some normal shit that supposed to be some stuff you could buy off the shelf like and uh, he tested positive and he told everybody what he took. They went to different stores independently. Pull that stuff off the shelf, tested it.

Speaker 1:          01:57:23       Yep. There it is steroids, but he still got his boy. Is it a six month suspension? They do a year. Yeah. He's not supposed to take that stuff. Like even though it's not illegal, you just, you have to approve everything. And then on top of that they have a list. They have a Usada list on the website that you can go to and find out what's tainted and what's not. Holy Shit Dude. It is the craziest thing you've ever seen. It's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of supplements. It's like there's so much shit that makes you piss hot. It's crazy. What's the most common? What's the most popular? I think there's a most popular, they start with like muscle farm type stuff. Yeah. They're starting with a and they work in the way through P and, and sec. Yeah. Dude, I'm talking hundreds of things. Like Novitsky pulled the website up and we were laughing.

Speaker 1:          01:58:07       We were laughing at how many things are work cause it's so absurd. Is there anyone who doesn't take anything, any supplements? Do you know of any fires or they talk the most minimal. There's some guys that just take fruit. Fruits and vegetables. Yup. That like, uh, the ones from mom's Sanford and son now are, those are tainted Mon Sanford and son and not total Elijah. She saw fruit and vegetables. Those are tainted, those are genetically modified. They didn't have a shelf life of 20 years. He posted a Joe Hogan from mayor sign and somebody who put up the word. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:58:41       Well he might not have somebody else did I guess. And they were just talking about him, jog and, but I think that, um, there's a lot of tainted supplements for sure. But I think there's a lot of guys using steroids too. So I was like, which one is it? Is Did Jon Jones take it tainted supplement or it was Jon Jones using steroids. Those are the only two options at this point cause that's Tufts in his body. They'll all, the other option is somebody dosed him. Then I thought I'm going to have somebody couldn't find out. Well they have to do some sort of an investigation. He has to come clean. I talk about everything that he's taken. Um, they have to, if he took something that is not on their list of approved substances, any didn't claim that one. You know when they, if that's the case, he needs a goddamn babysitter.

Speaker 1:          01:59:29       If that's really what happened. If it really was a tainted supplement, just some normal bullshit from a supermarket, a health food section, who the fuck knows if it's really just some nonsense. He needs a babysitter. He needs someone that's around him that he trusts and respects some mentor figure that does not allow him to take anything stupid and tells him, Hey man, you're the baddest motherfucker of all time and you're about to get put on the shelf for four years over some nonsense. Matt Serra raised a very interesting point about, again, it was just a speculation, but is it possible that this was happening because all those fights happened before you saw sada? Yeah, except for Osp. Well, there's always going to be that speculation. If someone pisses hot, you always got to think, well, if they piss hot in Usada and back when it wasn't very sophisticated and the drug searching wasn't that sophisticated, maybe they were doing it the whole time.

Speaker 1:          02:00:22       You got to, you got to wonder. You know? That's why I like a guy like Tony Ferguson is so fucking spectacular. You know, you look at a guy like Tony Ferguson and he's just got mad focus and work ethic. He's just for Roche and he's just ferocious in his, in his, in his focus and his intent. Like that guy doesn't need steroids. He just needs food and life, you know, and he's just going to keep going. He just needs a place to work out and he'll build it too. That's the crazy thing. He's up there in big bear building gyms. Builds his own fucking rolling room. He's got video of it and photos of it and shit. They mapped it out a room. He nailed all the boards down and shit. And he built a bag stand. Yeah, like a workout little why does he do that?

Speaker 1:          02:01:05       He just liked the act of doing it. He's the kind of guy that if shit hit the fan and we, it was an apocalypse, uh, like he's the guy that you're going to want to hang out with. He's going to build your house. He's on your shelter. Yeah. And all you gotta do is just make sure everything's cleaned when it gets, I'm not that guy call up like a Beta and I begged. Yeah, well that's what community is all about. It's supposed to have one of those guys, one guy like you. So we'll just have one guy Ligeti I mean that's, that's what a real community is. The idea that everybody has to be the guy that could build a bandstand, but he can, he does man. He cleans

Speaker 7:          02:01:40       your friends the cabin. He's on fire dude. He's just always on fire. He'll go for a run through these hills and these mountains in the streets and he'll have a crew with them running. And I'm in the car cause I have a torn ACL, some of my car following them and he'll beat them by so much and then come back for him and then go and then come back for him and go, these are all professional athletes now. His, his endurance is insane. He's at, he's into doing extra credit and if we're going to do 10 rounds of sprints, he'll do 12. And he's always going to go extra. What's going on with your knee? Did you pour ACL? Tore MCO.

Speaker 1:          02:02:15       Um, is it partially torn? Is that deal is, yeah, it's not Tom to um, Doctor Rati Mcgee.

Speaker 7:          02:02:20       He's talking about surgery and my doctor, uh, we're talking about, let's try to rehab it and see what happens first and then you could always get surgery later. Um, he said, has it, you know, with me, I told you that all I did was just stretch out and I just stood up and my knee just fell apart. It came out and I had to pop it back in and then I got an Mri the next day and it came back. Partial tear in the ACL torn MCL. You really don't need surgery for the MCL. Those apparently they just heal by themselves. You just got to stay off the ACL. I'm on, I'm on the fence. I could have surgery right now or I could try to rehab it, but um,

Speaker 1:          02:03:07       what's, what I'm the, I don't know what Clz anterior cruciate ligament is a ligament that stabilizes the knee, keeps it from popping forward. I've had both my ACL reconstructed from the same, from fighting. One of them from Jujitsu, one of them from taekwondo popped out. Three weeks later I was doing a seminar at 10th Planet Ocean side. And right there in the middle of seminar. Boom. It came out again. Yeah, it's going to pop out in front of her. I'm just like, if it pops out that much, man, I would go to a different doctor. I go to Rodney Mcgee, man, just go, go to him in Vegas. I talked to him and we see, he seems totally legit, but when he's talking about is the surgery, you know, new kind of surgery that they're doing, the new surgery only the healing is only three months.

Speaker 1:          02:03:45       They don't use a cadaver anymore. Now they reattach and you're a perfect candidate for it because your shit's not totally torn apart. They reattach and they resell it up and one dude did it in five months later he competed in the Olympics. The the, the recovery time is so much different because what they're doing now is repairing your ligament. Whereas before what they were doing is putting in an artificial ligament and then that ligament would act as a scaffolding. So not artificial, but a donor. Like I have a donor on my right, one from a cadaver, cadaver Patella or hamstring. I had patella on my left and cadaver on her. She left feeling both of them are awesome. Left Zoster, Baltimore.

Speaker 7:          02:04:22       Apparently people are moving away a little bit from cadavers cause sometimes you can get an infection like Benji radic. He had his ACL, a cadaver ACL and he got it got infected. You got

Speaker 1:          02:04:33       infected from the surgery. He got staff from the surgery, which is super, yeah, it's common from the cadaver. It's at the actual tendon. Well you know Murcia I know, I know the doc, the doctor that I'm going to cause the one who did his, yeah, but it's, there's no way to tell whether it was from the actual surgery itself from cutting you open because a lot of people get it from like any sort of simple operation. They get mercy stopped doing, he stopped doing so you don't do consumers and he's just does patellas well now what he's Dr. McGee was saying is the most latest cutting edge shit. You don't even have to do that. Now what they're doing is they're taking this torn stuff and he had pictures of it and images of the actual surgery. They stitch it together and rope it down and like literally stitch it together and they have this technique that they do and then you're up and moving like you're up and moving.

Speaker 1:          02:05:23       And if in three months it's 100% instead of six months, what's the technique? When are they just kind of cocoon it with a bunch of rows of stitches. Crazy looking like apparatus, the way they were doing it, the way they had it stitched up like some crazy fishing not but uh, apparently it worked amazing cause they the, he had some videos of this guy a few months postsurgery doing box jumps and I was like this is crazy. Do inside box jumps, like hopping on top of things, hopping on top of another thing, jumping over things left and right. I was like that is incredible for someone to go from ACL surgery, do it like that was a rat. That's a recipe for blowing your knee apart. Three cause I remember after I got mine for like six months, I was terrified to do anything like, and I, when I first came back to Jujitsu I was terrified.

Speaker 1:          02:06:08       I was like, Huh, Huh, Huh. Like every time I roll it's like, please don't fall apart. Please don't fall apart because if you call them for six months, so hard to do and how long until you're doing it, you're like, all right, it's not going to fall apart. A couple months, like eight months in, I realized I was like, this is pretty good. I'm feeling pretty good. I was through any kicks forever. I didn't kick the bag forever and when I did Jujitsu, like if anybody even went for my leg, I would tell him, I please don't, don't Yank on this one. This one's still ginger. And it was like, I wouldn't like try to explode with it and push off with it. I was real gentle, gentle on it. This fights about to go down. Ah. What do you think Eddie? Bravo initial thoughts. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:06:50       Does Luke Rockhold get the same guy after getting catered by Bisbing? That's a hard, hard one to call. Been a long time outside the octagon. Jim Norton, what do you think? You're the host of UFC uncensored. I'm taking David Branch. Ooh, New Yorker goes with the New Yorker, David Branch moving towards him, dropping some shots. Luke Rockhold is got a powerful left kick. Yeah, strong left kick. And he landed it a few times to the body already. It's a legit kick and he catches you with it way outside. And Luke Rockhold super hard to take down. He trains all the time with Daniel Cormier and Cain Velasquez. He's got all these monster wrestlers over there. How be you've never met off and you think branch wants to take him down. He might, he's kind of very good ground game. Sends a Roscoe Spinning Sidekick Kale finish, is that right? No, he got wheel kicked in the head by Vitor Belfort and, and then he got um, uh, Chris Weidman tried to will kick them and he took why into the ground and beat the fuck out of them.

Speaker 1:          02:07:47       And that was the beginning of the end, right? Yeah. It was crazy cause up until that, it was like a really competitive fight. Branches, Sarc doing a good job of circling to his left to avoid that left kick. He's not well, but he landed it right. Their branch is doing a real good job. Oh, he's, he's putting Rockhold and danger and Rockhold he teed off on him. Oh my God. Rock holds in trouble. This is a real fight. And he's, Oh my God, he's take Rockhold down and that's how you know rock is in big trouble. I brought, she was super hard to take down the state standing ab, but he lets him know he can take them down. God Damn, this is legit. And he just looked over at his friend and waved and said, I'm okay, or as coach his corner, but it doesn't look okay.

Speaker 1:          02:08:31       He got hit with bombs, man. You never, okay. When you get hit with those kind of bombs, you might not have gone out, but you're not okay. She's fucking him. I may so much different than boxing. These two fights highlight it like you do. You guys barely know who Mike Perry is, right? Yeah. But meanwhile, he's so invested in that fight. Chaos. Right? And this fight, this is the fucking chaos in so many different ways. One 18 to one 10. I'm not going to, I guess get a room or the fucking weekend. Adelai Berge it's a very nice lady. I can't say anything terrible, but that's where it is.

Speaker 1:          02:09:06       She's always very pleasant. She always waves and says hello. I mean just cause I don't think I agree with her. And boxing. Yeah. Not Mad at the lady. Do judges get removed for poor officiating to good questions that ever happened? Well, back in the old days with the Nevada state athletic commission wasn't being run very well. Um, Bob Bennett, the guy who runs it now as an animal, he's, he's on the ball. He's really good and he's really smart and he's just a real easy guy to talk to too. And you know, he wants us commission though, Nate. Yeah, he's, yeah, he handles all that stuff. So most likely he'll probably be looking into that. That's, do they ever get booted though? If it's not corruption, if they literally just think this guy sucks and making decisions, do they ever get kicked out? Like you've questioned many times.

Speaker 1:          02:09:52       It's a good question. I don't know enough about boxing. About, I know when there's a bad decision and I know names that I keep hearing, but it's not like I know a MMA judges. That was the, that's that's disgraceful score. Disgraceful. I agree. And has she had an another? Yeah, there. Just that she's had some terrible decisions in terms of what I think about the call. Ooh, look out for the knees on. He's trying to trip. Branched down. Luke Rockhold super strong, super strong. Top game branch might be fading and been here. Nope. Branch still looking at wing. Some shots. One of the things that branch thought was a big factor in this fight with his boxing but he's got to avoid those kicks. Especially the left one man, the left one's the big one for Rockhold and he'll do it off the switch. Ooh, that's a nice right leg kick. He'll do it off the switch and he's got a nasty question. Mark kick is question mark kick is what he used to crack Bisbing with cause he hits you with the body shots like over and over and over again. And then he gets your region. So he throws one like this to the body and then at the last minute he whips it around over the top. He's nasty with that. Really good with that. And it's like one of his best techniques.

Speaker 3:          02:10:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:10:58       That in his left power kick, that left power kick to the body. It's just so good. He stopped cops to Phillip. Who would that left body kick as well? Oh, we went jumping round. Kicking. Nice straight left. He said, no, no, no. He certainly looked like he recovered. Yeah, he recovered for sure. Oh, we just clipped David Branch with a right hook. Look. Rockhold does not want to go out like that. Bisping fight. See, here's the clinch. Well, you're talking about, yeah, so it's just way harder to pull off. This is too much scrambling in MMA and looking for take downs and stuff. Look at how Luke Rockhold getting the back. Get in the back. Oh Shit. David Branch almost goes down. Oh, Luke Rockhold on top. Very dangerous on top. Super strong and branches tired as fuck man. Rockhold looks like he's surgeon here. Branch is doing a good job. That protecting them. One thing Brock holds, got to watch out for is his legs. What brand is on the Henzel Gracie school? What's his motive? And putting them up against the cage when he's smashing, smashed against the wall. They can't move. He wants to just hold them somewhere. Ooh, not makeup.

Speaker 3:          02:12:08       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:12:09       dude. What do that shit? Um, yeah, just smash him. Rockhold came on strong towards the end of that round, there's nothing more claustrophobic and washing that when someone's mushed up against the cage like that. Uh, I could be, but Johnson fight that it's probably the most claustrophobic I've ever been watching fight over it. That was one of the worst ones over. There's an art to smashing a guy against that fence for sure. Keeping them there and land in shots and wearing them out and just smashing them. It takes you back to when you're 10 years old, like that's how I got beat up when I was a kid. Like, you're just helpless in a corner. Dude. That happened to me when I was 14. That's when I started wrestling. This guy took me down in the locker room and he was like gonna Punch me in the head, but he decided not to because it was so easy for him to take me down.

Speaker 1:          02:12:50       He just grabbed me in a head lock or I didn't even know if we were fighting. Like I didn't know what was going on. Like we were looking at each other and he was talking some shit and I wasn't exactly sure like what we're going to do and then all of a sudden we were grabbing each other and he just got me in a headlock and threw me on the ground and held me there and could have easily punched my face. And to this day I owe him a debt of gratitude. Changed Your Life? He did change my life because he made me realize like, oh my God. And then I had a friend, my friend and Arduino, he was a wrestler in high school and I was already doing a martial arts den and it just had no idea how easy it was for someone to take me down. And we went outside. We went outside on the grass and it was like, I could take you down easy. I was, no you can't. He's like wash, boom. I was like, fuck that. Try again. Boom. I was like, oh my God, I gotta start wrestling. So those two events

Speaker 7:          02:13:39       led me to wrestling class, wrestle in high school and I was terrible. I was probably one of the worst wrestlers in high school history. I got one one take down. I would never take anybody down. I was always afraid that I was going to catch a knee and my teeth. So I would just sprawl on dudes. It took down, they tried to take me down. That was my game plan. But regular people, when I'd get in a fight, I would take them down and I always felt like I was cheating, but I didn't care. Cause you use wrestling. Yeah, go. You know what? I don't give a fuck. If someone fucks with me, I'm a double leg them and then I'd get like twister cycle from a punch their stomach. I did that to us, a soccer player. He was talking Shit in school and um, I took him down. It took several guys down. I think that it would be cheating. I thought it was, I didn't think it was real fighting back then. So when I saw her voice, when I saw, holy smokes, he too, I'm like, Oh shit. You could take dudes down and fight. That's, that's legit. He's hurting that light. By the way. Rockhold was really hurting that lag bolt guys are hurting their legs. Rockhold yes, it's

Speaker 1:          02:14:30       been landed a bunch of hard leg kicks on branch too. This is a serious fight. That's what I mean. He's been, he's been hurting branches like Oh yeah, but rock holds her too man. This is a, this is a real fight. Very good fight. Is it a funny now like a fight where two guys take each other down. It's like totally standard. Like you know, kids today would ever think that would be cheating. Like that's how you fight motherfucker. If someone takes someone down like Oh shit, grounded pound kids know the moves so I can draw. Oh you guys, I see fight videos. Just street five videos where someone takes him down and they tap like that's like the understood move. Now it's hilarious. I but it, look, if people can tap in street fights, the world would be a better place. Yeah. Because if somebody leaves you alone after you tap and they let it alone.

Speaker 1:          02:15:13       Like if you guys agree to fight and then someone taps and then the guy who respects the tap. That's good that that'll done opens. Yeah. I hope it does. I hope it happens more often I guess of the Times it will push your fight to begin with though. Yeah. You know. Sure. You're not signing the contracts. Some Guy Fuck your chair. Exactly. Exactly. Boom. Then what's some of the craziest shit girls fighting? Cause it's so primal, especially when they don't know how to fight and that grabbing hair and just screaming come off laws wailing at each other. See the thing about Rockhold is he's so used to this shit cause he's in the gym with DC and Cain doing this. So like there's very few guys, they're going to have a kind of clinch game that Rockhold is going to have and the kind of grappling like grinding skills that Rockhold is going to have because he's been doing it with these fucking monsters.

Speaker 1:          02:16:07       Yeah. I mean, Ryan, his past, he's said, oh, there's a lot of time left to full Mount Cha not good for branch. Super Bad for branch. Let's see if he gives up his back and trying to get out. That's, that's super dangerous. Don't panic. Let's see if he panics. He's got to figure out a way to defend himself. Oh look at this. He's given up his back. He's given us, do you have it off of his back? It's going to handcuff him. Oh, he got that back. Oh, bad place to base flat. And this is terrible planning at time. Branches in a world of Shit. Doing Rockhold does this to everybody, man. Yeah. He gets on top of you when he just smashes you. It's so impressive to veto. Right. Look at his top mount. No, he did it to, um, uh, uh, the Odo Leo Machida. Oh to our wheel. Kicked him in the head, remember? Oh, that's right dude. Ranches in serious trouble. He's going to flatten them out. That's a serious mountain man. That back mountain is out of control. His mount and his back mount or sees his top game. It's just fucking ferocious. Oh, branch has done. He has done, he's just, he was just covering up. Dan's giving me a lot of chances here, but he's taken a fucking bad beat. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap strikes.

Speaker 3:          02:17:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:17:23       To, to strikes. Great fight. Fuck. Yeah. That was a great fight, dude. Brock holds top game. Might be the best in the fucking division. He might be better than Romero. He might be cray. Yeah. He's a black belt under who? I don't know. I don't know who they are. Um, it's not, um, oh, it's an achy Dave Camera Rio. How long has he been at this forever? [inaudible] still in Aka? No, I think, but a lot of guys, I trained with them still. A lot of guys still go over there and she just, yeah, we'll throw it to somebody. That's a joy. Would you suck on that? No, I wouldn't. Would you put in your mouth? No, I wouldn't. Girls would. Some girls would. Some girls want to get pregnant with that. Spit get you pregnant. I used to depend on the fighter.

Speaker 1:          02:18:15       Boom. I got a text message from Vinny Shoreman fucking Adelaide bird. Again, a lot of people are aware that alley birds does know the best decisions. It's true. Boom, boom, boom, boom. She's trending. Jamie knows who's trending. Would you ever know who's trending? Never. Not. You'd ever know? Would you ever had any idea ever who's trending? What was that? Would you ever have any idea who's trending? No. Sas. Jamie. Oh, it's just the newer still trending. Can't you train it? Two different ways to like locally like I've had guys go, dude, you're trending, but I'm not. It's like a fucking local, like in Jersey. I'm trying to compare it to other Jersey people. Nice. Which is, how does that work? How do you get, how do you train in Jersey? I don't know. There's a way to do it location wise. Like it gets your hopes up and utilize.

Speaker 1:          02:19:02       I'll no one fucking cares. Luke Rockhold put the beat down. But I'll tell you what, man, David Branch made it a scrap made a scrap from the beginning till Luke Rockhold wore on him with that pressure, that clench and that wrestling too. I'm telling you man, all those years with Cain and DC, I mean you don't get any better wrestling than that. You don't get any better, more savage, big giant dudes than to think about it. Olympic class wrestler and the arguably arguably the greatest UFC heavyweight ever. Well who puts, but who helps cane light that cause he's obviously he's heavier than combination. Not much. Not much. DC walks around all the time at two 35 to 40. You know, he'll, he even said he was feeling kind of slim like this time after the fight. You know, we did commentary last weekend and he said, uh, he was, uh, usually he'd be at like two 35 by now, but uh, he was lighter than that.

Speaker 1:          02:19:57       I think you'd be like two 15 or two 20 or something like that. But he'll get up to two 35 so it canes to 40 so when they're in the neighborhood of each other, like five pounds difference with a worldclass grappling like those two guys have, they're just going to war constantly. It's always a problem now for big guys guys, two 50 and above finding training part. Sure. Tough man. It's tough. We don't have very many big guys we've got right now in my class, I think the biggest guy pro 200 pounds crazy it. What a fight man. Huh? And that crazy Luke Rockhold. I'll tell you dude, when that guy gets people down, they are not getting up. He has one of the best fucking top games.

Speaker 1:          02:20:44       You don't see a lot of tap house due to strikes. A lot of people don't do it. They don't believe in it. A lot of people have said that like that's a bitch move. I don't think it is even a, even a little bit. I think it's a smart move. When you're getting hit, you're getting fucked up and you know you're not going to recover, you know, and the fights over it. There's no need to take extra shots if you know that you're done, just tap. But it seems as if they see fighters say this. Well a lot of people like George Saint Pierre. That's one of the things that Bj Penn was taunting him about how he tapped it strikes against Matt when Matt beat him, Matt beat the shit out of him and a clipped him with a pig right hand early gun on top of them, banged him out. And then GSP tapped his tracks and Bj was like, I would never tap the strikes. But really maybe some of those career fights he should have. If you know you've got nothing left, why not? Yeah. Getting out of what.

Speaker 9:          02:21:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:21:43       Brisbane. I Dunno. That's some bad trash bitch being cause he's saying it's his fights. I think he feels he should be fighting for the belt. Nut. GSP. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:21:57       Oh Man. You're getting credit for taking that and so I got my first round. Yeah, he was in trouble, dude. He was in trouble for sure. That Thai clinch stopped the strikes. Yep. This, this is what stops everything man. His fucking smushed game. I look at that step over mount may no resistance and getting that amount. He just overwhelmed branch branches couldn't keep up that pace. You know Luke Rockhold. I mean he's a reason why he was the champ. He's fucking world class November, November Madison Square Garden. Whoa. He's, so he's telling GSP to back out. Well, there's people who are still thinking that GSP is not going to make that fight. Yeah. There's a lot of people think that GSPS crazy. Now he's lost his marbles. Why didn't they keep delaying it? Well, because of the, uh, the time lapse thing and the Ufo thing that he saw, he kept talking about aliens.

Speaker 1:          02:22:48       Like he was obsessed with aliens to the point where they wanted to leave it out of a, one of the UFC countdown shows. No Way. He talks a lot about us. Yes. Yeah. He's trying to tell us we're not listening to, there was some, he talked about it on my podcast, man talked about, uh, he thinks that like sometimes he'll, he'll like be missing time and then we'll like be somewhere else. It wasn't comfortable listening to, didn't you pointed out to them that that was kind of a trauma? Yeah, well that's one of the main signs of trauma. You know, loss of memory is one of the big ones. You know when you start talking about missing time and aliens like, Whoa, okay, why would you think it would be aliens when you got hit 800 times? Like he's, he was hitting more than 800 times in his UFC career. It was like, no, no, no, no, no, I'm fine with that. Aliens are fucking with me, dude. Damn, that's crazy. Maybe it's true. Maybe it is. Imagine if we were like, we're joking around about it. Meanwhile, every night while GFP, GSP sleeping, his body freezes wool. The room fills up with blue light. Little dudes like fucking walk right to the walls will

Speaker 7:          02:23:56       and he's like, no, don't take me again. And they take him to this patient cartoons. They want to get that. You want that perfect super athlete. GSP DNA. They take them there and then fucking, they have a whole underarmour lab and space and they do an anal probe and him and then he turns around and goes, I am not impressed. Why? Why is it always your, but man that was playing with your but regular doctors don't, but I think it's like that. That's how they test the blood to see what you're eating. Plus they probably know it bothers us. I bet you could learn a lot from shit.

Speaker 7:          02:24:34       What did they started giving poop samples like that was more accurate than than pis. I mean we have no problem with piss samples. Try Shit samples. It is shit and colic. Hey, piano, piano like all right, can't believe you're making me do this, but I'll do it like w if ups made you shit in a bucket. Yeah, cellophane. The top. We found a new, there's a new blood, a drug test, but we need your shit. That's the only way you really, no way you're going to, yes, you're going to do this and we have to have at least four pounds of it. Can you imagine getting a friends to ship for them? Dude, I need your shit to do, do to just hide in the fucking air duct. You have like a bag of shit. You're like tap the wall twice and you dropped down like a fucking demon. Take a shit in my bucket and climb back up bro. What can he get caught?

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       It is shit. Listen, you been eating good. Like eat a lot of fiber. Like can you shit on command and they don't be dogs and smelled. There'll be like a steroid sniffing dogs. It was just a fucking Bagel and they started eating your shit. Then that means you're guilty. You don't get this puppy. And when, uh, when he was little, like as the shit would be coming out of his, but he be turning around and trying to eat it like dance. It was, he's was like taking a shit. He's like, oh he couldn't wait with that. No. Like puppies are weird man. They smell shit and they, they're so, they're their babies. They think it's food. Yeah. They don't understand that. Just like bad move. Literally like soft serve ice cream coming out of his ass always turn around and try to snatch us. It's like a thousand times stronger than ours, but they don't think it's bad.

Speaker 1:          02:26:10       Can you imagine what shit smells like? Liked the smell shit bad. They like it. It's like it just, it just flips out of like it's a defense mechanism. Well No, they like rotting bodies. Two dogs. Yeah. Dogs find like a dead beaver. Some shifts they'll roll around in it. They're like, like it on their skin. It's weird. A weird, maybe we've been brainwashed into not liking it because we're supposed to eat bugs where I was supposed to eat insects. Right. It was a smart thing to eat when they're being, I mean we wouldn't need to go to supermarket if we'd like bugs, which is eat bugs. We just trapped. We slice and stuff are only up to a certain point. Like once you can make shit, there's no need to eat them anymore. But she knows supposed the Ilene. Yeah. I was listening to a lecture about this.

Speaker 1:          02:26:50       Well they were talking about, um, okay. No, it was Terence Mckenna. That's who it was. And he was talking about how we used to be insectivores and so that reward system is still in our consciousness. That's why people get super excited when they catch a bug. I'll give you like, that's why people like those butterfly kept catchers. They'll like to collect butterflies and shit and the capture. I'm like there's a whole like group of people you know you can't trophy like no one like no, you know like people don't like trophy hunters. Like it's gross. You go over there, shoot Ryan, I was to put them on your wall. Collecting butterflies is totally fine. Nobody gives a fuck about butterfly. They kill them once they get them right. Well they don't last long anyway. So that's like actually like I guess the mindset. But there's people that like collect them like serial killer.

Speaker 1:          02:27:35       I think they have these butterflies pressed up on the glass and I've, I've collected all these beautiful killing all these bugs. It's like they're like trophy hunters. But for bug, that's one step. Throwing a fat girl and your well anybody out there fighting for bug rights? Well I'll tell you when it could happen. It is possible that it could happen some day with um, with, with there's a bunch of different people in different parts of the world that he, crickets and cricket protein is like really rich. It's very good. Cricket protein is very good for you. Yeah. Cricket protein powder right there. People um, are starting to turn towards crickets for animal protein for vitamin B, 12 for a lot of things. And a lot of people that might have like ethical issues with eating animal protein don't have it with like, maybe insectivore will be like a thing.

Speaker 1:          02:28:24       Like people don't want to mess necessarily commit to being Vegan, but they don't want animals to suffer. But they're cool with eating crickets like that. That would actually be a good health move. Like you could get a lot of really rich protein, like look at all the fucking, look at all the shit that's in, in, in crickets. Like how many crickets, how many crickets you get out of 10 a hundred, what is it? 10 gallons of water. They're going to be in there anyways. So for a hundred gallons of water you get 71 grams of crickets versus 19 grams of chicken. I don't really know what this means. I don't even that it's just so weird and they must be protein protein versus a or or the amount of a weight of body mass of the animal. Cause I would imagine crickets use very little water, right?

Speaker 1:          02:29:07       They're creepy little bus. They used to create that much less water use to create that much protein. Whereas like cows drink water, chickens do like they need actual water. How long we forced him. Asshole comes out and tries to defend cricket rides. It'll happen. It'll also happen with robots. As soon as we start making human looking robots that do shit for us, somebody will start to say you have to treat them a certain way. It may or may not happen. Right. There's a real problem that if we figure out that plants have consciousness and they know that plants do have some consciousness. Yeah, they had, they know there's some communication going on between plants. It's just not what we think of his consciousness, first of all because it doesn't entail moving, but there's, there's some sort of information that's being passed on. In fact, plants have chemical reactions to being preyed upon.

Speaker 1:          02:29:53       Like clants plants change their floor, their flavor profile. Like they'll make themselves disgusting for animals to eat just based on whether or not an animal is trying to eat them. So if something eats them, it changes the smell of all the animals around them or all the plants rather around them. And then they change. Like for the Keisha Bush, they've studied these things when they go down wind like one will get eaten by a giraffe and then the wind will catch the other trees and the other trees will become inedible to the giraffe. It's filed. It's crazy. There's some sort of community. I have my stuff trimmed, wants to know while I'm like dead fucking that hurt. I really did the one more with the snapping in the face and goods plants. It's a good question. Like what is pain though? Right? Cause our pain might have to do entirely with movement in our central nervous system, which plans definitely don't have.

Speaker 1:          02:30:38       So even though there are living thing, they might have consciousness but they might not be experiencing pain. But they do know that they have some crazy rep relationship with fungus and that the fungus or extracting minerals from the dirt and he's like mycelium under the ground and they have some sort of relationship with the root system and there's a whole community and this like exchanges going on and like these ecosystems of plants, like when you see a jungle, we think about a bunch of individual plants, but they're all working together. They're all like sinked up in some way that we're too stupid and self centered to consider. Plans gave me the creeps I like, they fucking creepy out fuck. Out of a plant is bugs. There's so much about them. I don't get in the

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       fungus. They really do freak me out. Anybody thinks the understand plants? Look at Venus fly traps. Okay. D that's a plant that kills bugs. Look at this fucking plant in, I want to say Ecuador. Is that worth from? There's this plant, it looks like a flower and mice and rats go around the edge of it cause it's, it's smell sweet and the smells like rotting, rotting meat in there and they fall in and this thing closes up on them and they absorb it and eat it. They eat rats or that goes right to check that. Okay. Back that up so I can see it to sell Venus fly traps. You can remember that shit. Look at this show. This mouse is like, man, that's, Michelle knows good. Whoops. I mean they're now I'm dead. So it gets get out. Is it slippery on the sides or does it?

Speaker 2:          02:32:04       There's a plant. It's just super slippery. Like the mouse. It's, it has a delicious smell. So what else comes there and just falls right in the hole. A frog bitch, boom. Venus fly trap eats a fucking frog son. And how does the Venus fly trap actually eat it. Crushed to death. Trying to eat it. It's like just a react. It just the reaction and then they just die and then somehow it just like fertilizer just feeds it. But it's an accident like that fell in that plant that could be just like a glitch and the design and we're actually falling in will end up ends up being fertilizer anyways. All sort of changes in plants or in, in in animals is all like natural selection. Right. So there has to be some random mutations and then some of them stick and then the was one funny, another rat shit.

Speaker 2:          02:32:56       It's going to smell the place up guy. Maybe mice were eating it and slowly but surely figured out a way over millions of years to shrink those fucking mice in the fall and into, yeah. So like they fall under and they starve to death. They die, they get absorbed by the plant. What is there, is there, I don't know, some sort of a judge justice breakdown and just digest them while they're alive. Something I want to, shit way to go eventually dies in there, but the frog, the the Venus fly trap. I didn't even know they can eat a frog. That's a fucked up way to go. Yeah. Plant clamps down on you. If you're walking through the jungle, they need to try to breed gigantic ones of those two and why can't they? If they can manage them in your house, that's something that you had Parana besides Bronto. That was the craziest, I was thinking about getting crocodiles at one point. The illegal or know exactly. I'm Venus fly trap. That's gangster. Giant breeding giant ones. Big Ones, big ones, some what do you call those dudes? Botanists. Geologists. Triology a tree side. That's actually a great idea. Someone should do the giant ones and that's your security system. Climate. Do you need for a Venus flytrap don't try to rob me. Alero perfect. Kyla, you can't grow them here but what you do or

Speaker 7:          02:34:17       as a, as an animal, what a Dick, you must feel like when a plant catches you. So fucking humiliating badge if you were walking through the jungle was probably the retards and caught by some plant that they didn't know about yet because there's like hundreds of thousands of different species in the Amazon and this place is in the Amazon that people just don't go. This is no one there. And if there are people that like these uncontacted tribes, they find these villages like, what the fuck are you doing here? And they're like, what are you like this people to this day that are like these uncontacted tribes in the middle of the Amazon? I read somewhere that 90% of the bugs in the Amazon don't have names because they've just evolved so quick. They just can't keep up with the evolution. I don't know if that's true or not.

Speaker 7:          02:34:57       Oh No. There's a bunch of bugs that don't have names, but I'll tell you this. When I went to coast, I got tricked into going to Costa Rica once I that thought we were going to Costa Rica Party, Ken Kuhn, I was thinking Ken Kuhn, the whole time going to Costa Rica is a bunch of people went. I'm thinking Cancun, Cancun. I didn't know we were going into the jungle. We went into the jungle and when at night to sleep in the jungle. A mansion in the jungle. Oh, that's mentioned. I can, but still you're in the middle of the jungle and at night. Holy Shit. I just doused mice. I bought all the off at the knee at the data village and they had like a little convenience so I cleaned them out cause I'm scared of bugs and I didn't want to really let anybody know that I was a big pussy about bugs.

Speaker 7:          02:35:36       I got, I got tricked into gone. I literally die. I used off as gel in my hair and put her all over my face because I knew when that sun went down it was going to get nuts. Even in the mansion you worried about getting, we were all hanging out outside of Soho and the mansion has open, um, ceilings. It's open air. Oh Dude. It was a complete nightmare. But my point is at night, every night we'd all, we'd all sit in front of the pool and all first you'd see all the frogs coming out of nowhere. And that first night it was so trippy. The guys that live there go, you're going to love these frogs. Don't be scared. They're the ones that are going to save your ass. All these frogs are everywhere in. All of a sudden the bugs just start coming out and it's, it really is like Braveheart.

Speaker 7:          02:36:15       It's a bunch of frogs and you see them. You don't have to wait and see. You just see them just going after bugs. It's just a war. And the guy, the guy that lived in a house that was watching the house, it goes, you're going to love this. It's just chaos. Was that they're preventing you from getting bitten by just eating the fucking bus was preventing that. I was cool. They didn't, they didn't come around me. But I swear only once did I ever see a bug. The same species that were all different. They're all mobs looked like mosquitoes that look like centipedes. It looked like stick one. There were all different and there was all open air too, right. So they were flying in your room and shit, dude, I could talk about this one hour, but they tricked me. It was a night mare.

Speaker 7:          02:37:00       Cause the people that liked it, they're the kind of people that have a giant like spider moth lands on their shoulders. They do. You know, like one of those dudes, you know what I mean? You know those dudes that don't give a shit about, but if you would like Costa Rica, if you want to move there, you're 100% one of those guys that doesn't get around you and you slept here. She'll be hosted, but no one told me to bring a fucking net and there was no more. Bring your own net, put a shit hole the first I walked in there as soon as soon as we're driving in this bus through the jungle, I'm going, oh my God. How many days? It was a nightmare. Every night was a nut. It was a nightmare. But I had to keep it inside because there was girls and when I was single and I, it was like a slasher movie and so I didn't say anything.

Speaker 7:          02:37:49       I just knew and I'm like, damn, I thought it was going to be like king can shit. So we get, we get to the Manchin, we get to the mansion I have and they go, your room's air, your rooms there and everyone's got their own rooms. There's a couple of couples, they got a room and as soon I'm already tripping. Uncle Buck when the sun comes down. Holy Shit, I'm a big gigantic vagina when it comes to bugs, like mod scare the shit out of me. I'm a big pussy and we're going into the jungle. That's all I was thinking. Oh my God. Oh my God. So as soon as I walk into my room, I noticed that it's all open there and I look up and there's about 40 50 bees in my room. 40 50 be nesting in your room. They're just flying all over the fucking place.

Speaker 7:          02:38:31       So I dropped my bags and I go downstairs and the guy that's watching the match, an old Vietnam vet, white guy who left civil, all those guys live down there. They leave their jobs, they leave their family, they try a new life than they hate it. And now they can't go back. Now they can't go back cause they do. They left everything. Yeah. But anyways, so I went downstairs and I talked to this Vietnam vet. I'm like, is there supposed to be a bunch of bs? And I room like God, just turn on the ceiling fan on low, don't turn it too high. It will make just, you just want it to be uncomfortable for them. And then a couple hours there'll be gone. They don't like that little breeze. And I'm like, okay, all, and then I'm thinking, what about at night when the bugs just flood in?

Speaker 7:          02:39:09       And he's said, oh, you need a, you need a net to sleeping. I'm like, Shit, what do you get those? It was a, they're usually sold out, you know? And they were sold out. There was no net. So I slept every night, every night. I said, first of all, I was complaining about the bees. I talked her, I was like, I had to let it out. I held it in and I said, dude, you guys have bees in your only go. Yeah, we got bees too. I'm like, oh my God. So I started complaining about bees and then a girl goes, okay, captain be watched. We get it. You don't like bees? And then at that point like, fuck, I got to shut the fuck up. No more peep out of me. No Sarcozi captain be watched. Conscious. The appropriate response. Yeah. Yeah, so I never said Shit.

Speaker 7:          02:39:49       I held it in every night was an ironman. I slept in the sheet like completely covered and you could just hear z z and then we now that when I had to take a leak, the bathroom again, if you like that you don't, you don't care about bugs. So they want crazy shit like a bathroom. When you opened the door as a bathroom, there's no walls and there's no ceiling. It's like an outside bathroom. They liked that shit. They like that shit. Oh, it's cool that people that don't mind bugs. If you're like the jungle, if you like the jungle, that means you don't mind bugs here that it's like there's like, I think 60% of the population that don't mind bugs. 40% are terrified. I'm terrified. That guy, that pets hornets. I watch videos and this guy to go on youtube. There's a guy who will appeal gently stroke wasps and Hornets.

Speaker 7:          02:40:36       He's like really fucking creepy fingernails, but he touches be there. That's probably my greatest fears every night nightmare. Oh, did you get will never go to a jungle again in my life. Did you stumble a baby much off on me. Had completely doused in pets the bees, but he actually does it with this one probably has. It looks like a, I don't know. That one probably has those stingers probably in Japanese horn. It they're away from the nest. But uh, this one may not have a stinger, but this guy is that he does it on the nest. I've seen guys petting them on the next, yeah. This guy can live in Costa Rican. No problem. That might not have a stinger. You'd fucking love that man. It looks like a stand to me PPO. They put those things honey on their finger and it just fuck it. It comes up to Jack Him Man is just trying to sting him though. Yeah, he's just avoiding it. It keeps trying to jack and I wish I had those powers. I wished there was a pill that could make me feel like that. Why would you want to do that? I wouldn't take that. Some pharmaceutical get fit. Get rid of the fear of bugs like you gotta it gotta be on it every day. It's a weird reactions. What if the shit hit the fan? North Korea blows up the United States and it's not gonna happen.

Speaker 2:          02:41:43       North Korea would go to war with Russia. We go to war with China at this place is a disaster, but you can live in Costa Rica is still, it's safe. You just gotta deal with bugs. Eddie.

Speaker 7:          02:41:53       I would go, you'd get dapped. I would. You would adapt. You adapt. You adapt. But I couldn't bugs really. A, it's a really weird, I don't know how anybody can be comfortable around them. I don't get used to it. I have silver fish in my apartment. They fucking disgusting. Fucking whore. Creepy. But I was diagnosed. I douse myself every morning, fresh coat. Does that make you feel creepy? I didn't give a shit. No. I mean like did it make your body feel worth it was worth it. The bugs didn't want not had too much on me do I put it all over my face, all over my hair in my balls. I didn't want to get bitten a dick.

Speaker 2:          02:42:28       There's a this stuff like, you know what line of Cain is like a pain killer? Yeah. It's like a numbing cream they put on. I uh, had a bad sunburn, wants like real bad. I was in Mexico and I was sitting on the beach and I was not paying attention and I didn't realize how bad I got burned. My back was on fire. I mean it was like serious, serious pain, especially if I'd start sweating. And so I got some, some of this light of Cain stuff and it says like, only put like two pumps of this shit put on your back. Of course I put like 13 pumps. I put it all over my back because my back is an agony. And then like an hour plus later I started feeling like shit, like nervous, like sketchy, like shaky. And I was like, oh my God. Got like this

Speaker 7:          02:43:11       is like almost like I'll like a cousin of cocaine, you know, it's like, it's doing something to me. It's not like getting me high. Like I'm like, no, no, I felt shaky and creepy. And you want to have sex. I didn't want to eat, I didn't want to do any of that. Did it go into your skin right here? Fucking central nervous system, but it makes your Dick numb. That's like the thing. It's a numbing cream. Like Dick would wilt with the numbing cream and I feel it. When I was a kid, my problem when I first started having sex young, I was 13 my girlfriend was 13 she talked me into it. I didn't want to have sex. I was cool with dry humping, but I was cool with that. I was really aggressive. It took like 10 months to get the dry humping.

Speaker 7:          02:43:57       It took a long time. But once I got the dry humping, I would not, she would not. We were done. We never got hit a big wall. We plateaued, but my problem, well we ended up having sex and the, after the 10th time she started crying and I asked her, what's going on? She goes, this is no way. They thought it was going to be nice and I know what the fuck I did wrong. So I told my brother was older and he was really experienced with girls at that point. And the first thing he said is, well, how long are you fucking her? I said, I don't know. Minute, 90 seconds. I don't know, cause dude, that's why she started crying. Dude, you've got to hold that shit. So I had a problem. I was premature ejaculation. Like that was my big problem. So, uh, my brother gave me this cream called, it was called stay hard.

Speaker 7:          02:44:43       That's how the poor of shops, shit, it was called the s s s t a just without the y hard. And I used that to just to, to, you know, so I could last a couple more minutes, but didn't really work. I remember guys would always say that there was talk about that. So yeah, the reason one of those girls could do the, they put the shit on the Duke so they don't feel anything. Yeah. That's why they could folks along first time, five minutes for me. Then my shit just went right through. It almost came by, it was fucking gay. I was getting blown. Me and my friend were hanging out and uh, I had my dick through a hulk doll and my friend is blowing me. I didn't know what come was, so I felt that come coming. So I ran to the toilet and stood over it and nothing happened.

Speaker 7:          02:45:19       It was a real dud. Um, this dude that I know that was in the porn business told me that back in the day, they used to literally inject some sort of chemical into the vein and their average yet they use to make their, what is it average yet? They still do that, but it can fuck your dick up so bad. It can turn purple and black cause the blood doesn't leave it. It's called Havard Jabber jet, I think. I think it's cabbage yet. Yeah. I've talked to guys who have used it and they said one guy said that his dick almost would've died. I, no, no, no. I think he needed to have the, uh, the pledge, right. Drained. But he had a real problem with it and he said he wouldn't do it again. It got so bad in the porn industry that they got their own form of Usada testing porn stars for Viagara. Oh my God. Like it wasn't fair. Porn stars Viagara the business would call apps. Can you imagine, go back to those 19 days when John Holmes

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       had a limp snake. He's trying to like shove it in checks or on Bola. You remember our Bulla, he looked, he was the fucking the worst looking guy ever. But John Holmes, isn't that the guy with the giant tick? Johnny White? Yeah. All medications ever invented isn't, isn't Viagara the most effective? That's the one that works. The bad. The side effects of Lisa's heart is bad for you. I mean it was a side effect. Yeah. But now it's wonderful, but the side effects of it, like pretty mild stuff. Who knows? But how many people are dropping dead of that? Are People dropping dead by Agra? What does it say? You know, fibrosis from this coverage act is one of the, Oh, Caverject. What is that? What's penile fibrosis? And that sounds like a dick saying. It's like we would know what the fuck that is. You have to explain.

Speaker 2:          02:47:03       It's like psoriasis of the Dick Penis Shit to form. Penis shaped that way. Hmm. I wonder what it looks like. Maybe a curves down. That's good. Damn. There's some chaos tonight. I guess we missed a bunch of chaos. So we found out that Brennan shop is a fucking genius. Genius. He's a soothsayer. Is that the word? Uh, he's uh, he sees the future. It's a prognosticator he's dead right? He's right. He couldn't, couldn't give it to go up kid unless he killed Canela. I wonder what the general public thinks about the decision, whether or not they think it was a good decision.

Speaker 2:          02:47:46       Yeah. We're insulated to hear the interview, but uh, yeah, he didn't speak English anyway. No, I forget what he thinks. What I to he of course he, I'm sure he thinks he won. I would like to see, I don't think he thinks of one, but what if he says like, you know what? I didn't, when he deserves it as a bad decision. What if he says something like that? That would be ballsy. That's a ballsy move guys up. That said that recently in the UFC, right? Yeah. There was someone who has that. He won a bad decision and he's like, you know what? I didn't win. Yeah. Who was that? I don't know man. I see too many fucking fights. Eh? Are you going to be there on October 7th for Beautiful Vegas? Yeah. It's going to be insane, man. He's training like a fucking machine. I'm sure he is. Holy Shit. His jujitsu is sharper than ever, man. You know it's going to be a great fight. It's very fun. Very interesting fight. Big Step up for Kevin Lee. Yeah, he's a, he's an animal. He's a beast. He's explosive. He's fast. He's got a really good, a rear naked choke. He likes getting the back and putting a anacondas in body triangles. He likes that. He likes super well rounded. Yup. Yup. And surging, surging young guy, you know, only like 25 but you got to kill Tanita beat him. You do. You've got to

Speaker 7:          02:49:07       kill him. He's a savage. There's no way he's, he's going to fight to the death. Does he rent the same house every time when he goes up to big bear, does he do it in a different house? Yeah, Tito's place. I think it was still for sale for awhile back and we just work out at his house. It just turn the garage out, turn it into a little Jiu Jitsu, the room and we just fucking work. She's still fighting Tito? Yeah, he's got a couple more fights going on. He said he's supposed to fight Chael Sonnen again and he wants to fight uh, chocolate Dell. I think they check. You have any interest in that? Yeah, he needs that cash. Tina used to have the sweetest set up up there. He had crazy big log houses, like two of them and one of them is fighters would stay in that.

Speaker 7:          02:49:47       He was training with one of them. He would stay in and he had a whole gym set up with a full size octagon, the whole deal. Pretty fucking dope. And it was for sale for a while. I don't know if anybody bought it, but Tito was one of the first UFC fighters to realize that I just fucking hit up to big bear, man. Get that work in up there. It's worth it. How old is Tito? I would say now he's probably 37 38. If I had to guess, why do you feel when you got by going to home? Find out how old title. I've been aware of it like 30,000. You know when you do a camp up there, you feel like you've done everything right and you've done everything you can. Some mentally 42 just being up there. Yeah, right. Mentally. Yeah, I'm doing, I'm up in big bear.

Speaker 7:          02:50:29       That's like there's nowhere else to go. That's the spot, right? These at as high as you can train in I California, California. Cow. It's smart. You don't want to go any higher. Um, like I said, the, the best guys now, most of the time they tried to work at sea level and sleep up high for endurance glove gun does. He doesn't work out in Big Ben. No, I think he works out of whatever the fuck he does. Doubt that shit. Cause that guy when 100% all 12 rounds and he wasn't tired at all at the end.

Right. We know what big bear does by watching glove. Good. They're doing it the new way might be better, but who's proven that?

Speaker 7:          02:51:20       Let me see a file. Let me see a high level of fight like that. Let me see. 12 rounds like that. Oh you went down, you trained at sea level and then slept.
