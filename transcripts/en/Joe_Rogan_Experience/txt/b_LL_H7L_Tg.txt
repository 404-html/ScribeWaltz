Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Real good experience.

Speaker 2:          00:00:12       Can we are flying Ocean Pacific flying above the Pacific. I'm with Dana White. What's up? Tony has gone hello everybody. And uh, we're uh, basically we were in shock right now. No one, no one here should be allowed to vote. They shouldn't be allowed to drive. We should all be forced to settle in. Don't make any rash decisions. Like right now we're dealing with a, this is a crazy time. We just got, we just got done watching. It might not be the biggest upset in combat sports history. I know I said it after the fight. I think Buster Douglas might've been a bigger upset because buster Douglas was kind of a fuck up. He was kind of a guy who didn't, didn't really train hard, didn't take care of himself, and he was a 42 to one underdog when he knocked out Mike Tyson. Holly Holm was only a 12 to one underdog when she knocked out Rhonda and Holly was, you know, very respected in the combat sports world, multiple time boxing, world kickboxing champion, but still on Twitter when I was hyping this fight off and I was telling people about this fight, so many people saying, you're trying to sell us bullshit.

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       You know Holly doesn't have a chance. Freddie Roach said Ronda Rousey is going to destroyer and it was all these articles and you just going. So it was an upset, but it wasn't just that it was an opposite. It was the way she did it, the way she did though. She fought the perfect fight and when she had kicked Ronda, just the icing, the cherry on the cake, goodnight everybody and hammer fist at her when she was out. I mean, we're all shocked. I'm in shock

Speaker 3:          00:01:53       placement shot. I mean there's a reason right now why literally my phone at four o'clock in the morning was going crazy. Every media outlet on earth, I mean, you name it, my Dave Sholler, our Pr Guy said, pick a, pick an outlet. Say it. Just say something to pull it, pull the name out, they call it, and they want either hollow Holly, Rhonda, they want to talk to him. I, and I was saying earlier to you guys, it's like patriots looking good this season. They just, they just went nine to know did they could win another Superbowl. The world will not go fucking crazy the way the world went when to, you know, went to bad ass human being square off and, and uh, and uh, and uh, you know, combat fight in the world goes fucking crazy man.

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       We're not used to women doing that. And if we are using, there's a, there was like a brief moment in the past or Christy Martin got big of the coal miner's daughter and she used to box on TV and she would have these kinds of fights. But one of the things about watching women fight was they didn't really knock each other out. They sort of beat each other. They had each other. But

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       when when Holly head kicked her on the last night, he was like, it wasn't just that she beat her, it was just that one. It was such a superstar. When such a superstar gets beaten like that, the whole Russ to go, what? It's like when buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson. It wasn't that a guy got knocked out. Everybody knows guys can knock guys out. We've seen Mike Tyson knock out a hundred guys. It's not that it was at Mike Tyson got knocked out. What? What? What's like it didn't fit in our paradigm of how the world works. The world works. Ronda Rousey runs out, grabs girls, throws them on their head, armbars bars or she needs the most dominant punches him in the face. Takes him out to see that happen the way it happened. To See Holly Holm fight the perfect fight and be so classy to all through the media, everything. She did cool as a cucumber during the weigh ins. Rhonda screaming at her in her face, everything Holly was stone faced never changed her expression. I mean the whole day,

Speaker 5:          00:04:01       it's almost the same feeling, not the same feeling, but almost the same feeling that I got on nine 11 watching this Cheyenne trade centers come down. No, I'm serious. I mean we knew when the trade centers got hit by planes, we were like, holy fuck. But when you watched him actually come down and you're like, there's no way something that's solid and that stabilized and strong and powerful is coming down right now. And that's how I felt when the leg kick happened. Like I felt like if there was a delayed reaction from everybody, like people are like, oh yeah, she just got head kicked and she went down, but it's up over. It's not really over. And until the graph and tell her dean wave that hand, I still think it took 10 2030 seconds before people really realize what was happening.

Speaker 4:          00:04:45       I was outlining it before the fight and what was funny was all these people on Twitter were like, you know, you try to show us just bullshit. We're already watching. Stop trying to sell. It's bullshit. You know, Ron is going to kill her. But as I'm outlining it, I'm outlining kicks. I'm talking about old bleak kicks. I'm talking about movement and distance and Holly Holmes striking credentials and like this is, this is a complicated fight for Ronda in this space. It really sunk in with me when I saw her at the weigh ins. You could tell that she realized like this, even though Holly wasn't doing anything disrespectful, she wanted to get this emotional, she wanted to turn this into something like very, very personal and she, you know, I don't know what was going on, but Rhonda was, you know when you do that at the day of the weigh ins, you're trying to get in their head, do trying to rattle or shake her up and Holly was not rattled or shaken one bit at all exchange. What was the other thing that we were talking about during the broadcast? We're saying like this is a girl who's, she's faced intense pressure before world championship pressure and boxing and kickboxing. She's been there, man, she's, we're shooting all over this fight. I kept saying, I did

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       a radio tour the week we left for Australia. I said, these girls had 45 fights and had multiple world titles there. There's a, there's a sense of, of uh, you know, experience and, and, and this just calm feeling even though she's going in against Ronda Rousey and Rhonda is, you know, I guess now you could say she was really the female Tyson for or for the sport because of the way everybody's reacting to her a loss. But you know, this girl has a lot of experience, man. It's, it's a big deal and she has the distance to range. She has great head kicks, you know, and good hands. This was, this was a great fight. This was the fight to make.

Speaker 4:          00:06:39       Well, you know, what it was is that she didn't come into our own, in the UFC until this fight. Like even though she looked great and other organizations and should not be out when she fought in the UFC, the few fights she had in the UFC, she was still trying to find her footing. Like in the Raquel Pennington fight. She looked good but she didn't look like a world beater. It's like we talk about this all the time, but being in the UFC is such an overwhelming experience for fighters that it takes them several fights like Kyle Noke, like Kyle. No cause had what, 10 fights in the UFC. I don't remember. I don't even know how many fights that in the EOC, but last night, Tom, into his own last night when Kyle Noke fought Sabata, he came into his own, he landed that, he looked fantastic, land that front, kick the body and said to himself a lot when I was interviewing him, he's finally believe it in themselves.

Speaker 4:          00:07:30       It takes a while to get comfortable in there. The other thing to this sport and this sport, it's so different to coach. This is, we're on a plane right now. What's your name, ma'am? To sell and just though is, uh, the flight attendant. Thank you very much, ma'am. Would you change that to eight together? I'll blackjack JB on. Yeah. We'll pause this for a moment. We'll come back in a little bit. Yeah. Oh, you're going to set up the tray right now. Is that what you're doing? Okay. Okay. Thanks. All right. Thank you. Just so well. The other thing is

Speaker 3:          00:08:04       that in this sport, and we say this all the time, there's so many different ways to win and lose and um, it's so hard to be perfect all the time of the sport to go undefeated and go on these long runs for 10 years like Josie Aldo, or as long as the Anderson Silva did, or as long as Ronda Rousey did, it is hard to be perfect every time you go in there. Because I don't care how good of an athlete you are. How long have you been competing? Not everybody jumps out of bed every day and feels perfect and feels good. The timing is on your body feels right. You know, it, it just, it's not possible for that to happen all the time. It's for, that's why when people go on these undefeated runs in this sport, they are, they're fucking great. They're truly great. Uh, and then you take all the things about physically not being perfect then had the pressure and the workload that gets put on you when you become a UFC champion. Ronda Rousey did it better than anybody's ever done it. The amount of work and the time she put in how hard she trained the things that she would do. She didn't become a huge superstar the way that she did for no reason. She, she worked at it. And you see Conor work at it and these guys that, that, that, uh, that can go on these long runs or are very unique individuals,

Speaker 4:          00:09:19       pressure that she's under and the pressure and the distractions, you know, when you see her and all those media events move all seen her on all these different talk shows and all these magazine articles. Is that yours?

Speaker 3:          00:09:34       Oh my God. It is like, listen to this song. He's got his beats headphones blaring, but the, when you see all these things,

Speaker 4:          00:09:43       I tune into them and I, I see them, but I don't think of how many she's doing that. I'm aware of them. You know, if, if someone's aware of, if you're aware of someone on the tonight show, if you're aware of someone in a rolling stone article, think about how many things they're doing that you're not aware how much shit Rhonda is doing all day long constantly. Or phones blowing up. Media requests constantly. People asking her to do things

Speaker 3:          00:10:06       and you know, you know, most people don't realize they look at somebody and go home, big deal. You got to do interviews, you got to do this. It sucks. A lot of energy I imagine doing that stuff is very time consuming. You always have to be on, there's tons of preparation that goes into it. The travel that's needed to do it. It's, it's a, it's a, it's a heavy workload when you're, when you become the champion. Let's a heavy workload

Speaker 4:          00:10:29       guy like you who doesn't have to fight. It's a heavy workload. Constantly doing interviews for someone who has to fight and you have preparation, you have to train, you have to eat right, you have to sleep right. You have to make sure that you get all of your physical preparation in. I mean the, the, it's, it's, it's a massive, massive distraction.

Speaker 3:          00:10:47       Carlos Barsa we'll call those bars. Uh, um, you know, one top, she was the champion. She, we started putting her on, she had to do media than we needed her to defend her title. And she started to freak out early. Like, I, this is, this is, um, to this too much. I'm, I'm breaking down. I just got off the ultimate fighter. I trained for this fight. I won the show and now I've got to defend the time. I got to go back and just people start, you know, Rhonda said this quote this last week, she said, um, these people who think they want to be the world champion have no idea what it really takes to be the world champion. And it's so true. You know,

Speaker 4:          00:11:25       I remember when Bj Penn beat Matt Hughes when I was interviewing Matt in the Octagon and Matt was very candid and very honest, and I really admire the way he approached it because no one's ever, I never interviewed anybody before and they talked about it like that. He said, honestly, losing as a relief. He said it was a just a tremendous amount of pressure being the champ and having all these people coming after me. And, uh, honestly it was a relief from my wow, what a ballsy guy he is to admit that bite. That

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       what an honest guy. It's so true. Th th the, the amount of pressure that these guys are under and the workload and then you take Rhonda and you had movies on top of it. She's doing movies on top of it and books and going on book tours and all this stuff. It's, it's, it's a, it's a lot of work for anybody. And uh, like I said, she, she did it better than anybody's ever done it. She really did. Now when you look at the fight stylistically, that's one of the crazy things about fights. Um, you know, you can get a guy like Floyd Mayweather figures out how to box people and get to a 49 to no record, but to figure out how to beat every different style of martial artists. When you're talking about takedowns leg kicks, all these different things. We had talked about the one thing that we hadn't seen Rhonda deal with with someone who knows how to kick and we really had cats in Ghana was the only possibility.

Speaker 6:          00:12:42       And Kat just made a, a crazy mistake and rushed. Rhonda got caught in a scramble and got arm barred. But what Holly Holm was able to do, it was the first time we ever saw anybody knows how to kick keep her on the outside. A lot of movement, a lot of kicking. And that's kind of missing in Vonda's game. The, the, the kicking aspect, we really, I don't, I don't recall ever seeing or throw a kick. I mean if she has maybe one or two ever. I mean if you, do you remember seeing her kick? Yeah. I don't know. The thing is is that Ronda was a fucking tornado and ripping through everybody, like in seconds. Um, you know, so he probably don't get to see her full name or what she's got in last night. You know, last night was just craziness south. So it's tough to to sit back and look at game play because the other thing is what are you going to do with holidays now you can look back and said, well, she probably should have tried to grapple with or she should maybe try to double leg or getting the clinch, take her down, do this, that and everything else.

Speaker 6:          00:13:44       But, but that's not Rhonda. Rhonda is, I'm going to go out on a fucking bang with you. I'm going to try to try to throw you off. I get the opportunity to throw you off throw you. She just, she never got any opportunities. She got into a couple of exchanges. She rocked Holly a couple of times but she never really, you think she blocked her? She did. From what I remember seeing the fight, I remembered seeing Holly look like she got hurt a couple times in the fight by Rhonda. I didn't see that. I remember seeing her charging after Holly and maybe connecting a couple of times at punches, but Holly was always moving back and you know, like when someone's moving away and you hit them, it doesn't have nearly as much him. No doubt. She was on the outside and she was picking her apart and hitting her with big shots, planting up, planting and then throwing that straight left. No vin planting hit her with a shoulder one time hitting her with hooks. She hit her with a couple of those oblique kick to the legs to jar your knees, you know, reminded me of watching an actual both fight when the bull charges and the, the matador hits that sword a couple times. Like that's what it reminded of. So you were saying

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       about the time where Rhonda

Speaker 5:          00:14:53       Yeah. Oh my God. When Rhonda missed that one time and she turns around and looks, it looked like a scene from a movie when she misses stumbled. Yeah. She like, she fell down and, and Holly just ducked under him, was out of the way, turned around and she had a look on her face. Like, who am I going against right now? It's exactly what her face said and she was wearing it and, and I think that was a huge turning point. I also think when, you know, I went crazy when Holly Holm took her down cause they were clenched up and it looked like Rando was trying to get that toss and all of a sudden Holly lifted and sort of just did like a standing double leg sort of then got her down. It was, I think psychologically a huge turning point. There was

Speaker 3:          00:15:37       clinch there at one point and they ended up going down to the ground and Rhonda was trying to get an arm bar owner and then Holly pulled out of it. Um, yeah, I got to see the fight again. It was, it was so fast and crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:15:49       We replayed the entire second round, but the second rail, she was already beaten up. We had time and I was said to Bruce and the truck, I was like, let's do the whole fight again. Let's do the whole fight, comment on it. And you know, with, with the knowledge of what had happened and because we're only dealing with, you know, seven minutes, let's, let's do this whole thing again. But we wound up playing the second round again and Rhonda came out for that second round already flustered already. She was so tired. Going back to that first round lake, her legs were wobbly. She was breathing heavy. And I like Edmond. I talked to Edmund all the time. I enjoyed talking to him. I was a hug that guy. When I see him, I do not, I do not like what he did in the corner. He wasn't honest with her. He told her she did great. He was like, great, round champ. Everything's great. I mean, maybe it was trying to psychologically pump her up, but that's not what you need to, I mean, she needed technical advice. She needed, she needed someone to tell her what she's doing wrong and how to correct it. Then I think, you know, I mean, he's more of like a boxing coach than he is an overall MMA coach.

Speaker 3:          00:16:52       Yeah. I mean, well, the thing is, is that, uh, you, uh, if it isn't broke, don't fix it. Right. You know, that's a very good point. The thing is now is as you know, what do they do? He listened to at the end of the day, Edmunds, a guy who really cares about Rhonda and her career and you know, all of that stuff. So I think as it, as a team, they'll sit down and try to figure out what went wrong and what needs to be fixed.

Speaker 4:          00:17:17       You know, and Tony, you had a great point. We were at breakfast today. You were like all these people on Twitter, like they knew what was going to happen. Oh, you knew he was, oh, well, I assume you bet everything you had there.

Speaker 5:          00:17:28       Yeah. Everybody wants to stay that they knew what happened. Well then where's the, where's your bedding?

Speaker 3:          00:17:33       Well, you want to know something? Vegas went down last night. A lot of people did bet on Holly home last night. And um, apparently there were some big college football games last night with, with huge spreads and they parlayed Holly Holm and college game. And this is what I heard, I don't know if this is fact, but this is what I heard today here in Australia, is that the Bellagio had to shut down for over an hour because they didn't have enough money in the cage to pay everybody from the Holly Holm bets that we, you know, and there's some guy, uh, his name's Vegas Dan or something like that. He bet $25,000 on her. Um, 2021 to 40. Yeah. 12 to one allegedly is going to have to shut off their fountain. Save that water bill for a little bit. Huh. They, uh, the other, the other big bet that everybody was taken was the over the over was around and a half. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:18:36       You know, it's, um, it's an interesting situation because, uh, I'd love Rhonda as a person. I consider her a good friend. I really like her and I know you do too. And, uh, as a person, I'm sad for her loss that this happened to her. Um, but how home is a great person to, you know, and there are two great competitors and I think ultimately what happened yesterday last night is great for martial arts. You know, and it's great for MMA because even though it was terrible for Rhonda and I feel terrible for her, I still, I feel great for Holly Holm. It's very con very conflicted. It's like I'm trying to figure out when I'm, when I'm interviewing Holly in the inside the Octagon, I'm going in there as a person who cares about Rhonda. It's tricky because this is the biggest moment of Holly Holmes Life. And I want to honor that and I want to go in there and I am genuinely happy for her while at the same time genuinely sad for Rhonda and it, but I can't, I can't acknowledge that I have to be happy for Holly.

Speaker 4:          00:19:45       And not only that, not only do I have to, I, I wanna I want, when I'm interviewing someone inside the octagon, I am trying my best to get them to express themselves. I want Holly to set, I mean this is the new bantamweight champion of the world, Holly Hall, and she's got tears in her eyes and her dad's dad and her husband's there and winkled John's there and everybody's down. It says intense and tense moment and I just want, I want to get that out of her. While that was all happening and I was thinking to myself, what a good person she is because she's a, even though you know, like love Rhonda and I care about Rhonda, like what a good person Holly Holm is, you know, she's, she's just like, you can't help feel happy for her. That's true.

Speaker 3:          00:20:29       It's the, it's the crazy thing about this business that we're in. It's not just Holly and Ronda to every, every, every person that goes in there and competes in the octagon both have these fucking dreams of, of winning and glory and, and world titles and money and all the things that go along with it. And then every fucking weekend when we do a show, one guy or girl moves forward and one guy or girl moves backward. It's, it's, it's a crazy thing in the Holly Holm and her, her, her father, her husband and all the crew that was around her could not have been better. People could not have handled the whole situation, but could it just, I couldn't agree with you more. Such a very, very good people. Um, I went to the hospital last night and I had Joanna young Jane check there. I had Valerie Laterno there and that Ronda Rousey there and I'm walking from room to room going, Jesus Christ, this is a crazy business more man. You know, it's, it's just so crazy. These girls, you know, even even Joanna as, uh, you know, as dominant as she was last night, she was hurt. She broke her hand, you know, she broke her hand. Valerie, what turnover is? Oh my God. Her, I was massive. It, I'm serious. It was the craziest thing that I've ever seen her eyes last night

Speaker 2:          00:21:50       and I was so swollen by the end of the fight, I can only imagine all looks like in a hostel.

Speaker 3:          00:21:55       Joe, it was so bad. So then I'm like, how's your leg? She looks at me and she pulls the covers over and shows me her leg. I've never seen anything like that. It was, I'm telling you that for a little girl is banged up right now.

Speaker 2:          00:22:12       Took some hard, hard shots in her leg and really kept kicking with it. Kept coming forward. She is so fucking tough left on top. So time, the women are tougher than the madman. Women. Women have fucking babies for Christ sakes. They're way tougher than us where he talked with them. Well, I'll tell you, I'm so impressed. First of all was a Latino's ability to rise to the occasion too, because that was the best fight ever fought in her life, or at least what I've seen in the octagon and against Yolana who's a fucking killer. She's so good.

Speaker 3:          00:22:47       See, we always believed in Valerie thought valor was good, big, strong, 115 pounder for that division. Now she's at least going to sit in the rankings where she belongs. You know what I mean? She wasn't ranked number eight. She's, she's, she's better than that. Then she approved it last night. Um, Joann, it's just bucking the monster. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:23:07       She's so tough. She's so tough. And Tony is in love with her, by the way.

Speaker 5:          00:23:11       Yeah. I'm in love with the Ohana. If you're listening right now, Johan, I love it.

Speaker 2:          00:23:14       Yeah. They don't call it Johana then call Yohanna. Yohanna. Yeah, it's no age. There's no age.

Speaker 5:          00:23:23       Everybody pronounces it differently, including her. I've heard, I've seen her in different interviews and say her name, toto six different ways.

Speaker 2:          00:23:30       Some of them, when you know, people would start calling a yawn. A champion. Yeah. They call it our champion now. They don't even want to fuck with young Jedd check. It's like you try spelling it. There's three people on the planet. They could spell her last name.

Speaker 3:          00:23:42       How bout she broke her hand and was throwing punches right up until the bell, like she didn't have a broken hand. She's awesome, man. She's a beast. She's a beast and she's arguably one of the most technical strikers in him and made today. I know. She's so good. Without a doubt. And then going back to the HollyRod thing, I mean, Holly and Ronda are the two, the two best in the world on a 35 pound division. Holly Holm fought the perfect fight last night, man. As you sit and just think about it and run it through your head, fought the perfect fight and there was so much going on to Rhonda. Didn't want to touch gloves. Were there all the animosity and the land? We Lady Gaga came out today and said, that's what happens when you don't touch clubs. Lady Gaga should know cause she's been fighting for years.

Speaker 3:          00:24:31       She's been crazy. Fucking Donald Trump. No, that's crazy. That's, that's how big this fight was. When you really try to wrap your head around how big this fight was, Donald Trump, who is running for president tweeted a nasty tweet at Ronda. Tell us, hey, the between, uh, he said, uh, he said, I'm glad Ronda Rousey lost last night. She's not a good person. And to help Donald Trump's plane apparently was pissed because he came out and said that Rhonda was endorsing him for president. And then Rhonda came out and said she was not well, she said she was endorsing Bernie Sanders and she, which is ridiculous cause she's rich. Rhonda, Rhonda, I love you. But Bernie Sanders is that there's a lunatic socialists then yeah, he's going to take your money. Right. You've got too much money. Go with Hillary. Had them hunter post to that. I'm pretty Sanders. We'll take 90% of her wins as soon as he's elected president.

Speaker 3:          00:25:31       He's got some ridiculous ideas about wealth, but I just can't imagine lady Gaga and Donald Trump tweeting about an MMA fight. Like how big this fight was this, this fight broke every record we've ever had from the venue to merchandise to commercial paper view. Um, everything, I mean, everything, the, the, the numbers that are rolling in are astronomical. Holly Holm has, when we just took off, we took off at 1230 in the afternoon. On Sunday. No, on Monday, right? It's Monday and yeah, we just took off at 1230 in the afternoon on Monday in Australia and Holly Holm was still trending worldwide, number one. And the NFL is going on right now. And there were crazy games like green bay lost, uh, again, the, the, the Patriots barely beat, uh, barely beat the giants with us. Last second field goal with six seconds left and Brady drove down the field with a minute. Let Holly Holm is still number one trending worldwide will because it's so stunning because he, you've seen football a million times when the ball goes across the line. Yeah. But he gets crazy. But to see someone like Rhonda Rousey, a movie star, you know, the transcending

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       the world of mixed martial arts get fucking head kicked like that flat lined and blood and the hammer fists like Whoa. Just so stunning. And when I think about Lady Gaga and Donald Trump won, the first thing that I was thinking when, when we're talking about this was you and I had been friends for a long time and one of the first UFC that I came to when we became friends was right after September 11th in 2001 when Tito Ortiz fought Vladimir Matt Yushchenko and you guys went over the paper view. So the, the what, what happened was there was a cutoff of three hour cutoff and when the cutoff hit, the fight was still going on. It had timed it wrong. So then you guys had to give a fuck load of money. I wasn't even working for you back then. Right. I was just your friend and we were hanging out.

Speaker 2:          00:27:33       We were drinking and that you and Lorenzo and frank like Whoa, he lost millions, millions who just like, everybody was like, I was a bad one to, everybody was like, oh fuck at palms over the base who window. So the paper view shut off with two rounds left to the flight. And uh, so people, people want their money back and it was not that many paper. If you buys back then, man, it was, it was so fringe and I had to, I felt a responsibility as a fan to try to support it. But there was no social media back then. It was nothing you could do to support it. I mean, there was nothing I could do. I did. I talk about it in the interviews, you know, I go and do the Howard stern show a talk about it. But that was, they would put them on these fear factor tours where he'd do these radio tours and talk about UFC instead of your backpack. I mean, nobody even knew what it was and it was like, it was so fringe back then. But to go from that to, here we are in 2015 and a fucking guy who's running for president, Donald Trump is tweeting about the results of the fight in a catty way. And I'm like, I'm glad she's not a good person. He is. He running is basically a front runner. Right? Well I think Ben Carson is for the Republican Party bike guy doesn't have a chance. He's a sleeper. I can't even keep his eyes open when he's talking. It's unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          00:28:57       Well, I don't know who has a chair. I think they're both Jeb Bush is probably the more likely candidate. It's like wait for the dust to settle. But just the fact that a guy running for president is addressing mixed martial arts, which, you know, we, we've, we, you and I both talked about that when we first got involved in it, it was like talking about being involved in porn.

Speaker 3:          00:29:17       True. Yes. It's, it's crazy. And, and, uh, again, just last night was massive man last night. It was massive when you talk about it and all those, all the people that were tweeting about the fight before the fight, Rhonda brings in this crowd of people that don't normally watch you, I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          00:29:39       Yeah, sure. Definitely. Well, John Wayne Parr,

Speaker 6:          00:29:42       who is a 10 time world Moitai champion, he's a good buddy of mine. He was at the fight yesterday. He brought his daughter, his daughter's a huge Ronda Rousey fan and his daughter was so conflicted after that fight was over because she's a kickboxer herself. She loved kickboxing. So on one hand, while percent, yeah, she's 12, she's 12 she's, she fights, she fights, she fights, she's good. And last night, great kid

Speaker 5:          00:30:07       felt bad because I was actually sitting right next to her and she got bon on. Come on, Rhonda. Let's go Rhonda. And you know me, I want her to, I'm not going to lie. I wanted to see history get made. I like Ronda Rousey. I like villains. I liked the bad guys. I like an ego. I want her to see history get made. I was that close. And I also know that it's good for Rhonda and it's good for the UFC if Rhonda finally has some competition. And so I was cheering every time Holly Atlanta to punch. And when Holly landed that takedown, I launched out of my seat. I couldn't help myself and I felt sort of bad cause she got con Rhonda Come on Rhonda. But me, I selfishly just wanted to watch history get made and I couldn't believe it when it happened, but I think it was great for her.

Speaker 5:          00:30:48       This 12 year old girl who loves fighting to get the seed that you can do anything, you can accomplish anything with hard work. And we got to hang out with the guy that trained Holly before this. And he said that Greg Jackson. Yes. Greg said that she trained so hard every day that you know, she was almost in tears every day, training hard. And that makes me so happy because it just proves, it sounds like hacky and redundant, but hard work really pays off in the sweat and the tears. That's what it takes to get good at anything.

Speaker 6:          00:31:21       So zero and then such a good point. And one of the things Holly said that was cool at the press conference last night, she said, they said, one of the guys that, did you ever doubt that you could do this? She goes, yeah, I doubted. She goes, there were days at the gym when I had a bad day, and I just walk out and go in my car and cry for 1520 minutes, take an I can't do this. You know what I mean? I, I look terrible in there today. If this is the way I'm going to fight, I'm not going to win. She goes, then I'd go home, I'd eat and relax and I go back at six and work on everything that I wasn't good at two hours earlier until I got it right. You know, and that goes with exactly what you're saying is you can tell physically when she went to the art dot, she was shredded. She had a six pack and I've never seen her hand before. I mean she looked in incredible shape and she was also so poised, even though obviously she was under a tremendous amount of pressure and the enormity of the moment wasn't, it didn't escape her, but she was bouncing around and she would pace and bouts, pace and bouncing pace and bounce.

Speaker 5:          00:32:21       I was watching her during Ron doesn't entire insurance, which is, you know, sitting that close to something that you don't really get to see on TV. That I had my camera, my eyes focus directly on holiday, on holiday the entire time Rhonda was coming out and she was, she was doing five steps, bounce, go the other way, five

Speaker 6:          00:32:39       steps bounced when she was getting, uh, her mouthpiece put in when Rhonda was stepping in. The octagon. Holly was nothing but focus, 100% no distractions. It was amazing to see

Speaker 2:          00:32:54       was a different kind of a focus because it was a girl who's experienced that kind of intense pressers pressure situation before that world title pressure. Like when Batchko Hay was in Brazil and she was facing Rhonda, she had this look on her face before that fight, like she was about to go fight a werewolf with a butter knife. You know? She was just like, oh, I'll put on a brave face. She, she almost knew she was going to get fucked up. It was almost like the enormity of the moment was just like, Ooh, like you can't breathe. Like you ever take a shower, a cold shower, and you can't get, you can't breathe. You just, that's how it looked like. She was just overwhelmed. That wasn't the case with holiday. It wasn't the case at all. She was, she was. She knew it was intense pressure. She knew it was a big moment, but she was prepared

Speaker 6:          00:33:37       for it. She's back again. How great should we do it now?

Speaker 2:          00:33:45       Oh yeah. All right. We'll do this and we'll come back to this. What are we at here? We're at 33 minutes. All right. Listen, Ladies and gentlemen, I know you're like, oh, it's only three, three minutes. How could that be the whole podcast? We're gonna eat. We're going to have a little Vino. Got a little Sharise and we'll be back. Maybe I'll even grab Greg Jackson from the cheap seats. Bring him up here. See it a bit, and we're back around to ladies and gentlemen. I was just sitting there. I was watching Birdman. God Damn,

Speaker 6:          00:34:14       it's a good movie. I got to stop listening to Howard Stern. He was saying it was boring. The fucking movie's Great. It's really good. It's really good. It's really good. Howard was just jealous that somebody successful at the bigger news than, Oh, I get it. The bird. Is that what you're saying? Okay, here we go. Ah, we were just talking about whether or not people get pissed at the, the length of the podcast. Um, they don't, I mean, they do, but they don't, you know, it's like some people do, but that's the UFC, right? I mean, some people get pissed at everything. It's like that about it. We have wheat, wheat. I think we're unique in this era and if you're putting out content, if you putting out a, anything you do in that, there's too many people that have opinions. Everybody can talk to you. So it's hard to sample and get like an accurate assessment of what's going on.

Speaker 6:          00:35:05       It's hard for me to live in a world now where everybody gets to have an opinion. How many times have you guys had to deal with people? Say, oh he's fucking cords or water down. I'm tired of this fucking bullshit. How's this guy's still floating? What is, you have to, you know, especially in this, in this new world we're living, you have to be able to tune that shit out, man. If I listen to the shit that you know, the media or on or some of the Weirdos on social media said, this will be all fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       Do you still fuck with people on social media? Cause you used to go back and forth and get angry at people? I don't get angry when I'm on social media. If I'm on there and I'm talking to people, trust me. It's like I'm having fun. I'm not angry. I have time to kill me. And me and a guy called fat boy, you got into it today. It's fat to wait for the morning cause Nate, you call that boy. I said, stick to what it looks like you're good at eating. Um, let me let me analyst. But as one with him, uh, he was saying that now that women are fighting in the UFC, I must be really desperate. Like we're going out of business and I must be really desperate. What's funny is these people and on social media, he says, uh, he says to me, you know, he obviously ripping on the UFC.

Speaker 3:          00:36:30       So I hit him back and I say, where have you been living under a rock? You know, you don't know who Ronda Rousey is a, you didn't know there was a Rhonda Rousey, Holly Holm Fight. And uh, he says, yeah, apparently a lot of people live under a rock. Nobody, nobody watches the UFC anymore. Nobody would, you know, something like that. I said, listen, why don't you stick to what it looks like you're good at eating and then leave the fighting of the day. He comes back and says, I live in the same town. You seem real tough over Twitter. Why don't you come see that? Yes, exactly. Flutter on the size on, I'm easy to find fat boy. Come find me. You know, just like, but I have fun with it. I'm not serious and I'm not, you know, listen, if you say stupid shit and I got some time, I'll play. I'll go with you. I'll, I'll do it. It's fun for me. I'm actually actually called Joel recently and asked Joe what he thought of rose. Do you like rose and Joe also very opinionated. Head does not like rose at all and doesn't, uh, like the type of comedy, I guess. You know the type of people that would row somebody that the front, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:37:42       I like to watch it, but I don't like to do artistic, this is mine. My personality. Yeah. I'm, I have, I'm very extreme. Either I go to war with you or I'll go to war for you. Either I love you or hate you. I'm not, I'm not ambivalent. So like if I loved you, I don't want to mock you. Ride this motherfucker. This is the number one writer for roasts in the country. He didn't even know he writes. He, he's one of the, like the main writers for all the comedy Central Roast. If you hear like a good singer, I'm not a comedy central roast. It's absolutely brutal. Most likely Tony Hinchcliffe wrote it, but he's got that sense of humor. My sense of humor is not Mike that I, I feel bad if I make fun of somebody I care about and if I don't care about you, I don't want to be on a show with you.

Speaker 2:          00:38:28       You know, if there was something like roasting Tony, if I had a rose Tony on some think, what does this ma'am, no thank you. Your birthday. Don't mind. 90 gif coaches has their time. Oh yeah, I don't eat that. That's how I keep my girl is figure. I'm trying to honey, what does that lollies lollies. What is a lolly? That's not a lolly. What is that? It's a raspberry lonely a lot, but it's, these are like gum drops. Yeah. I'll let you put in Australia. Oh, you call them lollies? Oh, we call lollipops like it as a stick. Yeah. You said it was Molly tried to get sex cause Exposito birthday. Quantis look, you've got 16 hours. Don't be a pussy. No. What can I have a cup of coffee though, please? Just black. Um, where were we? Roast a ballbuster. Yeah, and Baltimore and guys, not bustle bells is good but, but if I wanted to go like he goes, like Tony goes deep. He writes so stealing shit like he does, he writes the best jokes for rose. He's just got this, he's got everybody's personalities. Like we were talking about this last night. Like he's like a guy, like he doesn't do this on stage, but we're joking around and he, he'll say puns like ridiculous play on word puns. My brain doesn't work like that.

Speaker 5:          00:39:50       And you know, there's different comedic muscles. There's like cons, there's roasting, there's staying in the pocket, doing long bits. Like when you do, you know, you'll talk about the same topic for 10 minutes. There's like different muscles, you know, like I don't move around a lot on stage, which it is something that I sort of wish I could do. I can't do impressions like you can either, you know, there's just different muscles and stuff. It's sorta like, you know, to use an analogy, it's sort of like UFC fighters. Like some people are good at some things and sometimes the audience once those certain things and uh, you got to know which muscle to use against your opponent. If your opponents, that audience, that venue, whether it's in Australia or Sweden or la, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:40:29       Yeah. Just when it comes to like the roasting thing, I enjoy watching it. Like I go to cause a thing called roast battle, but they do at the comedy store, it's fucking hilarious. They have to comics and they'll go back and forth. Like one person will tell a joke and the other person will tell a joke and it's fucking brutal. A rap battle for comedy. Exactly. That's great. Cool. These motherfuckers, they steal years from each of those lives. Like we've seen some who were like, oh my God, we have to sit back and hold your head and you just feel the pain to the other person. I can't do that where I can't do that. We're thinking about doing a roast on fight pass, you know, roasting different people. Yeah. Oh that's your guy. That's your guy. I mean I've been literally not with his second of hesitation if you said, yeah, I need one guy to roast people. I'd say Tony Hinchcliffe wait before you'd say rose, he ba 20 inch left before you even get the word people out. I would say so

Speaker 5:          00:41:26       Tony is a huge crossover in there because obviously you know, people, you know the UFC in the roasting is very close, closely related in the way that if you like watching people get slammed in real life, you know, you'll love to see them get verbally slam. It all started cause I'm from Youngstown, Ohio, a tough neighborhood and I sorta defending the little guy so I defended myself with my words. So it's all sort of in the same ballpark, you know? Yeah. I'd love to help you out with the UFC rose. That's easy. You,

Speaker 2:          00:41:53       he's your guy and Adam Hunter's good attention. Yeah, I knew Adam with, he's great with MMA to him because he knows so much about MMA. You know, he's very, very knowledgeable. Yup. No, I talked to Adam off. So you've got to do something on fight pass. We're talking about it with fighters. Tony's a perfect guy to, cause they won't, it will feel like they need to beat his ass. I Dunno. I Dunno how many fighters could actually be roasted. I think that a lot. Can I not do it? I can't tell you how many guys get mad at me. I point out like situations that they're not necessarily the best dad or, or skills that they may need to like look into. Like they get mad at me.

Speaker 5:          00:42:34       So it was just an idea. It might not even work, but I don't know how many, how many fighters would actually want to be roasted. I think a lot of them have a great sense of humor, I think. Yeah. I think you'd be pretty surprised. I think if they're from a different country, like resilience, probably wouldn't want to get made fun of that much. Just thrown it out there like did. I think it all depends on the culture, but a lot of, uh, a lot of Americans are into it. You know, like I know that Brendan Shop, he's like, it'd be great with things. So many of those guys that I met.

Speaker 2:          00:43:06       What you need to do before you, uh, have Cyborg, have our first fight in the UFC, have Tony Roaster, let's each still haunts me. Still wants to be a part of the big show.

Speaker 5:          00:43:20       Yeah, that'd be amazing. I don't even know where I'd begin. Where would I start properly? She's the only person that cuts the weight by chopping off her deck.

Speaker 2:          00:43:32       Yeah, there'd be a, there'd be a lot of different angles and you'd approach that. I think it would be tough for a fighter to do a, Roche was sold back to the Ronda Rousey Holly Holm thing. Obviously you can't talk to Rhonda right now because it's too, too soon. It's too intense emotions. She's probably just in agony right now, but, um, how long do you wait before you think about scheduling a rematch?

Speaker 3:          00:43:58       Yeah. Well normally when fighters come off, we'll fight like the Rhonda fight, the Lawlor I'm Mcdonald's fight. Uh, you know, you don't, you don't even talk to them about fighting for, uh, the last core me a fight with, uh, with uh, yeah, it just, you just wait and, uh, probably a month, about a month he call and say, Hey, what's going on? Really thinking how you feel and you know, yup. You have

Speaker 2:          00:44:29       lunch with her and you going to like talk car on

Speaker 6:          00:44:32       the phone or do you want to do an in person? Rhonda? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:44:35       Yeah. You know, after this thing, when Holly is going to be in a fucking whirlwind, when she gets back, she's going to be, you know, normally she'd probably just get home. We'd take some time off hanging out with a, she's going to be on radio tours, television. She's going to have a lot of work to do. Rhonda will be able to go home and just chill out, relax for a while, got her head together. He'll level a little bit. Um, and then, um, you know, I'll see her next week in person and then, uh, what I'm talking about fighting,

Speaker 6:          00:45:13       he won't talk about fighting next week. You don't think she'll want to talk about it immediately? No, no. If she does, that's cool. She wants to talk. We can talk, but I won't talk to her about it and give her a month. What will you talk about? We say Divia how about the weather?

Speaker 3:          00:45:28       Just hang out, have lunch with her and hang out with her and see how she's feeling. So yeah, she's doing, you know, um, yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:45:36       job is very weird, man, because your job is, you're not just a promoter and a lot of ways, like you have to be almost like a counselor or like a psychologist in a way.

Speaker 3:          00:45:46       Deal with so many different egos and personalities and quirky, you know, that without a doubt. Personal problems, business problems, you know, a lot of stuff. We deal with a lot of stuff with the fire.

Speaker 6:          00:46:04       Well, you do probably wouldn't go back to that. When we were talking about earlier that 2001 Vladimir, Matt, you Shango Tito Ortiz fight like that was when you guys were first started. Did you ever imagine that you would have this kind of role now? Like what did you see the role of a promoter being? Because you're not just a promoter, you're, you're a promoter and a very weird way cause you're a promoter, but you're also like the main personality behind the UFC. Like you mean like when I checked into the hotel yesterday called me Mr. White. I'm like we're both bald but I'm not Mr. White. Like you know what I'm saying? Like if they say, oh this fight looking guys coming in here, it must be Mr. White. I see shit on social media where it says you and I are turning into each other, which is fucking photo. That's true.

Speaker 3:          00:46:49       Yeah. You know what? When you think of the term promoter, most promoters are fucking now secretary to fax machine. Right? Seriously there, there's no infrastructure there. There's no, we're so different because not only do we have 500 fighters under contract at 300 and something employees to employees, um, you know, in a weird way, we're more like a media company yet we promote fights. It's, it's, it's, it's really morphed into this weird thing. But you know, a lot of this stuff, a lot of the things is in the, in these, in the growing pains of building this business, the relationships that you have have with, with, with a lot of these guys. You know, there's some guys on the undercard said, I've never even met before. And then there's people that I'm really, really close to. And, uh, and you were saying it earlier, you know, you, you learn to care about these people. Um, no people that are involved in their lives and you become clubs.

Speaker 2:          00:47:52       Yeah. And you see them lose. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:47:55       And you know, and then there's, there's so many times that, you know, two people go in and care about both of them and somebody is going to win or lose that night. You know, there are some fights that I don't even want to watch. You know, it's like shit, I don't even want to watch this fight. It's going to be one of these good people are going to have to lose.

Speaker 2:          00:48:15       Yeah. And there's no way around it. There's no way around. And then there's times when I'm like it out. It's the complete opposite to, I mean, let's be honest, where I don't have a great relationship with a guy, you know, you know, there's a parallel between you and me too. And that there really wasn't a you before you and there really wasn't that many people doing commentary before me. Like you don't, you don't like a a normal promoter in a sense that they think is by, I mean you have, dawn came, it was like only in America, but it's all, you know, it's mostly showmanship and bullshit and, and you just somehow another figured out how to just be Dana White. You know, you've, how do you do a member like some sort of a conscious decision to not put on some sort of fake professional attitude? Or is that just not in you at all? You know, you're, you're you, you're the Ui new. Like before you were famous. See at the same dude,

Speaker 3:          00:49:17       thanks man. What we, what we, I don't know man. I don't know really how to explain it, but I just go in there and we put on fights and we, you know, we've, we've tried to put it on the best fights that are available with, with the best talent that we have for, for instance, I believed that the Ronda Rousey, Holly Holm fight was the fight. But you get all these fucking conspiracy Weirdos that, that, that start talking about. All anybody wants to say is, oh, I want to see Dana White's face after Holly Holm beat her. And I want to see what he, two women are going in there. Rhonda and Holly are going in there. Somebody's going to win and somebody's going to lose. I mean, anybody that's stupid enough to fucking think that. I think, you know, somebody could win forever or somebody else couldn't win is ridiculous. Or that Rhonda hasn't fought the best competition available on his phone. All the best girls in the world. That 135 pounds.

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       We brought Holly Hollman. Yeah, it's just that made the wait time. The wait Cyborg has had opportunity for

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       this fight. All she has had to do was make the weight. She hasn't tried it would that much money on the line and all the things that are going on. Look at last night's event, Holly Holm stepped up and took the opportunity and won. She won the fucking fight. The opportunity was there for the opportunity has been there for Cyborg this whole time. Guaranteed. Oh, get out there and said all that crazy shit that they said and she die if she made weight and all that stuff that was going on. What was Ronda supposed to go to? One 45 or fight her to catch weight for what Ron does. The 135 pound champion. Like it or not, that's, that's her weight division and that's where she fights. There's plenty of women there. And I felt like going into this next fight, I saw the Misha Tate fight twice, saw that fight, none of that finance, you know, and, and yes, we did.

Speaker 3:          00:51:18       We did set that fight up as a contender fight, you know what I mean? But I felt like that wasn't the best fight. That wasn't the best fight. I felt we brought Holly Holm and to fight Ronda Rousey. And I felt like that was the best fight to put on. We're literally in a fucking meeting room. We sit in this board room all day and I'm like, we got to make this Holly Holm fight, man. This is the fight you're going to ask Lorenzo's. Exactly. Actually, the way it went down. This is the fucking girl. This is the next big challenge for Ronda. This girl is fucking tall. She's got the heightened read advantage. She fucking kicks. Uh, you know, she stays on the outside. Ron has never faced anybody like that. This is the fight that make it, not to mention the fact that she's undefeated and she's got legit boxing credentials. This is the fight. And we did it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:06       Yeah. I mean, we're right now, it's kind of funny because we're in a plane, we're flying over the ocean, and when we land, it's the buzz just as kind of started, I made it exploded, but it's almost like a tidal wave. And that tidal wave is just going to reach all across social media and all across television shows and radio shows. And you know, by the time we land, it's going to be Monday morning, all the morning radio shows are going to be talking about this. All the television shows are going to be talking about this. That's when the party really begins. And that's when the Holly Holm coming out party really begins. True. And you know, we're, we're right now, we're kind of like sitting here while the fuse is lit.

Speaker 3:          00:52:49       I've been doing this for 15 years, man. And let me tell you what, anybody can beat anybody on any given day. You know, even even reporters and fans and even you win this fight was first announced Kevin Alley. He's like, I'm not flying over there for a 15 second fight. I think we'll be over in 15 seconds. And you never, Freddie Roach

Speaker 2:          00:53:08       said in a lot of people said, well I didn't think that Holly was going to get destroyed, but I thought that Amanda Nunez was a more dangerous fight based on her performance against Sarah McMahon cause she smashed her man, knocked her down, beat her up and I know she had beaten up cats in Ghana and the first round, although she got stopped later in the route, I think cats, Donald stills

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       dangerous as fuck. She just made a big rookie mistake. She's charged, got caught in a scramble and you know Rhonda is so nasty at catching those arm bars and even in this fight she had been tagged with all those fucking straight lefts. She had been rocked and she's still, when they went to the ground she was a immediately threatening with an arm bar. She still has the best arm bar technique. And Emma.

Speaker 3:          00:53:49       There was one part for a second where she caught her on standby and grabbed it like a crocodile and just, I don't know what she was going to do with it, but she fucking added trying to take her down, had it. She got Holly just kept fighting. She got defensive and she just kind of rolling out of it.

Speaker 4:          00:54:09       I think this is a, this is a pivotal time for Rhonda because she's a huge superstar. She's a huge movie star. She's a huge celebrity. But what got her to that position as being a great fighter and there's a balance there somewhere and you've got to find out where's the balance, is the balance spending all this time working on movies and all this other shit and, or is the balance going back to fucking rocky for going to that cabin in the woods and going, running up the hills, the snow and you know, and focusing on just fighting. And that might be what she needs to do now. I mean if she or, or that's it, you know, or figure out what it is. I mean she's got enough money now and assume she probably, if she's frugal, it doesn't have to work again for the rest of her life. She does. She doesn't. Right? So she has to decide what she wants to do. Does she want to figure out what rent wrong, figure out what she could have done better. Get back to the drawing board, maybe work with some new coaches that are going to work with her on kicks and distancing and flip work or maybe figure out some other ways to try to get Holly down. Other than the collar tie and and clenching. I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:55:21       she's the mentally strongest fucking athlete I've ever met in my life when she gets over this, this loss she's going to, she's going to be a savage man. I mean she was, she was a maniac in a hard worker when she was the best in the world. What's she going to be like now that she lost? And the thing that makes this fight great again is Holly Holm. Now everybody knows how talented Holly Holm is and that Holly Holm is legit. And Holly Holm is a workhorse to both of these two are going to take the next few months, go back in and start working on shit, and they're going to clash again and there's second fight will be fucking awesome. Does Rhonda have a broken jaw because social media was reporting on? That's what, that's bullshit. There's nothing wrong with Rhonda, Rhonda. Well, there's definitely something wrong with it. Well, I mean, she's concussed.

Speaker 3:          00:56:09       She's heard. He had a huge fucking cotton in her lip. Her lip was split open and uh, I was, I was there and I was like, you know what? We don't want a doctor. Someone that fucking lip. What's lip going gonna look like at the, so we brought in like the best plastic surgeon and from Australia last night. He came in late last night. Soder lip over and her lip looks awesome today. They do. When they do that, did they do interior stitches? So they do it from the inside out and plastic surgeons are just so much better than dockers. I'll give you an example. In here. Something fucking crazy. So at the last fight, um, when we were at the core MBA fight, Courtenay Gustafsson sitting there and my phone starts fucking ringing during the fight and, uh, it's my sister in law, so I pick up the phone during the fight and my wife was on the phone going fucking crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:57:04       So we have, uh, uh, uh, English massive two year old English massive who jumped on my daughter and ripped her ear off her head in my house. How did he do it? Fucking just jumped at his paw in it. No teeth. Watts ripped her ear in half this way and then off the head. So it was hanging by the thing here, like by the bottom of the ear. So how old's your daughter? My daughter is nine. Oh my God. Yeah. Nine years old. Fucking dog rips her ear off during the core me Gustafsson fight. My wife is hysterical. Can't even understand a word she's saying. So I have to calm her down. What the fuck is going on? Tell me what's happening. And she tells me, I said, okay, I grab doc d. Uh, one of the doctors for the UFC, he gets on the phone and calls Las Vegas.

Speaker 3:          00:57:59       The first thing he did is trying to set up a doctor and I said, I don't want a doctor. I want a plastic surgeon. Get me a plastic surgeon. He calls them his plastic surgeon. They go to the hospital. Um, they had to wait like an hour and a half. So you can imagine the freaking out. They got to wait an hour and a half because they're waiting for the plastic. But the plastic surgeon came and put her ear back on and then fix the ear this way, sewed it back together. My daughters ear looks unbelievable because you can't have a doctor do that kind of shit because if you have a doctor do it, all he cares about is getting the fucking ear back on. Not How it looks, you know, but you cosmetically, it's like the doctor will come in and Stitch Rhonda Slip, but did Rhonda, his lip is going to look weird.

Speaker 3:          00:58:40       So when we do fights in Vegas, there's a, there's a doctor named Dr Shoe. I Dunno if you've ever met Dr Shoe. He's a tall Asian guy with glasses. He is the man when it comes to he's so he sews up these cuts because as you know, in fighting cuts are a big problem. They have to be sewn up the right way, not only cosmetically, but if you're going to continue to fight, you have to sell them up so that they don't rip open all the time and getting a lot of scar tissue under there and things like that. So we're very, very careful and stuff like that. But if anything traumatic ever happens to your kids or your wife, you're looking for a plastic surgeon, not a doctor. What the fuck did you do to that? Doug? Did you kill that dog is gone, Doug Bit. Your daughter's here. Dog's gone. Yeah. Ah, to kill that dog myself. I know. It's crazy. Fuck Great.

Speaker 2:          00:59:29       Massive too. But he's the sweetest dog in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:59:32       Doug would never do any of that on. My daughter had a buck, an ice cream cone and the dog when I was trying to get the ice cream cone and my daughter said no, and the dog just freaked out, man. At the end of the day, even though it's a dog, it's a fucking wild animal and went and they're just, they're fucking nuts with food and now when you have food there, you could feed your dog, feed your dog till he's full and then you're sitting there eating food and the dog is like looking, you know, he wants some more fun. Wow. Look at this. Hello fellas. We're doing a podcast right now.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       You guys circled Gerkin as hanging out with just one way. Good luck with that. This plane, his playing is so bad ass. Then it has two different levels. There's 500 people on this plane, 1100 bags and there's actually a lounge upstairs where people can hang out in the lounge. He had, it's like a little bar area. He's Quantas flights are fucking ridiculous. We're not great. This is the first podcasts, by the way. That's never been done in an actual pod. Yeah, we're in a pod and the pod that's it might be right. Yeah. Everybody else just does it in a room. I says, well, how did it become, it's from iPods, right? I guess that's the name, right? Yeah. Yeah. I had to get done branding in everywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:00:55       Chocolate Dell had that crazy cut in his lip after the rich Franklin fight and now you can't even, you can't even know that.

Speaker 3:          01:01:01       Yup. What's even crazier is Robbie Lawler. Oh yeah. We had Robbie Lawler's done with a plastic surgeon too, and actually the Jessica Penne a fight when she fought. You want to on Jay check. See her nose. We flew her straight to la and she went and saw the best plastic surgeon in La and we got her nose fixed, so everybody, next time you see Jessica Penne at, you'll notice that her nose looks phenomenal. You look at that Gash and what that looked like. If we sent her to a doctor, she looked horrible. Right now a doctor would have stitched or stapled that thing together and she would look terrible. They sent her to the best plastic surgeon in La and she looks phenomenal. That's amazing. By the way, I remember her nose after that fight. I've seen snow men with better noses.

Speaker 2:          01:01:46       You son of a bitch. You had one ready? He had one ready. Can you know Kevin Ross is a Muay Thai fighter from America. Great. Great fighter fights for a lion fight. He was uh, talking about how, why he got 'em. He got hit with some elbows and one of his fights in Vegas and the, uh, the doctor, you staples and the doctor was so shitty. He actually stapled like one of the things was in the crease of the actual cut instead of like pinching the cut together to staple, went in the hole. It was like this fucking guy was blind or drunk. Now we know. What

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       people don't realize is when you go to a doctor, a doctor is not worried about how you're going to look after. It's about healing. Whatever is ready. I gotta close this whole, I have to, I have to fix this thing. It's like an artist. He's not an artist. Exactly. So when you go to see these doctors and they give you stitches, you are going to have a nasty scar. In fact, I don't care who your doctor is. That's a fact. That's the way it goes. And they do that though. Can they fix that? And they score a Redo it with like a really good job of playbook for like a girl like Jessica panic. It would cost her a ton of money to go do it later and all this stuff. Fuck that. Let's just get it. They might not even work because like there's going to be all that scar tissue and healing from Yammer sutures and you have to cut that out.

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       Maybe. I don't know. What am I? I'm just making shit up that, listen, there's the eds, you know, there's a completely different, um, angle to this thing now when dealing with women, we have women who fight me. You can't have Jessica Penne a scar on her nose and stuff. Like I said, we get a lot of shit. We take care of a lot of people now with what, it really comes down to it. You know, we don't say, Hey, send Jessica Penne, I over to some doctor in stitcher. We sent her to the baddest plastic surgeon in La and he fixed her nose, sent Robbie Lawler to a guy who fixed his lip chocolate doubt and his LePen Rhonda and her lip, which is broken. We literally got the best plastic surgeon in Australia, not, not Melbourne. We've got the best guy in Australia. Um, you know, so we're, we're, we're pretty big on the medical side with the fighters.

Speaker 5:          01:03:51       Yeah. I mean it's, it's, it's gotta be like an incredibly difficult job to do, to like stitch up, uh, a cut like that and it makes sure that it heals. And a nice theme, clean line like that. You know, my friend John Wayne par, he was at the fights last night. He's 10 time World Moy, Thai champions and Australian guy. He's had more than 300 stitches in his face, in his face. That's crazy. With that. Um, no thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you. I saw this stuff. We want you to hear what it's like in first class people just to, just to give you a little taste. Knollies no chill clip. No, I got some child. Anything at all. I can get coffee. Yeah. Is there a blowjob? I'm saying they didn't offer you that. Oh yeah, it was, it was the guy though. The guy, his name's Joe and it was amazing by the way, but to bed too.

Speaker 5:          01:05:00       It's really incredible though. Like, like what you do. It's amazing. I grew up in and chose about to kill me. I grew up a huge pro wrestling fan and there's something about what Vince Mcmahon has been able to accomplish with the crazy circus that he's running and turn it into a huge company with tons of bands and watch every week, even though it's all fake and you've been able to fake or real life cause like always say, great. I've always admitted that on your show. What is it? You're the only one that keeps making it look, what does it to make? Still fake always has been bullshit. Right? Right. Just like your game of Thrones. Exactly. What's wrong. But it's amazing to me that you have been able to accomplish what that with reality, like everything he did, he wrote it out himself and wrote scripts and has, they have 2030 writers that he pays six figures a year, big time, more than six regular, like lower middle six figures a year.

Speaker 5:          01:06:02       They all get paid to write that stuff every week and you have been able to grow this thing. And I guess that's really like, it's mind blowing because you get those writers all day. You're never going to do what Conor McGregor can do. Just on instinct. I have to, I have this thing that reality is better than any script you could ever. Right. And, and, and that's the reason that you see, so it's so real and it's so like, like last night, man, you put on the fight with the best fighters in the world and reality is going to happen, man. And when you see it, it goes fucking global and electric like it did last night, man. Even triple h what? Aaa chip me up last night and said, wow. He goes, what? A show and want a shocker. That's what triple h me with last night. It's like, you know, w w when you do have that reality and it goes off like it went off last night, it's, it's bigger than anything you could ever write in.

Speaker 5:          01:06:58       What it does is it makes it so that you never know what's going to happen. Now people have to watch every fight because people can hate and people can say that they knew that home was going to win. That's the biggest bigger. It's bigger than this plane. The amount of bullshit that nobody knew that was going to go. Even the people who bet on Holly and had all this shit last night. There's one reason, one reason only, that they bet on holiday because of the odds. Odds were so big. Why not take a shot or they were her family or a family or friend? Hello. Would that be more comfortable? We're good. We're good. No, he's, he's a Ninja. He's an acrobat. You can flip. These are all my people here. No, no, we're good, but thank you though. Thank you. So nice hair. That was a polite, strong arm. She was trying to strong arm us up to the, uh, to the lounge and Joe shutters down. That was dated. Get Low. Yeah, she was definitely, that was her polite

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       way of saying you guys should go up. Don't match. People want to sleep now. Is that what, is sleep at like 10 in the morning or something? Fucking time. You have a, we're landing at six in the morning and write, but what time is it? What time is it in la? Well, it's only 3:00 PM in Australia. Okay. People want to go to sleep. That's their fucking problem also. That means it's the, but it's not. That will be the middle of the night in Vegas. In La is eight 28 20 La and 3:20 PM in Australia. I haven't been able to sleep since I got here. I'm so confused. I sleep like three hours a week. I've got five in the morning. I'll fall asleep and pill for you, pal, if you want to take it. Don't take sleeping pills, man. I don't take them. It's not only one you don't do as a sleeping pills.

Speaker 6:          01:09:04       I want to be able to wake up at all. Like I was in a hotel fire in San Francisco in the middle of the night. It was a, it was actually, it wasn't a fire. So people that set off the fire extinguishers and it filled the room up with that smoke, you know, that, that fog of those fire extinguishers green. And it was four 30 in the morning. These alarms went off. Plam Pam, Pam, Pam, I got up, didn't know what the fuck was going on. I'm trying to shut my alarm clock. Rob. We, no, no, I didn't. But all the people that were in the fucking hotel and sleeping pills and it was in San Francisco and he had this narrow staircase and it's really hard to get down the stairs. It's like really narrow. And uh, these people were walking like real slow down the stairs and half of them were fucking sleeping.

Speaker 6:          01:09:47       They're like waking up as it were walking. They were all whacked out on sleeping pills. Cause a lot of people when they stay in hotels or when they travel, they'll take a sleeping pill and it was dangerous. It was dangerous to the point where I was ready to start a fucking stampede. I was like, like, like why are you fuckers not running? Like there's a alarm going off and announcement saying the building's on fire and you people are strolling down the stair and half of them look like zombies. And um, um, I've had some friends that have done some shit when they on sleeping pills. Like Kevin James, Kevin James takes sleeping pills to like cook himself dinner and doesn't realize he cooked dinner and wake up in the morning like, what the fuck is this? And then someone has to tell him that he cooked it. Like I'm not down with that. I've seen some crazy. She had to asleep and us. Man, what's funny, I took one number. I told you on the way here, I took one when I saw it, a sleeping pill, I woke up, my throat was so fucking so, I dunno if I was snoring like a biester.

Speaker 6:          01:10:42       I don't know. I don't have that. You usually don't have a problem with sleeping. And I figure if I'm not awake or if not, I'm not sleeping. I'm awake, I'll do something and then they'll do something, tell him tired, then I'll sleep and when I get back to la, LP blacked out. But I just work out and I'll deal with it, you know? I don't know. I'm not into the drugs that I like that they're like, uh, you know, they don't, they don't incapacitate you like that. I'm not into like, I'm not in the sedatives. Right. Got It.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       I'm just sleeping pills either. But if I need to fall asleep on this flight, I might go a couple rows back and have Holly Holm kicked me in. The neck is hard to judge. She's not even on the flight. She's probably still back in Australia. Right? I think, well she was trying to leave today. She was supposed to stay a couple more days and then she changed her mind and want to leave today. So I don't know if she got out or not. Do you schedule fighters to leave a couple of days after? So they can recover. Yeah. You give the, the fighters on the car to a couple of days that you still, you'll see fighters getting on all banged up. And I was just always think after you've had a fight, you should, you should recite a couple of days without a doubt, without some people want to get right home. Can't tell them what to do. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:11:58       Just imagine that like after a brutal fight, a year ahead would be so fucking swollen. Everything you wouldn't want to get on a plane like it is. It sucks. And being on a plane when you're,

Speaker 3:          01:12:08       he knows his stuff. It's true. People don't really understand or appreciate how fucking tough these human beings really are, that compete. The FCA man, these guys are so tough and girls, it's, it's, it's, it's pretty fucking spectacular how tough these people are.

Speaker 2:          01:12:23       When you were talking about the Robbie Lawler and Rory Macdonald fight, and after that fight, Robbie Rory rather, uh, tweeted a photo of his face like the next day and his eyes were close shot and his nose was fucked up. And what's crazy about, and he said that it was the greatest night of his life. You know, like that's how you know, you're supposed to be a fighter.

Speaker 3:          01:12:45       That's it. Are there, they're special people. They're different than all of us, man. We, uh, that's why I, when I think about fighting, these people are so special that very few people can actually do it. You know, how many people can actually become a top three fighter in the fucking world and how many people can become a champion and then hold the belt for any amount of time? Very few people. It's, they're very special. And I think that's why as human beings, we're sewing on a professional fighters. You know, I always say that, that it out findings in our fucking DNA and we, and we just, we, we look at fighters and we're like, Holy Shit, that fucking guy is the toughest dude in the world. Or that girl is the toughest girl in the world and why we put them on such a big pedestal that they deserve to be. But at the same time, the craziest loneliest fucking, you know, Ronda Rousey loses one fight and everybody turns on her. So she had the Anderson Silva loses one flight. He was never that fucking good. Anyway, the 85 pound division isn't weak. It's just, it's the craziest fucking, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:13:51       You know what that is is, is people, the people that are mean and nasty and insulting after fights are the weakest aspects of humanity. They're the people that are scared and terrified and they know they could never do that. So when someone does do that and falters they just,

Speaker 4:          01:14:15       because that's their own demons, their own insecurity there all the knowledge that they could never do that in a million years. So when someone does it and fails, all of their insecurities just come flying out of their stupid fucking mouth or their fingers. That's what it is. When when I went on Instagram last night and Twitter and I was reading all that means shit that people were typing about Rhonda, I knew what the fuck that is. That's the weakest aspects of humanity. If we could pluck those people out of our culture, the world will be a way better place. And if the people listening to this, if you're one of those people you need to fucking go for a walk, recognize who you are because that's why you did that. That woman put at both of those women, put everything that they are on the line and for you to insult them after they came up short. The reason why you're doing that because you're a con, you're a con of epic proportions and there's no way around that. There's no, no. It might go up. You might actually know something. No, you don't know shit. No, you're a con because if you do no shit, you would just look at it and you would recognize the sacrifice and the, the, the drama of it all and the danger of it all and you would have respect for them.

Speaker 3:          01:15:25       That's true. So, so well said and these special individuals who want this fucking earth and go out and fight in front of millions of people and lay it all on the line. You know, and I've seen guys walk in with the fucking belt and an entourage go home and a fucking ambulance and by themselves since raise them. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:15:45       That's when they find out who's really their friend. But it all goes down. I mean, how many fighters have developed these gigantic entourage? It's like, remember Mike Tyson in his prime was buying everybody. Look at Floyd Mayweather. Floyd Mayweather is hanging around with a, he's got a God damn army with them. It's mainly parky out knocked him dad. You know, it's one of those guys knocked him dead. All those dudes would disappear. Everybody would disappear if he went broke. Everybody would this. As soon as he retires, he has retired for what? I don't believe it. I think he'll be back. I'll be back for at least one more fight. Especially Manny Pacquiao started talking about coming back. Why wouldn't he come back and make another hundred million dollars? Right? But I think that this, the cling ons and the hangers on and the yes people, there's some of the most dangerous people for a fighter's ego because what a fighter wants, they want affirmation.

Speaker 4:          01:16:41       They don't want to like a reinforcement of the love that they're missing, which kind of leads them to fighting in the first place. And they surround themselves with all these people that are boosting their ego up. Those people are fucking dangerous for you though. So I like, have you seen, have you seen what Teddy Atlas is doing? Teddy houses training Timothy Bradley now. So amazing. He's, he Bradley's last fight. You know, we talked about, I can see it, but you said it was awesome. Phenomenal. Bradley looked fantastic, but one of the best parts about it, as Teddy Atlas said, no entourage, no cell phones, no nothing. He doesn't want music plan. No one's in there. It's just him and him. They look at each other, they go over technique, they focus on the game plan. They focus on what the work there has to be done. And that's it.

Speaker 4:          01:17:25       You know, Floyd Mayweather has got a goddamn circus and he's counted and he could pull it off with that surface. Right? But the moment he can, and those guys have to go out and get real jobs. It's a moment he finds out that they weren't really his friends. They were paid friends, they were employed friends, friends that were there to try to boost his ego up. And there are only, they're only occupation. It's like they're, they're professional friends. They're there to be Floyd Mayweather, his friends. Yup. Floyd is Floyd's good at the surface though, you know, and all it, the best Floyd had the circus, you know, people weren't as interested. He, he really took it to another level when, when, when he was pretty boy Floyd, nobody can, nobody can became money. Mayweather. Everybody cared. He's a wizard. I mean, look, that's the same thing with Rhonda.

Speaker 4:          01:18:10       You know, Lady Gaga doesn't fucking get it. Like all these people don't get it. Like half of what Rhonda does is psychological, but half of it's marketing. All that stuff is marketing. You know, you talk all that crazy shit. That's where you get all the money. The money comes from what Conor Mcgregor's doing, you know, Bill with, oh, I don't like what Conor Mcgregor's doing. Mixed martial arts is supposed to be about respect, but you got maybe 10 years if you're lucky. But realistically the great fighters, you'll get the great fighters, they have like an eight year period that they can operate at this incredibly high rpm and then your body starts giving out. You can't take any shots anymore. Your fucking knees or bad, your back goes bad, you're next all fucked up at a certain point in time, it fails you. You have two things you're trying to accomplish during that time. You're trying to win. We're trying to make as much money as they can. And the best way to make as much money is get people to pay attention. And the best way to get people to pay attention as to talk out gang. I Shit,

Speaker 5:          01:19:06       I'm going to tell you right now. So I was laying in bed last night after the fight, you know, and, and, and Melbourne, the fight was over around five something. We were all back at our hotels by nine. Um, the notorious was on, have you seen that is a fucking ratio man. They literally ran five episodes of it last night. I laid in bed and watch five fucking episodes back to back. I'm like, Jesus Christ, this is really fucking good. It's a good show. I mean it's, it's unbelievable. They just follow this kid around and it is compelling. Great television. He's a wizard and it's amazing because it does this thing where either you fall in love with them, right? And this goes for Mcgregor Mayweather and Rousey at the fall in love with them and you want to watch them retain their chief in ship or you start to hate them and you want to watch them lose. Either way you're watching and it's beautiful. And again, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:20:02       pro wrestling

Speaker 5:          01:20:06       smeared as it is, the fact that it's not real and this and that, you know, that's definitely something that, you know, they built their entire Moi.

Speaker 3:          01:20:14       Yeah. Pro Wrestling fans are going to go crazy. That hear you say that. I, I you hear what I call the fake that time I had every crazy lunatic pro wrestling fan on my fucking Twitter for like

Speaker 2:          01:20:25       three weeks, man. Well, Tony, I did a podcast and a, there's like, well, there's only a few times while I've gotten, like, there's two times when I got like more hate than anything I've ever done. One of them was a, when I said that Fallon Fox, that man that became a woman shouldn't be fighting women. I got all the fucking progressive's and social justice warriors coming after me being a trans folk. And the other time was when I said that pro wrestling was retarded because Tony and I did a podcast and I just mocked him for about an hour. I got all fucking tsunami of misspelled tweets my way. Just, Ooh. I was like, I was drowning in misspelled tweets and I was like, I just wanted to correct their drug. The grammar, that's not your, it's y o U Apostrophe, r, e Fox. And I was like, I got the same thing people were called.

Speaker 3:          01:21:16       Then there's these guys that used to wrestle and guys that have podcasts and all these things that were on there. And then, and then the stone cold, Steve Austin came to my rescue. So listen, I don't think that he was saying he said fake, but you know, they don't know the work and that that's that. And he didn't mean any disrespect. You know, stone called had to come and save me from all the fucking [inaudible]. That's what happens.

Speaker 2:          01:21:38       Fully did that for me.

Speaker 5:          01:21:39       Yeah. Mick Foley for the man, everybody knows that it's fake. Where they get super defensive and crazy is if you say that they're not like real athletes because they do like every night. You know what I mean? They do a different marina every night and on Mondays it's filmed and then they do pay per views on Sundays. That's it. The only thing that really Ruckus is up the fans. If you say that like those guys aren't real app.

Speaker 2:          01:22:03       Well they, it is a tough job. Those guys put in some fucking serious numbers. I mean, how many days a year they go on the road? Like that was one of the reasons why Brock Lesnar decided that fighting in the fucking UFC at the highest level of the game, which one, one previous MMA fight was easier than doing pro wrestling. That goes to show you how hard that, that entertainment business has.

Speaker 3:          01:22:26       It's true, man, that they're on the road like 330 days a year and a 230 days in here and wait, no, three 30, I think it's three 30. It's a big number. It's a lot. Most of the entire year. And they're always in pain. It's why a lot of them have pain, pill problems. Every one of the people over at the WWE or fans of UFC. And anytime I've ever had any type of interaction with the WWE, you know, uh, star, they're always really good people. Really good people. Really Nice, totally respectful, just like the best people to deal with. So I have nothing against wrestling at all. Do you think cm

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       punk is ever going to actually fight? I do. Yeah. So what happened was he got hurt. He hurt his shoulder and he was fucking devastated. He thought he was going to have to have surgery and he did. And he actually, he lucked out and got out with therapy. And uh, so he's went through his therapy and he's, he's coming back now. Tell them to go to doctor d to take them to that guy in Vegas and get the stem cells. Oh my God. Maybe I will tell him that you should get stem cells in every part of your body. Just do it. Trust me. The greatest thing I've ever done, I'm going back in December. I'm just want to start shooting shit up. Shoot my elbows up, tuck it. Duane Ludwig told me did that Dwayne has hips done and shoulders done. Didn't even need anything wrong.

Speaker 6:          01:23:46       Just just decided to just get stem cells shot in there to heal things. It's incredible. This is total next level shit. You were saying that that guy in Germany, what's his name? Peter a Dr. Beard. Rolling. Tell me, what was he saying about the college and thing? Yeah, so they're, they're working on this thing over there were, you know how testosterone replacement therapy works. You know, as we get older, our testosterone levels drop and then they can, you know, give you an injection and put this, this testosterone back into your body, make it feel younger, sex, life, all these other things. Well. Now what these guys are working on is these collagen shots. So they give you these injections of Collagen and it replaces the college in your body. Collagen is what keeps your skin young and as we all get older, it goes away and they did this thing, I guess that they've been testing on this 10 year old rat and the rat looks like a fucking rat.

Speaker 6:          01:24:40       Looks like a baby rat now. So they're, they're literally right now, I guess this shit's ready to go. They're just building up the infrastructure over there because when they, when this thing comes out and when they announced this is going to be $1 trillion business, it's going to be ridiculous. That was it. They're injecting collagen or the injecting something that makes you regenerate college. Again, don't take the fucking, you know, I can't give you the, you know, the scientific explanation of it, but they basically came up with this thing where you get these injections and it makes you younger. Again, it's almost like replacing the Collagen in your body and your wrinkles go away. They go away and your face looks like your face. Look when you were younger. So ladies out there that are banging your face, it's all up with all this crazy shit that they're doing.

Speaker 6:          01:25:27       A plastic surgeon and all this stuff. I'd lay off and wait for this stuff to come out. We're, we're fucking year away from this APP and hang in there gals. Just hang in there. You know, it's interesting, we were talking about testosterone replacement. That's been one of the biggest controversies in MMA over the last few years was that for a while the Nevada state athletic commission was allowing testosterone use exemption. So if you guys got it and you know, Vituro may be unfairly takes the brunt of the criticism for that because his results on testosterone, we're so fucking spectacular when you get an old guy like [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       who has all that experience and all that knowledge and you give him testosterone and his body performs like a young guys, Bonnie. But with all that knowledge and all that experience, you get what happened in the Henderson fight, the Bisping fight and the Rockhold fight. We just looked fucking sensational. But now, you know, now they pulled out, they pulled the testosterone use exemptions back and these guys are trying to force to try to compete and like Mark Hunt, perfect example, the first fight with bigfoot Silva, uh, and Mark Hunt was this crazy fucking five round war and after the fight, big foot test, positive or not positive because we knew he was on TestTalks.

Speaker 3:          01:26:44       Steve was allowed to take it. He actually, out of all the fucking people, he's a guy that actually medically has to take it and not because of his age, because he has some type of pituitary pituitary gland. It causes gigantism look, stops his body's production of a lot of hormones and interrupts a lot of hormones. So he's the guy who actually really has to take it or bad things can happen to him. And uh, the problem was he took the shot the week of the fight or two days before, you're not supposed to do that. You are not supposed to do that. And the sad part is, you know, some of these doctors say it wouldn't even help them at the time that he took it to have that much in them. It wouldn't even, we say that they say that, but I don't think they know because he, oh, that's the problem.

Speaker 3:          01:27:28       The problem became that if you talk to fucking six guys, they give you a six different answers. And that's what started to happen with this shit. Nobody was really an expert on it. Nobody really knew what it would do or wouldn't do. Then if you had two different, if the commission had a doctor yet, he was talking to his own doctor, they would disagree on what the, you know what I mean? So, and not to mention the fact that if you have something good, when testosterone first came out and said, well this is going to be good. You know, guys can replace it and guys careers and this, that and everything else. But, but the other problem is is if you have these guys who are like, well, if this much is good for me, how much is this going to do? Right? So they're cheating on it. So they're, they're basically doing their hope camp using so much that they might as well beyond steroids. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:28:14       Well they are on steroids. They're, they're taking hyper human levels. And that was what, what had happened with Mark Hunt. But look, the proof is in the pudding because if you watch that Mark Hunt fight, Mark Hunt hit big foot with everything, but the fucking kitchen sink and big fudges ate it. He ate it. This all, and Mark Hunt's one of the biggest knockout artists in this sport and those two went to war for five rounds in the rematch. Big Foot's awesome off the testosterone replacement. Mark Hunt hits him with one clean right hand and drop it.

Speaker 3:          01:28:44       And Alex is big food is having trouble taking his shirt off. I know it sounds crazy, but like it was like stumbling, taking, it did look like he might have been having problems with his shoulder or something. Right. And Navy, Yeah. Also just seemed a little bit of a slow to come up the stairs and it's like those aren't cutting weight, right? No. Well maybe a little bit. Yeah. Baltimore to 65 I think they both weighed in at 65 and how they did cut weight, but Hans said he didn't have to cut weight for this cause he dropped a lot of weight training. He looked a lot leaner. You look really good and you trade with Mike Sweat over nick k by the way. I couldn't be happier for him. Yeah, I mean to dude. Good to see him succeed. Good stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:29:24       The big filling on the scalp person, he was slow, slow in a few different ways and then Mark Hunt was introduced and he came out with this stuff already off. Like I said this before on one of your podcasts, but I feel like you can learn a lot about them during the way.

Speaker 3:          01:29:40       Yeah. So to tell them, look into where everything relevant. Yeah, it's everything. You really do see everything at the way end.

Speaker 5:          01:29:47       See, please. Psychological, and I mentioned this, I don't think I mentioned this in this podcast, but maybe yesterday. I said, if you look at the way in between Rosie and home, exactly what Rhonda did at the way in is what she did in the fight or the second she got off that scale. She ran over to home. He was standing her ground in her place and rushed her. I mean she really bum rushed or I think harder than Rhonda has ever win for anybody. Even her last fight when the lady said about her dad's suicide, you know, don't kill yourself or whatever. She seemed more mad and Holly Holm for what? For drinking or drink and moving her hand towards her a little bit like she bum rushed her during the way and she did exactly that way and exactly what she did in the octagon.

Speaker 3:          01:30:33       Didn't you say that the way in change the betting line? Yeah, I did got changed. The mind moved after the after the way and moved and Holly's favorite. Oh see yeah. There's a lot of times the wins tell you everything that's, that's my second favorite day. It's the day that you get to see who's on wait, how do they stare down? Does it either Guy Flinch? Does either one of them budge? Does somebody have trying to get the mental edge? It just, it's, it's, it's the fucking greatest day of the week except for Saturday

Speaker 5:          01:31:06       to break it down even more. I've watched the last four weigh ins of Johana NJ check and this was the first time that Valerie Laterno was the first person that also put her head down and matched up with the Ohio Mason. No, Valerie did that at the on sale too. Yeah. And it's basically saying, let's fuck fucking,

Speaker 3:          01:31:27       I'm telling you dude, your dad on fucking right on it when we were in, uh, whatever. I fucking luck when they squared off a lot of, lot of the time, my job is to make sure they don't touch each other because when they touch each other then people start feeling disrespected and whatever value return on laid her fucking head right on top of Joanna's at the item on sale. When we came out of here for the onsite and they switched their fucking nose to nose and I have to kind of gauge what's

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       going on there. So that shit doesn't happen. And I felt that, that, that they were both and I was like, God damn, this is bad ass. I just let it happen because they both just did it, you know, but you gotta be careful cause you'd let guys do that and you'd get the core me Joan situation. You know what I mean? It's real tricky, but you're dead on with what you're saying. And even that was the day I said, well the turnover is here to fucking white man. And not only that, but definitely a little bit more icing on that cake when Johana and Laterno we're heading the forehead. Johana was talking and you asked her what she said, but if you watched that again, the allergies talking to and they're just talking over each other, both saying stuff. She wasn't listening to you. I know in your mind I wasn't listening to her.

Speaker 2:          01:32:38       Craziest. Well you don't want to said, I told her yesterday is your lucky day today and tomorrow on my lucky days have some fucking creepy fairytale hobbit type shit.

Speaker 5:          01:32:51       Can we just the same way asked for them and they're too slow for me. She's a dean. I gave her cooking

Speaker 2:          01:33:01       theme and she's awesome. And I think that like having these two champions in the women's divisions and both of them now or just he's skilled killers, you know both of them. I mean look, Ronda was a skilled Keller Holly Holmes or skilled Keller. John is a skilled killer. These are, there's a, there's so skillful. It's like though the highest level of MMA in the women's division is, is like comparable to the highest level of men's mmn. We absolutely, I put you on a striking up with anybody on the fucking planet that fights in MMA six times. World Muay Thai champion, clean, striking. I mean she's obviously 115 pounds so she's not dropping people dead like rumble Johnson is, but she is fucking nasty.

Speaker 5:          01:33:46       The first time I saw her I said she's my favorite fighter and I make jokes about one in the area and this and that. Truth is, I have a girlfriend who hates all this Johana Mumbo jumbo when she reads it on my Twitter. And a searching what people are saying about me, who's this Johana Nj check? Would you really hook up at their this and that. The truth is, you know, I make the jokes about Johana cause I say I need a woman that will keep me in line. She's really just my favorite fighter. I love UFC. I've been watching it since Gracie was in the, there's something about, he'll honas straight clear name back that she draws Joanna. Yolanda, Yolanda. I want to not Hannah. Okay. Yolanda. Yolanda. I mean just calling Joanna, she's my favorite fight or the way that she strikes and it's just fun to watch it. There was a guy that through four or five punches at a time, all for the center of your nose. That guy would be my favorite fighter. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:34:37       And then you look at Holly Holm obviously, which would Holly did last night was perfect. I mean, she fought the perfect fight. She didn't, I mean there was nothing amateurish about it. Nothing clumsier slopping that was as skillful as you could ever hope for in a professional mixed martial arts fight. And the way she took advantage of Rhonda at end of that, the

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       exchange in the second round when you, when when Rhonda was tired and she slipped and she caught her with that punch and then head kicked her. I mean that's, it's perfect. It's perfect technique. Everything was perfect. So we have now in women's MMA, we have the two representatives now in the UFC there as skillful as anybody in MMA. It's true.

Speaker 5:          01:35:18       And then when you think about shaking out the rest of that hundred 35 pound division, you know, you, you, you, you pair up any way you want. Amanda, Misha, Julianna Pena,

Speaker 4:          01:35:32       just opinion. It's nice to have her back to those four, those four women, you know, in any mix and match that any way you want. Well, you know, the perception was that Rhonda was at the top of the heap and everybody else was just under skilled. But man, that, that perception's been blown wide open by Holly Holm now. Now the whole game changes. It just opens it, right? It's like the same thing that happened with buster Douglas knocked out Tyson and then a Vander Holyfield came along and knocked out buster Douglas. I mean, the whole thing just more, it just throws the paradigm into a fucking turmoil. It's true. And you know, the thing about having someone like a Rhonda Rousey or like a Yawner is that greatness beckons greatness when you have one person at the top that is just fantastic and spectacular and has these incredible results.

Speaker 4:          01:36:21       All these people that are coming up, they have this insanely high level to aspire to. And that's what makes mixed martial arts so great in 2015 it's not a coincidence that if you go back to 1993 and you look at the level of the fighters and then you look at it in 2015 there's just a head and shoulders above everybody. It's insight. It's barely the same sport. And the reason being is that slowly but surely everybody aspired to the people who are at the top. And the people coming up got better and better and better and better. And that's how we have the level that we have today. And you're seeing that neared now in the women's divisions, and that's one of the most exciting things about this room.

Speaker 5:          01:36:59       And it's that way, not only for the UFC, but from life. You know what I mean? Like sometimes I forget that until, you know, I'll go once in a while, a month or two without working with you or you know, but like the, there's only a few people left that I watch. I do stand up comedy every night. I work really hard for the last nine years, basically training every night to get as good as I can yet. But when I see you, Joey Diaz, Bill Burr, which are the only three people left that I'll even watch it, it's a straight shot of adrenaline inspiration. All of a sudden I'm riding harder the next day I'm sleeping. Right. Doing more things. The people, you know, it's important to use inspiration to your advantage for everything you know?

Speaker 4:          01:37:42       Well, human beings, all, we all need other people to inspire us. We all do. It's one of the most in one of the most important aspects of MMA is competition and the competition in between. So I, these are not people that evolve in a vacuum. They evolve looking at each other, mirroring each other, and also now one of the things that we've said many times is that martial arts is evolved more since 1993 when the UFC was founded than they have in the past 10,000 years. That's 100% true, but really one of the reasons why it's true is because you can see the techniques. You can actually watch them. I remember when I was a kid in 1986 I went to watch the World Cup in Colorado Springs in taekwondo and I flew out there and it was a giant turning point in my taekwondo career because I was, I was, I was really good.

Speaker 4:          01:38:30       I was winning like like good level tournaments and I was doing well, but in [inaudible] 86 when I went to watch the best guys on the planet, I came back 2030 40% better. I was just way better. I saw the top of the mountain. And I think when, when you get people that are sitting in the crowd, you know, you get these young contenders are sitting there and they watch someone like Holly Holm Dismantle Ronda Rousey did watch someone like Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva, they watch Josie Aldo or Tj Dillashaw, they Washington's fighters and they go back to that gym and they're a different fucking person. Jay Go back to that gym when they have the memory of that spectacular performance in their head and it just makes them rise up. And I think also to people that don't have anything to do with fighting, don't watch that Holly Holm fight and they'll wake up in the morning and they'll go to their fucking yoga class inspired, you know the, the, we'll take spin classes, they'll go run up hills there. They'll show up at work, fucking fired up, ready to kick some ass and get some shit done.

Speaker 5:          01:39:32       Yeah. And it's so true. Champions should take something from this cause. What's one thing in my opinion that Anderson Silva has lost a Weidman, the first one and this loss. Ronda Rousey, Holly Holm have in common, and I see you go Silva was showboating when he caught that punch, maybe he would have lost anyway, but he was showboating he caught it and it was over and I'm sorry, but Rhonda was fighting with pure ego yesterday. Her head, her chin was out or hands were low. She was just bum rushing. It seemed like she just thought she was gonna out cushion.

Speaker 4:          01:40:06       I think it was more desperation in ego, but it's, I think you're right in some ways, but I think really instead of ego, I think pressure is a better thing to concentrate on the good. I think both with Rhonda and with Anderson, many Anderson had the pressure of everybody saying he was the pound for pound, greatest fighter of all time and he had all these murderers coming up through the ranks. Like why men, Yoel Romero, all these Jocko Ray, all these guys waiting in line to get a shot at him. And the pressure of that is just overwhelming. But unlike Anderson, or unlike Rhonda Rather Anderson didn't have all these movie offers. He's not constantly doing television shows and, and I mean he had some media obligations, especially particularly in Brazil where you idolize. But Ron, Ron is on a totally different

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       level. Enough credit for is the guy was fucking 37, 38 years old. You know what I mean? Yeah. People forgot and he was so good and so talented to still be doing what he was doing at the level he was doing it at 37 years old is unbelievable. Are you guys going to do vetoer versus Anderson? I don't know. That's the fight we're, I don't, I don't, I don't disagree. I love the fight. God Vittoria into that. Uh, I think Victoria is. Yes. When does Anderson suspension go up?

Speaker 5:          01:41:25       Um, might be the first of the year. Oh, that's our fight. That's the fight. Do you think they'll ever be a time when marijuana is allowed in, in the UFC? Well, marijuana, these guys can do whatever they want to do. You can't do it the week of the fight.

Speaker 6:          01:41:51       Please not even legit. Novitsky said, it's like literally the day before the fight now it's like you just can't fight, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever it is that it's going to be out of your system needs to be out of your system by the fight. You can do whatever you want. There's, there's so many misconceptions about how this thing goes down. Oh Jon Jones can do cocaine, but he, John Jones tested positive or lead paint out of competition. Right out of competition. Nick Diaz tested positive for three times in competition wells. The difference, the problem with the last time though was those two water tests that had him below the threshold, which are much more comprehensive test or blood test and the one quest labs test, which was a urine test, had them above it. So it's controversial what happened in the last fight. Very, that's why he's going to do well in that deal.

Speaker 6:          01:42:45       Well that just that they're so out of control that they would fucking banned him for five years when they do that. I mean, it's one thing to find a guy or to figure out some sort of a compromise, community, service, whatever the fuck you got to do. But you're taking away the guy's career five years when you're 20 is a long time. Five years when you're 32 is a death sentence. No, I agree. I agree. Well, they lost their lawsuit against Vandelay so Vandelay his suspension has been lifted, right? I mean, or if it hasn't been lifted, their lifetime ban of him has been, it's been thrown out by a judge. Yes. I don't know. I'm, I'm, uh, I do know that. I know he definitely, I mean, I dunno whether or not the Nevada state athletic commission is going to appeal it, but I know that they did throw out his lifetime ban.

Speaker 6:          01:43:35       They haven't seen, they haven't licensed him. I mean, it's not like he can go back to work right now, but if they just banned him or gave him a suspension, that was the same amount of time that you would have gotten if you tested positive for steroids. Especially Vandelay had never tested positive before. You know, and look vandelays nope. You know, he's no saint. Who knows what the fuck he had done? Lee's in pride, but the point is when they were testing him, he followed the guidelines, at least in his term as far as when they tested them and they banned him for life one time he runs away from a drug test. They ban it for life. That's fucking crazy. That's crazy, right? I mean, I think someone needs to pull those guys aside and go, look, it's what you do is very important.

Speaker 6:          01:44:21       It's very important to have you there. It's very important to have a voice of authority. It's a very important, important to have penalties for people who violate the rules and cheat, but it's also very important to have some common decency and some compassion. You can't take a legend like Vandelay Silva, a fucking mixed martial arts legend and banned him for life. I that's, I find that disgusting and, and it's, it's bad for them because it makes them look bad. I don't disagree with you. It's not good for PR. It's not good for how everybody, I know they were mad at me because a, I tweeted the phone number for the Nevada state athletic commission after they been Nick Diaz for five years and am like, let everybody know like let them know what you think about it, but you have to understand what I did to you was nothing in compared to what you did to Nick Diaz. Nothing. Not David. Yeah, I tweeted it. I was going to eat it every day for like a year, but I changed my mind. I was like, I'm not helping anybody. No, just change her number or whatever. But the point being is that they didn't take any consideration that to WIDA tests, which is fucked up and they abandoned for five years and find them $160,000. That's just crazy. Yeah. It's too much money. Chavez jr they find them 1 million bucks, man. What's it 1,000,900 and something thousand for pot? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:45:45       Oh my goodness. Let's see. Maybe, maybe there should just be some matches where the fighter and their opponent and have to smoke pot and all of a sudden they're doing crafts and stuff. I know.

Speaker 6:          01:45:57       Crazy weed smoking dudes, man, love your weed, but don't smoke it two days before the fight. Don't smoke it one day. Keep it simple. Let's, well, let's, let's play it safe. Let's go two days before the fight. Hold the word on Nick Diaz. Was that the goal me fight that he tested so high that he had to be high when he was fighting me? Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. It's amazing.

Speaker 5:          01:46:21       It's one of those things where like if you're in college, you study for a test high that you should take the test time and you know, really? Yeah. I've never heard that. Oh yeah. It's one of those like things, I mean I cannot confirm before you guys start tweeting at me that I don't know my science, you know, I'm just saying I've heard this before and that it's sort of makes sense to me. So I mean, I don't know. Maybe if nick trains, I mean I know sometimes I go on stage. Hi. Yeah. And while I know what I do do is I work out a lot of my material when I'm doing a, like a late night spot at the comedy store, I purposefully get high, you know, it's like working out with ankle weights on and then you do that stuff. So Bert, you'll fucking slay a theater. Oh my God, your timing and beats are just impeccable because I don't know, maybe like, I don't know, maybe he trains high so he feels like he has to fight.

Speaker 2:          01:47:15       There's been arguments like that when it comes to testosterone replacement and even though some performance enhancers that if the two fighters had made an agreement that they would both allow the other person to do, you know, whatever amount of whatever that that should be ethical on the lounge and then instead of saying, you know all you're cheating, it was just like saying, you allow someone to me, we all allow people to take multivitamins, we allow them to take creatine, we allow them to use cryotherapy, chambers and all these things that have shown to have a pretty significant impact on recovery. Why not allow them, you know, to make an agreement like a steel cage match, right. If all sign up for it.

Speaker 5:          01:47:56       Yeah, I know. I'd rather fight a stone guy than, so

Speaker 2:          01:47:59       I say that you say that you wouldn't want it. I'd rather do Jujitsu with a guy who is sober. Then a guy was high. When you, when you get, I think I do Jujitsu better when I'm high. I really do. A lot of people do lie to Jujitsu. People do Jujitsu high, they train high, they compete high. Super, super common. The difference is it's not striking. You know,

Speaker 5:          01:48:20       I know I'm better at eating and watching movies when I'm high.

Speaker 2:          01:48:26       I wonder what's going to happen, Dana, you know what you're talking about. Things like this, a doctor welling, you know, coming out with this college and stuff like when they start coming out with gene therapy and all these different ways to make your body young again and he'd get a guy like v tour who is an old guy with all this experience and all this knowledge. But you know that's, that's the trade off in life is that as you get older, your body doesn't work as well. So you might be a crafty old veteran, but you got to conserve your energy more because your body is just not capable of the same kind of output. But if you get a guy like Vito and then you bring them to that doctor and he does some wacky shit to his body and all of a sudden he's got both, he's got the knowledge and he's got the youthful body.

Speaker 2:          01:49:06       The whole sport gets very, very different and very, very strange. Yes. And that'll change all of sports, not just fighting, but the difference in basketball and MMA is that in basketball you don't have a finish like you had last night with Holly Holm head kick and Ronda Rousey. You have someone's slam dunking on you. That's like the, you know, that's the pit, the equivalent, you know, someone shooting a three pointer in your face. But like you said, you have a guy who's really talented, has the knowledge and how much laundry for Jordan played, if you know, if, if this what about now around when he was here. Yeah. It's going to be interesting. It's definitely gonna change the scores. It is. And you got to wonder, you know, this stuff they're doing with stem cells, they're regrowing cartilage. People that have bone on

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       bone arthritis, they inject them with stem cells and it regrows Cartlidge it regrows meniscus tissue. It's insane. So all these people that have these chronic ailments and injuries, they're going to be able to get those things fixed and all the detrimental effects of constant competition. There is slowly but surely going to be able to chip away at that stuff. That's true. They're getting rid of arthritis. Arthritis too. It's the stuff that they're doing out there now and those injections, arthritis goes away. You know, all these, I was Regena, key nation in your body that's going on. It's uh, it's going to be fascinating to see how this changes everything in the next 20 years. Yeah. And it's going to be fascinating to see, like what kind of regulations, if any, are they going to be able to establish to keep up with that stuff because it's way, even though, I mean, how would you even know if a guy was doing that?

Speaker 6:          01:50:36       We'll Novitsky was telling me when he did my podcast that there's an issue that they're having now with, they have testosterone that they've developed through animals instead of like the way they make artificial testosterone award. Uh, synthetic testosterone as they use wild yams. I don't understand the processing, but they use yams. So when they use a carbon isotope test, they can tell that the testosterone that's in your body is not indogenous. It's not created by your own body, but with this animal shit, they can't tell. So the testosterone they're getting from like, I don't know, wild boars are what the fuck they using for the testosterone. It's the same as the testosterone. It's being cooked up, write down little Tony's nuts, nuts. And what's crazy is he was telling me that there's this thing right now that you know, those strips that you put on your tongue, like a mountain, Washington, you know, there's actually, they have these trips that they're putting on their tongue and uh, it gives you all the effects of, uh, you know, like a growth hormone or, or test Thomas Testosterone injections or whatever it is, and it's out of your system in 12 hours.

Speaker 6:          01:51:52       If you take that before you go in to work out and you do your whole work out and everything, we'd get all the benefits of it and then it's out of your system in 12 hours. That's incredible. I mean, that's incredible. They call not microdosing. Right? But it's, these guys are there, they're really playing Russian roulette with the testing because they just hoping they don't get nabbed inside that 12 hour period. That's why when the drug test show up, they're showing up at your house at six in the morning and you know, yeah, yeah. It's, um, it's, it's really interesting times because it's pretty, it's been pretty clearly established that at least the early days of the UFC and the early days of pro, well pride period, there was a lot of performance enhancing drug use. There was a lot of it, you know, off the record, I've talked to guys who did it or in pride or told me that everybody was doing it and I'm on the record, uh, NC in any way, told me when he was on my podcast that they had in the fucking contract gave him, it said, we will not test for steroids in the contract.

Speaker 6:          01:52:49       And we, but we know it when we watched watch Vandelay at 218 pounds and you see all these fucking guys who were competing over there, we kind of knew they were juiced up. It's going to be interesting to see the culture of the sport transition to, you know, as clean as you can get it. And you know, you guys have to take, you guys have to be given credit for that because you stepped up and you did something that was very dangerous, very dangerous for the product and it's very, very, very dangerous for the reputation of the sport because as more of these people keep getting popped, like in your spending fucking billions of dollars to do this and these guys are getting popped work, you could just do what the NFL does. The NBA does kind of turn a blind eye and you know, no one's begging you to do this or forcing you to do this.

Speaker 6:          01:53:35       You know, and I'm not sure if it's in the NFL or major league baseball and one of them, they get warned that they're going to get tested. Yes. They know that the test is coming. Um, well that happens in college sports too. I mean I've talked to guys who played college ball and they say, hey, Friday is going to be a test and everybody's fucking drinking vinegar. And you know, gallons of water and trying to clear this year, right. When you say this, you know when you look at what we're doing right now to clean the sport up, you know we have contracts in place and how many flights we have to deliver, not just the television, the paper view and you know all these things that we have, we have contracts, we have obligations. Yeah, we're going to spend $5 million a year and testing and testing.

Speaker 6:          01:54:15       It could completely crippled the entire business, but it's the right thing to do. It's the right thing to do. Yeah. I don't know Def, I definitely don't think it's going to cripple the business, but I think it's definitely going to figure it out. If a guy gets tested and you know, you get a big star and he's on something, he's gone. Isn't that a big problem too with camps is that it's not like the NFL where they have this like giant infrastructure set up for, they know like, I mean there's, there's some variables when it comes to strength and conditioning training when in, in in many professional sports, but they have protocols that are pretty clearly established. Whereas in MMA there's a bunch of different ways to do it. And this guy's a competed a very high level that have really wacky camp environments. We like, you know, this is not really the most professional they're hanging out with.

Speaker 6:          01:55:03       Like that fucking guy that Anderson hangs around with the guy from black houses, 60 year old guy who looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger. You know what I mean? I mean like, what do you think that guy does? Oh, nothing is fucking fruits and vegetables. Steak and chicken. I mean, come on man, I'm fucked. You guys choose to the tits and, and no wonder, you know, Anderson tested positive other than the way he's hanging out with that guy. Why would that guy tell him the, the positive benefits of steroids? You know, it's, it's weird. It's weird and you know, this sport is so big, but has that aspect of it still that there's, there's, you know, it's not, it's not universe, not across the board. Like look at Kansas City royals and the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       How much fucking difference is their training? How much difference is there preparation? I would say probably not nearly as much as comparing someone who trains at Nova Uniao or so on trains at AMC pankration you know, I mean the variables and MMA, they're pretty, pretty stark.

Speaker 3:          01:56:01       Yeah, that's true. Um, and working now, the training has to evolve. You know, we're building this new campus, basically building new offices and uh, building a state of the art rehabilitation center fighters and it's like the New England patriots, right? If something happens to Brady, they don't tell Brady, see you later and come back, go, go do your surgery and all your stuff and come back and let us know when you're ready to play again. He's, they're there, they're there making sure he's doing therapy. He's got the best. That's what we're going to start doing it with the fighters and Vegas. And how do you set something like that up? Like who do you have running? So we're actually taking a looking at companies right now to come in, you know, we're going to find the best of the best. This will literally be a state of the art.

Speaker 3:          01:56:55       Um, the best in the World Rehab facility. It's going to be insane. And now we're going to have everything of everything in there to Rehab. We're going to have the, the, the, um, therapist and trainers in there to show people how to, you know, how to get a lot of these guys. A lot of these guys will go get an ACL done and then not do the therapy when they come back. And, and you might as well not have to fucking surgery. You have to go through the physical therapy to get it back and then you have to keep working on that way, you know? Um, and Conor Mcgregor, that's what's so another fascinating, his whole thing about movement, human movement and flexibility and stuff. He's very into that. He, you know, he fought the Chad Mendez fight with them, with really blown out knee, um, to, what did he do for, we did he get a stem cell shots? So he went out to Germany and got those shots and uh, Germany, he went to Germany and in Ireland, so he just went over to Germany and got those shots. And uh, he did some in California too. He did do some in La too when he was out in Vegas. Um, and that's all you needed. You did that. And he did his own physical therapy and he brought the knee right back. Well, that's what's incredible

Speaker 2:          01:58:13       credible about the stem cells shed man to the regenerative, regenerative potential for stem cells is just incredible. And they're just now starting to tap into that. And when it comes to sports and rehabilitation, when you're establishing this, this place has this whole center, um, are, are you going to establish like strength and conditioning protocols to, are you going to bring people in for that kind of stuff as well? Like and like movement specific, like different guys who have Organon

Speaker 6:          01:58:42       certain things, different guys who are grapplers were gone. Certain things I don't dig where to get into the striking and grappling. That's not our area. That's not our thing. They can pick their own coaches and who they'll work with them. But I mean as far as like improved like strength and conditioning aspects of that body balanced, you know, proper strength conditioning, stretch, you know, all the things that that um, they're definitely not learning at their jumps so much to learn. You know what I mean? You know, there's a lot of coaches like Edmond is a good example. He's obviously good at holding mitts and good at teaching. Rhonda, the mechanics of throwing punches. How much does he know about defending gay teens? How much does he know about the transitions between boxing and grappling? And we don't, you know, we really don't know. And I think the same can be said as far as what are the requirements of your sport when it comes to strength and conditioning.

Speaker 6:          01:59:32       It's still kind of being learned and everybody does things differently for every guy. Like GSP and thinks you have to use gymnastics. There's certain guys like fate or gave up on all weights in any strength and conditioning later in his career and just did fight training. You know, you look at John Jones right now who's totally getting into all this power lifting stuff. Um, have you seen some of that stuff? Oh my God, he looks huge. It's unbelievable. Shrek a freak of nature. That guy is, he really is. I'm hoping he straightened his head out and comes back because when you, when you want to talk about just a spectacular talent, I mean Jon Jones is probably the most talented guy we've ever seen in this sport. I mean it is, is, he's just an incredible athlete and what he's been able to do to top level fighters like really early on in his career is nothing short of amazing.

Speaker 6:          02:00:22       If he has a wake up call from all this and just cuts the bullshit and focuses on just, just taking advantage of the prime cause he's in his prime, he's in his prime, he's in his prime. He's so big, so talented. Such a gifted athlete. I mean, you look at, like you said, what he's done in the Fed and the sport. Then you look at what he's doing now, he just gets into power lifting and he's benching 500 pounds and squat and dead lift and 600 pounds. I mean, it's crazy. And he could fight it. Fucking heavyweight too, by the way. Easy. He keeps powerlifting. He's probably gonna have to, I know, right? Yeah, but it's just, it's, it's cool. It looks like, it looks like he is, he's doing the right thing now. He's doing what he's supposed to be doing for his community service.

Speaker 6:          02:01:09       It looks like he's working hard in the gym, you know? Um, it looks like his heads into it and he likes it. And you know, we were talking about inspiration. Look, he's, he's in camp now with the fucking woman's bantamweight champ of the world. Holly Holm is definitely going to give Johnson inspiration because I know they're close friends. Yeah. That's cool. It's fucking awesome. I said, I think we gave these people enough and this bitch podcast on a plane. Oh, we look at this. We did another hour and 27 minutes. Shizam Holy Shit. That two hours. Yeah. See Time flies when we talked Dana White. Good Lord. It's going to be the first podcast you have to be on TV. The one, one of those two, like I said, changing the game. All right, well this is the end of this. Thanks brother. Appreciate it. Tony Hinchcliffe. Say Goodbye to the people. Good by people.

Speaker 6:          02:01:58       Tony. Tony in each color. One hour special. One shot coming soon. My first special that might be on Netflix. I mean that's what I heard. Uh, might be, um, any more message to the fan. Any word? Nothing. Anything you want to say? Thanks. It was, it was a historic night, you know, uh, Rhonda Rousey versus Holly Holm broke every record UFC ever had. And thank you everybody. We appreciate it. Attendance pay per view buys everything. Attendance. The Eddie had a gross record. Gate record. Um, the, uh, the merge, the, the commercial paper view. Um, the paper views trending well over a million buys. Um, what else? I'm trying to think. I just, there were so many records that were broken that night. It was crazy. Now here's the last question. If you do do a rematch, when do you think you would do, which tried to do it for UFC 200 in July? Um, I don't know. I, again, we got to see, we've got to see where Ron does that figured out. Yeah, I mean, obviously that's like UFC 200 would be awesome. That would be the move. Right? Great. All right folks, that's it.

Speaker 4:          02:03:05       That's the end. Thank you. And Goodbye. Oh, you still here? Well, if you are, please enjoy the lovely sounds of Dana White's snoring on the flight home from Australia.
