Speaker 1:          00:00:06       And we're live, it's going on. Where did you sleep? Well last night. I did. I didn't sleep that badly. I mean, hotels are a tough thing. Um, and we actually know the science that I'm one half of your brain will actually not sleep as deeply than the other when you're sleeping in a, an unusual room, like a hotel room. Really, that's what fucks me up when I'm on the road, you know, I'll do three different hotels in a week because I'll do like a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, like with gigs and then by the time Sunday rolls around, I'm a mess in rough shape. Yeah. Is that what it is? Yeah. And it's a union. It's a threat detection thing. I mean if you look at other species, they can do this much more impressively than we can. So dolphins or any sort of sea dwelling memo can actually sleep with half a brain.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       So one half of that brain goes into deep sleep. The other half is wide awake. That's how people, the DMV do it. Those people that work at the department of motor vehicles, they're there. They work half asleep. You ever meet him? I haven't. No. Just teasing the DMV. Listening. Going fuck you man. Next time you come in and get your license renewed. That was my next NIH grant. I think looking at the DMV and sleep. But yeah, we ESA workers. Same thing, same, same type of human that I've come across them too. I'm just kidding. Fuckers. Relax. Um, so when you're in a hotel room, what is happening that you're half. Your brain is not really sleeping. Yeah. So there's different stages of sleep. There are two principle types. One is non rapid eye movement sleep or non rem sleep. The other is rem sleep, which is also known as dream sleep and non rapid eye movement.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       Sleep is further divided into four separate stages, which are unimaginatively called stages one through four were a creative bunch is easy to remember that it is true, but I think it's also a low Iq, but it's the deep stages of sleep. Three and four of that non rapid eye movement. That's where a lot of sort of body replenishment takes place. Grief, the cardiovascular system, metabolism, all of those good things, but that's the deep sleep that one half of your brain will resist going into when you're sleeping in a foreign environment. So it stays in this kind of lighter stage, almost like a threat detection system. And you can imagine why, you know, it's an unusual context, evolutionarily. It would make a lot of sense to just have that sort of on guard one half of the brain that makes so much sense. And that really for me, it fills in the blanks of like why even if I get, you know, seven, eight hour sleep on the road, I'm still kind of just out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       Yeah. And that's in fact, probably one of the, I think the most impressive parts of new research on sleep. It's not just about quantity, it's also about quality and quality can be as detrimental if you don't get it as a reduction in total quality. I mean both are essential, but I think it speaks exactly to your point. You just don't feel like it's a refreshing sort of deep sleep. Um, yeah, it feels totally different. Um, it just feels like, I guess I would say it feels like half asleep. Yeah, me too. It's really kind of out does feel. One of the things that I noticed, I did this thing with my friends called sober October where we, um, didn't smoke any pot or do any, no drinking at all, nothing for a month. And when I did it, one of the things I found was that after about, I don't know how many days, but it was noticeable that I would have these incredibly vivid dreams.

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       And then I had read that marijuana does something to suppress heavy rem sleep. Like what, what, what is happening there? Yeah. So both of those chemicals, both of which are used as a sleep aid, alcohol and marijuana are actually very good at blocking your dream sleep, your rapid eye movement, sleep. And so what happens is that the brain is quite clever in this regard. It builds up a clock counter of how much dream sleep you should have had but have not been getting. And it starts to develop this increasing appetite and hunger for dream sleep. So that finally, when the alcohol actually gets out of your system, sober October, the love of the day, that's all of a sudden where you get what's called a rem sleep rebound effect, where you not only get the normal amount of rem sleep that you would normally have, you get that, plus the brain tries to get back some of that dream sleep that it's been losing over the past maybe 11 months.

Speaker 1:          00:04:34       Um, so you get this 20 years. I didn't want to make any assumptions of uh, so, um, so you get this rem sleep rebounded effect and that's where you have these really intense dream sleep. Um, situations. It's the same reason that people, they'll say like, I had a bit too much to drink last night. Maybe it was a Friday or Saturday. They sleep in late. They say, I just had these crazy dreams. What happens there is a kind of an acute version where the alcohol is swilling around in your system and after about six hours, your liver and your kidneys to finally excrete it, all of the alcohol and your brain has been deprived of dream sleep for that first six hours. So then it feast in the last couple of hours and that's why you have these really bizarre dreams after you've been drinking a little bit too much.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       Oh Wow. So what is happening with marijuana though specifically? Do you know? Yeah, so marijuana, it does help. People will help it. It puts people to sleep quicker. Although I think the question is whether it's really naturalistic sleep or not, that they go into. Certainly with alcohol, it's not that nightcap idea is a misnomer. Alcohol will actually will. It's a form of drugs that we call the sedatives and sedation is not sleep. It's very different, but we often mistake one for the other. Marijuana seems to act in a physiologically for a different way. It doesn't target the same receptors in the brain, so it's unclear with the speed with which you fall asleep after having a session with marijuana is actually natural sleep. Let's assume it is the problem, however. Is that it? Then we'll start to disrupt rem sleep. It will start to block the process.

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       We think perhaps at the level of the brainstem, which is where these two types of sleep, non rem and rem sleep will actually get sort of worked out. That's where marijuana may actually impact dream sleep and shut it down and block it. Have there been any studies on chronic marijuana smokers, like those, uh, dawn to dusk type characters that just are constantly high? Like what happens to their brain from not because they must never hit rem sleep. Yeah. So people haven't looked at marijuana. They have looked at alcohol though. Exactly that. So what happens is if you look at alcoholics, they will have some thing often when they come off alcohol, something called Delirium Tremens, which is where sort of Dt I'm there. What happens is that the alcohol has been blocking dream sleep for so long and the pressure for dream sleep has built up so powerfully in the brain.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       It actually just spills over into wakefulness and so the brain just says, look, okay, if I'm not going to get this dream sleep whilst you're asleep, I'm just going to take it whilst you're awake, and so you start to essentially dream while you're awake. It's this sort of collision of two states of consciousness, so you get delirium. Wow. I always thought the dts. We're detoxing other one. Someone said someone's going through the dts. Okay. Yeah. So it's delirium. Tremor, yeah. Delirium. Tremens. Yeah. Sort of. So what, like what is going on with them when this is happening. So if they are going through this delirium during the day, while they're conscious, what's physiologically happening? So it's almost as though the veil of rem sleep gets pulled over the waking brain as it were. So you have this mixed state of consciousness that you can pick up with brain wave recordings and he just tells me, I mean in some ways how necessary sleep must be if that's the length that the brain will go to to get that which it's been missing, just shows you why, you know, it took mother nature three point 6 million years to put this thing called anytown asleep necessity in place and we've come along and within the space of 100 years we've locked up almost 20 percent of that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:22       If you look at the data, wow, really know so many people take pride in that too. I don't need eight hour sleep. I got three. I'm good, ready to go kick ass and dominate the world. This sort of like sleep, machismo attitude. There is a lot of that, right? Yeah. Baby. Alex Lee. Well, I mean you'd be glad to know that. Then you know, men who sleep five to six hours a night, we'll have a level of testosterone which is that of someone 10 years their senior. So lack of sleep will age. You buy a decade in terms of that particular aspect

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       of wellness for realty, neck, muscle strength. Sexual performance. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:00       Credible. Wow. We had a woman on the podcast, her name is Courtney [inaudible], Walter and cheese, a ultra marathon runner. And she ran a. she's a real freak. I mean, like an incredible athlete. She ran this thing called the Moab to 40. It's 238 miles through the Moab Mountains and she did it 22 miles faster than the second place man. So she won it by like a whopping, I think it was 10 hours, 10 hours ahead of the second place winner. And she slept one minute, one minute the entire time. She tried to lie. This is over three days. I think it took her less than three days. I think it took her like two days. Um, she slept for one minute during the entire time, but she tried to lie down. She, she said she laid down for a few minutes but she couldn't fall asleep. And then she wound up actually just taking one minute and going to sleep.

Speaker 3:          00:09:59       And she said that one minute was like one of the most intense restful minutes after that minute is over, she was woken up because she told her partner running partner to wake her up at a minute and she's like, how long did you let me sleep? And he was like, one minute. She was like, wow, I feel great, let's go. But she was saying that she hallucinates and that she starts seeing like rabbits or talking to her and she sees things that aren't there and like mystical beings and stuff. She said it's really freaky, but she knows that she's hallucinating because she's done this. She's done a bunch of an ultra marathon. So she just keeps going. She just keeps going and she's like saying hi to rabbits there talking to her and stuff. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:10:36       I mean you see these reports too. I mean this is a race of cycling, race of thing. His bike across America just got to go from east coast to west coast in a shorter time as possible. And that exactly what they do too. It's all about managing how little sleep that you get. And they will explain these wild hallucinogenic experiences on the bike. If you look at world records for people who have tried to sort of go without sleep. And one of the most famous examples is a radio disc jockey called Peter trip back in the, um, it was back in the sort of sixties, fifties, sixties. And he tried to break the world record. He went eight days straight. Um, and yeah, no sleep. Yeah, he was broadcasting from time square. He would do is show the. And you know, the scientists, the psychiatrist said, look, this is a very bad idea based on what we know, please don't do it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:26       And he said, I'm going to do it anyway. And then the scientists being a good scientist, they said, great, do you mind if we study here because it'd be a great paper to sort of, you know, to write up. And they tracked him. And by day three he was having Florid delusions and hallucinations. He was seeing spiders in his shoes. He became desperately paranoid. He started to think that people were trying to poison him in his food. One point, it was the middle of winter, some guys came in with sort of these barriers. New York winter came in with these big jackets. He thought it was the secret service coming to get him and he ran out into the road, you know, these are strange, but so we know that that same profile of just starting to become psychotic, which is essentially what happens naturally when you dream that you are, I mean all of us here, you know, as long as we slept last night, became flagrantly psychotic when we went into dream sleep because you start to see things which are not there. So you hallucinate, you believe things that couldn't possibly be true. So you're delusional. You get confused about time, place and person. So you're suffering from disorientation. You have wildly fluctuating emotions. Something that psychiatrist called being sort of effectively label. And then how wonderful. We both woke up this morning and we forgot most if not all of that dream experience. So, uh, suffering from Amnesia,

Speaker 3:          00:12:44       what is happening when you're having these hallucinogenic experiences? Like what are the chemicals that are causing. Do we know?

Speaker 2:          00:12:53       We do. Yeah. And so we've done some of these studies where we put people into brain scanners, we let them fall asleep, and then we see what happens within the brain, which parts of the brain of switching on which parts of the brain of switching off when you go into rem sleep, firstly some parts of your brain become 30 percent more active than when you're awake. So you know, we think of sleep as this sort of, you know, static, passive state where everything just kind of drops down in terms of activity. Quite the contrary. But what's also interesting is that not all parts of the brain ramp up when you go into rem sleep, visual parts of the brain, increased motor parts of the brain, increase emotional centers and memory centers. They all increase, but the part of the brain that bucks the trend and goes in the opposite direction is the part of the brain that we call the prefrontal cortex.

Speaker 2:          00:13:44       This sort of CEO of the brain that's very good at rational, logical thinking. That parts of the part of the brain gets shut off. So it's almost as though you know the, the prison guards are gone and everyone runs a mark because there's no controller in place. And so we know sort of from the patterns of brain activity, why you become sort of so visual. You see things, why you have motor kinesthetic activity, why things feel so emotional, but also why things seem utterly illogical and irrational because your frontal brain, the thing that makes us most human, you can say goodbye to that for the rest of dream sleep. So there's no driver. So there's no driver. Yeah. Now why do we forget? Why do we forget those dreams? Because I

Speaker 3:          00:14:30       wake up and I am sure that I'm going to remember these dreams and sometimes I do. Sometimes our member and I don't think I really remember them. I think what it is is very much like you ever hear someone talk about a memory from a long time ago. I used to think that people actually remembered things from a long time ago, but now what I as Dave remember remembering it, I think they remember talking about it. They remember how they described it and then they sort of remember that and repeat it and in their mind convinced themselves that that's what happened because I've heard people tell stories about the past and they're, they vary wildly from what is absolutely true. Like, like factual. You could check it, you could research it, you know what the facts are, but in their mind it's very different and I think that it's entirely possible that what people are doing is remembering the recollection of these memories and how they told them and then also sort of people elaborate things and make themselves look better or make the situation look more dramatic. But with dreams that doesn't make any sense. So I was always trying to figure out like what is it about a dream where sometimes I can remember the dream and sometimes it's so vivid when I wake up, I'm like, holy shit, that was crazy. What a dream. And then I forget it 20 minutes later.

Speaker 2:          00:15:55       Great. What is that soup firstly? I mean, one theory of dreaming is that it's just simply a reconstruction when you wake up. So you have these fragments of activity and what your cortex does when it wakes up is what your cortex is designed to do when you're awake normally, which is try to package everything, can make a good story, make logical fit out of the world. That's one theory. I don't believe that though. Um, your, your point is a really interesting one. Do I remember my dreams? Um, that doesn't necessarily mean I forget my dreams. And what I mean by that is accessibility versus availability. So if you haven't had that experience where you've woken up, you thought I was definitely dreaming, I can't quite grab it. You know, it just and it's gone. And then two days later you're in the shower, you sort of washing yourself, you see a bottle of shampoo, you see the label, and it just triggers the unlocking of that dream memory and it sort of comes flooding back or someone says something to you and you think, oh, that was the dream.

Speaker 2:          00:16:54       What that tells me as a brain scientist is that the memory is there. It's preserved, it's available. But what happens when most of the time when we wake up is that we lose the Ip address to the memory, so it's present, but it's not consciously accessible, available, not accessible. If that's true, what it means is that this type of information we know can have nonconscious impacts on our behavior all the time. It's great brain science about this nonconscious memory processing. It's possible that we store every one of our dreams. We just don't consciously have accessibility to it. But nevertheless it's changing how we behave, how we feel each and every day. No evidence for it to theory. I'm still wanting to test. But that's possible too. And it's only that anecdote where I can think. I just don't remember the dream. I forgotten it. I don't. That may be true. It may still be there. I just need to find

Speaker 3:          00:17:52       keys to sort of access that memory. What's stunning to me is how quickly the dream evaporates. The memory of the dream or in relation to an actual experience. Like if we went outside and we saw some lady walk up to some guy and kick him in the balls, we'd be like, whoa. We would remember that and that you needed to be able to tell your friends like, yeah, some lady just randomly walked as some guy and kicked him in the balls. Like we would remember that and you'd remember it 10 minutes later you'd member in an hour you'd remembered. Yes. Next day you'd be telling your friends. Yeah, she just walked right up to him. I remember it like it was yesterday because it was right, but a dream it can be 10 minutes ago and you wake up and dude it was King Kong and he was. He was swinging from my ceiling and somehow or another they fit in the room, but the room got bigger and you have these crazy dreams and then 20 minutes later you forget all of it. Like what is happening there?

Speaker 2:          00:18:46       So one, one current explanation is that the chemistry of the brain when you go into dream sleep is radically different. Yeah. So one of the chemicals called noradrenaline in the brain, which downstairs in the body it's sister chemical, is called adrenaline. Noradrenaline actually plummets to the lowest level. It's actually, it's a stress chemical in the brain or to one of them that get shut off during dream sleep, which has been. If you're panicking like what if you fall off a building? Well, what's interesting is that that chemical is low wealth. You're having that dream, but when you wake up from those and some people often wake up, that's when you have the spike of origin, so it's still low when you're in dream sleep, but there's another chemical that goes in the opposite direction. It's called acid tile. Coleen. It's the chemical that is actually an altered in Alzheimer's disease and these two chemicals will change essentially the input output direction of information flow into the memory centers of the brain center. Sense

Speaker 3:          00:19:46       excuse people take that as a nootropic they do. Yeah. That's actually an Alpha brain when when you take that, it's has been clinically proven to enhance memory, especially verbal memory and recollection of words and things like that. That's right. So that's happening while your sleeping

Speaker 2:          00:20:03       well, so you're in rem sleep, but what may be happening, our current model is if you sort of build these neural models to sort of mimic dreaming, it may be that during dreaming it's principally about the outflow of information to generate dreams and in fact the chemical profile is oppositional to input which is about saving. So it's about sort of pumping out information rather than committing information. And so when you come out of a dream sleep, you still get this sort of lingering after sort of taste of chemistry as it were in the brain. That means that the dreaming brain is more programmed to be outputting a narrative and an experience rather than actually committing it to memory, which is the opposite direction. That makes sense. It

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       does make sense. Um, how aware are you of dimethyltryptamine?

Speaker 2:          00:20:52       I'm somewhat aware of it scientifically. Not, not, not personally.

Speaker 3:          00:20:57       Yeah. Yeah. I'm one of the things about psychedelic experiences with dimethyltryptamine. First of all, it's endogenous. You, your brain produces it, your lungs, your liver produce it. But when you have a dmt experience after it's over, the memory fades very rapidly and it seems just like a dream in that regard. We're while while you're having it, what's bizarre is that you're having it while you're awake and then after you have it within 10, 20 minutes, it is just like a dream that you can't remember. It's a very. I remember like little flashes of experiences that I've had and there's been a lot of speculation that that's one of the things that you're experiencing while you're in heavy rem sleep and that could be responsible for the crazy visuals that you have. That seemed so vivid. I mean there's been times where I've had dreams where I was 100 percent convinced that I was awake and then something happened.

Speaker 3:          00:21:52       Like I do this thing sometimes where I'll. If I do it consciously a lot. I think I saw in one of those wacky movies like what the bleep do we know? I think I saw it in that when you walk up to a door, as you're walking through the door, you knock on the side of the door and go, am I awake? Nope, not awake, or am I asleep? Rather? Yeah, no, I'm not asleep because I'm not going to the door. Well, I did that in my hand was just like going right through the wall and I'm like, oh, I'm sleeping. And then I woke up and there was like woo. But the feeling that I had while I was in that dream, it was so vivid. I mean everything seemed so real. Like what could possibly be causing me to construct this artificial reality in my mind that at the moment at least was indistinguishable from the reality that experience right now. And I'm assuming because I just knocked on the table that I'm awake.

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       Yeah. I really hope I'm not just a fictive character in your dreams. Maybe we're sharing a dream yet very inception, like possible, not based on the science so far. Um, but I think you know, what you're speaking about, there really is almost why would, why would mother nature create this thing called the dream experience? You know, what would be the function of essentially every night going into what sums up to be about two total hours of virtual reality experience and testing. One possibility which is deeply unsatisfying is that it's just a byproduct. It's just Epi, phenomenal that when your brain goes into this thing called rem sleep and all of the different patterns of brain activity that we described, an offshoot is this thing that we call dreaming in the same way that a light bulb, the reason that we construct the apparatus that's a light bulb is to produce light. But when you produce light in that way, you also produce heat. It was never the function of the light bulb. It's just what happens when you produce light in that way may be dreaming is just sort of the heat of rem sleep and rem sleep serves lots of other functions. But wow, that doesn't feel to me right though. Why? Well, firstly, I think it's probably additionally metabolically demanding to have dreams in addition to this thing called rem sleep and whenever mother nature burns calories, it's usually for a reason because they're so precious.

Speaker 3:          00:24:18       That's a good point. That makes sense too. Yeah. I read some article about the lack of rem sleep with marijuana users and it was trying to say, and it made me super skeptical even as a pot smoker, it was trying to say that it's not bad for you because what it's essentially doing is bypassing the rem sleep and going directly into the deep sleep and then it's helping you in that regard. Does that make sense to you? It doesn't make sense as a neuroscientist. He says nay, you fucking stoners. Obviously. I'm just so deeply unpopular, you know, I'm telling you

Speaker 2:          00:24:54       don't smoke pot, stay away from alcohol, you know, apart from a general personality, which is dislikable. This doesn't help me.

Speaker 3:          00:25:01       Definitely not dislikable, but I don't think you're saying anything wrong. I think um, I think marijuana, like most things is best used in moderation. And one thing that I got out of the sober October thing wasn't just that. It's fascinating to see the dreams, like just ramp up and get crazy. But also that when you take a few days off and then smoke a little pot, the pot actually has more of an impact. In fact, one of my favorite psychedelic authors and lectures, the late great Terence Mckenna, his advice was to not do marijuana for long periods of time and then do as much as you could stand. And he was a, you know, a real psychedelic adventure in his thought was to really get the benefit out of marijuana. It's not something that should be used daily and recreate recreationally. It should be used as a psychedelic sacrament.

Speaker 3:          00:25:57       Not should be because he actually did smell pot pretty rarely read pretty regularly rather. But his thought was if you really want to get the full impact of it, you shouldn't be accustomed to it. And when you're accustomed to it, you build up a tolerance to it and it doesn't have the same impact. Like it's that thing. I don't know if you've ever been around pot smokers, but when someone doesn't smoke pot and then they get talked into smoking pot with some pot smokers, it's always a terrible idea. You got a bunch of people with super high tolerances and some poor person that doesn't have any tolerance and they just, they just get taken down a tornado, rabbit whole journey into their child, zero to 60 and so paranoid and thinking about everything and freaking out all these sensations and they just never experienced before. But, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       the, the idea that you could bypass rem sleep and go straight into the deep sleep, that doesn't make any sense to you. No, it doesn't. And what we've learned over the past 30 or 40 years is all stages of sleep are important. You know, when you think about sleep as a state, it makes no sense. You know, first the, your vulnerable to predation. You're not finding food, you're not finding a mate, you're not reproducing, you're not caring for your young on any one of those grounds. Sleep should have been strongly selected against as a collective. I mean it, it's, it's almost idiotic. If sleep does not serve an absolutely vital function, it is the biggest mistake, the evolutionary process ever made, and that counts for all of the stages of sleep too. Again, Mother Nature wouldn't waste time putting you into a state that wasn't necessary.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       And what we've discovered is that all of those different stages of sleep that we spoke about all have unique and separate functions. So you can't short change any one of them. You don't need to bias towards one and try and sort of, you know, play Kate, the other, you know, evolution is, has taken a long time to get the blueprint accurately correct for each physiological individual. I wouldn't play around with it and think that you're smarter than that process. When I read it, I felt like it was a justification for smoking pot. Like, man, you're just getting deeper sleep, man. You don't need that rem sleep. You're passing it up, man. You just go right into the deep, heavy, necessary sleep. Oh, contra contrary potheads. Um, so what is happening to the body during rem sleep that's so critical that one particular aspect of sleep.

Speaker 1:          00:28:31       So firstly, in the body, the your cardiovascular system seems to do something quite strange. It goes through periods of dramatic acceleration and then dramatic deceleration during, during rem sleep. Quite unpredictable too. We also know that during rem sleep, your brain power analyzes your body so that your mind can dream safely. So wow, I mean, and that makes a lot of sense. If you're thinking that you're, you know, this world champion mixed martial arts person and it's in the middle of the night, you're not, it's dark. You can't see. You're not perceiving or outside world, you're going to get popped out of the gene pool very quickly if you start acting out that experience. So there is a barrier in place that mother nature locks you down in incarceration, muscling, customer coloration. That's crazy that you say that because when I was fighting, when I was young, I would wake up throwing kicks.

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       I would kick in the middle of the night. I would do it all the time. I'd be sleeping and I just, I would move and throw a kick in the middle of the night and I remember waking me up like, what the fuck is wrong with me? And then I to go back to sleep again. But I was obviously dreaming about competing. Do you actually remember this when you woke up, did you remember dreaming at that point or did you just have no recollection of anything going on at that point? I believe I had a recollection. It's been a long time, but I believe I had a recollection. I'm like, I would be like in bed with my girlfriend would wake her up too, you know, because I just don't like. I wouldn't throw a full kick but my body would move. Like I was going to, you know, like I would turn my hips and my leg would extend. It was my body was, it was I, I've, I attributed to the, the idea that it's so extreme, like the activity of fighting is so extreme that my brain had kind of like hyper charged itself to compete at this very high level, you know, and that this was so unusual that it was, it was almost at red alert all the time and maybe even trying to work out patterns while I was sleeping. That's exactly the evidence that we have now. So for things like

Speaker 2:          00:30:47       skills or even rats running around a maze where they will learn specific sort of navigational pathways and even skilled motor movements. What you can do is you can place these electrodes into census of the, of the brain. We, we work in my sleep, sleep center works on humans, but other people have done these studies in rats and you implant electrodes and you measure the brain cells firing as the rat is running around the maze. And let's say that you can sort of play little tones for each brain cell. So they're running around the maze and and you can listen to the brain cells to learning

Speaker 1:          00:31:19       the signature of that may so it goes, but bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup. But what was amazing is that when you let those rats sleep, but you keep listening to the brain, what you hear is as if the brain is actually an infected is it's replaying the exact same sequence. They memory sequence that it was learning whilst it was awake, it's replaying, but at a speed that is 20 times faster.

Speaker 2:          00:31:48       So now we start to get into this inception. Weldon, I don't mean to cause the scientific data read that we're not sort of in that territory, but you know that notion of time compression and time dilation that Christopher Nolan played so well within that movie. We can see that at the level of brain cell firing in rats as they're learning these mazes. And it comes back to what you're saying, which is that the better that they reversed those skilled memories, when you wake them up and test them the next day, that predicts how much better they are. In terms of their performance, so it's not just that you learn, you go to sleep and you replay and you hit the save button on these new memories. You actually scoped out those memories and you improve them. And we've done studies with motor skill learning critical for athletics,

Speaker 1:          00:32:34       performance and practice does not make perfect practice with a night

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       of sleep is what makes perfect because you come back the next day and you're 20 to 30 percent better in terms of your skilled performance than where you were at the end of your practice session the day before. Wow. Wow. I mean sleep is the greatest legal performance enhancing drug that most people are probably neglecting in sport.

Speaker 3:          00:33:01       Wow. And not just for your physical performance, but actually skill learning.

Speaker 2:          00:33:05       That's right. Skill learning, memory. And then also, you know, downstairs in the body all over the recuperative benefits. Um, and you can flip the coin by the way, if you're getting six hours of sleep or less, your time to physical exhaustion drops by up to 30 percent. So you could spend all of your time training for 10 round fight, perfect condition. But then I put you on six hours of sleep the night before, you're now going to be physically exhausted by round seven rather than around 10.

Speaker 3:          00:33:34       Wow. But. Well, and that's a really hard thing for fighters because they have a very difficult time sleeping the night before a big fight. Yeah. It's very, very difficult because usually sit and. Yep. And I would imagine it's got to be. I mean it's probably going to take a huge, a huge tournament is probably be a huge benefit if they can somehow or another bypass all that and just relax and learn how to relax and learn how to actually sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:33:59       I mean it's, I think it's one of constantly trying to hack the physiological system, especially in elite sports these days because you know, small fractions of a percent of gain to make a huge difference. So that sounds like 30 percent. That's a monster. Huge. Yeah. I mean your time to sort of not just physical exertion, but you know, the lactic acid builds up quicker. The less and less that you sleep your ability of the lungs to actually expire. Carbon dioxide inhale, oxygen decreases, the less sleep that you have

Speaker 3:          00:34:28       so much sense. Why? Because when I was doing, I was doing fear factor and I was doing standup comedy and then I was also doing another television show and I was doing Jujitsu. I never got eight hours sleep. I'm mostly got four, usually go for it and my cardio is sucked. It was terrible. And I'd be like, why is my cardio soccer workout so much? Like that was probably what it was. Yeah, it's a huge part of that. Now, how many hours of sleep should you get? Similar between?

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       It gives me somewhere between seven to nine hours. Um, once you get below seven hours of sleep, we can measure objective, impermanent your

Speaker 3:          00:35:03       brain and your body. I can show that in the last two days and I can show it because I basically did the same workout two days in a row. Um, the day before I had flown back from Boston, very tired. I'm hiring out with my kids all day. Went to get some sleep, but then I had to do some stuff at like 2:00 in the morning. And uh, I just never really got good sleep. And then my youngest daughter got up at five, she was crying and then eventually my alarm went off at eight, so my sleep was like three, four hours. It was all screwy and the night before it was even less because I had flown and I had to get up early for the flight and I tried to sleep on the plane and I went running and I felt like dog shit.

Speaker 3:          00:35:46       And then during the day I felt like dog shit, I just didn't have, like as I was running, I just didn't have any extra gear. I was like, I did it, I pushed through it, but then it was over. It was like, oh, well last night, last night I slept seven and a half hours, woke up today, lifted weights, ran, ran, felt great, feel great. Now, like two days in difference. I mean, that's the difference. The difference is one day I got real sleep. One day I did and I did the exact same thing even more today I did, I lifted weights today as well. And I just feel great. So I could see, I could see it physiologically in the difference in my performance in 24 hours. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       and that's noticeable. I mean we see that too. You know, your, um, your peak muscle strength, your physical vertical jump height and your peak running speed, all of those things correlate with sleep. The less that you have, the worst, those outcomes are probably one of the most surprising factors. There was injury risk when they've looked at athletes across a season and they've just plotted how frequently will they get injured and then they surveyed them, you know, how much sleep are you getting? And they bucketed them into sort of people who are getting nine hours, seven hours, six, five, four, and it's a perfect linear relationship. The less sleep that you have hired your injury risk, so people getting nine hours versus five hours, there was almost a 60 percent increase in probability of injury risk during a season. Do you attribute it

Speaker 3:          00:37:10       that to exhaustion or do you attribute that to a lack of recovery from the previous night's workout? Is it a combination of those things? Is it exhaustion causing you to miss step perhaps and like twist an ankle or turn a knee?

Speaker 2:          00:37:24       Yeah, it's all of those things. Even if you look at micro balance, if you look at sort of the stability muscles versus you know, major muscles, those stability muscles also fail when you're not getting sufficient sleep. And I think we often underestimate how critical they are in sport performance, particularly in terms of combating and placating injury risk to see if you just get someone on a stability ball, you know, sort of just dose them down with sleep eight hours, five hours, three hours, and just notice how those stability muscles help you balance just the basic act of balance that deteriorates dramatically. No wonder you're getting more or injury

Speaker 3:          00:38:01       risk. Totally makes sense. Now as a neuroscientist, what do you attribute when, when, when people talk about visualization and visualization is a, it's a huge factor in improving technical skills, uh, specifically more martial arts, which is a, I'm a big fan of obviously martial arts. When you visualize people who visualize, who sit down and like go over their body, going through the motions and doing things, those people perform better, they better, they, um, they, they learn quicker. What do you attribute that to? Do you think it's the same thing as what's happening when you're sleeping? Just maybe to a lesser extent.

Speaker 2:          00:38:46       I think it's to a lesser extent, but people have done those studies where they've looked at sort of whether you actually physically practice, let's say on a keyboard, just because it's easier to sort of managing the laboratory versus just imagining sort of typing out that sequence and just the act of physical visualization, of sort of imagination of that motor skill. It's about 50 percent as effective as physically performing it too, and it's 50 percent as effective. What I mean there is in changing the plastic connections within the brain to even just visualization, know passive play as it were still can actually cause a rewiring of the brain beneficially.

Speaker 3:          00:39:31       Wow. You know, learning techniques, specifically martial arts techniques. My good friend, Eddie Bravo, so world famous Jujitsu instructor, he's, he's always. I'm comparing it to tying your shoe and he said, do you know how like when you were a little kid and you're trying to figure out how to tie your shoe, it's an extremely difficult thing to do. Like how do I do this? And you put that down and you do loops. Like I'm watching my seven year old daughter go through that right now. But now as a grown man, when I tie my shoe, I could just be talking to you. Oh, what? Oh yeah, we're going to go tomorrow and I'll do it. I don't. I don't even know what I did. If you tried to ask me to explain how I tie my shoes, I'd be like, how do I tell her shit? Like I don't even know how I do it because it just. I have it in there. It just it. And the idea with martial arts is you've got to be. All of your techniques have to be automatic. Someone extends the arm. You instantly hook it and go into the arm bar. You know someone. You have to have these paths like so drilled in that you don't even know you're doing them until it's over.

Speaker 2:          00:40:35       Yeah. So automaticity is one of the things that sleep actually accomplishes. Yeah. I was talking about those 20 to 30 percent benefits in motor skill performance. So we did some additional studies to actually say, well what, how it, how does sleep do that? You know, where in your skill performance to sleep give you the benefit. So you're right, tying a shoelace, you know, even driving a car with stick, you know, at first it's just overwhelming. It's so difficult to clutch it's gas pedal, you know, it's good and now it's just second nature. You know, it's shifted from conscious to automatic, from conscious and unconscious. If you look at performance that is conscious and not automatic, it's usually very staccato. It's this, then it's that, then it's that. It's not fluid. If you heard someone trying to sort of play piano to begin with, doesn't sound very fluid.

Speaker 2:          00:41:27       You know, as someone who is a maestro, it just flows out of them. So we looked at this with skill performance. Again, sort of a keyboard playing musicianship and you learn and you learn, you get better and let's see, but you type a sequence that take four, one, three, two, four, and people learn it, but they have these problem points throughout the sequence. They go four, one, three, two, four, four, one, three, two, four as if it's as a sticking point to the same thing with any skilled performance in an in athletics and it's the brain chunking things up. A very long motor sequence gets chunked up into small sort of digestible bites. It's a good way to begin learning, but it's not a way to create automaticity. At some point. What you have to do is stitch all of those things together and it just flows like a sentence, like a sentence.

Speaker 2:          00:42:14       Yeah, like a piano piece, like a, you know, a sequence of movements. If you've got, you know, in martial arts you've got. So what we found was that before sleep, you've got these big problem points, these gaps in your motor skill. Learning sleep does not necessarily improve the places where you're already good. Sleep is intelligent. It goes in, finds that problem, point, that friction point in your motor skill sort of deficit and it smooths it out. So you come back the next day and now it's just four, one, three, two, four, four, one, three, two, four, four, three. It's automaticity and it's exactly what you're describing, you know, speak to musicians. They'll say, I was playing, I just couldn't get that piece the night before. And then I came back the next day and I sat down and I could just play, sleeps doing its work. I've heard that too with problems and that's why people say sleep on it. Yeah. Yeah. You've never been told to stay awake on a problem,

Speaker 3:          00:43:10       right? I mean sometimes when you're about to go to bed, it's almost overwhelming. You just can't concentrate on anything else, but this problem, whatever it is. And then you go to sleep and you wake up in the morning like, Eh, that's all right.

Speaker 2:          00:43:22       Yeah, it's going to be fun. Yeah, I got it. I know what to do. And sleep. So there's lots of anecdotal evidence of sleep inspired creativity and now the shift to one of the benefits of dreaming, in fact, it's during dream sleep, when we take all of the information that we've previously learned and we start to collide it with all of the new information that we've learned. It's um, I mean it's a little bit like group therapy for memories, you know, everyone gets a name badge and you will get to speak to each other and the brain starts to seek out and test novel connections and new associations. So it's almost like informational alchemy and you wake up the next morning with a revised mind wide web that is now capable of dividing, you know, incredible solutions to previously impenetrable problems. And lots of anecdotes. You know, Dmitri Mendeleev came up with the periodic table of elements by way of dream in spite insight, you know, talk about a Herculean task. Take all of the elements in the known universe and figure out a structure as to how they all fit together. Off you go, his waking could not do

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       it. His sleeping brain solved the problem. And Einstein, by the way, this is Einstein was suggested to be a short sleeper and we don't know if that's true, but even if he was, he was a habitual Napa during the day. I've got some great pictures of him on his work bench and he used sleep ruthlessly as a tool for creativity and he would sit at his desk and he would have a sort of pad of paper and a pencil and he had a chair with arm rests and he would pick up two steel ball bearings and take a metal saucepan and turn it upside down, placed underneath the arm of the chair and put the tool, steel ball bearings in his hand and he would rest back and he would start to fall asleep and so we didn't fall too far into sleep. What would happen is at some point his muscle tone would relax.

Speaker 1:          00:45:25       They would release the steel ball bearings. They would crash on the Saucepan, wake him up, and then he would write down all of the creative ideas that he was. Half isn't the half really in no one day. Yeah. You're never told to sort of stay awake and a problem, and in every language that I've inquired about today, I'm French Swahili. That phrase, sleeping on a problem seems to exist, which must mean that this benefit of dream sleep transcends cultural boundaries. I should note. I think it's important that the French, the French translation is much closer to you. You sleep with a problem. We, the British, you say you sleep on a problem, the French, you say you sleep with a problem. I think it says so much about the romantic difference between the British and the French. You know the Fed is trying to fuck everything.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       Fuck their problems. No British passport, but I won't either. It's just a joke. That's fascinating that Einstein figured that out too, that he literally had like a, a whole routine that you had dropped this ball and hit it bearing and wake up and start writing like south will have to be in the room watching Einstein to that. It must have been fascinating. I'm sorry. I said Einstein. Edison. I'm an idiot at changes everything. That's probably the best medicine. A thief though. Didn't he steal everything from Tesla? I think there's an argument to be made, but I mean he has a lot to answer for by the way, in terms of the way that we're sleeping, you know, he electric, he was the first person to electrify society, not necessarily create the light bulb, but he really gave shifted us from a point where now we controlled the night in terms of illumination and we are a dark deprived society in this modern era and that's one of the things that are keeping us awake at night. A lack of darkness. You're not just that, but also our inability to see the stars anymore. The light pollution that we have at night. I think it's, I think it's a giant shift in perspective. Like, uh, have you ever, you ever been to a planetarium or. I'm an observatory, like one of those, uh, at night

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       there's a Keck observatory in Hawaii as a place I try to go to every year. And it's, it's really stunning because it's very high up. I think the observatory is somewhat somewhere more than 9,000 feet above sea level. And then I think you go even further and then they have the telescopes, but you go to visit our center and you go to the visitor center. They have some telescope set up, but it's huge actually drive through the clouds. So as you're driving up this mountain, we were bummed out. We're like, oh, it's cloudy. We might not be able to see anything. And then you drive through the clouds and then we need to get through the clouds. You're like, Holy Shit. And you feel like you're on a spaceship flying through space. And this is what our ancestors saw every night when they went to sleep with a clear sky, they saw all the stars.

Speaker 3:          00:48:17       They saw the full milky way like this. And the way the big island has set up, they use diffused lighting all over the island because of the Keck observatory. So you don't have the same level of light pollution that you have when you're in a normal city like Los Angeles, which is terrible. I mean the La, if you look up you see like one or two stars because everything's lit up. It's crazy bright that I think that perspective is, that's a giant factor in the way human beings look at their relationship with the universe, but I think that also just the light everywhere, constant light everywhere. It's got to be a big factor in why people sleep so little,

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       right? Yep. We know it is now. I mean, these studies have been done. The first part is the external light, which is, you know, street lighting, you know, even if you've got curtains that can still bleed through, but then when you come into the home, know the invasion of light into the home by way of technology has been a big problem. People are looking at their phones before they go to, well first of the year, I mean the incandescent light bulb sort of was the start of it and light bulbs can suppress a hormone that's called Melatonin is the hormone of darkness and it tells your brain when it's dark and when it's time to sleep, but then you add into that screen usage and they've done studies where, for example, um, you know, one hour of ipad reading versus just one hour of reading on a book, you know, in dim light, that one hour of ipad reading firstly delayed the release of this critical darkness hormone called Melatonin by about three hours. So if you read on your ipad for an hour here in California, your Melatonin peak is not going to arrive. I mean somewhere in Hawaii time, in fact, it's three hours delayed. Wow. It's 50 percent less in terms of its peak. And furthermore, you don't get the same amount of rem sleep and when you wake up the next morning, you don't feel refreshed or restored by your sleep. Those studies have been done to wow, what should someone do

Speaker 3:          00:50:14       if they have a hard time sleeping? Like say if you're a person who has insomnia, you have a hard time getting, getting to bed and you have a hard time staying asleep. When you wake up, you can't go back to bed. Are there other strategies?

Speaker 2:          00:50:26       There are. I mean, I think for most people that are five things that you can do just out the gate to get better sleep regularity is probably the most important thing I can tell you. Go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time, no matter whether it's the weekend. Weekday regularity is key. We've spoken about light. For example, when you in the last hour before bed, tried to stay away from screens but also just switch off half the lights in the house. You'd be surprised at how soporific that is. It really starts to sort of make you feel a bit more drowsy. They done some great studies where they would take people out into the rockies, no electric light, no electricity whatsoever, and they started to go to bed two hours earlier than the acclaimed natural bedtime wasn't just because they didn't have anything necessarily to do.

Speaker 2:          00:51:14       It was that their Melatonin was rising, you know, two hours earlier. So keep it dark. The third is probably keep it cool. Your brain actually needs to drop its temperature by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep. And that's the reason that you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot. I've seen people use cold pads. Casinos, are you sleep on these cold pads? What do you think of those? Yeah, I mean the evidence is pretty good that cooling the body actually works. They've, um, you know, in the book I write about a series of studies where they had people in it. It's almost like a wet suit, but it has all of these veins running through it. And they could actually perfuse warm or cold water into any part of the body, hands core of the body, feet, and so you could exquisitely manipulate the temperature of any part of the body and what they found is that they could effectively cool the body down and it instantaneously made people fall asleep faster and it gave them deeper, deep, non rem sleep, that sort of restorative sleep for the body so you can even look at studies where people sleep semi naked and that also seems to improve their sleep and they get a little bit more deep sleep too.

Speaker 2:          00:52:34       So cold is better. The paradox here though is that you need to warm your feet and your hands to kind of charm the blood away from your core out to the surface and radiate that heat. Really should go to sleep with socks and gloves on. Yeah. Or better. Still have a hot bath and evidence here to that. I discussed where people say, you know, I get out of a hot bath. I feel nice and toasty and relaxed and that's why I fall asleep. It's the opposite. When you get into a bath, you get vasodilation, all you sort of get rosy cheeks, red skin, all of the blood rushes to the surface. You get out of the bath and you have this massive thermal dump of heat that just evacuated from the body. Your core body temperature plummets, and that's why you sleep better, so you can hack the system very easily.

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       Wow. So your core body temperature plummets and that's what makes you sleep easier. Yeah, that sounds so counterintuitive, but it makes sense and it makes sense because that's how we were designed. If you look at hunter gatherer tribes whose way of life has not changed for thousands of years in you, how do they sleep? One of the things that seems to dictate the sleep is the rise and fall of temperature. Your temperature is at it's lowest in the Nadeer of the night, you know, three or four in the morning. And as that temperature that climate temperature starts to drop, that's when they start to get drowsy as if temperature is just sort of signaling to the brain. Now it's time to sleep. So light as well as temperature. Uh, two key triggers to help you get better sleep. If you look at those tribes, by the way, and when they go to sleep and they wake up, they go to sleep probably at two hours after dusk, sort of eight to nine in the evening, wake up about half an hour or even an hour before dawn.

Speaker 2:          00:54:25       It's the rise in temperature rather than light. That triggers their awakening. But there's a reason, you know, have you ever thought about what the term midnight actually means middle of the night and that's what it should be for all of us. But in modernity we've been dislocated from our natural rhythms and now midnight has become the time when we think I should check facebook last time, you know, I should send my last email. That wasn't. That is not how we were designed to sleep and in fact we may also be designed to sleep by physically too. If you look at those hunter gatherers, they don't sleep one long bout of eight hours at night. Yeah. I've heard this recently that people that you should have two sleeps. The idea of two sleeps. Yeah. It's actually a little different than the idea of to sleep, so there was a time in sort of the Dickensian era where people would sleep for the first half of the night, may be sort of four hours or so.

Speaker 2:          00:55:22       Then they would wake up, they would socialize, they would eat, they would make love, and then they would go back and have a second sleep. If you look at natural biological rhythms in the brain and the body, that doesn't really seem to be how we were designed. It certainly seems to be something that we did in society, but I think it's more of a societal trend than it was a biological edict. However, we do seem to have to sleep periods the way that we were designed. Those tribes will often sleep about six and a half hours, seven hours of sleep at night, and then especially in the summer, they'll have that Siesta like behavior in the afternoon and all of us have that sort of this what's called the postprandial dip in alertness just means after lunch and if I measure your brain wave activity with electrodes, I can see a drop in your physiological alertness somewhere between two to 4:00 PM in the afternoon, but it's that dependent on diet. It's not. People think it is. You know, especially after they've had a heavy lunch.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       You can actually just have people fast and sort of well fasting for long periods of time actually makes you sleep much worse, but you can have people abstain from lunch and you still get that drop, so it's independent food. It's a genetically hardwired, preprogrammed drop that suggest we should be sleeping by physically but does is that dependent upon their standard diet? Because if, if someone is on a carbohydrate, carbohydrate, rich diet, a lot of times you do get that spike and then you crash crash. What? When people are on low carb and high fat diets, they don't get that and they, they, they tend to be more even with their energy through the day. Yeah. So yeah, that sort of more constant release of energy can actually help you sort of almost combat that lo without lo exists no matter what exactly. So even if you don't think it exists, it's there.

Speaker 1:          00:57:08       It's still present. Interesting. So why did they do that and then the Dickens era, why did they, what is there a root cause of their double sleep thing? We don't know. I mean, it's hard to sort of really fascinating. Yeah, it's a, a trend. Yeah. That it was a movement. So they would just wake up and do things and yeah, maybe it's because they didn't have tv and what to do with themselves. Yeah, sounds like they did some pretty interesting things, which are nice, but yeah. Yeah. Well they created a lot of art then to write a lot of writing and a lot of fascinating stuff came out of that time. Now when you're, um, when you're measuring a people's health and when you're measuring people's health in regard to how much sleep they have, like what, how do you, how do you do that?

Speaker 1:          00:57:52       Do you just talk to people? Do you do surveys? Like how do you get like a detailed analysis of people's patterns so you can do it at many different levels. I mean we can start at the sort of gross high level, which is epidemiological studies across millions of people where you do surveys, you ask them about their sleep and then you look at health outcomes. The first thing from that data that's clear is an unfortunate truth. The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. Well, short sleep predict all caused mortality, which is really ironic because people that want to sleep less. I like, you know, I don't have a whole lot of time. You know, this life is short. Yeah. Fucking shorter if you sleep less. Yeah. That old maximum, you know, you can sleep when you're dead. Yeah. Well, it's mortally and wise advice because we know from the data you will be both dead sooner and the quality of that now shorter life will be significantly worse.

Speaker 1:          00:58:44       Yeah. That's counterintuitive to people. The idea that you need this, it's not just like you're making best use of time by sleeping less, you're not. You'd make best use of time by being awake less. Exactly. Which is crazy. I mean wakefulness firstly from a brain perspective is a low level of brain damage. We know that wakefulness is low. Like right now where you and I are getting low level brain damage. Yeah, that's right. I need sleep. That officer reparatory function. Wow. And, and you know, I'll give you one example, which is your risk for Alzheimer's disease, insufficient sleep across the lifespan now seems to be one of the most significant lifestyle factors. Determining

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       whether or not you'll develop Alzheimer's, what studies or if any have been done on people that work third shift. So people have looked at shift work in general. They haven't necessarily split it down to that granular point, but what we see is that shift workers have higher rates of obesity, high rates of diabetes, but perhaps most frighteningly cancer and in fact we now know the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is quite strong. Insufficient sleep is linked to cancer of the bowel, cancer of the prostate, cancer of the breast, and the association has become so powerful that recently the World Health Organization decided to classify any form of nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen. Wow. Yeah, so jobs that may induce cancer because of a disruption of your sleep wake rhythms.

Speaker 3:          01:00:11       Are there other correlating factors like don't people that sleep less or work into the night, don't they eat more,

Speaker 2:          01:00:18       more shitty food? They do both of those things. Yeah, and we know exactly the pathway, so there are two hormones that control your appetite and your weight. I'm one is called Leptin. The other is called Ghrelin and they sound like hobbits, but

Speaker 3:          01:00:33       they're not the real. They're real. The real chemicals. It's bizarre, but 10

Speaker 2:          01:00:38       is the chemical that tells your brain you're full, you're satiated. You don't want to eat anymore. Grelin does the opposite. It's the hunger hormone. It says you want to eat more, you're not satisfied with your food. If I take people in, these studies have been done. We've done some of these studies too, and you just put you a group of healthy people on four or five hours of sleep for let's see one week, and you look at those two hormones. They go and in fortunately opposite directions, so leptin that says you're full stop eating. That gets suppressed by lack of sleep. Ghrelin, the hunger hormone that gets ramped up. So first the people who are sleeping just five to six hours a night, will on average eat somewhere between 200 to 300 extra calories each day because of the under slept state. Add that up. It's about 70,000 extra calories a year.

Speaker 2:          01:01:32       It's about 10 to 15 pounds of obese mass each year. Which for me is starting to sound familiar. Um, but what we also know is that it's not just that when you're under slept, you eat more, you eat more of the wrong things. So if these great scientific work, if you give people this sort of finger buffet and they can eat whatever they want and it contains all of the different food groups and you sleep deprive them or you give them a full eight hours of sleep, yes, they start to overeat by somewhere around about 450 calories with total sleep deprivation, but what they go after is heavy hitting carbohydrates and simple sugars, processed food, and they stay away from the healthy sort of leafy Greens, nuts, proteins, etc. So you're not eating more, you're eating more of the wrong things and that's why a lack of sleep has such a strong obesogenic profile to it and you can take a step back to when you say, well, if you look at the rise of obesity of the past 70 years, it's just this upward exponential increase.

Speaker 2:          01:02:36       And if you plot on the Same graph, the amount of sleep that society is getting, it goes in the opposite direction. Asleep time is declined. Obesity rates have increased. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the obesity epidemic is simply a sleep problem. It's not, it's a problem of as being sedentary process foods, larger food, serving sizes. If you take those factors though by themselves, they cannot explain the increase in obesity. Other things are at play. Is sleep one of them now we know it is. It's a critical factor in the obesogenic, a epidemic.

Speaker 3:          01:03:11       I know from personal experience when I'm tired, I always gravitate towards the worst choices. It's for me, it's late night cheeseburgers, wednesdays at 2:00 in the morning or whatever. What happens if you get naps, like save. You only have five hours of sleep, but you take a two hour nap during the day. Does everything make up?

Speaker 2:          01:03:32       Yes and no. So what you're talking about there is what we call prophylactic napping, which has sort of strategically trying to help combat your deficiency of sleep. Naps can actually give you benefits. we've done some of these studies where they improve your learning, your memory, your alertness, your concentration, especially your emotional regulation to sleep is critical for emotional first aid and mental health. However, you can't keep using naps to self medicate, sort of short sleep. Have you know, four or five hours each night? Um, we know that the system itself, your, your brain has no capacity to regain all of the sleep, but it's lost. It will try to sleep back some of that debt. But what we've discovered, let's say I take you tonight, I deprive you of sleep eight hours last, then I give you all of the recovery sleep that you want on a second, third, or fourth night.

Speaker 2:          01:04:26       you will sleep longer, but you will only get back maybe just a three or four hours of that lost total eight. So sleep is not like the bank. You can't accumulate a debt and then hope to pay it off at the weekend. And so there is no credit system within the brain for sleep. You can't bank it, which is odd by the way. I would love that system, you know? Then you would know what road you would know, what you owed, but I could also just know when I'm going into a state of sleep debt and I could build up some credit and there's precedent for this. By the way, there is a system like that in the brain, it's called the fat cell because there were times during our evolutionary past where we faced famine and we faced feast and so the body learned to adapt to that and said, when you have store it up as caloric energy in these things called adipose cells, fat cells, and then when you go into famine, you can spend that caloric credit.

Speaker 2:          01:05:26       Where is that in the brain? Why don't we have that? The reason is very simple. Human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason. in other words, mother nature has never faced the challenge of coming up with a safety net for lack of sleep. We've never been forced to come up with that solution. That's why we get such demonstrably disease, sickness and impermanent. When you undergo a lack of sleep. So this is a recent occurrence and in human beings, is that what you're saying? Yeah, I mean the. The only time we see it in nature is when you go into conditions of starvation. The only way that you can get a species to sleep less and it's very, very difficult to do because sleep is just so essential is when you put them under conditions of extreme starvation there, they will forego some sleep to stay awake so that they forage in a larger sort of circumference area to try and find more food.

Speaker 2:          01:06:23       It's probably the reason that when people go into fasting there, sleep is so terrible because the brain is receiving this ancient trigger that you're going without food. You're in state of salvation. You need to stay awake and hunt for food. That's why your sleep gets so much worse when you're. When you're undergoing fasting. That's fascinating. I did not know that. So fasting is when you're talking about multiple day fast and you're not intermittent fasting and we don't know the evidence for intimate and fasting. So you know, if some people are doing sort of 12 hours, 14 hours, 16 hours, that that doesn't seem to be extreme enough to trigger a change in sleep. But if you fast for these long periods, you know, two days, three days, four days, you can really see some quite marked sleep fragmentation, sleepest, ask any of those people, they'll tell you.

Speaker 2:          01:07:11       That's fascinating because people always cite the health benefits of multiple day fast. Do you think that that's just like a placebo effect? Um, I mean, certainly we know that there are chemical pathways that when you go into fasting are activated that seem to be beneficial for health outcomes. There's a big literature on sort of fasting and aging with the mtor pathway, for example. But you know, we also know that as a species we're, we were not designed to have such terrible fragmented sleep. And we spoke about how sleep regulates your appetite. You know, if you're trying not to eat food and sort of control and manage your weight, the last thing that you probably want to do is be shortchanging yourself on sleep because it's only going to make you even more hungry and reach for sort of worse food. So I still think there's room for fasting in the equation, but I think was extreme fasts and the havoc that it plays on sleep, it's still yet to be understood. You've got to be very careful with playing around with anything going beyond sensible, you know, behavior. So what does it like? What is saved? You're going to fast for two days.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       What switches on that forces your body into this haphazard sleep program. So that's where that whole moon gruelling just kicks into high gear. That hormone that is just saying it's a starvation hormone at that point. It's not just a hunger hormone, you've gone over into starvation and that will promote a wa alertness. It promotes chemicals that try to keep you awake. Chemicals like dopamine to sort of force you wide awake. So it's forcing you to go hunter gather. That's right. Yeah. And this is even if your body goes into a state of ketosis that we don't know, people have not tried to correlate sort of, you know, the profile change in ketosis versus alterations in sleep. I actually think it would be fascinating, you know, maybe there's a peak where it's bad and then you sort of, you crest it and then things get better, you know, just the body acclimate to that.

Speaker 1:          01:09:08       I don't know, it's w we've never seen the body being able to sort of re engage with, you know, cognitive function with a dose of sleep deprivation that keeps going. So if I am, it's the tcp intern, take people and give them two weeks of seven hours of sleep, five hours of sleep, three hours of sleep or no sleep, you know, even by sort of seven days or even 14 days of six hours of sleep, your cognitive performance just nosedives like a dart into the ground and it doesn't show any signs of leveling off as if there is no asymptote that it could keep going. And by the way, people should know that after 20 hours of being awake, you are as impaired cognitively as you would be if you were legally drunk. Wow. WhAt about physical movement? Same thing. Yeah. Integrity of your alertness and reaction time.

Speaker 1:          01:09:59       But it's worse. And this is where, you know, drowsy driving comes in for every 30 seconds that we've been speaking, there has been a car accident linked to sleeplessness, drowsy driving, it seems kills more people on the roads than either alcohol or drugs combined. Whoa. Why are. Why are drowsy driving accident so deathly rail? Now I'm not endorsing those other things. Of course not, but let's just think about why that's the case. When you're under slept, you start to have what are called micro sleeps. Sometimes your eyelid does not close all the way. It just partially closes, but the brain essentially goes to sleep for just a very brief period of time. You can even see individual brain cells looks like they go to sleep during these micro sleeps. at that moment. If you're traveling in a vehicle on the freeway, you've got a one ton misael traveling at 65 miles an hour and no one is in control one time if you're lucky.

Speaker 1:          01:10:56       Yeah, yeah, exactly. Last time you saw a 2000 pound car, unless you have a miata. Yeah. Yeah. Or yeah, a mclaren p one. But you know, if you are, even though they're having a are they really shows my lack of knowledge despite living with them. You know, I think what happens here is that when with drugs and alcohol, it's often the case of a problem of later reaction with, with a lack of sleep. It's a problem of no reaction at all. So you're out of it so you're out of it. So rather than breaking too late, there's just no breaking whatsoever. That's my tip for people too. If you find yourself cole or tired and driving and you have to stay awake, take a either ice or ice cold water and put it in a wash cloth and then rub your face with it. It keeps you awake.

Speaker 1:          01:11:45       Works. Yeah, it works. I mean, if you're forced to drive for whatever reason, you have to, you know, you have 20 minutes to go and you're really exhausted. Do that, I guess is the best. Take a like a wet cloth. Put ice inside of it and just rub your face. It just wakes you right up for whatever reason. And it's, I mean, those statistics around driving, drowsy driving, you know, a frightening, and it's a weird thing when you're on the road, you're, there's something about those white lines that just want to put you to sleep. There's no other time where I feel more compelled to just conk out while I'm awake. Yet it's probably one of the greatest sedatives known to men. If that monotonous, you know, behavior. And the longer you go with that monotony, the worst things get. Um, you know, and if you look at, um, you know, teenagers, that's where we see some of the greatest impact of drowsy driving.

Speaker 1:          01:12:31       You know, it's the leading cause of death in most first world nations. Suicide is second. Um, wow. ThAt is crazy. It speaks to this, you know, this muddle of later school start times, they've done these studies. There was a great one that was done, I think in tenent county in Wyoming. They shifted their school start times from 7:35 in the morning to 8:55 in the morning, much more biologically reasonable fatigue ages. The only thing more impressive than the extra hour of sleep that those teenagers reported getting was the drop in vehicle accidents. There was a 70 percent reduction in car crashes the following year when they made that sentence zero, zero search. The advent of abs technology, for example, antilock brake systems that dropped accident rates by 20 to 25 percent. Some deemed it to be a revolution. Here's a simple biological factor. Sleep that will drop accident rates by 70 percent.

Speaker 1:          01:13:20       WOw. So I think if our goal as educators truly is to educate and we spoken about learning and memory and not risk lives in the process than we are failing our children in the most spectacular manner with this incessant model of early school start times. Why do we do that? Or not just really school times but early work times two. I was driving to the airport the other day at 6:00 AM, 6:00 AM, bumper to bumper traffic on the four, oh five. I was like, this is insane. Look at these poor fucks. What are we doing? and if you're in the car at 6:00 AM there, it means that you probably woke up, you know, five or 4:30 average school start times, you know, in the us, some of them, you know, seven, seven, 25 buses for school start time of seven, 25 will begin leaving at 5:30 in the morning.

Speaker 1:          01:14:08       That means that some kids are having to wake up at five, 15, 5:00, maybe even earlier. It's just lunacy. It is lunacy. Now, why did they do that? I mean, it's just a pattern that they've always done and they don't, they never corrected it again. It's a pen that actually has, has changed over the past 30 or 40 years. I mean, american schools used to go to. I'm used to start around 9:00 and it started to shift ever and ever earlier. Why I'm part of it is because of work times that parents had to get to work at ever earlier. Chart the kid. Yeah. And then bus unions and schools, they comply to that same timeframe as well. And it becomes very difficult, you know. And um, I don't mean to chest eyes, school systems or the bus unions, you know, it's an incredibly difficult logistics problem, but I have to think that, you know, what is our goal here, if our goal is to keep our kids safe and to get them well educated and get information into the brain and nurture them and create them to be the next generation early school, start times on not the thing to do.

Speaker 1:          01:15:11       Um, there's a lot of lazy kids out there. They're going, yes, well pre john, dr. Preach. I mean the data, you know, they looked at these academic things too, you know, one of these, another example comes from edina in Minnesota and they shifted school start times from a, I think it was seven slash 25 to 8:30 in the morning and they looked at sat scores and in the year before they made the time to change the top 10 percent performing students got an average sat score of 1,288, which is a great school. The following year when they were going to school now at 8:30 rather than 7:25, the average sat score was 1,500. That's a 212 point increase, which is nontrivial. Wow. That's gigantic. Yeah. Yeah. I just, yeah. I think it's the school time in correlation with the work time. Yeah. It's very difficult to get people off of that.

Speaker 1:          01:16:07       Yeah, and that's part of what, you know, modernity has done where we're working longer hours and also we're commuting for longer durations of time, so therefore people having to wake up earlier, they come home later and the one thing that gets squeezed sort of like vice grips is this thing called sleep, you know, and the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations as a consequences. Having a catastrophic impact on our health and our wellness and the safety and the education of our children. Silence. Sleepless epidemic. Wow. Now, other than I'm making the room cold and warming up your hands and your feet and things along those lines. What about diet? Is it or even time that you eat, is there a specific time before you go to bed that you should eat? How much time should you give yourself the digestive food? So the general advice right now is don't go to bed too full and don't go to bed too hungry again, if you're going to bed too hungry, you can get that sort of, that signal of I'm starting to go into low level sort of starvation and that can keep people awake at night.

Speaker 1:          01:17:15       Um, the evIdence in terms of diet composition and sleep is quite unclear. It's not particularly well researched area right now. What we do know is that diets that are high in sugar, and I'm sort of heavier starchy carbohydrates and low in fiber, those diets tend not to be good for sleep. You tend to have less deep sleep and your sleep is also more fragmented throughout the night. Um, so that's sort of right now the best advice. So usually several hours before you go to bed, but not five hours. That's right. Yeah, like two hours maybe. And it's different for different people and you will know it, you know, if you're sort of starting to wake up with really severe hunger pangs. What about supplements like melatonin supplements or things along those lines? Melatonin is efficacious. It's useful when you're traveling between time zones. So at that point, your body clock, your internal clock is out of sync with the actual real time in the new time zone.

Speaker 1:          01:18:16       And let's say I fly from los angeles over to london, back home. Um, you know, my melatonin spike is going to be eight hours in the past, you know, sort of back in time. It's not going to arrive with me for eight hours. So I can take some melatonin. I can fool my brain into thinking, oh my goodness, it's actually dark when, despite in California, it's still daylight once I've arrived through airport. so you can use melatonin strategically for jet lag once people however, are stable in a new time zone, melatonin does not seem to be efficacious for helping sleep. That said though, if people out there taking melatonin and they think it helps, I would tell them to keep taking it because the placebo effect is the most reliable effecting all of pharmacology. So if it works for you, no harm, no foul. He taking it interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:19:07       So, um, the people that take melatonin nightly, like this is what gets me to go to bed. Really. They're just playing a trick on their mind. Yeah. Unless you're an older individual where you're sort of 24 hour rhythm, it's called your circadian rhythm starts to get blunted in. It's not as strong anymore. That's where night nightly use of melatonin actually has been demonstrated to be efficacious. But if you're young, healthy and you're taking melatonin, it's unlikely that it's actually helping us sleep. That's probably the placebo. So it really should just be just for traveling. Yeah. Or weird situations where your sleep is interrupted. That's right. And you need to kick it into gear, bring it back on. So it's almost like a heck yeah, it's definitely, you know, that's one way that you can check. Like, I mean, there's no cure for jet lag, but there's actually lots of ways that you can hack jetlag. Are there any other vitamins or nutrients or particular foods that enhanced the sleepy effect? There was always thing about trip to fan. Everybody thought the trip to fan was in Turkey. What I read was that was bullshit and what was really good

Speaker 3:          01:20:13       going on was that you just ate a gigantic meal and it's filled with stuffing and mashed potatoes and all those carbohydrates. Kashi

Speaker 1:          01:20:20       crash, and it's usually the time. Then everyone goes back through into sort of the living room. You lie down. Most people are chronically sleep deprived, right? Finally you get the opportunity to sort of just relaxed and no one's doing anything because there's no plans. What do, what do you think the numbers are? Sleep deprived people in this country. So we know those numbers. Actually, I'm almost one out of every two adults in America and not getting the recommended eight hours of sleep. Almost one out of every three people that you pass on the sleep, uh, on the street or trying to survive on six hours of or less of sleep. Um, back in 1942, gallup did a poll and what they found was that the average american adult was sleeping seven point nine hours of sleep a night. Now that number or most recently is down to six hours and 31 minutes for the average adult during the week in America. That's the average, by the way, that means that there's a huge swath of people well below that average. Now, what about the people that say that they sleep, they go to bed, they sleep five hours, they wake up, they feel great. Yeah. So bullshit. Um, we have the number of people who can survive on six hours of sleep or less without showing any impermanent, rounded to a whole number and expressed as a percent of the population is zero.

Speaker 3:          01:21:39       Wow. Yeah. Wow. Zero.

Speaker 1:          01:21:44       And one of the big problems with the lack of sleep, by the way, is that you don't know your sleep deprived when you're sleep deprived. So your subjectIve sense of how well you're doing with a lack of sleep is a miserable predictor of objectively how you're doing. so it's like, yeah, especially. Yeah. Perfect example. You know, you're at the bar, you've had six or seven. I can drive home, I'm fine. And your response is, I know that you think you'll find strive subjectively objectively, trust me you're not. It's the same way with sleep deprivation.

Speaker 3:          01:22:14       That's fascinating. So, but you're not drunk, so even though you're impaired, you don't feel like you're impaired and you probably have a couple of espresso or have one of these caveman coffee, you feel fine, right? You get juiced up, you're ready to go and you're trying to accomplish things. You're trying to succeed, right? You're trying to get ahead in his life. I don't need to sleep.

Speaker 1:          01:22:38       And it's, you know, that's completely counter intuitive why it's on the data. We know that people are more productive and they've. We've seen some of these studies in the workplace where you look firstly, under slept employees will take on fewer work challenges overall. They ended up taking the the simple ones like listening to voice messages rather than actually digging into deep project work. They produce fewer creative solutions to challenges that you give them. They also slack off when they're working in groups. It's called social loafing, where they just ride the coattails of other people's hard work. The less sleep that you have, the more willing that you just sort of don't pull your weight. Furthermore, it goes all the way up to the top, so the moral, less sleep that a business leader has had from one night to the next, the more or less charismatic that employees will rate that business leader.

Speaker 1:          01:23:29       Despite them knowing nothing about the sleep of that ceo, it's evident in their behavior more because they're short with the, you know, they're, they're short with their temper or they're quicker to get upset about things or less charismatic and social with their conversations. They're just, okay, I got it. I gOt it. I got it to work for. Yeah. I'm so less than does not equal more productivity. And it's always struck me as strange, you know, why do we sort of overvalue employees that undervalue sleep and if you look at your workforce, you know, trust me, everyone's going to be looking busy, but it's like stationary bikes, everyone's looking like they're working hard, but there's no forward progress. The scenery never changes. That's what an under slept it workforce will be for you. Now, what about the amount of time that people spend at work? I mean, I know this is not related to to sleep, but I've always felt like people weren't too much.

Speaker 1:          01:24:25       I feel like you probably could get more done with lesS time there. Yeah. So efficiency is what we're talking about. Again, that's another one of those things with sleep deprivation and I think many people when they haven't had a good nights of sleep that, you know, they're looking at this report and they realized I've just read this paragraph the third time and I still can't quite get it as you had scrambled efficiency productivity. But I would feel like, um, when people are working eight hours a day, I don't think that you could work at peak capacity for eight hours at least I don't think the average person can and you can't sustain that. So you're, you're kInd of bleeding these people. You're getting blood out of a rock in the last couple of hours and it's. Yeah. And it's not, you know, either a creative way to work in creativity, you know, it's supposed to be the engine of know business, uh, and ingenuity.

Speaker 1:          01:25:14       But why would you, you know, take twice the amount of time to boil up, you know, a pot of water on half heat when you could do it in half the time if you just put it on high. Well that sleep, you know, it's interesting though, there are certain writers who use sleep deprivation as a strategy for creativity. They literally don't start like the writers for the sitcom I was on news radio, they wouldn't start writing until like two, three in the morning. They would just play video games and fuck around. And then late at night they would really start writing. And they would ride until like seven in the morning. They would be, they would stumble into the set like barefoot delirious hair, all fucked up with hilarious scripts. And it's like they had used being silly and overtired as a strategy almost like they were doing drugs but they weren't doing any drugs.

Speaker 1:          01:26:02       I mean it comes to, well we didn't, we don't know in that scenario, you know, it hasn't been sleep. But what we have found, at least in in our scientific studies, is that that prefrontal cortex region that we spoke about before, that sort of rational, logical part of the brain, that's one of the first things to go when you're sleep deprived. So that area of the brain just gets sort of switched off. The more that you are sort of lacking in your sleep and emotional deep emotional centers of the brain, which are normally controlled and kept in check by that prefrontal cortex. They just erupt In terms of their activity. So you're all emotional gas pedal in two little regulatory control break, which for the most part very bad. But you know, one possibility is that if you want to try and get a little bit sort of, you know, crazy loosey goosey, you know, maybe that's not bad for that type of sort of comedic writing that you know, you become a bit more childlike and I say that affectionately because the last part of the brain to mature in development is the prefrontal cortex.

Speaker 1:          01:27:05       So you revert back to almost a more childlike state. But I wouldn't, I honestly would not condone that sort of undergoing sleep just based on the mortality and you know, risk of alzheimer's and cancer by itself. You just don't want to keep. Even in short doses, like you're a couple days a week. Like here's the, if, if sleep is not a renewable resource, lIke what is the effect of say if you have three nights a week where you sleep eight hours and then the next night, two hours, and then the next night, eight hours, how much of a bump or how much of a dip does that two hours give you and your overall health? It's bad, it's bad. So I'll give you two examples that there was a study where they took individuals and they just gave them four hours of sleep for one night and what they saw was a 70 percent reduction in critical anticancer fighting immune cells called natural killer cells.

Speaker 1:          01:27:57       These are wonderful immune assassins that target malignant cells. So today, both you and I have produced cancer cells in our body. what prevents those cancer cells from becoming the disease that we call cancer is impart these natural killer cells and after one night or four hours of sleep, that is a remarkable state of immune deficiency and that's one of the reasons why insufficient sleep predicts cancer. I could also speak about your cardiovascular system though. An all it takes is one hour because there is a global experiment that's performed on one point 6 billion people across 70 countries twice a year and it's called daylight savings time. Now in the spring when we lose an hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24 percent increase in heart attacks. What in the fall? In the autumn, when we gain an hour sleep, there's a 21 percent decrease in heart attacks, so it's bi directional. That's how fragile and vulnerable your body is to even just the smallest perturbation of sleep. An hour one hour is insane.

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       Yeah. wow. That is. You're blowing my fucking mind. It's funny. I mean you can go even further by the way. Wow. Insufficient sleep will even erode the very fabric of biological life itself. Your dna code. So In one study they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them to six hours of sleep for one week and they compared to the profile of gene activity relative to when those same people were getting eight hours of sleep and there were two critical results. The first was that a sizable 711 genes were distorted in their activity caused by one week of six hours of sleep, which is highly relevant by the way because we know that many people are trying to survive on six hours of sleep during the week. Wow. The second. Sorry. No, please go. I was going to say the second sort of perhaps more interesting result was that about half of those genes we're actually increasing their activity. The other half were actually suppressed. Those genes that were switched off by six hours of sleep for one week. What genes related to your immune response? Many of them. So you become immune deficient. Those genes that were increased or what we call overexpressed with genes that were related to the promotion of tumors, genes that were related to longterm chronic inflammation within the body and genes that were associated with stress and as a consequence, cardiovascular disease.

Speaker 3:          01:30:28       This is unbelievable. You know, it's really disturbing to me. I'm in my youth from age probably. I guess I was probably 18 when I started. I delivered newspapers. I used to drive around and throw newspapers out of my car and I did it for years and uh, I would have to be up at 5:00 every morning and, uh, I never, never went to bed early. Yeah, ever. And I worked 365 days a year. How old were you, by the way? I think I started when I was 18. I might've been 17 whenever I started driving. Well I drove at 16, but I don't think I started right away delivering newspapers, but it was trying to find a, a good part time job. I think I was either in my senior year of high school or after I think right after my senior year of high school, so I was probably 18. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:31:19       And the reason I ask by the way is because as you go through into their sort of latest stages of adolescent sensitive early adulthood, your biological rhythm moves forWard in time. So you want to go to bed later and wake up later. so even if you went to bed sort of conscientiously at that time, at the seed, like 10:00 or 9:00, you wouldn't be able to sleep because it's biologically impossible.

Speaker 3:          01:31:38       Yeah, no, I didn't sleep. And then on saturday, even worse one day a week, saturday night, I'd have to get up at three or four in the morning because I had to deliver sunday papers in the sunday. Papers were enormous and so I had a pack of van filled with site 350 people that are delivered papers too, so I'd have to do multiple trips so I'd start work [inaudible]. I'd start delivering somewhere around 4:35 depending on when the paper's got in and I was done by like nine, nine, 30 and then I tried to crash, but I was a wreck. I mean, and it, it fucked me up for years. For years I did that and I stop and think about that. Now I'm listening to you listening to this conversation, like what kind of fucking damaged that I do to myself over those years.

Speaker 1:          01:32:23       Yeah. I Will tell you about the stuff with outside mr hannon, lloyd protein and I feel okay now and it's been. It's been several decades. Did I mentioned that your subjective sense of how well you're doing with insufficient sleep isn't. No, no. Wow. I'm sure you did. And I'm sure that there's a factor there. Um, what's stunning to me is that

Speaker 3:          01:32:41       sours is so detrimental. I would've thought that had been fine for six hours is good. Like you get six hours ads. Good. That's normal for me. Like six hours is normal. Like literally the minimum is seven.

Speaker 1:          01:32:53       Yeah. Seven to nine hours of sleep. Seven you need anything under seven is bullshit. Yep. for the, for the average there is, there is a small fraction of one percent of the population that has a special gene that allows them to survive on about five hours of sleep. Um, and most people when I tell them this, they say, oh, I have that. I'm one of those people. The chances of you being, you know, you're much more likely, for example, to be struck by lightning in your lifetime, the of which I think about one in $12,500. Then you also have this incredibly rare gene that means you can survive on something around five hours of sleep. Really? And what is the gene? Well, it's a gene that seems to promote sort of, again, wakefulness, chemistry within the brain that allows you to sort of maintain wakefulness in a more sustained way.

Speaker 1:          01:33:46       Um, and so we're only trying to understand right now what the actual biochemical mechanisms are of in terms of the consequences of that gene, that gene mutation. Um, but certainly it seems to exist that there are some of those, quote unquote short sleepers by the way, you know, we hear if these business leaders, and even actually heads of state, I'm not going to name any names but I'll give you right now, but I'll give you two examples of the past. Margaret thatcher and ronald reagan both were vociferouslY in the statement and their declaration of how little sleep that they would get. Both of them said four or five hours a night. And I think in part it was to paint this heroic ironclad status. Um, many people would say to me, you don't know margaret thatcher lifetime, well, sadly and tragically fascia and reagan both ended up getting alzheimer's disease.

Speaker 1:          01:34:36       You know, and we now know because of its during deep sleep at night that there is a sewage system in the brain that kicks into high gear. And it cleanses the brain of all of the metabolic toxins that have been built up throughout the day. This low level brain damage, one of those toxic sticky proteins that builds up whilst we're awake is called beta amyloid beta amyloid is one of the leading causes of underlying the mechanism of alzheimer's disease. So the less sleep that you're having across the lifespan, the more of that toxic amyloid is building up night after night, year after year. And I don't think it's coincidental that both of them ended up progressing into tragically into a state of alzheimer's disease. So it's good night's sleep clean in that way. In terms of, uh, of deep sleep, that's critical.

Speaker 3:          01:35:24       That is stunning. Um, are there anything, is there anything you can do in terms of how you eat or supplements you can take that could potentially at least somewhat mitigate the effects of having no sleep?

Speaker 1:          01:35:37       We haven't found any good counter measures. Have you tried diet pills? So, um, people have tried things like a fog or in the academy, amphetamines, you know, I mean, caffeine has been used strategically by the military for years and caffeine can help you get over the basic reduction in your alertness. So basic response times you can, you can dose with caffeine and still maintain some degree of a fast response under conditions of sleep deprivation. What about provigil or nuvigil? You started modafinil is sort of the underlying chemical there and debated who actually came up with. It may have been the french military who actually ended up being the generators of that. That seems to work through a pathway, at least right now as we understand it for a chemical called dopamine, and dopamine is principally known as pleasure drug. It's the chemical that a lot of drugs of abuse will target to sort of ramp up, but it also is a basic alertness drug that when you get an increase in dopamine, you tend to actually get an increase in your alertness and your wakefulness. Don't you get an increase in happiness as well? You can too, although modafinil tends to come with the alertness component of that equation and less so with the euphoria. That's why it has a lower prevalence of sort of addiction and abuse.

Speaker 3:          01:36:57       Well, I know a lot of people who are, I woulDn't say they abuse it, but they say they have to use it. Like all the doctor says, the doctor says I got to use it. I'm always suspicious because they seem pretty normal other than the fact that they, they're exhausted if they don't take this with what's essentially a stimulant. I've taken it a few times. I've taken it when, uh, I have to drive like long periods of time. Like I'm driving from san diego to California or to los angeles and maybe I have a gig my gigs done at like 1130. I know I'm going to be on the road late at night. I might take one and it's fine, but it gives you this weird feeling. It's a weird state and I know all. Lot of tech people. Yep. A lot of silicon valley is on this stuff and they pop it like candy. So much so that tim ferriss, when he was writing his book, the four hour body, he didn't want to include it and didn't want include this particular drug because he felt like people were just going to eat it all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:37:53       Yeah, I mean it's throughout student populations. Study drug as well as adderall. Yeah. As an adult, you know, and one of the interesting things is that if you look at the, the profile of what sleep deprivation is cognitively, you know, reduced alertness, impulsivity, lack of ability to concentrate, difficulties with learning and memory difficulties with behavioral problems. If I were to describe those features to a pediatrician and say, what disorder is this? ProbablY say it's, it's adhd, yes, but what we now know is that there is some portion of children out there who are diagnosed with adhd who either won or just under slept or to actually have sleep disordered breathing because of perhaps tonsil problems where they're not getting sufficient sleep. And when you treat the Sleep disorder, when you do a sort of, you know, remove the tonsils and they start sleeping normally and the adhd disappears.

Speaker 1:          01:38:49       So there is an issue here I think within that sort of the explosion of adhd, not all people are, you know, sort of privy to this sort of sleep problem simply masquerading as adhd. Some people are the, one of the other problems too though, is that adhd kids tend not to sleep very well and what we ended up giving them is a drug that is a stimulant which will combat sleep and fight back against sleep. So I think we need to have a bit more of a strategic approach is to when we think about at least the dose of that medication in terms of when sleep should be x sort of expected during the day because you know, taking it in the middle of the day in the evening or if it's a stimulant, it's wake promoting drug need to be very careful to sleep. As part of that.

Speaker 1:          01:39:33       It was terrifying because I don't know if the people that are prescribing these things have the sort of deep education and sleep and the necessity of it that you do. They don't and you know, it's not their fault either. You know. In fact, I've started to try and lobby doctors to start prescribing sleep and don't make the mistake that that's me suggesting, you know, prescribing sleeping pills that's a separate, straight sleeping pills are associated with significantly higher risk of death and cancer. And I'm happy to speak about that too. It was the one chapter in the book that I think the, um, the legal team of my publisher took, took a very long, long look at. But I think doctors come back to your point, they on average only have about two hours of sleep education in the medical curriculum. So 1:32 hours, two hours, one third of this podcast has been two hours.

Speaker 1:          01:40:23       Yeah, that's fucking crazy. Isn't that frightening? That's terrifying. And I bet you probably have laid things out better in this podcast then you would get in those two hours of education. I, I don't know about that, but I'll give you that credit if they could, if they could increase that, you know, I'm desperately appealing for this, you know, it's a third of their patient's life, but they only get two hours of education. But the other problem is the medical industry itself, by the way, you know that residents that data, you know, junior residents working a 30 hour shift of 460 percent more likely to make diagnostic errors in the intensive care unit relative to when they're working 16 hours. If you have elective surgery, you should ask your surgeon how much sleep they've had in the past 24 hours. If they've had six hours of sleep or less, you have a 170 percent increased risk of a major surgical error such as sort of organ damage or hemorrhaging relative to that same surgeon if they had been well rested.

Speaker 1:          01:41:26       And then the irony here by the way, is that when a resident finishes, a 30 hour shift, gets back into their car to drive home, there is a 168 percent increase risk that they will get into a car accident because of the under state being ending up back in the same emergency room where they just came from. but now as a patient from a car crash, you know, it's. We need to radically rethink the importance of sleep in education in, in business, in the workplace, and in medicine too. Why do they do that to residents? It's a fascinating story. Um, so there's, there's a chapter, I'm in the book on this too. It's a guy called william halsted and he set up the first resident surgical program in the United States at johns hopkins university, and he was known for being able to stay awake for these heroic lengths of time, days on end.

Speaker 1:          01:42:20       It was iNcredible, like superhuman strength. Turns out that in later years after he died, there was a dirty secret that he was actually a cocaine addict, that son of a bitch. And here's what happened. It wasn't his fault. Yeah. Alien is Korea. He was examining the anesthetic capacities of cocaine. So, you know, if I'm not going to save, you know, you may have heard from a perhaps colleagues that when you snort cocaine, you get a numb face. The reason is because it's, it blocks nerves from colleagues. My colleagues have told me I've actually never done cocaine out of. I've known quite a few people who have and they will, you know, they'll have their sort of numbness. It's the reason is because cocaine is also a nerve blocking agents like lighter cane lidacain. Exactly. Talked about this yesterday, ironically on the podcast and about doctors becoming drug addicts.

Speaker 1:          01:43:15       The initial doctor started doing lidacain. Hosted was he became an accidental cocaine addict. Wow. And then for days and he was up for days and he structured a program where he expected his residence to match him to go toe to toe with them. But yeah, it sounds like what a cokehead would do. Come on and stay aWay. Unbelievable. And I think the story was that he actually knew that there was a problem. He went to rehabilitation, checked in under a different surname and one part of the regiment for him coming off cocaine was to prescribe morphine. And at the end of the rehabilitation program he came out with both the cocaine addiction and heroin addiction. And so now there's rumors that he would get his shirts laundered in paris, in France, and you know, they would come back and it wasn't just the white starched shirts that, that were in the box that we were other whites substances too.

Speaker 1:          01:44:16       But that's, you know, you ask a great question, where did that come from? Where's that history? The legacy seems to date back to william halsted, who is an accidental cocaine addict. And the, we then maintained that inhumane practice in medicine, which is so critical to be awake and aware and to be sharp. You're cutting people open, you're operating on people. And think back to what we said about being awake, you know, you would never accept treatment from a doctor who started, you know, looking at your child who's sick with an appendicitis at 3:00 AM in the morning, who then switched some whiskey and says, yeah, I'm going to do the operations fine. You would, you'd go ballistic. Well, why do we accept treatment after 20 hours of being awake? Your as empowered as you would be if you were legally drunk. So unfortunately we placed young residents in this position of acting and operating and decision making under conditions of insufficient sleep.

Speaker 1:          01:45:13       One in five medical residents will make a serious medical errors due to insufficient sleep wanting 20 medical residents will kill a patient because of a fatigue related error. One in 20. That's crazy right now. You know there are well over 20,000 medical residents. If you have 100 of them. Five were going to kill people. Accidental deaths. Think about that number. That's insane. If we were to solve the sleep loss epidemic in medicine, you know, we could start saving lives and I don't know what it is. Is it just a, you know, an old boys network where we used to. Well we went through it. Yes. So you've got to go through it, you know, and the data now is so prolific, you know, I write to all about that and try to make a builder an evidence based, you know, emotional, emotionless, cold case for sleep in medicine, asleep prescription for medicine as it were.

Speaker 1:          01:46:03       Or most people don't realize the requirements of residents have no. And they are, they are literally, you know, beyond human capacity thinking that hubris and some degree of hours on the job is going to be able to allow you to sort of cut short what took three and a half million years to sort of, you know, get in place which is an eight hour night of sleep that's just thick headed, you know, it's, and I think the medical profession, it maybe at the stage where it's my mind is made up. Don't confuse me with the facts. Wow. That, that this has blown me away. I just don't understand how the very people that are working on the health of patients and fixing

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       them and repairing injuries and taking care of diseases, those are the people that are ignoring one of the primary factors of disease and errors and cognitive function impairment. It's a travesty. I have a friend who's an ophthalmologist and he tells a story about during his residency, he was, is back in the eighties and he had a pager. He was on the toilet with a tray of food on his lap because he didn't have time to eat and go to the bathroom, so it was eating food and he fell asleep and then his pager went off and he's like, fuck my life.

Speaker 2:          01:47:27       How many warnings, how many warning bells do you need to tell you that you're in a military state with your trousers around your ankles, with food or via face, and yet you're in the deepest stages of non rem sleep and he's the guy who was working on people's eyes. Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah. I mean, you know, sleep is equally absent for the patient in the hospital setting. We know that somewhere between 50 to 70 percent of all icu alarms are either unnecessary or ignore rubble, know, and the one place where you desperately need the swiss army knife of health. That is a good night of sleep is the one place where you get at least, which is on a hospital ward. We could. We could exit people out of hospital beds earlier. The data is already there. For the neonatal intensive care unit, they used to leave bright lights on 24 slash seven, and that would prevent sort of the signaling for sleep and wake and sleep and wake, and that cycle is critical if you regularize sleep, sorry.

Speaker 2:          01:48:29       If you regularize the light in the neonatal intensive care unit, those infants ended up having high levels of oxygen saturation because they were sleeping better, their weight gain was dramatically increased, and they ended up exiting the neonatal intensive care unit five weeks earlier. Whoa, simple things. You know, why don't we do something like this in medicine? When you come in onto a hospital ward, you get this on an international flight, travel for free, earplugs, facemask, even just that by itself could help people to start, get better sleep. Next on the hospital admission form, tell me when you normally go to sleep and when you normally wake up and to the best of our ability, we as doctors will try to sort of manage your health care around your natural sleep tendencies. If we could do that, you know, sleep is is the elixir of life. It is the most widely available democratic and powerful healthcare system I could ever possibly imagine. Why aren't we leveraging that and taking it? That's one of the greatest hacks that medicine could actually, you know, inflect a stunning.

Speaker 3:          01:49:37       How is this being received by doctors? Are they reluctant to listen to you? I mean, what, what, what is happening with all this data and you're, you're passionate cry for extra

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       sleep or more sleep or the proper sleep, I should say it's starting to happen. I mean, when the book came out, which is sort of the hub that came back, I was in back in october and, and some people started to give push back sort of in the medicine realm. You know, there was some concerns about continuity of care that if you keep switching residents out every 16 hours, that you wouldn't have continuous patient care. And tHat was a problem. Um, well there are other medical training systems. For example, France, Sweden, New Zealand, they do this all the time. They do not allow their residents to undergo anything along the, neither of 14 or a 16 hour shift. They train their residents in the same amount of time or less, and if you look at the rankings of their medical health systems around the world, they rank far higher than the United States, so you can't tell me that longer work hours for residents, for example, unnecessary to train good doctors.

Speaker 2:          01:50:45       The evidence just isn't supportive, so I've had some pushback there, but for the most part I think people are receptive once they know the information and I think I'm the. I've been someone who's been to blame here. I've known this evidence for, you know, I've been doing sleep research now for 20 or so years. We are with sleep where we were with smoking 50 years ago. We had all of the evidence about the deathly cost magenic cardiovascular disease issues, but the public had not been a word. No one had adequately communicated the science of smoking to the public. The same I think is true for sleep right now. That's part of the motivation for why I wrote the book, why I've been doing or trying to do a lot of publicity. I'm a very shy person and I don't like being in the spotlight, but I feel as though there is a mission that whose voice has not been actually gifted yet and I wanted to try and help him be a sort of asleep diplomat.

Speaker 2:          01:51:40       I mean that's why I chose the handle on social media, trying to be there as an ambassador for sleep and now once people start to understand the science as we've spoken about for two hours, then people start to actually realize it's not the third pillar of good health alongside diet and exercise. It's the foundation on which those two are the things said, you know, for example, if you're dieting but you're not getting sufficient sleep, 70 percent of all the weight that you lose will come from lean body, mass, muscle and not fat. Your body becomes stingy in giving up its fat when it's under slept, so once you get this information out there, things are starting to change. I've started to have some discussions with the world health organization. They seem to be very interested now in getting, getting to grips with sleep. I'd, I'd love to speak to first world governments tHere.

Speaker 2:          01:52:29       When was the last time you saw any first world nation have a government supported public health campaign around sleep? I don't know any. We've had them for drink driving for risky behaviors, for drugs, for alcohol, for healthy eating. Sleep should be a part of that equation. You know, I want to lobby governments to start to instigate this and it will save them millions of dollars. The rand corporation did an independent survey two years ago on the demonstrably cost of a lack of sleep to global economies. What they found was that a lack of sleep cost most nations, about two percent of their gdp, the gross domestic product here in America, that number was $411,000,000,000 caused by insufficient sleep. Solve the sleepless epidemic. You could almost double the budget for education and you could almost half the deficit for healthcare. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:53:24       What studies, if any, have been done on people who live in the northern hemisphere where they experienced these long days like Alaska and

Speaker 2:          01:53:34       places like that. It's really tough for the regulation of the circadian rhythm and what they. A lot of people, they're not all, but a lot of people will suffer from what's called seasonal affective disorder, which is the winter blues. Yeah, and you. It's an unfortunate acronym. Sad. Dr. Doctor comes along and you say, look, I'm not feeling good. It's the wintertime. Well, you're sad. No, no, no, I'm sorry. It's a medical term. It's got sad seasonal. If it's called seasonal affective disorder, and that data is quite powerful too, and you end up having to use melatonin strategically to help you fall asleep to sort of signal darkness in the summertime when it's really liked or almost all day and then in the wintertime you reverse engineer the trick and in the morning you sit and you have your breakfast or you're working at your terminal and you have one of these big light boxes that sits next to you. Strong looks power light to try and sort of fool your brain into thinking that you're getting a lot of daylight when it's, you know, it's not going to be light for the next four hours.
