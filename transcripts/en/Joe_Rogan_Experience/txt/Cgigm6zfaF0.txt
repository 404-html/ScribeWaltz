Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Started the recording, started to broadcast. What the Fuck Ladies and gentlemen. See it doesn't show that it started but I know it has. I know, but you got to like refresh it and shit. He usually takes a couple of seconds. That will do it. It's bullshit son. Ladies and gentlemen. That's me. There you go. Every time we do this, I could have sworn I muted it this time. You know when you do it by yourself, you don't do it. You catch yourself. Yeah. Maybe I'm going to distract you. You do not. No, no, no, no. Don't make me make fun of you.

Speaker 1:          00:00:37       You stop. Alright. This mother fucker and his God damn ipad. Fucking love it. Listen, Ladies and gentlemen, it's a little gay but if it's good enough for the Romans, that's good enough for the Greeks. Look at you. I got an ipad even though I said I wasn't going to get one for you to get one. Like walked by, said you guys got in them bitches. St Guys said yes. And I said okay, let's go first day. It's kind of interesting. You know, what I am interested in is what's going gonna happen with these things, like what are these things eventually gonna, eventually these things are going to be able to control your house and Shit. You know, you could already do that. And if the dragon naturally speaking, is any good on this. Do you know it? This.

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       It's alright. It's alright if you have a headphone microphone thing plugged in to it. I tried to do it like in a loud room in it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       Well I got to write a book now and uh, I just signed a deal. So it's fucking official. I'm in the middle of writing this thing and I'm thinking, God damn, it takes a long time to write shit. It might be easier to just talk it out, but I don't think that stuff is any good. Now. Some of the people told me that I'm a voice recognition software is really good on pcs, but I'm not quite there on the Mac yet. Have you heard of?

Speaker 2:          00:01:50       I didn't miss that because one of the best ones on the PC is dragon naturally speaking. So it's the same technologies the same. Everything's the same, so there shouldn't be a difference,

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       but it's not the same version because it's a unix based for the Mac operating system. Ryan is totally different. It's like a different version.

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       It's the same programming language. It's just, it's, I mean it's, it's, you know, it's like a xbox and ps three. I mean it's the same tech. The programming is the same. It's just two different ways.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Is that true? Ladies and gentlemen, did it maybe you wizards out there and know whether or not he's speaking the truth because, uh, I believe Brian, but I also believe that Brian did not know the answer.

Speaker 2:          00:02:26       Well, it's just like I barely used dragon so I could be wrong. I'm not a huge dragon nerd, but to me it makes sense that if a company makes that kind of software, it would be the same on pc and Mac and might have to get there a different way, but the actual brains of the software would be the same.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       The same program. There's something about actually writing things too. That's better than speaking it and writing it because like when I write something, if I write a blog, I don't type that fast, so if I'm writing something, each word that I'm thinking about, I'm writing really dwelling on it. The other words that come

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       after it now, that's why one of the things people are always really impressed about is the ability to speak without stammering and that have something to say. I mean that's the reason why Obama got elected really is because not just because he's black, but because he's black and he's just really good speaker, you know, he's really good at talking and there is an art form to that. It's a management of your, the ability to recognize like what you're gonna say next and the inflection you're gonna use and preparation and all that shit. It's, it's, it's, uh, there's an art to it, but, you know, it's more interesting. Usually when I read things that people wrote and they actually wrote it, they sat down and they really thought about how this is going to be absorbed. You know, there's a craft, there's a craft to both, but there's a real craft to writing, you know, actual writing itself. I really appreciate it when I read good writers, don't you?

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       Yeah, I, you know, I don't read that much, but the few books that I choose, I pick out certain things I want to read this. I read all day on the Internet when it comes to a book. I'm like, all right, I've read so much today I don't need to read anymore, you know, type thing. So I've actually been reading less books ever since the Internet kind of grabbed, grabbed me, I've noticed.

Speaker 3:          00:04:07       Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:04:09       Last good book I read was a book called early bird. Highly recommended though. It's about a guy that used to write for, I think letterman and he retired. This is real, a real guy. And he retired and he went to Florida and lived in a retirement home and he documented his life inside a retirement home being retired at the age of 35. It was one of the funniest books. It's weird how they, the retirement village is like high school. You know, there's like the popular old people and they have like their cliques and stuff like that and it's so weird. You kind of go back to that,

Speaker 3:          00:04:38       that old school thing. That's hilarious. Early bird. Yeah. People are like that man. They like that no matter what, they're like that if they're 80, they're like that. If there were 180 for, you know, we're monkeys, man. We have a whole bunch of instincts that we follow that uh, really are directly attributable to our time in the jungle, you know? I mean, that's what I've said about human beings, that there's something fucked up about us where we need. You're distracting the shit out of me with that thing, son. Let's not be fucking browsing online. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       Tom was actually seeing if we could get our live show on the IPAD.

Speaker 3:          00:05:09       Oh, doing it live. So watched new fucking move. Know. Don't sit behind me because then I can't talk to you. I'm going to turn like this. My neck hurts from Jujitsu. Hey, you fucking me. Forgotten what we were talking about. Uh, yeah, me too. Damn. Fucking stoners. Uh, we were talking about talking and writing and the last guy who got me into writing or reading and writing really, but, uh, I read the great shark hunt, the hunter s Thompson Book. It's kind of a compilation book of all of his, uh, his stories. Fuck, that dude could, right? That dude had some really interesting writing like guy you excited to read more about it, you know, and it's kind of like this weird blend of fiction and nonfiction. That's one of the things that was so cool about hunter's writing is like this guy was just crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:05:56       It was making all kinds of crazy shit up about like Las Vegas and campaigns and dudes being on drugs. You know, when Ed Muskie was running for president, Hunter Thompson just started printing in rolling stone magazine every week that it was like widely known. This guy had an ebook again, addiction and that he was bringing in Brazilian doctors. Like nobody ever done that before. Nobody's ever done like real serious coverage of like a political event and just started adding nutty shit to it. That totally wasn't real. So literally this guy changed the fucking course, the election because that guy was like one of the favorites and because hunters writing about him having an evil game addiction, which is this crazy exotic drug from Africa, you know, Hunter wrote this whole thing about it and this guy literally fell apart on the campaign trail. People were heckling him and he's doing these campaign speeches and just crumpled, just bring some crazy shit that this guy wrote. And when they asked him about it and he goes, uh, well, you, you made up that stuff about, you know, ed muskie having an irrigator, he goes, well, I didn't make it up. I, I, I, I didn't print. I said it was a rumor and it goes in. It was a rumor and I started in Milwaukee.

Speaker 3:          00:07:02       It was crazy. It was just. But he got away with it and he was just constantly on acid. He was constantly doing masculine who's constantly doing cocaine. I mean, he was constantly getting fucked up and writing. That's like Super Uber fucked up.

Speaker 4:          00:07:16       Is there a book or a movie that you would recommend about all this?

Speaker 3:          00:07:19       Yeah, well I didn't even get into him until I watched the documentary Gonzo. I'd like to move you fear and loathing in Las Vegas and I'd seen him on talk shows before. I always knew that he was just kind of crazy guy. There was this older dude who was really nutty, like to shoot guns and it looked like, you know, your friend's Dad, but he was fucking completely psychotic, you know, it was just this guy left over from the sixties that somehow or another morphed into this like super violent fucking drug addled compound Chuckii. That's what he used to call themselves. You know,

Speaker 4:          00:07:49       I just added it to my netflix queue on my ipad. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:07:52       good job. Good job. See that? Where it's very good documentary, but it's a really well made too. So it really gets you into how fucking interesting this guy was. And it brings me back to the same thing that I always think of, man, I'm when you're really that good. He's so good. I always wonder how fucking crazy you have to be to be really good. You know, like, you know, in almost everything like Michael Jackson and fucking sports, anybody like tiger woods, you know, look how crazy is. I almost think that you have to be a certain. There's a certain amount of imbalanced to you to be really the best at anything to be. Excellent.

Speaker 4:          00:08:25       Yeah. Well that's why you're considered the best. Usually not in the same road as everybody else. You're on the side street, you know, you're a little different than everyone else. So that's the most successful people are not just a common person in everything. They do,

Speaker 3:          00:08:39       not just that. What I'm saying is that the commitment that's involved in order to get to the highest levels of anything, like you almost have to be completely not knowing that I hit those Rpms, you know, it's like um, with so many things, especially when it comes to the working world, when it comes to like the world, I could see a, you know, an argument for there's no, there's never too much. It's never too much art that you can produce because you just producing positive energy. People that get addicted to success in the business world. And try to be like the number one guy in the business world. I mean, that's one of the main reasons why we have all these problems today with corporations or corporations are sort of these consciousness list entities, you know, I mean now corporations basically are allowed to, uh, they're, they're judged as an individual.

Speaker 3:          00:09:23       You know, corporations are a thing, like they have rights and shit. Like they can contribute to campaigns now as much as they want. They can do all kinds of crazy shit, you know, as, as a corporation and get away with it because they don't think of it as them, as an individual doing it. They think of it as well, you know, it's all business and we're part of business. Like they can do fucked up things in overseas countries, you know, third world countries and they don't even think that they're doing anything bad because what they're doing is they're just doing business and there's just a bunch of people involved doing it. So no one person feels like total responsibility for what's happening, you know? And that's, that's like a, that's like a real problem that we have. And I think one of the real problems that we have is related to people just being super competitive, you know, that's the only reason why these fucking super crazy billionaire dudes would keep pushing forward, you know, at a certain point in time, how much fucking money do you have to have, you know, when you're one of those dudes that has like 30, $40, billion dollars and you're still trying to rape third world countries.

Speaker 3:          00:10:20       Like what the fuck is going on? Like how much money do you need, bitch, you know, that's a lot of goddamn money. And what is that? Why? Why would they not be able to recognize that there's something wrong there? Well then they're crazy. That's what it is to get at the highest levels of anything. Whether it's golf or whether it's fucking, you know, whatever the fuck it is to get at the highest levels of anything. You got to be a little naughty man. Whether it's sports, whether it's singing or performing the writing, you know, I think, you know, to really achieve those, those, those crazy great highs, like you almost have to like lose your connection to everybody else or lose control of your connection. You know, it's weird because that's our high watermark, you know, and we're always aspiring towards higher and higher levels of performance in everything we do.

Speaker 3:          00:11:08       Whether it's athletic or anything you do, you're always trying to do better than you did before. You know, I mean that's like a human ethic that we have and it's a very strange man because there's never a point in time where we ever stepped back and go, you know, hey, this is, this is good. We're good right here. Let's just, let's concentrate our time right now. Instead of making more money, let's try to concentrate all our time and trying to make things better for each other. You know, let's kind of try to concentrate our time and dealing with all these problems that exist all over the world. Instead of trying to fucking smash atoms and create black holes. Let's, let's settle down. You know, and let's concentrate on some other shit when we look at a surplus of money that we have, but they don't ever think like that. All they think of as more and more and more and more and more and more and more like they're going to live forever and those motherfuckers drop a heart attacks left and right. Those like ceos

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       of big corporation type dudes, those motherfuckers die like crazy. They die all the time. Those guys are, you know, like Dick Cheney's at 150 fucking heart attacks. And one of the reasons is, is because he's, he's just such an evil cunt. You know, if you're that fucking evil, you know you're going to have some goddamn heart attack you, you're doing some wicked shit. You're creating so much bad energy and you're pushing constantly, constantly, constantly. You know, what kind of balls do you have to have to be the fucking CEO of a corporation like Halliburton and then go from that to being the vice president of the United States and then go from that to signing billion dollar agreements with Halliburton. We're billions. Literally billions of dollars were lost, like they don't know where it went. Billions and corruption. They have no idea where, like all kinds of money went. And the fact that that motherfucker profited on it.

Speaker 5:          00:12:45       He had shares in Halliburton while he was the fucking president. I mean, he got money from them while he was the president or vice president. What do you mean really? Was the president really was the fucking marionette supposedly remember the days where he was always in the bunker. Remember? They would always, they would always talk about Dick Cheney been in the bunker and where's this bunker? These, there's some Batman type shit, you know, what does he have? What is the Dick Cheney bunker? It's just probably like a golf club. It's another nickname for a golf club. He's at the bunker, at the whorehouse dudes banging dudes, you know, that was the big secret of the fucking, uh, the, the whole, uh, Bush White House was, there was a lot of gay shit going on. A lot of gay shit. That guy, Jeff Gannon, who's a reporter for, um, the White House.

Speaker 5:          00:13:31       He was a White House embedded reporter. And he would love the super softball questions at President Bush, like Mr Bush, President Bush, when or Mr President, when are the Democrats just going to come to reality? When are they going to come to their senses? Do you think that's ever gonna Happen? He would say shit like that. And other reporters were like, who is this motherfucker? And so the other reporters started investigating the student and they found out that he had a fucking gay porn website with him, him with like, you know, like fucking bare chested and like a towel over his cock and shit, like super gay with dog tags on. And it was gay porn geared towards guys with military fetishes. Yes. What have you heard about that

Speaker 4:          00:14:13       typical guy? Have you heard about that guy in the news recently that tickled parties? Uh, with, uh, he worked off. Same thing like he worked for the government somehow or like the dude. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? The typical guy that had like ticklers that would come over and they would all have to tickle parties.

Speaker 5:          00:14:31       Well, how about that fucking woman? You can make the Madam, how about that woman who was the madam for that big fucking brothel in Washington dc and this chick claims she's got the fucking ends on everybody in Washington. All of these senators that use to service all these different people and then she commit suicide and she even said she at her interviews, if I commit suicide, they did this to me. I am not going to kill myself. I'm happy. I want to live. It was fucking gone and the whole case gone. Dust in the wind, dust in the wind would Jesse James did you see? Oh my goodness. And that's what happens man. People get fucking wacky about Jesse James or tiger woods or whatever the fuck it is this week in the news and while all that's going on, crime just left and right. They're just stealing, stealing money and fucking pitches and killing bitches are going to fuck bitches.

Speaker 4:          00:15:27       It's the congressmen Eric Massa that had to tickle part.

Speaker 3:          00:15:31       Oh, interesting Democrats, Senator Democrat, senator. It was on the daily show. He was on a daily show talking about it.

Speaker 4:          00:15:38       No, I think they had it on the daily show. That's where they talked about that. So take a story. New York Times, somebody's twitter to look at. Sweet. Oh, is that the the tweets or the chat thing? This is on twitter right now. People responding to you on twitter, so if you go to Joe's website, Joe Rogan net, click on webcams. You can see the chat we're talking about.

Speaker 3:          00:15:57       Yeah, yeah. Or you can go to my ustream page. You can see the whole chat on the extreme page. What the hell is joe going on about things? She can't just tune in. Halfway in the middle we're talking about shit. The way the human mind works, man, that there's an error and the way the human mind works and that's the reason why people are doing all this crazy shit like trying to conquer the world and you know, and billionaires are fucking torturing these third world countries and crushing their resources and doing it all for money. They're. The reason why is there's a, there's an error and the human mind and there's an error that causes us to never have perspective. We're always moving in a direction, but we don't have a perspective like nobody ever stops and very, very few people stop and realize that a certain point in time, like I would rather live a, an easy going really peaceful life and make less money and have less bullshit and less drama in my life and you know, and just be happy all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:16:53       Then be this like super ambitious, you know, gotta go get it. Typical American, you know, and that, that's a problem in that fucking typical American attitude is bullshit because we're going to die. We're fucking dying. All of us. There's just. This is totally temporary. So like the, the one thing to do is to try to balance it all out and have the most amount of fun possible and the most amount of positive time, the most amount of positive energy during the time that you have. But then there's the keeping up with the Joneses thing. This trick that gets us thinking that somehow or another, like bigger houses and bigger cars or bullshit is going to make you happy. Some of the most miserable Fox that I've ever met in my life were rich and famous. Okay. The some of the most miserable fucking human beings I've ever met. Rich and famous and living in a torturous existence. You know, like we were talking about. Our friend on the way over here has got the female problem. You know, this guy is a very

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       successful guy. He's like, been on television. He's, you know, he's a, he's a guy that people enjoy. They go to see him. Has Life is all I know. It's fucking chaos and it's just, it's, it's. So. It's a few steps before murder. Suicide, right? It is. It's right there. It's not going to murder suicides door. You know, if you got that phone call in the middle of the night, you wouldn't be that surprised you. But God damn it. Damn. Should've done something else. Yeah. This is nothing you can do. That's, that's the cold hard facts. There's nothing you can do. At the end of the day, these motherfuckers have to go home. It's like you have to figure out what is it that we're really doing here? What is it, and because they're so fucking many of us, I think that human beings have lost this sense of community.

Speaker 5:          00:18:34       I think human beings are programmed to be in tribes were programmed to be in tribes of like 50 to 200 people or maybe more, but enough that you know everybody and you know, when we live alone, we're fucking miserable. Like that's why we don't trust hermits. We don't trust people that go off into the woods by themselves. We look at this sketch, you motherfucker, he wants to be by himself. You know, we don't trust that shit because that's not how you're supposed to be. We're not programmed for that. We're programmed to be in small groups of people so that we worked together and we protect each other and we support each other. But we're living in a group that's way too big. Were tricked into believing that the were a part of some $300, million strong group. You know? That's why like wars work, you know the reason why wars work is because we feel like, well, yeah, we got to defend ourselves and we all know we have this sort of sense of loyalty, defend ourselves, but a certain port tenants like against what?

Speaker 5:          00:19:23       Hold on a second, whose we are $300 million fucking people and we're defending ourselves against what, 300 million other people from somewhere else and we don't even know what is going on. Why are they really after us? Like, what's happening? Well, I'm getting this from you and I'm connected to you somehow. Who the fuck are you and why these people mad at you. Why are these fucking people in this other country mad at you? Why do they want to come over here and kill me? Because some shit you did. What the fuck are we doing? Until you know what we're doing overseas? You can't support it. You can't be involved. You know, there's a video that was released that you haven't seen yet that it was on Wiki leaks where it shows this a Apache helicopter shooting these hellfire missiles into these people and they weren't soldiers.

Speaker 5:          00:20:04       They were mistaken as soldiers and I don't know us did it. I watched it. The US duty. Yeah. Yeah. The 2007 and covered it up and then wiki leaks got ahold of it. Someone in the armed forces apparently was a whistleblower and just thought that this was a horrible situation and needed to be corrected. And these guys were like, you know, look, I mean if they thought there were insurgents, I could see how they develop this antagonistic attitude towards the enemy because this guy's willing to. They shot him up as one guy, survivors. I just pick up a weapon, just pick up a weapon like he's asking them to just pick up, pick up a weapon so he could isom and he's got these 30 and they've looked at the, they're the bad guy and this guy is out there and he's in the shit and he's trying to survive.

Speaker 5:          00:20:43       I mean that's the attitude you have to have. If you don't have that attitude and you're in war, you're going to get killed, but what it shows you is like, what the fuck are we doing there? Like what? What is? What are we doing that our American friends are people who live over here in this country are subject to becoming that guy are subject to being put in a situation when they are shooting at civilians accidentally and thinking they're insurgents. They have to live with these fucking memories because someone told us that we're supposed to be over there for some fucking strange reason, some fake weapons of mass destruction and now some fucking democracy building project. You were surprised though. An 18 year old made a debt bad decision. That was an 18 year old pilots. I know, but half those people are so young that it's retarded and I didn't get smart and I'm smart with like a z until you may 25, 27.

Speaker 5:          00:21:30       I would probably say I started actually doing making better decisions. Not fucking crazy shit. No, listen, no, no doubt about it. I was retarded when I was 18 and if I was 18 and I was in war, I would be doing the exact same shit. I was hyper-aggressive extra violent and ready to ready to do stupid shit. You know when you're an 18 year old man and you're around a bunch of people who tell you you are supposed to be doing stupid shit, you're supposed to be violent. You're supposed to be attacking. You're supposed to be a killer. I mean, man, you, you could program the shit out of us, man, if you, if you're a fucking angry 18 year old kid, you know who has a, a, a need to belong to something and this need to belong takes you to another country and all of a sudden you're, you know, you're in Afghanistan, you're fighting for America.

Speaker 5:          00:22:17       You feel like, you know, you're representing some real shit. And then someone's fucking telling you, you know, this guy is telling you you're a goddamn killer. You know, you know you. I'm fucking proud of you boys. You go out there and go get it. You know, like total, full metal jacket style. You know, man and any of us could get sucked into that. I could've got sucked into it. You could've got sucked into it. We all could have, but the idea that they're over there protecting us, like, man, we have to sit down and fucking talk this through. Like, what are you talking about? You know, they're protecting us. Like they're protecting our freedoms. Look, if they really were protecting our freedoms, what a noble thing. If there really was some evil empire out there like, like the Nazis that were trying to fucking take out Americans and there was millions of them and they're storming the beaches and taking over countries.

Speaker 5:          00:23:00       That's not what's happening. Okay. There's a bunch of fucking dudes living in caves and we don't even have to fucking go in with what we're doing now that's most successful because he's fucking drones. These, these aircrafts that are shooting around total straight video game type Shit, Shooting Hellfire missiles into mountains and killing people. I mean, that's probably the best way to hunt these fucking dudes anyway. If there really are terrorists out there, like the whole thing is nuts and you hear people like Michael Moore saying that there's only a hundred Taliban or a thousand Taliban. He said, living in Afghanistan, it was 100 or thousand. Neither one of them is nuts. The fact that we got 30,000 troops over there, I was like, what do we just sent $30,000 more like, what the fuck are we doing? It's all so scary that we're putting our trust into people that are known liars.

Speaker 5:          00:23:45       You know the idea of protecting America. The idea of being a proud citizen is standing up for your country. That's all noble. The real problem is who is giving the Goddamn fucking orders? People that totally cannot be trusted across the board full of Shit at every goddamn turn, whether it's the Gulf of Tonkin, whether it's a weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or whatever the fuck it may be. You know, and it's not just Republican, it's Democrat, it's this fucking crazy healthcare thing and it's fucking crazy thing that's going on with the bank. Bail outs were all this money is just flying around and there's no accountability. Nobody knows where the fuck it's going and these executives that came from these companies that got big fucking bail out checks. They're taking big bonus checks and saying, well, if they don't get these bonuses, they quit like, fuck you.

Speaker 5:          00:24:35       What is happening? This is a goddamn money grab. Like how is this money grab going on? The money grabs grown out because they're all corrupt that Democrats and Republicans, they all owe favors to people that got them in office and they suck Dick and kiss ass and they let this bullshit pass through. So it's not just the Republicans. It's not just the people who want war, the military industrial complex, it's fucking all of them. It's all of them. We live in a horribly corrupt system. That is, we're. We're like sick. We're like the human race is sick. There's something wrong with the way we think and behave and or it's right and we think it's wrong to think that because it doesn't know because it doesn't have to be this way. If you want total enjoyment for the people that are participating in it, it doesn't have to be this way and the way it is right now, it's this way because too many people are passive and they're sitting back and they're just allowing this life to keep rolling forward in the same direction.

Speaker 5:          00:25:31       It's going in a certain direction for sure, but it doesn't have to be negative and it doesn't have to fucking involve war. It doesn't have to involve all the shit that's going on in these other countries were being tricked into thinking it does it. We're supposed to be getting past that shit and we're supposed to be evolving in a technological sense, but we should be evolving socially too, and we're not. We're still socially the same way. We're 30, 40, 50 years ago. We're still doing the same dumb shit where it's gigantic groups of people led by a couple of leaders will attack another gigantic group of people and a bunch of fucking people that have nothing to do with anything die and someone is getting money from it all. It's. That's all it is. It's all about resources. Every fucking one that's ever been fought ever there about resources and it's just crazy that in 2010 we know the real problem is we live too long.

Speaker 5:          00:26:21       You know, right now we live to be 80, 9,100. You live long enough to figure out. It's all bullshit. Back in the day when you were fighting for the Roman empire, you know you died a fucking plague when you're 19. You know what I'm saying? If you live to be 30 you, you, you did a lot of shit. You got a long ass life. You know Jesus, they killed him at 33. If he was ever real, you know what I mean? Look at all the people that live back then. You know the holidays. Motherfuckers live forever. You know, you, you hear about some new lady in France, it's just, you know, 100 2,626 smoke cigarettes, drank red wine, but the one in 26, it's incredible. People live way low and you live if you live past a certain point, like you and I are very fortunate because we're in the entertainment industry so we don't have a specific job that we have to do every morning like we don't have to go to work and work on say insurance cases all day stuff that we're not interested in.

Speaker 5:          00:27:16       We're lucky that we get to create and we're lucky that we get to do stuff that we find interesting, but it's all fun. But for most people that's not the case. And when, when it's not the case and when your whole day is filled with work and I've been there before and you've been there before, you don't fucking think too much. You don't figure too much out. You know when you're working eight hours a goddamn day plus and you try and get some overtime, man, because you got extra bills and credit card debt and shit. You know, when it gets to a certain point in time, you know, at the end of your day, man, you don't got time to contemplate the universe or culture or you know, why people behave the way they behave. No, you just fucking keep going. You know, life has got damn hard.

Speaker 5:          00:27:53       You just keep fucking going. But you and I have way more time by ourselves to think on our own than most people. So you get to a certain point in time and you know what, by the time 42, by the time you're like 42, like fuck man. The whole hustle is so obvious and stupid. It's like the same hustle that would've gotten me when I was 18. I would've got them joined the army for sure when I was 18 for when I'm 42. It makes me angry because somebody my age is doing this hustle on someone who's 18, you know, not even my age older than me. You know? I mean, it's like you motherfuckers should have figured it out already. You motherfuckers that are older than me that are running the planet. You should be delivering this message. You should have figured this out.

Speaker 5:          00:28:32       You should know that we're, we're living like retards, that this is nonsensical, that this is. No, this is not sustainable, but we could live a sustainable life and it doesn't involve going to countries where you've never been in fucking up people you've never met. It doesn't involve that. You know, and this fucking argument like about our boys. Well, you know, what do you want our boys to die? That's how they have to behave over there. That's stupid. That's a stupid argument. Yeah, I know that that's how they have to behave when they're at war. A 100 percent, but that's not the argument. The argument, this is, this is nonsense. They shouldn't fucking be there in the first place. It's not that they're not heroes. It's not that they're not brave. They are. Absolutely. You have to be. I mean, that's real fucking fighting. That's real. Live killing and fighting with tanks and missiles and jets and shit. That must be white knuckled. Terrifying. You didn't even like hurt locker, did you? Nope. How come he didn't like hurt locker? I thought it was boring as fuck. You need to go to a doctor, get your balls checked out. That movie was. We talked about this a million times. I know it. Did you gotta get your balls? Sorry. I'll tell you what sucks. Clash of the titans. Oh yeah, that's stupid. It was dumb. It was so dumb. I mean, I like

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       the special effects are kind of bad ass. The cracking was pretty dope when the cracking comes out, you're like, God

Speaker 4:          00:29:47       thing is just like a made for TV movie. Special effects. Sucked ass. I heard,

Speaker 3:          00:29:53       I kinda liked the Medusa, you know, the problem was there wasn't enough shit going down, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:29:58       Yeah. I don't want to see it. Do you see hot tub time machine? Um, no I haven't seen that or heard. That was bad too. But what is this gentleman saying? I don't like to respond too much to negative people that don't know what he's saying. Of course he's reading it. All he cares about is his internet reputation. Not even listening. Huh? And then you're talking to me. Some chick asked me a question on twitter today. It was one of the, the, it was one of the most ridiculous questions that I've ever like heard ever. So I like, look at this. This chick says to me, her name is Taurus spa or 12. I don't know what the fuck it is. It's on my twitter feed. She says, Joe, you can't seriously not believe in evolution. You don't believe in that God. Listen, listen, listen how it's worded. You can't seriously not believe. Like I didn't even know what she was asking. I had lost it. So I said saying, if I can't not just, that means I can write what the fuck. Yeah. What does that mean? And then I'm saying that I said that. I'm not saying I don't, not, I'm saying she don't know if I do or don't.

Speaker 3:          00:31:11       Yeah, it was like fucking do something about, um, twitter speak and uh, something about, uh, tech speak that's making people really retarded.

Speaker 4:          00:31:22       Yeah. And it's so much better than curse of man. I just got a letter the other day in cursive and it made me cry.

Speaker 3:          00:31:28       I will take. No, no. You know, cursive doesn't imply stupid to me. When I read something in tech speak like you are. I go, God damn it. I do it. When dudes do it, it drives me nuts.

Speaker 4:          00:31:40       Yeah, but my brain immediately skipped to and understand what it was supposed to save recursive. I'm more like, okay, that's Z.

Speaker 3:          00:31:47       that's why. Oh, you apostrophe r e dot. When you get a Goddamn text message from me, you're going to get a fucking apostrophe. You're going to get a U Apostrophe r, e mold. School's son. I'm old school so I prefer a stick shift. There's just too much God damn traffic in La, but I really prefer to shift my own fucking gears. You know what I'm saying? Do you like to shift your own gears?

Speaker 4:          00:32:09       A nine in la now?

Speaker 3:          00:32:11       Fuck. Fucking nice fucking BMW or nine slash 11 turbo or some shit.

Speaker 4:          00:32:16       You want to sit down with automatics are means manual.

Speaker 3:          00:32:19       I don't know. My first sports car, there's nothing like it so far. I have a little BMW m three. I love that thing, but it's got the paddle shifters and the paddle shifters are pretty dope and traffic because you really can't shift gears when you want and you really control the engine, but there's something about pressing that foot clutch down. Put Nat gearing, click, let the off hitting the gas at the same time. It's like you're in tune with the machine, man. You're in tune with the machine. I'm just pressing buttons. I'm hitting the gas and pressing buttons and it's fun. I mean, don't get me wrong. The fucking car. It's funny shit. These little cars now they make like little bmws. They handle so good. Then they're just like. They figured it out now and there's a crazy horse power war now, so like regular cars that you buy are so much more fast than they've ever been before.

Speaker 3:          00:33:04       This BMT old BMW before this one had 333 horsepower. This one has 420. It's fucking ridiculous. It's as fast as my old nine slash 11 turbo. That old porsche that I was to have. That thing was stupid fast. This thing is just as fast as that, but handles way better. Like the balance is like perfect. It's like you feel like you can just move it like it's not even real. It's like the gold card or something. You know? It's incredible what they're doing now. Those new, like those new mustangs that the shelby, the, the. What is the, the, the GT 500. Those fucking things have 540 horsepower man. And never buy unnecessary. Yes, but fun as fuck. That's fun as fuck dude. If you had one of those Mustang's those really fast one. Boom Dude. That does nothing for me anymore when I was a kid.

Speaker 3:          00:33:51       Yes. But nowadays I'm like, no, I want to live. Okay. What if you had a weekend car would, if you had this and you had like a Mustang gt, $500 a weekend car, you don't think that would be fun to fucking. Just, just not safely. I'm not talking about going down residential roads 150 miles an hour, but that merging onto the highway to 70. Like that song, you feel that fucking roar that va knows fat four inch pipes. Are you kidding me? That's fun as fuck. That is fun. As far I guess I haven't done it in awhile. Yeah, you haven't done it awhile. If he did it, did it. Every now and then he realized that's fun as fuck man. There's a. You know there is going to be a limit though. A certain point in time. Like how fucking fast these things go. The new nine slash 11 turbo is zero to 60 in three goddamn seconds. Three seconds. One, two, three 60 miles an hour. That's insane. You have stuck in texts from a girl and shut that shit off. Twenty percent battery. Low faggot.

Speaker 3:          00:34:51       Knowledge me, dude, please. There I did. I acknowledged you. Dude. You're way behind. Way Behind. What are you talking about? Thing? It's too much. Too many people. Too much. Too many people. Have I ever seen the movie called falling down with Michael Douglas. His grades are good goddamn movie. I love it. And that's how you feel when you live in La, in La. After awhile you're like, no, there's too many humans. They did population density studies with rats who had took rats. They put them in a box and there was, you know, there's a certain population of rats and they were cool with each other and then they doubled it and they started getting a little crazy and they tripled it and when they got to like a high number with a wrapper on top of each other, rats developed mental illnesses just like human beings do.

Speaker 3:          00:35:36       There's some would sit by themselves and shake and just like face the corner. I mean they literally, the way human beings are is mirrored and population density studies for all sorts of animals. So you know, you take us and he put us in the same. The reason why people yell at each other on the highway. That's craziness. Why we get so angry and angry on the highway with this because we grow on top of each other. Just eat each other's energy. All Atlantic. You're not supposed to live like that. And so that movie, that movie just resonates with everybody. I think when he just went fucking crazy. When you live in at a place like La, La has got 20 million people in it. I mean that was the reason why I moved to Colorado in the first place. I wanted to get away from this heavy vibration of all these people.

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       You know, I don't think this is a healthy way to live. I don't think it's a healthy thing to be like this many people. To me, I feel like I'm living in a game of musical chairs. Like one day some shit's going to go down and I'm just going to have to go further away, you know? I don't feel like I could stay here now. Did you feel that earthquake the other day? No, I didn't. No, I didn't feel it either. I was in the car either, but it wasn't Mexican wave. Our friend Duncan said that his bookshelf was moving. He said it felt like you were on a boat, like you're waving. That said, our friend, Duncan's done a lot of acid in his. Well, I heard from a few people. Same thing, same exact thing. Wavy motions, like three people told me, well, it was a pretty big one. It was a seven point. Oh, six point six point nine or something like that or something else in Baja California and that's like Mexico. Right? Then there was Jesse Ventura lives, I don't know. It's fucking government and then 15 minutes later, 20 minutes later there was like a four point three over north north of Los Angeles. The government try to fly with me.

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       That's bad. Jesse Ventura impression. That's great. He said that the dude who lives in Mexico, half the year, seven point two, I think that's pretty cool. Seven point two, seven point eight. Indonesia. Two hours ago. Is that true? Okay. I'm going to have to check that shit out because that's ridiculous. I might have to run and hide in the basement and that Shit's real traffic. Indonesia sir. Let's move to North Carolina. Yeah, right. How cool is that? Right? North Carolina has taken about that lately. Massive earthquake rock, southern Sumatra and Indonesia. Seven point eight on the Richter scale. Whoa, motherfucker. It's true. For minutes ago. This is on these websites. God Damn, I love this little latest results thing. It scrolls down. It shows you all the shit. I love that. Google is the shit. Okay. I'm willing to give up some personal liberty so the google could be running. Shit. See what else we've got here, son. Um, these podcast. Spent a lot of fun and met a lot of people last week on the road in New York and in North Carolina. And thank you all. Oh very

You know the, the best version of that story is a Duncan trussell's drunk history. I don't have a link to the video, but I'll put it up before you guys. I'm going to find the video for you because it's so cool. It's funny or die. Duncan trussell

Speaker 6:          00:38:57       drunk history.

Speaker 3:          00:39:02       They get Duncan Super, super drunk and he asked. There it is right there. Job History. Okay. I'm going to put this shit on twitter. Content. Objective terms. You going back to that, your search results. There was a video in a daily motions stolen Fox.

Speaker 6:          00:39:22       That's hilarious.

Speaker 3:          00:39:23       Yeah, it's amazing.

Speaker 6:          00:39:26       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:39:27       Don't get in. Was so wasted it. They can get on like bottles of Tequila and shit out. Absence Block. Oh yeah. Absence. Right, right. Have you ever done that shit? Never did. The roommate never did enough to have it.

Speaker 6:          00:39:40       Like I feel it or anything I don't think I did a long time ago.

Speaker 3:          00:39:50       What is is? Um, what does Duncan's a Duncan Trussell d one s or two

Speaker 6:          00:39:58       to t r U, s s e l l

Speaker 3:          00:40:18       I have to keep my mouth props on the twitter. It's hilarious. You gotTa Watch this drunk history thing. It's really a pretty spectacular. But for the people that are tuning into itunes right now and you ain't, you get no link. You motherfuckers, you don't even know what we're talking about. Duncan trussell, drunk history. If you google that, they'll, they'll be a website up where you can watch, you can watch the youtube clip, you can watch it on funny or die. You can watch it a couple of different places. But it's hilarious. And Yeah, a Edison was a con westing house. There were constant. Tessa was a genius, but in their Defense Tesla also fell in love with a pigeon. Yeah. And he had an issue where he destroyed his sexuality, like he had some fucking crazy problem with some actress and he fell in love with her and you know, this is all like really vague stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:41:08       But the, in his own words, he destroyed his sexuality and they don't know if they could cast, rated themselves. They don't know what. It was also a lot of speculation that he might've been gay or whatever to, you know, he was, he was definitely a loan. But again, I think you have to be alone to be like the fucking greatest genius that the world has ever known. I mean that guy was nuts, man. That got created all kinds of shit alternating current and you know, who you like literally. I mean you created a way to fucking broadcast electricity through the air. You know, the only problem with it was a, it would be like free Wifi. They wouldn't be able to control it. Like to have it in your house, you'd just be able to have it. But I guess now you could have like a password you've paid for the password.

Speaker 2:          00:41:46       Well they already do that in some cities they have city wide Wifi. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:41:49       It's free. Yeah. But I'm not talking about them. I'm talking about electricity. Oh, talking about if they would be able to do that with electricity, like and put a password on it. The way we put a password on Wifi today. Either way, Nikolai Tesla is a perfect example of what we were talking about earlier is a dude who's just gigantic super fucking genius. Like the greatest genius ever end. Completely Bat Shit Insane. Just just, just out of his fucking mind claimed that all of his information he received from aliens that he would, uh, he would tune into alien signals and they would tell him I'd do all those stuff, you know, I want, I always wonder about that man. I always wonder where the fuck ideas come from. You know, what if ideas are literally like a living organism. What if ideas are like, you know, you know, when we think about like parasites, we talked about this before, like parasites infecting a host, you know, and they take over the host body like that grasshopper that gets infected by this worm.

Speaker 3:          00:42:46       The aquatic worms grows inside the grasshopper to maturity and then when it gets to maturity, it convinces the grasshopper that it has to jump in the water and drown. So the grasshopper commit suicide so that this warm can come out of it. What if like language and ideas literally are like another sort of organism and what if like they are manipulating our consciousness. You know what if like language and ideas and all these different things that people come up with a creativity in people. When people are creative about things, they pull these things down out of the air. I mean, what are you doing? You freak them out

Speaker 2:          00:43:18       because I could see it. I can see today we're going to do this podcast. Are you going to play on the fight? I'm trying to do some tech support here to see if are you stream shows? It could be. We don't need to see it. We can watch it on here. I'm not really bothered because you were not having a conversation. The conversation, you're talking about theories and I'm listening to talk back then, motherfucker. I'm not gonna. Interrupt your theories. I don't understand why you need to in there and I've seen this flash of your fucking line saying that. I am Brian, why are you arguing with me? I am and we're know. What am I lying. No, defending yourself when I'm telling you it's distracting. Sorry for listening to you while looking at trying to do something and doing it more than it's tech support. Not at Brian. Stop arguing with me. I'm not asking you to do this. Jesus. That seems very unnecessary too. It's not unnecessary. Brian, you're distracting me. You Distract me by Web surfing in front of me and I'm looking at your screen. Was I web surfing? Whatever you're doing, I'm seeing you fucking flipping through pages and you're not listening to what I'm saying. Okay? We're not having a conversation. I. We weren't having a fight. You're talking about theory about something. I'm listening to thing. We're doing right here. This is 724 people

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       understand. It's called the podcast show. You were doing a theory. I was listening to you watching you flip through this fucking thing. You're not listening to me because I'm trying to do something for the show. Brian. Brian, don't do it. I told you not to do it earlier

Speaker 1:          00:44:47       is we're just had a little girl back. Little hissy fit

Speaker 3:          00:44:53       the IPADS, fucking evil ipad. He's right guys. Had the IPADS. Evil. It's causing you to do that too. What do you do? If I wasn't doing that, I would have been doing the same thing. We're talking. I would expect that. You know when you're talking. I do the same. I think we know when people are talking to each other, they sit back, the other person listens to you, but you're doing a bunch of shit. I'm just telling you, man, I do a bunch of shit while I'm talking. I know you're not listening to Joe, Joe, Joe. It's not that. If I were to go off for 15 minutes, 10 minutes at a time, you would do the exact same thing. Yes. You would not what? We're talking 20 minutes talking about 20 minutes and would you want a podcast? We're not having this conversation though. Brian. Jesus Christ. Why are you defending this? Because your attention. Really simple. I'm not attacking. Yes twice to stop looking at that fucking thing that it's distracting. It will look at this thing. Then it's in front of us doing the same thing. No, it's not because you're not flipping through things and moving stuff around. I can tell you not paying attention and it's distracting me.

Speaker 1:          00:45:51       Okay. Sorry. Okay. Damn. Have I looked into the Illuminati? What if harp cause the earthquakes. Shut the fuck up. Okay. Whoever you are. God Damn it with your nonsense. Go read some David eick books. Well, red bands. The man. Shut the fuck up. Jo. How dare you. Listen, we have moved on you fox, but I have to.

People are there to try to change gears here. Okay. Let's get some questions. Sarah, can you give us. Can you talk about being more flexible? Any books you already recommend on stretching and flexibility? Just take yoga. If you really want to learn how to suck your own Dick. That's why you're. That's why you're asking. God Damn it. You said you hung out with Ron Jeremy.

Speaker 3:          00:46:52       Oh, he was at the party. I was at the other day.

Speaker 1:          00:46:53       Did you guys, did you hang out with your talk and I said hi to on that about it. He used to be able to suck his dick. That's why I had a bit my act about it, but he got too fat. Then the joke was that that's all overrated. Sucking your own Dick. Is

Speaker 3:          00:47:09       that guy never just sit at home and watches TV, does he? Because that dudes out. I mean I see that guy at least once a month. Yeah, somewhere he's, you know, it's kind of funny. He's like really into being like a mainstream or like success, you know? He would always tell me about things that he's done, like I'm not doing this new movie with this guy and I'm, I do a cameo on this TV show, you know, and he's like, I'm trying to make it as a mainstream actor. And I'm like, Dude, you're fucking Ron Jeremy. Okay, and do you understand that you'll like a hero to ugly fat dudes all across the world. You fucked the hottest women on the planet. He's fucked all of them. Every single one of them, he has a giant Dick and he's fucked all of them. Hard slaps them around. Fuck some doggy style nuts in their mouth and face. I mean, he's a goddamn champion. He's a champion.

Speaker 4:          00:47:54       And that was something that you thought was going to be the thing that you feel like it can be a champion about. You know, like a lot of people are like, Oh, you fucking 5,000 hot chicks. That'd be like, Oh God, I feel horrible. You know

Speaker 3:          00:48:04       what? You really think people would think that that's a bad thing. Like a regular guy that never gets laid, that looks like him to a regular guy that looks like blasting logs look like that. That's true. He looked pretty fonzie back in the day. Fuzzy. He was a decent looking guy when he was younger, but he was never like a hot stud, you know? These girls are tens, you know what I mean? And now he's like this gross fat hairy guy with great chest hairs and he's still banging them all the new ones. All the new ones have to to pay homage to the staff at the thing. Right. He's like a superhero for horn. Yeah. If you're a dude who looks like him in Jersey, you know you're a fucking mailman or you're, you know, you're delivering sausages to the fucking local supermarket. Ron. Jeremy looks like you and he's banging tens and you can't get laid at all.

Speaker 3:          00:48:47       You know, you're lucky if you get some toothless blowjob from some hunts point hooker that just makes you check your balls every five seconds for the next three days looking for herpes sores. You know what I mean? You, you, you're lucky if that's, you know, that's as good as you can get in and that's going to cost you a hundred 50 bucks or whatever the fuck it cost Ya, you know this, this motherfucker's just bang and you looks just like you and he's banging them all. But hang on, I can't wait to these chest Harris. Turn Gray. Really look sexy. You everything about shaving that

Speaker 4:          00:49:16       I hated you. I fucking hate shaving because what looks better? How like being an animal of being a man or having white little red bumps everywhere with ingrown hairs and stubble. And you look like A. I just think you're supposed to let it go. You're supposed to be a man. Supposed to be an animal.

Speaker 3:          00:49:34       Saving your fucking problem, but she jitsu is if you, especially with you, train with the guys grabbed you right here. Fuck that. Grab your, you know, your, your collar and when they grabbed your, your uh, your collar that grab fistfuls of chest hair and it hurts like a motherfucker might have gay man, Gay mad key. You're supposed to have a gay man. Yeah. But they grab it through through the Geek. I mean that's the. He gets caught up in the chest hairs back. There's a lot of like guard passes where guys on top of you and he pushes down on the collar and grabs it and they always get a fiscal. People

Speaker 4:          00:50:03       grab your chest hair, you get like ringworm staph effects and there's no reason to be doing Jujitsu.

Speaker 3:          00:50:09       Definitely hard to justify sometimes. Think about injuries. I mean I've gone through since doing Jujitsu, I've gone through two knee surgeries, one meniscus, one reconstruction. I've had all sorts of fucking back problems. And so why? Why the. Why not? One

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       of the things like if you had like a stove that smelled like gas, you're always burning herself. There was always flames coming out of it. Why would you keep on using that stone? Why would they keep it

Speaker 5:          00:50:37       surfing when the crash and get scratched up? It's so much fucking fun to keep doing it. Jujitsu when you get good at it is really fun, Dude. It's really fun. You're, you're, you're going basically hand to hand combat and you're doing it with good friends. Like these guys that I did you just to, with, you know, you would trust each other with basically each other's lives, you know, when I do get, gets my back and chokes me and I tapped. I'm trusting that he's going to let me go before he fucking kills me because basically he's got to a point where he's killing me. And that's the same thing with you when you get on top of a dude and you're finishing off a choke or an arm bar or something and the guy start tapping. He's basically trusting that you're not going to injure him, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:51:13       And sometimes people get injured accidentally, but the amount of times that I don't get injured, it's way more the amount of continent. Do you know? I get injured but I've had these operations and shit over the course of doing Jujitsu for 14 years. It's a long ass time, you know, and the first year, so first couple of years I had a knee issue that I had. I already had like the knee surgery on my left knee. The meniscus, I have the, the meniscus problem for years before that. So it was a preexisting injury, so really the only major one that I had was the knee surgery, but he's just get it fixed and you fucking heal up and you've just train smarter. Next time you realize, don't put yourself in bad positions and don't train with spazzes. That's another thing. You've got to make sure you don't train with anybody that you don't trust.

Speaker 5:          00:51:53       You know, it's very important guys. Uh, some guys are just a little too nutty. They, they fucking spazzed out on you when you train and you gotta be real careful those dudes because they want to win so badly. The best guys are the guys who were really good because guys are really good. Even though the tap you out, even though you know they can beat you, they're going to beat you with technique and you're much safer. You literally safer with a guy who can kick your ass, who's a black belt than you are with a guy who's strong, who's a blue belt because that's strong blue. My fucking dive on your foot and break it. You know, he might try to get you into foot locker and get ahold of it so quick, trying to tap you out that he hurts you before you even get a chance to tap.

Speaker 5:          00:52:28       You know, it's a, it's a very tricky thing, but doing it good is so much fun. Dude. It's so much fun. It's so much fun and it's. You don't think about anything else. It really is like a form of meditation. You know, when you're in there and you're going at it and your role in with each other, you're not thinking about your bills, you're not thinking about you gotta wash your car and your laundry. No. You're thinking, I've got to survive here. I got to get out of the situation. I got gotta. You know, I've got to get into full guard. I got to pass his guard. I got him out. I gotta I gotta finish him. I got to stop them from finishing me. That's all you're thinking about is the moon, the moment and whenever you're involved in something like that, that's that intense. It's like a form of meditation, you know, but don't you think that way about like art sometimes, like when you're at your best and your like with your video editing or whether you're creating something, like when you're right in the middle of it all, you only thinking about shit but what you're doing, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:53:15       Yeah. But it's always getting, getting it done. It's never like I'm enjoying it. Oh No, fuck no. When I, when I'm painting a painting, when I'm editing a video and I'm doing anything, it's getting it done.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       It's not, I'm not having, I'm not having fun while doing it. They all have spurts of fun while I'm like going, oh, that's a great idea, but that's not like I'm like bone or style going, oh, I can't wait to finish this.

Speaker 3:          00:53:37       Really? Wow. Yeah, you don't. Is that an attitude thing?

Speaker 2:          00:53:41       Is it I, you know, I don't know. I mean that I, I guess I consider that you creativity. I consider I'm trying to get something out of my brain and do something else as fast as possible. While I have the idea in my head, like I'm trying to take my ideas and thoughts out of my head and put it in a form as fast as possible before I lose the original thought, right idea. So it's not like, oh, I love this idea. I can't wait to do it. Mine is just trying to get what I want. What I thought of out fast.

Speaker 3:          00:54:12       I'm making notes with the iphone using that little uh, application. But I don't like that I have to fucking go in the menu, find it, press that, press record. I think I'm going to get like a little tiny voice notes thing and when I have ideas like that when I'm writing and I have an idea, but I'm trying to write it down, I think I'm just going to press it and say the idea into it. So I know for sure that I'm not going to lose it,

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       you know? I mean like, do you have your iphone night record, abby? Just open up program, hit record. That's it.

Speaker 3:          00:54:39       But I want to be able to just one press and it's recorded. You know what I mean? Step two projects for real. I mean, it sounds ridiculous, but it is. I mean, it is that.

Speaker 2:          00:54:50       Yeah, I mean I have the biggest problem, like I will have an idea that might be the coolest thing I've ever thought of and if I, uh, last or wait like five seconds, 10 seconds, I might accidentally think of something else. And that idea has gone down so much and now I know it's mostly when I was smoking weed because lately I've been smoking weed maybe once, twice a week instead of almost everyday. And My, I feel so much sharper. My memory is so much better. It's amazing how much better I feel already and I'm just just from cutting it. Well

Speaker 3:          00:55:19       you also, you also don't exercise that much either. That's a big part about the weed. You got to blow that out of your system, you know, it's not just a. If you just sit around and just keep smoking weed everyday, everyday we'd starts to lose the effect and then you start to have to get more weed too to kind of an ad. You're like, you're like flooding your system. You know? I think that when you smoke weed, you can you shit, like if you want to do something creatively, you can't smoke too much. You gotta have one hit, one hits good. If you have two or three, you might lose track of what the fuck you're talking about. Sometimes it's fun to have two or three, but for the most part one it's a little bit. I read this or this professor not read or saw this interview once with this professor is a um, uh, a, a, I think he was a physics professor.

Speaker 3:          00:56:01       Pretty sure when he was talking about marijuana and he was saying that he smokes a little bit. He said that the key is to not overdo it. I smoked one hit and I go on walks and I contemplate my theories, you know, and he says that that one hit, he says it's like a magical push, like a little boost just helps give some, give some, a little momentum, little wind in his sails, you know, and it starts the ball rolling. You know, don't you ever think that like sometimes you're creating something, you're trying to do something and you're not smoking weed and you're like, God, so I get anywhere and then you smoke a little weed and then also Bam, right?

Speaker 4:          00:56:35       The main thing I think it is, it just gives you a different perspective, but the same idea that you, you're, you're thinking almost like you're multitasking, you're thinking one way this way and you smoke weed and you can think of it a different way and that's one of the only ways you could ever do that. You know, it's changing your brain. I mean you probably do it on cough syrup and think of it a different way, you know, but, but we, I think is most effective and fastest and reliable because you're so used to that

Speaker 3:          00:56:59       other side. George Carlin had an interesting take on writing what he would do, who is right, who would write everything first sober, and then he would smoke a joint and go over it, which I think is kind of interesting because it's kind of like he put up the skeleton of the house first and then he starts adding up.

Speaker 4:          00:57:14       Don't do it the other way around that because then it always sucks, you know, I think if you, if you die

Speaker 3:          00:57:22       sometimes you can come up with some crazy shit and then if you go over it sober you go, oh, this is too ridiculous. And then you can edit it. I think the combination of the two is what's important. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if it's necessary which order.

Speaker 4:          00:57:33       I think. I think thinking of the idea sober and then going off on the idea stoned always helps. I have better odds that way.

Speaker 3:          00:57:42       Yeah. Maybe I think, uh, I might want to do that with my writing. I might want to label it, you know, uh, like s t and s o stoned and sober and like, so I'll write s, t e s o, so you know, I did it stone and edited sober or like, you know, sos to.

Speaker 4:          00:58:00       I have some funny stone jokes that I write and I look at them and they are fucking crazy. Let me see if I could pick out one

Speaker 3:          00:58:07       real quick. The bit that I do in my act. That is totally true that I wrote down something when I was high and then I went to, to read it when I was sober and it's like a unicorn is a donkey from the future. I looked at him like, how could I have ever possibly thought that that was something that I needed to write down? That is for sure a sure. A sure sign that I got way too fucked up. All right. Here's one of my stone jokes. Marble, marble industry has to be hurting right now.

Speaker 4:          00:58:34       Remember when you're a kid, what the fuck does marbles nowadays? That's actually funny.

Speaker 3:          00:58:42       That really is funny. That's awesome. That's hilarious. New Comedy tour. Have to show stoned half silver. The problem with that is I would have to like start out sober and then step off stage, go outside and get high and that's when the cops grabbed me because mother fuckers

Speaker 4:          00:58:58       twitter, he laying in. Wait. The words on twitter is when you find out that you're following a fake Lisa Kudrow, you feel ashamed and disgusted, but you're not ashamed that you were following her to begin with.

Speaker 3:          00:59:11       I follow everybody. I can. I mean there's no one that I follow a lot of real dummies, a lot of really dumb celebrities. It's really annoying an end to themselves. I follow people that like give out like really patronizing advice and like ridiculous God quotes and just really dumb shit, you know, twit. Some really dumb shit. Deepak Chopra is. Some of this stuff is just like, why are you fucking talking about Deepak Chopra? You don't know who he is. He's like some really famous authors. Like a ace has a lot of brilliant shit. Now I've, let's do a lot of his interviews. He says a lot of brilliant shit, but God damn some of his tweets make me want to kick him in the Dick. The balance. He's missing the balance. My friends

Speaker 3:          01:00:00       take a Brownie at the start. That's not a bad idea, but the problem with brownies, brownies and comedy do not mix my friend. If I took a Brownie at the start of my act and our end of the act, when the Brownie kicked in, I would be so high. I would not be able to function. When I get really high on brownies, man, I don't want him to be talking. I don't want to talk to people. That stuff's too strong. I can't trust edibles. They're like, it's like doing small amounts of mushrooms now to me. Like sometimes I feel like I'm really tripping and there's. That's crazy. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. The, the, the, the eating. It is spooky man. And for people that don't know, it creates something. When you eat it called 11 hydroxy metabolite, that's four times stronger than thc. So when you eat, it literally is a totally different drug than when you smoke it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:42       That's why people, when they eat brownies, they always think they got laced with something, you know, so I can't do that. So that's the answer to that question. There's no way I could eat a Brownie, go onstage than an hour in the brown kicks in because then I would just want to lie on my back on stage and start talking about the universe and you know, some people might be into it, but there'd be a lot of people that would leave and go, that fucking show sucked. It was really funny for like an hour and then he just started talking crazy. He's lying on his back saying it's connected to everything and people would just not, not enjoy it. Just take a social dose. Well, that's what we're talking about. We can't figure out what a social dose is because you don't, unless you're making the brownies yourself and then even if you make the Brahmins yourself, you could fuck up the first time. You get it too strong and I don't have that time to be mastering the right dose of Brownie. Smoking is the way to go.

Speaker 6:          01:01:30       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:01:31       Well, I loved you in Calgary to jen Ab. Calgary was the shit that was fun, man. That was a good fucking time. A stone universe tour. Yeah, I should do that. You know, it would really be cool. Eventually. Right now we can't do it, but eventually when I get to a point where we can do stone shows, you know, like I could do a show like somewhere like in Amsterdam they have those cafes where they allow you to smoke weed. If we had a, a place like that in America. Hopefully in November. Yeah. Hopefully in November, but I don't buy it, man. I think you don't think that's going to fucking put the Kibosh on that shit. The problem with the drug movement is that making drugs illegal is good for business and making drugs. Legal puts a lot of people out of work. He puts the dea out of work.

Speaker 3:          01:02:17       It puts private prisons of work. It puts prison guards out of work. It puts parole officers and fucking police officers. Literally 50 percent of the people that are in prison are in prison for nonviolent drug offenses. How many of those are weed and what happens when we become illegal? The, Oh, it's a fucking colossal mess. So what they're doing by keeping it illegal is really protecting business. And it sounds crazy. It sounds like nobody will be doing that. There's no way the government staff fuck up. No, it really is. It's not fucked up. That literally is what it is. The reason why it's still illegal is all because of money. There's no one dying. There's no one getting cancer. There's no one losing their fucking mind. There's no yet. It's still illegal when you can go to cvs and buy jugs of wine and cheap liquor and cartons of cigarettes and you could smoke cigarettes and drink yourself to death. Easy, easy. You know, literally you can't die with pot. I mean you can't. I mean, I guess you could do something really stupid when you're stoned and wind up killing yourself, but if you're that dumb, he probably would've done something stupid anyway. You know?

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       And when they say, don't dye pot though, you could totally die if you say start panicking because your stone and then your heart had a heart attack. Die. I've never heard of that. Have you? You would you. So you don't think that ever happened? Somebody got sue stone started freaking out. Then there are heart fails or something. I've never heard of it. Have you heard of it? Because they can't be saying that. The weed is like,

Speaker 3:          01:03:40       let's look, let's, let's Google this. If you're a week ass

Speaker 2:          01:03:43       bitch, weak as weak ass. I'm going to google weekends. Attack. Yeah. Heart attack. You.

Speaker 3:          01:03:54       Let's see. Can Marijuana caused harm tech? Yahoo answers. Let's see. Marijuana said the trigger heart attacks. Okay. This is just wiki answers. Wiki answers a stupid because people like answer. That's how I thought that that whales, the killer whales used to kill people. I read this online a couple of different places to killer whales used to kill people until World War II and then people were using the whales as target practice. I've read this online and I talked about on the Adam Carolla show. And even though I said I don't know if it's true, I read it online that after World War Two, after the bombers, killer whales stop killing human beings and actually started saving, which would be really fascinating. Hold on a second. But it was true. It was just fucking wicky answers, man. Some crazy whaling guy on wiki answers. And I had to like chase it down on my website. Marijuana said the trigger heart attacks, Harvard, Harvard,

Speaker 2:          01:04:45       five times the amount of having a heart attack

Speaker 3:          01:04:48       in the first hour after smoking pot, a person's risk of heart attack could rise almost five times. God Damn. That's if you're a weak ass bitch

Speaker 2:          01:04:57       or if you're just one step away from having a heart attack because they eat a lot of meat, you know, or something like that. And careful we guess bitches don't want to write this. Be careful where you use. That's why we didn't say that marijuana's are killed when. True it didn't. It didn't. Employees and anybody, it didn't, you know. But if you have other problems and

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       he smoked weed or absolutely you can. Same thing could happen if you lik shoes. And you get him out, there might be something allergic on a shoe that, that could trigger off a sinus infection that will make you die. I really don't know where you're going with this. I have no idea.

Speaker 3:          01:05:36       Okay. So I just told her that careful weak ass bitches, marijuana can give you a heart attack if your ticker socks and you can read the story. Um, yeah. I mean if you really got to get a heart attack from weed because you're freaking out. I definitely think that there's another problem though. The real problem is that you're in terrible shape and you need to take care of your body. That's the problem. It's not pot. You know, it's like the way I've always described pot not being able to help dumb people is that you can't, you put jet fuel, jet fuel and a fucking lawnmower. It's still a lawnmower. You know, you know, you put jet fuel in a jet and it's pretty bad ass. But the bottom line is, you know, it's all about what kind of hardware you're dealing with. And some people just have wheat brains.

Speaker 3:          01:06:16       Their brains just suck. I mean, have you ever met people and you look in their eye and you're talking to them and you're like, wow, like there's no hope for this dude. This dude's just doll. Like I'm looking in his eyes. I'm not making any connection. And just like talking to a dog, he's like a fucking idiot. There are people and people don't want admit this for whatever reason, because there are people that aren't dumb. They're just troubled and their lives have fallen apart because they, you know, they, they've got all sorts of issues and you know, people go, oh, that guy's a retard, but he's not really retired. You know, he's kind of smart. There are people like that that are just troubled and fucked up and you know, perhaps they never figured out what it is in this life that they're good for us should be doing.

Speaker 3:          01:06:49       But there's definitely people with cas, nine volt brains that are just supposed to be out there digging ditches and to deny that it's just unscientific. If you look at the entire fucking universe, man, it's all about things improving and getting better. And if you look at human beings, there's all sorts of things, there's all sorts of programs and things set up to make sure that the week can still survive. They don't drop off. And when that happens, you're going to create a bunch of dumb people and having those dumb people around. Look, they all fit their purpose. They're all here for a reason. But if you're going to have a fucking Nikolai Tesla, if you're going to have, uh, an Einstein for sure, you're going to have dick ditch diggers dudes who are here to ditch Dick's, Dick's, Dick's,

Speaker 4:          01:07:30       you'll have ditches you have. It's probably, they'd set the retard are so low in like the 19 hundreds that they just haven't raised it yet. You know, there should be maybe a test or two that we have, we haven't been doing that makes people that are considered dumb. They're just retarded. You know, like, like, like, you know what I'm talking about? Like this person is so dumb. They are retarded. But you know that their loved one's passed away for

Speaker 3:          01:07:52       want to say that because we want to say, Oh, you know, you give people a chance and you know, everyone's got a chance. I think there are. There are certain people where it's very much cultural. It's very much they're, they're, they're just, they're raised in an environment where no one's questioning anything there. Their role models are all dunces that grew up in a family of people who scream and yell at each other for no reason. And they just, they live in this stupid world. And so they, they imitate their and they become stupid themselves. There's, there's people like that. So it's, it's not an exact science, but the problem is there's a lot of really fucking dumb people, man. When you see those videos of those people that go to those Sarah Pailin, book signings, those teabag or people and they're all up in arms against the government.

Speaker 3:          01:08:29       There are some wooden minds and there just some doll motherfuckers, you know, that's, that's, that's really a problem that everybody has to have a say. Like, how do you fix that? How do you fix what we got going on as far as like the idea of a democracy, the idea of, you know, half the people you know or more have to agree or have to have to. I mean the idea of a real democracy. If, if more than 50 percent of people retarded, which I think they are, I would say more than 50, more than 50 percent. How the fuck do you move forward? How the fuck do you. The only way to do it is to make those people smarter, is to figure out a way to educate those people to, to raise the number of dom raised the number of uninterested, uninvolved or 50 percent or retarded. Like, like they have bad brains or just education environment.

Speaker 2:          01:09:18       Well, you know, you know, I have, I know people that are great people, but for whatever reason they just don't think the same way that other people, my other friends do, you know, like they don't, they're not thinking about like, uh, putting your seatbelt on because they don't want to get in a car accident. Just get in the car and just drive. You know. Right, like there's, they just don't have as like a part of their brain is not working. Like, like, uh, the deep, like just thinking outside the box thing, if you think that's how they were raised, is it nature or nurture? I think it's, I think it's just, they're not using the same parts of brains, their brain, you know, it's almost like, I just don't think that they have that in him, you know? I don't know. I, I really,

Speaker 3:          01:10:01       I wonder how much of that is due to a environment, like how much of it is due to pollution, you know, how much of it is due to what your mother was eating and doing while she was watching is probably totally that. Totally. That, that has to have a big effect. You know?

Speaker 2:          01:10:15       I mean if you go on Youtube and search me smoking cigarettes, you'll see some just guy in West Virginia just sit near smoking a cigarette and you can tell just by looking at him, he's retarded, but yeah, he is probably not considered retarded.

Speaker 3:          01:10:28       No. Any can vote. Yeah. Anticonvulsant. Yeah. Like I had a conversation. I've been having all these conversations about religion on the Robin Board lately because all this Catholic scandal that's going on, and I don't know if you know the latest, but they've proven that the pope knew about pedophiles and hid the cases that went before he was the pope, that he knew about these pedophile cases and he did everything that he could to shield the information and protect the. The priests. That's like, man, how could you not think that the Catholic religion as a cult at that point, at that point, it's a cult, right? Yeah. I mean it's a cold period definition wise, but at that point in time you're like, how could this possibly be good? You know, if at the very top this kind of shit is going on, how do people get tricked into that? How, how was that possible? You know, how, how are people so silly

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       that in 2010 this is still considered a possibility? Like maybe they're right, maybe these kid fuckers are on the ball. Maybe they're the ones that we need to follow. You know, maybe this crazy organization in Italy, maybe they're the masters of all the knowledge like that's, that's. Is that nature, is that nurture? What does that. It's both. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:11:33       No, I think it's. I think it's the same thing that when you talk to certain people they don't get technology like they, they, they're not informed as much as other people.

Speaker 5:          01:11:42       Is that nature is that nurture? I mean how could people see to me and to you when we look at gadgets and new things like you know what both, like Brian, we'll find some new thing online, like Holy Shit, look at this and they'll send it to me or I'll send something to him, you know, and you look at it, you're like, oh, what are they doing? Look what they're doing with that. This multitouch fucking interface. Like a minority report type shit or anything, anything new thing. That stuff becomes fascinating man. I think though the

Speaker 4:          01:12:07       later, the more we kind of kill off a certain age group of people that didn't grow. I think the more people are going to research for themselves, religion and stuff like that. I think religion is probably their future and the religion is probably going to be a lot different in say the next hundred years.

Speaker 5:          01:12:23       Yeah, ever been ever. I think it's probably more people have realized how ridiculous it is now than ever before. You know, I don't think there's ever been more questioners and there's probably never been more options either. You know, with scientology and the moonies and anything else and new ones that are popping up left and right. There's all these new ideologies that are, that are popping up left and right. People are offering like new alternatives, you know, and it can't last. It's just, it's going to be too much. There's gonna come a point in time where we know the truth. We know it's not going to be something that we have to like wonder and make a judgment call on. It's going to be like, oh, I know you're full of shit. Oh, I know you're lying. Oh, I know. The information you're giving me is not truthful. I can read this and I can understand this. We have an intuitive sense of what's wrong and what's right. We also have an intuitive sense of when people are lying, you know, when someone is not being honest with you or, or when you ever been talking to someone that you know, that they're secretly hoping that something goes wrong with you. Like there's some secret hate, you know, you ever been talking to someone

Speaker 4:          01:13:28       well on the Internet everyday.

Speaker 5:          01:13:30       Yeah. But you know, you know that feeling where somebody really is like, they're being douchey to you. Like there's something there and it's, you can't describe it, but you get a feeling from them. You know, there's instinctual feelings that we have and deception is a big one. Man. That's a big one. When someone's being deceptive and someone's lying to you or does that not drive you fucking bananas? Doesn't that drive you crazy?

Speaker 4:          01:13:55       Well, yeah. I mean, but you have to also think that the person, the reason why this person's acting like this or something like that, it's because it's something that they don't like that you've done to them. Or is that something that you do or you know, so then you have to eight.

Speaker 5:          01:14:11       But that's not always the case. Sometimes throwing shortcomings, it's causing them to be a cure. I mean, you know, I mean we're talking about earlier this girl that's upset of this other girl, you know, I mean think about that. I mean, what does that, where is that coming from? That's not. And no one did anything wrong there. You know, it's like sometimes it's their own shortcomings is people choosing you over another person, someone seeing something that someone else has and saying, well that should be me. How can this guy successful? How come this girl is so happy and I'm not. They get angry. I mean there's, there's a lot of shit to human beings that's not logical, you know, and, but we can feel that when you're talking to someone and you. I mean, how many times you talked to a dude, I've, I've talked to a bunch of dudes where I know there's some, some weird jealousy hate thing when I'm talking to them and I tried to be as nice as friendly as possible and like, listen man, we're just meeting for the first time, but I don't really know.

Speaker 5:          01:14:59       Okay. You don't, don't make this a personal issue, you know, you think you have this, this, this rivalry with me because you know, you see me on television and you don't like the fact that I'm doing something that you want to do, but I'm just a dude. You know, you're a dude. I'm a dude. And the reality is I'm not taking your job. Okay? The reality is I got this job and the other reality is you can get something like it. Do, you know, you can become exactly like me except your own version of it. You know, you can. Anybody can do it. Anybody can be successful in any, any area that they pursue. You just have to figure out your way through the fucking path. It is possible, you know, I mean, look, muggsy bogues was a fucking basketball player who is five foot six, you know, I mean, anything's possible.

Speaker 5:          01:15:39       You know, there's, there's, there's just has to be your own path. You know, and I think human beings especially have a real problem being jealous of other people and being upset at other people. But you can what? One of my point is that you could feel that when someone does that to you and we're going to be able to tell when people are lying, we're going to eventually going to be able to tell. That's for sure. More like something that we're evolving in us with language and with consciousness. We're figuring out deceptive behavior. We're figuring it out because we understand that we recognize it in yourself and the more truthful you are, the more easy it is to pick out laws and other people. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:16:16       and just so much information to. They were just like twitter alone is probably killed a million relationships and a million rumors too and then I can't do anything nowadays. Like imagine being married and imagine going to a bar and then you'd meet as girl and you start talking to her and somebody goes, Oh hey, there's that person takes a photo of you puts it on their twitter. Now you are just being caught in front of 5 million people. You know, you can't. You pretty much have. We going to have to all have to start wearing disguises like fake mustaches and stuff. And I know it's going to be, it's going to be like that

Speaker 5:          01:16:52       fucking movie with Tom Cruise. What was that? Crazy. But we want to. Stanley Kubrick's last movies wore masks on. They. They Bang each other.

Speaker 4:          01:16:59       Oh yeah. With a. What the

Speaker 5:          01:17:01       fuck was that with Nicole Kidman? Nicole kid. What the hell was that moving? Somebody knows Stanley Kubrick. Was that shit?

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       Some fucking come up with it. I'm just going to sit here until somebody comes up with this chick says, don't cheat. Then. How hilarious are you Jenna? BBB? No. Nobody knows the answer. This fucking movie. What is this God damned movie? Eyes Wide Shut. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, yeah, of course you shouldn't cheat. But the problem is dudes want to. And we're programming

Speaker 4:          01:17:32       what does not even cheating. Like you could have just met this person at a bar set high and just started talking. But you know, Mr. camera phone behind you took a picture of you and now you're fucking, you know, it doesn't like shit's all crazy. You can't do any short.

Speaker 3:          01:17:45       But. But the reality is, the reason why it's an issue at all is that human beings, especially men, are wired to try to populate an entire village because that's how the best sperm survives. And you know, that's why all these crazy conquer motherfuckers like tiger woods, you know, these guys that are so uber competitive. That's why I had so many checks, you know, it was like guys just doing nature. He spread his seed. If this was 2000 years ago, that would be totally normal. But it's like an offshoot, you know, it's an offshoot of a, you know, a fucking warrior instincts, you know, he's out there conquering and then he's conquering. No, he's doing what he's supposed to do. He's like driving forward. Women are wired to grab a man and keep him for protection. Yeah, that's true too. That's definitely true. Sex addiction is total bullshit. Is it you sex addicted

Speaker 4:          01:18:35       mother would have to disagree because I know some people that are totally addicted to sex and a different level than I am. You don't know. You never met some friends of mine. Do you ever talk about the Saran wrap or the

Speaker 3:          01:18:45       lotion? No, you said talking about front who uh, you should do a thing called shooting and what he would do is he would get these running pants, like those on those really thin, sort of like, it's almost like a nylon nylon, really silky running pants. And he would literally rub the crotch with a fine grit sandpaper and, and then he would a baby oil, his balls and his shit is junk and baby oil, everything. So it's all nice and slippery. So he takes this super thin running pants and he puts them on over his baby oiled shit. And then would go get lap dances and they were just shooting this past [inaudible] girl would be hot and she'd be riding on. It's difficult hard. It was literally like sex, like a. and he had, he was like obsessed with his work. He has his own company and so he would work like these long hours and you know, and you know, he was really successful.

Speaker 3:          01:19:42       Millionaire had the whole thing. No big fucking house in the hills. They, he had the whole package and he worked all day. He was so he had no time for relationships and he like had some bad experiences with women so he thought women were just trying to rip him off and this chip that he was dating, she, she wound up cheating on him and he like, he got his heart crush so he just decided to just go shooting and this would be his day. He would, uh, go to work, work day. Then he would get something to eat and then he would go shooting or he would go shooting on the way home and then he would get something to eat and then go to bed, do it all over again. And that was his. All of his relationships were lap dances. He would just go, we got caught eventually.

Speaker 3:          01:20:20       Did any or he fucked up once and he went and he put too much baby oil or I think he used lube and literally his pants were soaked. And so the girl, the girl sat, I'm sure like, what the fuck would she like? She's like, pissed himself, just like, what are you doing? What's wrong with you? It's like, I'm sorry, he said I was so embarrassed and he left and he leaves with this puddle and his pants of baby oil and move and it's like dripping into his socks and shit. That's a Dixon Dixon mean. I think it's kind of like, because he's into massages. He was into like big rewarded for his hard work. He was into like fine food and massages and if prostitution was legal he would just hire a hooker. So like if there's like a, if it was like an acceptable normal thing to do, like you've lived in some foreign country, you know, they were, they allow prostitution.

Speaker 3:          01:21:06       He would just go to the prostitutes and get serviced and then go home. You know there's a fucking, you know, I don't, I don't understand how people have allowed that to be illegal. How do you stop that? Why do you stop that? Stop people. Health reasons I think you don't want fucking aids going ramp. It hurt everyone. Having herpes really though is that either. But if you go to brothels, they have to check those girls. They test those girls. If you go to a brothel in a country that's respectable, supposedly they're testing those girls just like they test porn stars, you know, I don't think it's a good argument because I think that if you're paying attention more, it's a lot safer than if, you know, if it's some fucking underground thing where these, you know, it's probably a lot of violence that comes with it too though, you know, people going a little bit too far and raping the person falling.

Speaker 3:          01:21:52       But if wouldn't it be safer if they did it in a brothel where their security and when people get screened and they know someone's not crazy, purity, they're everywhere. I mean, that makes much more sense to me than some poor girl has to put a fucking add in some magazine and then show up. Normally that girl that came to the comedy store, one night, we'll talk to her, she said she was a hooker and she would respond to ads and she would, uh, she would only go to them, right? She wouldn't let them come to her as I would have worked. She would go to them so that she had an address, you know, and she would tell her friend, hey, this is where I went, so if anything happens to me, I don't come back, you know, somebody killed me, you know, and she would, you know, she would go to these places, peoples places and she would fuck it was like, it was crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:22:29       She like super awesome about it. You remember that Shit. What was it? She was meth. She was a method, wasn't that, but she told us, told us what you did. Yeah, I think she said she did the mess, you know, and then you could, if you had like a real brothel, I think there'll be a lot less crime. There will be certainly way less rapes if you just get laid, you know, and people would settle down and you know, it's like the, this when you really did fall in love and you're really with a woman, like there wouldn't be this, like this overwhelming desire to be with someone just to have sex because you could always have sex so you could just pay for it if you want to. But you know, being in a relationship would, a relationship where you really enjoyed being with that person, you know, they wouldn't like, especially if you live in a place where it's hard to get laid, I'll give you live in Boston or something like that. It's hard to get laid in. Boston is. It's not easy, man. Those gusts.

Speaker 7:          01:23:18       What do you want to use? Me? You just don't want to use me to get the car. You drive home.

Speaker 3:          01:23:24       Oh, I didn't even know women were the nights until I moved to California. Man, I had no idea.

Speaker 1:          01:23:30       No, that's funny. It's true. Totally true. That's angry people. So God damn cold. It's cold.

Speaker 3:          01:23:37       It's just a God damn disaster. You know? There's a lot of, a lot of tension, you know, and a lot of people, they're all go get them to, you know, they moved their, they're immigrants. You know, the grandparents were immigrants and they moved there from another country that's not some serious. Go get them shit. Take all your stuff, pack it, get in a boat, sail across the fucking world, and starting some new place and learn the language and learn how to it. That's how go get these people were. So the people that initially came to this country on the east coast, those are all savages. And the people that went west or all the people that want to get away from establishes all the people were like, these fucking people are crazy. Get Me Outta here. And they all took off and the furthest they could get was here. That's why people in California are like the most laid back in the most progressive. I mean, it literally is because they're the ones that are the ancestors of the ones that wanted to get the fuck away from where they were, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:24:30       So let's go try the thin running pants next time you're in Houston. Um, I don't think so, man. I think you'd probably still get diseases within running pants, but a listen, it's a fucking, it's an excellent possibility. I should add that whole story to my house. Vegas routine. It's totally true.

Speaker 1:          01:24:56       Joe Always talks about 2012 new topic. Who the fuck are you talking about? Dummy? I'll keep answering this chick's tweets. When did we talk about 2012. We didn't bring that up. I have no idea. Poker shut your mouth shut. You're dirty. Dirty mouth. This guy says I use naturally speaking. Nine point five on the PC. It's pretty good. I have a little bit of speech impediment due to my cerebral palsy. You speak much clearer than I do, so you should have no problem. I believe there's a new version. Huh? I wonder though, if that's the pc one is better. Does anybody know if the better pc, the pc one rather is better than the Mac one or is it the exact same sense if, if the PC ones better used to be that way? It used to be the, the uh, that the pc one was better. It definitely used to be. But uh, I don't know. Now the Mac users, like eight percent. Ten percent of the population or something. What is it now? Eight? Yeah. What percentage is it? Man?

Speaker 6:          01:25:56       I have no idea.

Speaker 1:          01:25:59       There is a mental game, one can play called channel the alien when one

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       can find the answers to complex questions simply by visualizing an ancient alien from beyond pretending to channel the answers. Try it sometime. You'll be surprised. Okay, so would this guy is saying this holy chaos. Twenty three is that you can find the wise answers to things by pretending to channel an alien who has the wise answers.

Speaker 2:          01:26:31       What the fuck are you talking about? Why don't even think about that. Are you getting.

Speaker 3:          01:26:39       We'd Bitch. Okay. Because that shit is strong. It's a little too strong for you. You're, you're off the track and into the woods. Okay. You're fucking train is knocking over trees right now. That doesn't make any sense. I, I guess I kind of see what you're saying. You know, and I sort of do that sometimes where I say to myself, okay, if I wasn't me, how would I advise myself? And I pretend that I'm talking to a, a much more intelligent version of me guiding my life. I do do that, but I don't pretend it's God damn alien. You know? I just try to think of what is objectively separate myself from my life and what's the best advice I could give myself if I was smarter than I am.

Speaker 2:          01:27:18       I started about it again and mad at myself.

Speaker 3:          01:27:21       Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:27:24       That's funny. Tell me Shit ever. I think. I think you're silly fellow. Channel the alien. Okay. Louis Guy.

Speaker 3:          01:27:36       Puny human. The reason red band isn't paying attention, it's because you talk about the same shit every show. Then don't tune in faggot.

Speaker 1:          01:27:43       You don't have to like it. It's all free. Bitch Ron. Jeremy fucked your roommate. Whoa. Somebody's roommate. Got Fuck by Ron. Jeremy. Uh, I'm glad you like them, dude. All right. Let's go to page one. She questions we've got here.

Speaker 3:          01:28:00       How do you think the world would turn out if it were to be divided by believers and nonbelievers? Would the believers eventually end up just raping and murdering the nonbelievers into their cult?

Speaker 1:          01:28:12       I hate these questions.

Speaker 3:          01:28:15       You know the, the real problem with believers and nonbelievers is nobody fucking knows you don't know, and nobody knows. You shouldn't be a goddamn believer. We should it be a questionnaire which try to figure things out, but what I need, whenever anybody tells you they got the answers, that person's either full of shit or they want your money, period. No one has the answers. You don't know. It's impossible. There's no way. Have I listened to any Daniel Dennett lectures? No. I don't know who Daniel Dennett is. Do you know dental than it is now? I will never find information. Some more information.

Speaker 2:          01:28:47       See, that didn't go off on me about the last APP. Podcast. How about politics? Yeah. Emailed me. He made a threat about it. He fucking tried to contact me on some. I am. It's an interesting topic.

Speaker 3:          01:28:59       No, because I go back and forth on it and I agree with you to a certain extent. It really is silly. I'm to do. You can waste so much of your energy thinking about politics, but then you know, the argument is we're supposed to be governing ourselves, governing ourselves in this country and that you get the option to vote and you know, you get the right to express your opinion. You can actually change the world. But I don't know if you can, you know, I'm not completely convinced at this point with the amount of money that they're able to contribute to campaign funds that giant corporations are able to, they're, they're literally shaping the way people see things, they're putting ads and, and, and manipulating people's thoughts and getting people to believe things that aren't necessarily true. Also, they can push a certain agenda so that somebody can make money.

Speaker 3:          01:29:42       I mean, the situation is totally corrupt. I mean, so much money is involved in politics now and so much money is involved in, you know, in running the world and you know, just look at what Obama's done with this, all this fucking bailouts and this. When you look at this whole healthcare system thing, someone has to be making money. There's no way they'd be putting this much effort into this whole healthcare thing if it was just about, you know, keeping people healthy and making sure that people have medical coverage. It's not there, they're just there, there's money involved in it. It's corruption, it's gonna get crazy and it's a goddamn money grabbed just like the bailout is. And it's all very, very boring to me. And the real thing about it is it does get boring. It's a real thing about it is you can never have all the information. It's impossible.

Speaker 4:          01:30:29       It's a trap. I care about the things I want to care about, about the government. Meaning if they decided to make a bill about banning the internet or that night, cats are going to be illegal. They don't care about that part. That's not part of it. But I'm not going to sit there and try to figure out everything from a to z about our government and freak out about it because you know what I. I'm freaking out about my mail being delivered today. You know, I'm thinking, how am I going? Shit. If I did that, I'll just be an angry person. It would argue shit. Yeah, I agree with you. I see you

Speaker 3:          01:30:56       point. But people could also argue that that's apathy. People could say that that's what's wrong with this country is that people don't care. But I say that until someone acknowledges the fact that this system is broken, we need a radical overhaul of the system. A complete restructuring of the way we do business in this country.

Speaker 4:          01:31:15       It's called moving to Canada. It's not even moving to Canada because they're corrupt too. There's a big fucking. Yeah, there's

Speaker 3:          01:31:21       a big scandal. The Minister of Finance, I believe it was involved in a big scandal in Canada. People are corrupt. It's human beings. People are less corrupt in places where people are less ambitious like Canada, where people are more laid back and friendlier, you know, and that's one of the things that's cool about Canada. People are just like, they're less crazy up there. They're a little cooler, a little calmer, you know, I think that I think, you know, you could waste your whole life trying to understand the system and be a part of it and argue and go to court and it will become your everything. And it's a system that we're born into. We're born into this system that we did not choose. We have no control of and it's so comprehensive

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       and so fucking intertwined that just to study a single branch of it would take up all of your time if you just wanted to understand the stock market. That shit would take up every fucking hour of every day of your life. Just trying to figure out how all that shit worked and even then look at that fucking guy that, that, that, that Bernie made off. Motherfucker. That guy was ripping off people who understood the business. That kind of ripped off everybody. He ripped off millionaires and shit. He ripped off fucking Steven Spielberg, you know, he ripped off all these like really big name people. So that means nobody knows how it works. Nobody understands that thing. Could you imagine if your whole life is dedicated to studying the stock market? You're supposed expert people ask you for advice. Anyone you got fucked. You could say God damn con game. Nobody understands it. Fuck politics. It's not politics. We're talking about now we're talking about the whole system. We're talking about money, we're talking about everything and we're talking about this attitude of fuck politics, just like what, what can be done? That's the big question. What, what can be done to make the world better? If you had any say in, you know, trying to figure out what direction we could go to make everything easier for everybody. What would you do?

Speaker 4:          01:33:16       Have everything be a lot. Make a lot more sense. Because right now everything from the schools taxing. Do you know everything about the government makes no sense to the average person, but if they can have like a website, you have to go to everyday and go, okay guys, today's topic of the day. Do you think that slavery's legal? Yes. No. And then have the whole country vote right there. Make it super planned out and easy and make it something like that. Because right now no one gives a fuck what's going on on, you know, you started talking about it

Speaker 5:          01:33:46       occasion and money and stuff like that. Then you get into really complex subjects. It's not that simple as like having people vote because then he runs the same issue, like people just put out propaganda, Oh, if slavery is not legal, that means the Iraqis will attack us and they'll rape your baby and next thing you know slavery's legal again.

Speaker 4:          01:34:05       Yeah, I know, but it shouldn't be. It should be a vote though system because right now it's like no one gives them online.

Speaker 5:          01:34:12       Like if there's a vote online, whether or not you should be killed tonight. Right now, if people watch this podcast, maybe 60 percent of the people would want you to.

Speaker 4:          01:34:19       Obviously that's how crazy they are. I know that. That's true. It is like allow penciled out of the way all this shit's all broken anyway. You can't fix it. No matter what. Me read bad things about fucking any of it doesn't matter. It's going to happen the way it's going to happen. Just called yourself by your Internet name. I know. That's what that. From that, from that thread, everyone's. Everybody was calling me and I get third person cares about a red band. You know what? Raymond was designed for? Mac, computers and cats and you know I agree completely because who the fuck cares? I can't change anything and even if I could one person, I don't want to devote my life to see if I could or not, I don't give a fuck about that. It's like baseball and it

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       was a real problem is it does take away from everything that you enjoy and people say, well, you have to fight for your rights really to you just have your rights. That's the real God damn problem. The real problem is that I have to think about this fucked up system. Not all that. It's so broken. You have to keep an eye on it 24 hours a day because people are just stealing and getting us into wars and making terrible decisions and they'll blame it on all these troubles that are happening in other countries. But when you start fucking reading into it and you find out the shit that we do that causes all these troubles, you know, God damn. No wonder why everybody fucking hates us. We got our dirty little fingers in everything, so it's like, it's not me. It's not me that has my dirty little fingers in Afghanistan and Iraq and you know, and fucking all sorts of shit that goes on in third world countries and it's not you either.

Speaker 5:          01:35:42       You should be able to fucking pursue what you want to do and the idea that you have to go over there and kill some people to do that. It's just damn. In 2010, we pretend like you go to Australia. Like when we went to Australia recently, dude, people in Australia are so fucking cool. They're so fun to be around such a friendly culture. What if we decided to go to war with Australia? I'm not. Would that be all a sudden we're supposed to be tricked into believing that we have a problem with this continent that we'd never been probably happened in our lifetime. If it didn't. I mean it's because we're going to war together as a group against some other motherfuckers. I mean, that's really the only reason why we're not. Because we've decided to band up and go jack these fools and take their shit, but it's, it's, it's amazing that you know, our system.

Speaker 5:          01:36:25       There's no other system though, I mean when you get 300 million people in place, what the fuck? There's no other model of how to run a 300 million person empire and to do it correctly where people think it's fair because people are just. It's part of life is an intelligence test and part of the intelligence test is how susceptible are you to manipulation. You know what I mean? Literally it's like a game. It's like there's people like these evangelists that you see, you know, at 3:00 in the morning that are fucking talking a certain cadence and especially that black guy with a hot dog rolls in the back of his neck. You know, that guy I'm talking about that motherfucker is always, you know, spouting out some Bible Shit, but he's doing it so charismatic and he's sweating like a pig and everybody in the audience is going bananas and it's an intelligence test.

Speaker 5:          01:37:08       Intelligence test is, do you believe this guy is so confident and speaking so clearly? Do you believe what he's saying? Because if you do, you're a dumb ass. You know, he's just tricking you by being so confident in what he's saying. And that's what it really is. It's like this whole, this whole world is like a gigantic intelligence tests and even at the highest level people are failing left and right. If you start getting into these, the, the, the, you know, the Republicans want to control the house and like, what the fuck are you talking about? Like, look what you're talking about. You're talking about nonsense. If everybody just stepped back and said this is all nonsense, this whole thing sucks. Stop. We're not going to fucking keep going with windows 95. Shut the fuck up. Okay. Windows 95 sucks. We need some new shit. Okay. Do you have empty? Do you have windows? 2,000, whereas Vista, whereas windows seven,

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       you motherfuckers. Where's MCA? Wes knows me. Those dark dark time in American history. You know, we need a better operating system. And the problem is we don't, we just keep patching up the same stupid fucking system we've always had. So what do you do? Do you just sit back? No, you don't move because you moved. They're going to be under control of some other mothers.

Speaker 4:          01:38:15       I look at it, it's like if you have a neighbor's dog that's barking, you know, you can either sit there and deal with it for as long, but once it gets too bad you have to do something about it. And so that's how I feel about it. If I still wake up and everything's fine, nothing's really affecting me on an everyday basis, enough to care about it, then I'll be fine. But if something crazy happens, like they decided to do something that's going to affect me, then I'll just be like, you know what? Fuck you. I'll move on because I don't give a fuck. Like I'm not like United States or for, for the rest of my life. I don't care. You know, like I'm sure

Speaker 3:          01:38:47       move a bunch of times, move around a bunch of times in this country you realize the United States doesn't have one mentality and then when you move or when you travel to other places, you're like, God, I could live here, can easily live with. It's a huge planner. Dude. England is pretty dope. I like living in the weather kind of socks or rains a lot, but to the people you fun. I enjoy it there. I love doing shows in England. England is fucking fun. You know you could live in England, you can live in Australia, you'd have, you would have no problem in Sydney. Do it. You'd have to wear sunscreen. That's it. They get no ozone. Layer it up there to. Everybody gets jacked. There's skin cancer, less ramp. They have these big ads on billboards about skin. Cancer is everywhere. It's a real problem. But do the people are friendly though.

Speaker 3:          01:39:27       The weather's beautiful. You know the fucking, the coastlines. Gorgeous. It has no problem there. No. The idea that this one fucking place, you know the from one ocean to another ocean that's like so 5,000 years ago, you know, that we're fighting for our land like Jesus Christ, especially in America, to think that where they just, when we're, you're a citizen in America, you are just like riding in the balls of the Dick. That's fucking the world. You're just a part of this gigantic machine. It's just bone in the world. You know, two planes come over here and smash into buildings and we lose our marbles and we wind up killing a million civilians in Iraq and justifying it that we're keeping ourselves safe over here. It's fucking nuts, man. What's the answer? God dammit. What's the answer? Internet people. What's the answer? Twitter people. There's No God damn answer. There is no god Damn fucking answer. It doesn't exist.

Speaker 4:          01:40:21       You lose your marbles. You can't buy new ones because they don't make them anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:40:25       Yeah. The marble industries. We're at A. we're at a businessman.

Speaker 4:          01:40:31       Yeah. Pretty soon. I think it's almost going to be like how the Internet, uh, kind of like in the old days I wasn't talking to people from England every day in Australia and that kind of broke that wall. I think in the future there's not gonna be like, well, it's religion kind of fizzes out fizzles out a little bit more. I think even just countries are going to fizzle out more because we're probably going to be just teleport into Japan every day. You know, like, Hey, every go to Japan, I'll be

Speaker 3:          01:40:53       right back to me. Definitely dissolved. And the only thing that keeps us in this one, this one idea is travel, another difficult to get in planes. Then when you land, you have to be screened for what's the next plan plan. Plan. It's probably going to be sending our brainwaves to another body in Japan that we have like a backup body and if we get to a position or we talked about before, like we talked about, like twitter and facebook and this connectivity that people share right now, it's like we're connected so much more now than we've ever been before. If we really do get to a place where no secrets will exist, where everyone will know everything, you'd be able to read each other's mind will be able to access each other's information. Maybe that's the only way we'll ever really have like a real government will really realized that we really can't bullshit things that we used to have to come clean about.

Speaker 3:          01:41:43       The fact that we live in a dictatorship that's dressed up as a democracy where these gigantic corporations are making millions of dollars because we just have to just, just accept the fact that we're under their rule the same way they accepted the fact when they lived, you know, in England they were under the rule of the king and you know, and all these different countries that are controlled by, you know, by monarchs, they have to accept that it's clean and then they know what the fuck it is. Like in Thailand there's a Goddamn Qing period. That's what it is. There's a king and you got to deal with that shit. You can't talk shit about them and maybe it's either that or we realize we can't do that anymore. We realized we can't live like this anymore. Maybe that's the only thing that's gonna save us. Maybe this technology, you know, maybe it'll get the people who are actually running things to realize how ridiculous it is when everybody knows they're bullshit.

Speaker 3:          01:42:30       I don't know man. It's a fucking. It's a tricky situation. You know, student, we are completely headed towards an age for lies and deception will fade away. Yet we will never understand all of everything. I think that's what we were just talking about. So that's contradictory. Yeah. Yeah, it is. But we're just talking about what's, what's here right now and you know what, what may or may not be possible in the future. I mean, the idea that we're gonna get to an age where everything is connected. That really is speculation, man. I mean, we don't really know if we're ever going to get that far. We don't know if we're going to get hit by a gigantic meter or fucking polarized caps or shift or when you look at the history of the earth, who the fuck knows what the hell's going to happen to us?

Speaker 3:          01:43:08       You know, there's always some new shit going down. No, you know what the nuttiest thing about, about like I was watching these solar system documentaries today, the nuttiest thing is how many different planets had been hit by planets. You know, like they were. There was a thing on uranus about how they recognize those rings around your anus and they believed it was some sort of a collision and they were talking about moons colliding. Then eventually your ransom Williams there, they're real close to each other. Eventually in a slam I knew each other like, damn. Imagine if we realize that earth was getting hit by a planet. It was like 100 years away if we saw planners. Yeah, I mean how long would it take for a planet to hit us? I mean like I think they were saying that your readiness is a year, like a year and your readiness is like hundreds of years. I think it was 160. I don't remember what it was. It was a bunch of years. They're there. Their winter alone was like 60 plus years. I think that's what they're saying. How, how many, you know, that's a long ass time. How many years would be able to recognize like if a plant was headed our way, like if there was an inter inter solar system, intruder a got like a plant that's in another,

Speaker 2:          01:44:15       the solar system. It's coming, it would be faster. It just seems like it would just happen faster for some reason, even though it probably isn't, but why would it seemed like that if it takes a year for the earth to go around the sun, right? Doesn't. That was not what the whole deal. I mean it's like it's, I guess spins like asteroids. It goes around the sun and heat

Speaker 3:          01:44:35       year. Right? That's pretty God damn close and it takes us a year to go around. If some shit was coming in from another planet, it wouldn't come that fast. What it. Unless we're moving towards it as it's moving towards us. Who the fuck knows? The point is that's happened that literally has happened to Earth. There used to be earth one which was just a different planet and then it got hit by a planet and that created the moon fucking nuts, man. We that, that would end all the bullshit. All the tiger woods, all the Jesse James, all the fucking healthcare and tea baggers and you know, rush limbaugh and Glenn back, all that Shit would just stop. If we saw a giant planet in this guy that got a little bigger every day, whole Lee fuck, could you imagine

Speaker 2:          01:45:20       it? Probably be pretty cool if it wasn't going to hit in your lifetime. Now it probably be pretty sweet, like look at the death moon comment section to be used. Just die of heart attacks and then other people would just go raping and pillaging and murdering. That would be a bunch of different things would happen. It would be people that would live like just savages. They would just commit all sorts of incredible atrocities and steal and do all kinds of other shit and then there'd be people that would just become total hippies. Just have orgies and probably what people want to trade route. Imagine. Really you think so? Some people would probably be like nine slash 11 times a million. Just being sad and probably be so many specials on tv about it. Song religion would pick up. Look motherfucker, oh my God.

Speaker 3:          01:46:05       Figure out some passage in the Bible that related to this and that they. They figured out a way to to to, to connect the two of them together. God, Dan, that would be incredible. That would be the. That's. That's so possible. That's happened. It's happened in other solar systems. I'm sure it's happened here. You know, it can happen in our lifetime. That would be fucking bonkers, man. If we saw like it was 10 years away, like we have a real issue, would they even tell us there would be rumors on the Internet? I don't think they would tell us. I don't think anybody was talking about it. What are the questions? We'll go to this bridge. I think my cat just took a shit in there so I might smell her last scratching. But you're a cat man. Anyway. Hey, mayhem. Miller 12. When you say Joe was being a Dick, I'm telling you it's distracting to me and it keeps me from able to do in this podcast. Well, I asked him to not do it. So you're being a dick.

Speaker 1:          01:47:09       I wasted my question. And religious bullshit. Marbles are not dead. Wow. The marvel world is still huge apparently. Okay. Let's go with the questions. Here were the best substitute for the current monetary system. This dude wants to know who the fuck knows, right?

Speaker 3:          01:47:27       You can't. I don't think you can have shit out there and the fucking numbers in computers that can't. It's got to represent something. Right. That's the problem with money is it doesn't really represent anything, you know, kind of represents more ideas and anything. It's not like one piece of gold, you know, is $1 and you know, and that piece of gold was sitting in an account somewhere and you can go, you know, cashier, $100, billion for 100 pieces of gold, you know, the, it has to mean something. You can't have it. Just all numbers in computers because people will just can fuck you. You know, like you've been going through, I don't know how much you want to talk about this, but you've been going through some bullshit with the irs where they, you know, they audit you and fuck with you and go into numbers and like storing numbers and how much numbers did you put on this and how many numbers went to that? And politics to me

Speaker 1:          01:48:20       is it, my brain does not care about any of that shit, but that's how I've always been like that. Anything that I'm forced to do almost, I almost don't care about, you know. Yeah. Well that's sort of one of the reasons why, you know, people sort of become artistic in the first place. You know, I think one of the reasons why people would call artistic is because you know, you're, you're

Speaker 3:          01:48:41       fighting against a bunch of shit you don't like and you, you go against the grain and you wind up doing something that's totally unconventional, you know, that's how people come and positions and comedians and artists and stuff on the side street path. Yeah. That's why it's so weird when like a comedian enters into the world of politics or something like that. Like Al Franken. Franken. Yeah. That's strange. But that dude is like a serious historian, you know, like that seems like it's sort of like a project for him. Like he really knows a lot of shit.

Speaker 1:          01:49:12       What about our kids? I don't know. What about our kids, man? What the fuck is going to happen? What is going to happen? No one knows, man. It's a strange world we live in. It's a strange world. That's the weirdest thing. When you have kids, you start wondering like, how is this little person going to be survive? How they're gonna? How are they going to be happy?

Speaker 3:          01:49:31       This crazy world and it gets nuttier and nuttier and more goddamn earthquakes. You know, earthquake in Baja, Mexico a couple of days. Big One in Indonesia today. I mean, we have an earthquake's everywhere. Dude. It's getting really weird, right?

Speaker 1:          01:49:43       Yeah. It's like that. Whoever opened up the treasure chest from Indiana, raiders of the lost

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       Ark, you know, it seems like some fucked up. I haven't

Speaker 3:          01:49:51       weird how many people want to think that it's because of like a US government experiments that they're creating earthquakes. Like how nutty is that? How it is. That idea that the US government is like, I know that we need to do. We need to just start causing earthquakes everywhere. Stupid. It's hilarious though. I mean, it's hilarious how many people want to believe nobody. Shit like that. When it comes to anything that's happening, they always want to find someone, some human who's pulling the strings in some gigantic diabolical scheme, you know, that a diabolical scheme with an earthquake machine that just pointing at it all these third world countries and just fucking people up. Like how hilarious is that? What a, what a, a ass way to look at the world.

Speaker 3:          01:50:30       No, I don't think that's what's happening. I think that the earth is getting very pissed off at us. I think, uh, you know, it's uh, it's about time. It's shaken us off. No, not really consciously, but I think surely like this just happens, you know? I mean, look at what's going on in the moon. There's creators all over the moon and that nobody ever did anything bad on the moon. The moon is just a, another little planet. Shit happens. Volcanoes erupt all over the world. Earthquakes happen. You know, the topography of lifeless planets constantly changes. You know, it's a. is it, is it

Speaker 2:          01:51:03       that we're having more earthquakes right now or is just that we have twitter?

Speaker 3:          01:51:07       It could be that too. Could be that. Yeah. I don't really know, to be honest with you. All I know is what I'm hearing that I'm hearing about them more than I ever heard about them before, but I've not. I've done looked at it at all. I've done no research. It does seem like we're hearing about it way more than we ever heard about it before. Yeah. We also more information pumped through our eyeballs every day we've ever had in our life. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:51:30       Ten years ago I would only have found out on my laser disk player. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:51:36       Well, you know, you would have found out 10 years ago if it was really big newspaper people will be paid below up my pager. I found a page of the other day that I used to have that my dog had bitten into. It's all fucked up. And Jack Solaris. Yeah. I don't know man, you know, I got no answers to that. I don't know if it's, uh, it's happening more or just more information, but there's definitely more information, that's for sure. That's 100 percent. Whether or not the earthquakes are happening more just seems like they are, man. Everybody's scared. I'm about to lose a shitload of viewers. Last starts when you know what, we're about two hours anyway, and that's why the way we like to end it, so we'll have one more topic. Try to end it well, and then we'll close it off.

Speaker 3:          01:52:24       Is it weird that you're so into conspiracies, but hate movies that have a twist ending? I hate movies that have a twist ending. I love fucking movies with good twisty ending that I didn't see comment. What I don't like is when movies faked me out and they say, oh, it was just a dream that drives me bonkers and I'm not really into conspiracies. I'm into the real concern there. Real things that people have conspired, like Enron and you know, I mean, the problem with the whole term conspiracy theory is you bring it up like someone saw talks about conspiracy theories and they bring it up. All the automatically. You any rational person, any thinking person does not want to be associated with conspiracy theories because conspiracy theories make you seem like a loon conspiracy theories the way it's been labeled make, make it seem like you're a silly frivolous person that you believe in ridiculous shit. You know?

Speaker 2:          01:53:12       Yeah. Well, I think if you just tag it with the conspiracy theory name, but I think if you don't believe that conspiracies, but you think that's an interesting approach to an idea or something like like people that just think nine slash 11 was done by our own government and they don't think anything else in the and stuff like that. That's a. that's a sick way. I think of anything. You know, you should never put all your eggs in one basket type

Speaker 3:          01:53:35       that putting all your eggs in one basket is a real problem. We've talked about that before with our friends, with, with certain subjects. People love for there to be mysteries that they can unsolved. They love for there to be some hidden information that they can unsolved, whether it's about nine slash 11 or about anything, but the reality is, you know, unless you like really, really, really researched shit, most people were just talking out their ass when it comes to subjects and when you do start researching shit, you realize, well you can't just blanketly discount or discredit all conspiracy theories just because it seems like a ridiculous thing because a lot of them are fucking real. The Gulf of Tonkin, the fucking operation. Northwoods. There's a lot of different shit that the government has done and different companies have done. Cigarette companies have conspired to, you know, to, to hide the facts about tobacco and to make sure that people keep smoking them and people were addicted. This motherfucker's hook, line and sinker with the cigarettes. You're locked in. How many smoke today? Three. Does that drive you bonkers?

Speaker 2:          01:54:37       Yeah, because it's relaxing when I smoke a cigarette, but you don't worry about it. Every time I smoked a cigarette and my, my ellipse caught on fire, then I would hate it. Well, what about like our friend that just died, you know, stuff like that. Thinking about your body just given out on you and that doesn't drive me now. Well I think it does to a point definitely. But I also think like, shit, I might have skin cancer right now. I don't even know about it. You know, it's just either think about death all the time. Are you done? So the red band approach is just to live life capital might be a happy person, but everybody else fight your wars and do battle and then everyone else that find out that everyone's stressed. Do you ever

Speaker 3:          01:55:16       worry about your, your think rather about not worried, but do you ever consider your position in this world or do you just try to just live?

Speaker 2:          01:55:23       I don't think about anything like that at all. Don't think about. I think about my happiness and that that's pretty much what I think about making sure that I am. I'm happy and people are happy around me. I just wind to be happy person and I want my friends to be happy, but I do it. Do I care about any thing else about like fucking or anything like

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       that? I try not to. So when the storm troopers come, you're just going to pack a bag and run to the hills. Fuck yeah. Give a fuck about borders. They grow in joke. It's interesting because people can, you know, you can criticize that. You can say that's apathy, you know, like this discussion that we had on the board, but I don't think that they're right. I don't think they're right. I think at a certain point in time it is a foolish notion to try to control a corrupt system. It's a foolish notion. It really is. I could see both sides of it. I could see people saying, well, if everybody thought that way, there'd be no government. It'd be, oh, this is bullshit. You know, you have to fucking stand up. I could see that argument, but I could also see her respond. I see your argument.

Speaker 3:          01:56:20       I think you're right. You know, like a lot of people are already has that same argument. He says, why do I care? It's not gonna affect me. Why do I care? And in a certain way it really doesn't, but in a certain way it does like social things, like you know, Obama not going after the medical marijuana. That's, that makes a big difference to me. You know, that's big to me. Real estate issues like legalizing medical marijuana in the state of California, that's something worth fucking voting for. That was a huge thing. That's real. That's a real issue that got resolved and it changed a lot of people's lives and it changed the whole climate of California. People are way more relaxed. People are way chiller, you know, the access to weed is through the roof. It's, there's never been more access to in this country ever than right now.

Speaker 3:          01:57:04       That's a real issue that was resolved by voting. So it's almost like state voting, voting on state issues like that where you can actually pick the issue. Like that's real shit. That's real. Local politics seem to be real, you know, this is the reason why California is so in depth. We got an actor to be the governor. You know, we went with a dude that seemed like, you know, it was a no nonsense and we took this fucking dude. We was an action film star and we made him the governor and Shit. Just hit the fan, hit the fan running. You know, it's fascinating, you know, because politics are local level seem to be real. But politics on a national levels. Yeah, it's not, it doesn't seem very fucking real. The end. That's the end of this podcast gentlemen. Brian's good for two hours. He starts fading. It needs a, he needs his coffee in a binky.

You got to mention it everywhere and you've got to tweet a lot of interesting shit. But once you do, man, it's so important, like for prefer promoting gigs and for letting people know like shit, you're doing like, Hey, I'm going to be in this town like this. The best way for people to find out what you're doing, you know, there's no better way to promote things, you know, and who knows what the next stage of that is, easily consumable, easily consumed. But Ladies and gentlemen, this is easily consumable. I hope you enjoy this. This is the end of this week's Ustream podcast, and we will see you next week. Thank you. Love you. Bye.
