Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Five, four, three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       And we're live with Justin Brown. Justin, first of all, I'm very upset that gave you such a small badge. What's up with that? Yeah. And it's nice and tiny. They're not law enforcement. So seems like you should have like, like you've, there's some badge there. The summit forcement, right? Sure. It looks like it doesn't it? But yeah. No law enforcement on my end. And just the biologist. Well, listen man, I've, I read about your work in um, uh, an online article. I don't remember where it was, but about coyotes in the urban area all around Los Angeles and I've been fascinated by this since I moved to La. The first time I saw a coyote was in 1994 when I first moved here. I was in Burbank and uh, I had an apartment and you know, one of those, um, those uh, pre furnished Oakwood's gardens apartment on all of the street, you know, where that is not the top of my head, but it's where people always, when they transitioned to La, they get one of these pre furnished apartments.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       He. Anyway, yeah. I'm driving up olive and I saw these coyotes and is the first time I'd ever seen a coyote and I was like, this is crazy, like this is in Burbank, this is in a residential area, and they were just hanging out and I pulled over and I stopped and I rolled down the window and I, oh, staring at them and they're staring at me and they didn't give a shit about me. They were so calm and they didn't run and I just remember thinking this is so strange. He's like wild dogs that live like right amongst us. And then from then on I've had some encounters. I had a coyote steal a chicken for my yard. I watched him hop the fence with the chicken in his mouth if quite a few encounters with coyotes, but I'm, I'm absolutely fascinated by them.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       I mean, they've been amazing. I've been working with them now for almost 15 years, actually a little bit more than that now. And I've seen him do some amazing things. I mean, they're able to live in some of the most urban environments we can imagine. I mean, I'm tracking them right next to, I don't know if you know where the West Lake neighborhood is in downtown la, but if a coyote running that neighborhood, which when I first drove through there, so I worked in Chicago for a long time. We were tracking coyotes and some incredibly urban areas. They're like, right along the lake shore drive in Chicago and, but in Chicago there's some green spots where when you get down in La, there's not a lot of open spots, vacant lots and stuff. Um, but I tracked this coyote for about nine months down there in that area and she was just amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       Like she was running the streets. She kinda hang out in these little vacant lots. And what was even more amazing is that no one was really complaining about her. We actually talked to people and some of the houses and stuff they were actually fascinated to see on versus being like they're in my backyard where they do it. Well. People have always had a weird relationship with coyotes. I had, um, Dan Flores on the podcast last month who's the author of Coyote America. And uh, he's a, uh, wildlife historian and it has just some amazing insight until like the relationship to cody's had way back with the native Americans, you know, they thought they were gods and a lot of ways. Yeah. I actually listen to your podcast with Dan. That was great. Dan's some pretty interesting facts just in his book in general, things I didn't actually know about before.

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       It's kind of Nice to have a historian tie in some of the facts I could get lost, ask lots of questions about where the coyotes came from, how they're moving around. Um, and so it's nice to have something like Dan's book to kind of reference people to. I think most people in the downtown La probably welcomed something like caio because it's kind of cool, you know, and have this thing I can't get around as long as you don't have a dog or a cat that it's snatches. Yeah. And that's definitely the case. A lot of people think it's cool, but they do cause problems. Um, I'm actually dealing with one in Silver Lake neighborhood that keeps going up to people walking their dogs and trying to. It's got a den in somebody's backyard is actually deneen under their deck. So the decks open and she put our seven pups underneath this den.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       Yeah. So it's pretty crazy. Um, but she would basically, but he gets closed with a dog. She comes out and tries to run them off. And this is pretty common during pupping season. This is the time when most people have issues with coyotes because they're trying to protect their dens. I mean we're all obviously protective of our offspring, so they think that the dog is going to find the pups and kill them or something. Uh, I mean we don't really know why they're doing it. We assume that's probably the case. They come up and they, most of the attacks have been where they just come up behind the dog and start trying to like nip it. It's back and the dog, the people move on, people freak out. Um, as far as I know, there hasn't been anywhere that I would actually like draw blood on the dog, so it's almost more like, it's like get the hell Outta here.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       Right. So they're just scaring them. They're not trying. They're not actually being predators. That's what it seems like for the most part. I mean they definitely do kill a little dogs. Many occasionally end up fighting with big dogs as well, but that's rare. Wow. So these, what are they eating? Like especially the one in downtown? Yeah. So that's, that's interesting. Um, we've actually been doing this study using, working with a bunch of citizen scientists and I don't know if that's the story you read or not, but we're basically having people collect coyote scat from around downtown La and they were actually breaking. The coyotes got up to look what's in it and we're seeing a huge variety of things. I mean, lots of fruits and stuff. They were actually big time into vegetation, vegetation type stuff, a lot of fruits and an urban environment. Obviously we got peaches and plums and all kinds of crazy fruity and stuff that they take advantage of, but they're also eating rats and squirrels, cats, um, insects.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       We see things like earwigs and those big old potato bugs we'll see eating almost anything you can think of. They're taking advantage of human trash. Well, I, I've had him in my yard for a long time and one of the things that surprised me is how much coyote scad that I find with berries in it, like I didn't know that there were omnivores. They really are omnivores then. It's not like a, like a dog or a cat. I mean they pretty much everything. Yeah. I mean coyotes can take advantage and that's why they're able to live amongst us. I mean, because even when there's not a lot of prey available, they did, they, they're able to take advantage of these different fruiting trees. Yeah. You know, I was talking with a friend about it and he was saying that he hates them and he wants to kill them all and all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:05:51       And I was saying, but yeah, but ever noticed that you don't see any rats, like we hardly have any rats, like it's so rare that you see a rat or a mouse in my area. And I think a big part of that is because you hear coyotes all the time and I think they're eating them all. I mean they definitely take advantage of it. Maybe there's other predators to. I'm not sure where you live exactly. The owls and hawks and stuff, cats and all those different things. Definitely have of those praise. Well, but yeah, coyotes, I mean they're amazing. They are really are fascinating animals. So this, this one that got to downtown La, do you know, like when it arrived, I don't know when it arrived. So I, I kind of drove through there looking to see where I might be able to call her a few animals so we could kind of see what's going on and how these animals are persisting down there and actually do that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       Uh, how do I see of where they're possessed them? Oh, how do I call her? Um, so first we have to capture them. So we'll put out traps will capture them and then once I get them in a trap, I'll go out with a poll, I'll pin them to the ground and then I'll hold him down. Jesus, I'll, I'll put a muzzle on them and hold their feet together and then we'll throw a collar on him. We'll take blood to look for disease. You don't triangles, we don't tranquilize them. Wow, that's crazy. Yeah. They actually go very docile. They're a lot like a dog. Once you kind of show them that you're the dominant thing, they kind of just lay over and you start to be careful. Obviously they can turn and bite you if you don't muzzle them. But usually once you get them down that first time they usually just lay there until you're done.

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       No kidding. And it usually takes me somewhere 35, 40 minutes to do the whole thing and they just lay there. They're not fighting me anything to deal with that. Uh, I'm sure I do. I want to see that. That's kind of a trip. I would think that there'd be like a wild cat. Like I've had a feral cat before and I had her when she was a kitten or he rather when he was a kitten and he was like a spazz, like you couldn't even hold onto him. He would freak out and climb the curtains and Hisson sputter at you. And now it's like a little domestic cat that was born outside. Oh yeah. We do drug. Any of our cats we catch. So we catch a bobcat's. It's another study that we're doing a lot of. Uh, we've actually had a bobcat project going on since 1996.

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       And so we've been calling those guys for a long time. They're not docile. They're not docile. We don't trust them. Raccoons are another species. You don't handle those guys on drugs. Oh yeah. I would imagine they'll make you pay the price and that crazy. Like people don't realize it. Raccoons are predators. Yeah. Well they're, they're, they're definitely omnivores. Like just like the coyotes are. They actually had a lot of fruit and stuff they take, I mean, part of them living in an urban environment is they're just taking massive advantage of our garbage. Right. I couldn't just, I mean we've, I've seen amazing photos of like 13, 14 raccoons in one garbage can all feasting down. I have chickens in my backyard and this one raccoon was by my chicken coop the other day and I flashed a light on him and he walked towards the light.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       I was like, look at this cocky bitch. He just started walking at me and I got nervous. I was like, I don't have a weapon on me or nothing. I thought a flashlight. He'd be like, well, let me get outta here. He's just looking right at the flashlight, walking towards me, you know, trying to get to the chicken coop. But you'd be amazed how many people feed them because they're so dang cute. Right? Big Old mask on when people are like, oh, they're starving out there. They can't find their own food, and so they feel like they need feet on. And same thing with coyotes to. It's people feel like these animals can't fend for themselves, which is ridiculous because they're not able to make it there because we're feeding them. They're making it because there's resources for them to take advantage of. Yeah, I would imagine they probably play.

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       I mean, like I said, I think in my neighborhood they do play an important part of keeping the rodent population down, but in downtown there's got to be a ton of rodents as well. I mean downtown for people that don't know is like the only area in all of La that really looks like a city. Yeah, definitely. I mean I, like I said, I drove through there. I mean after track and coyotes in Chicago, I didn't think they'd be in some areas they are in la. There seemed to be. Everywhere I look I get photos of coyotes on our cameras or get people reporting them to us. And this one that's in downtown, it's just a single caio by herself? No, actually she's got a whole pack so I call her and then within a couple she was actually lactating when I caught her, so I know she had pups and then we ended up seeing her with five pops probably a week later and there was actually a, a ambulance that drove by and she just started howling and all the pups are out there yipping and this is all like in this little vacant lot between two houses.

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       Wow. So they just find these areas where people aren't. Yeah. And so before we call it on, the one thing I always heard is oh, the coyotes are coming in from griffith park or they're coming in from Elysian park and coming into our communities and they're just here for a night or two night causing problems and leaving. Well that's not what we're seeing. Definitely. Once we do these colors on these animals were like, no, they've got pretty small home ranges. They're kind of living just in the urban environment. They're not going back and forth while living with us. So do you feel like it's a good thing or a bad thing to have them around or just a thing? I think it's just the thing. I mean it depends on your perspective. Um, I think it's bad when people think we need to feed them, need to do these things, like to encourage them and make them more comfortable with us.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       That's not a good thing because that's when bites and that kind of stuff happen. But when it comes to the coyotes and stuff, living in these urban environments, it's really all about us. It's more about managing people, getting people to quit feeding them or quit. I mean, one thing I encourage people to do scare the stupid coyote off like because there's lots of people that have little issues that occur with the coyotes. They're cats get taken or the coyote start just sitting there watching them. I had somebody complained recently because the that was sitting behind their yard looking at their wife in the Jacuzzi. Oh Jesus Christ. So it's a pervert. Yeah, exactly. So it's like, come on like, oh, he has to do, if he really doesn't want it there, go back there and turn the thing off and tell you that a coyote is staring at their wife.

Speaker 1:          00:11:35       Yeah, you'd be amazed. The calls we get about coyotes, people just. People are still not comfortable with them being there even though they've been there for a long time. It's just people cannot get comfortable. The idea of there being a, a medium sized Predator in these urban environments, they're like the perfect size to almost get away with it too. You know, they, it's not like a wolf. Like if a wolf was around, everybody be freaking out. Like it's too big, but it is like know 40 pounds, something like that. And that's that. That's a big coyote. What's a small one? A. So our average is around 25 to 27 pounds. Wow. Okay. So you're really small. They are. And that's why I'm always like when people are so scared of, I'm like, it's really not that big of an animal. I mean there's a lot of small dogs are bigger than that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       They're smart though, man. They're really clever. One of them. He or she essentially what you would say honey, Dick, my dog and tricked my dog into a. do you know what, um, what it's like when a chicken molts they actually have chickens as well. Okay, cool. Yeah. So, uh, my chicken was molting so I had a separate her from the rest of the chicken so she wasn't in a nesting box and I put her in a cage by herself. If you let them sit in a cage for a few days, they figure out that they don't really have an egg and then they go back to their normal behavior. So, um, this coyote was too small to knock over the cage, but my massive is big enough to do it. So she literally tricked my massive into coming out with her towards where the chickens are. He knocks over the cage.

Speaker 1:          00:13:04       She steals the chicken and hops over the fence. Wild. You see all this happen. I caught him with another chicken in his mouth and uh, I was like, you motherfucker. And then I see the coyote jumped over the fence with the chicken, like he was with the coyote right next to it. He thought it was his friend, like he was treating the kyle like, this is my friend. She's cool. We hang out together and she tricked him into knocking over this small pen because he's like 140 pounds. He just smashed that thing and broke it open and she grabbed the chicken thanks pro oil and hopped over the fence. And I watched her. I was sitting there, I was playing like monopoly or something with my wife and my kids are sitting in the living room and I see the coyote running across the backyard with the chicken in its mouth and hopped over this five foot fence.

Speaker 1:          00:13:52       Like it didn't even exist just just right over the top of it. I was like, wow, that's crazy. They're girly smart. I mean heck, living downtown, they've got to be like crossing roads. It's amazing. Like I watched them walk up to these busy roads, they stop about 10 feet shy, kind of sit there listening. Then they'll peek around the corner and look both ways and then they'll run across. Well, I've heard that they understand traffic lights. Now. There was an article I read yesterday about coyotes and traffic lights. If there's real evidence that coyotes understand when that beep beep, you know that sound that they use for a blind people that coyotes understand that that means the cars aren't allowed to go and that's when they walk. Oh, I haven't seen that one. That's interesting. It doesn't surprise me. I mean there. It's incredible watching them move around this urban environment and just dealing with us and dealing with traffic.

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       Like they get around. I mean they'll come out in the street all suddenly somebody will peak out in the street to go into the car and they'll cut between the cars and go down the sidewalk like they figured out our movements and how to avoid us pretty quick. How many do you think there are in the greater la area? Oh, I get asked that question a lot and it's a hard one to answer because we don't know because they are pack animals so you could end up with easily. It could be just two animals in an area or it could be two adults with seven young or it could even be five, six, seven, 10 adults together with with a pack of young as well, because a lot of times the young from the year before may not disperse. If there's enough food available, they'll keep hanging in there until they are able to find their own territory, so whenever someone would give an estimation, it's really just a rough guess.

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       It's a very rough guest. A lot of times what they'll do is they'll just try to be like, okay, this is how big of an area caio uses and then be like, okay, there's this much area in La and throw a number out there, but there's a lot of variables that come in and it has the. Do you feel like the numbers increased over the past few years or? Definitely not over the last few years. It's possible over the long run because I know there are some reports of places that there weren't coyotes, like the Baldwin hills, there was some work done where they identify it, all the different animals there and coyotes worn in their list. So they use trail cams, like what did they use to identify the animals back then I think they were doing a lot of tracks surveys and just going out there into the field and looking for them.

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       A track service. Meaning like looking at the ground. Exactly. Yeah. And with coyotes they leave enough scat, different places. Like if they were looking hard for them they would've found them. How can you tell the difference between cat and dogs? Cat, I'm usually, so dogs get is almost always just dog food. Um, and it doesn't. These coyote scats ended up getting more spiraled inside and so there'll be really tapered on. The ends were dogs get can be tapered, but it's usually just drastically different. Huh? Why is it tapered? A, it's partially just the way their digestive system works and they're getting all this hair in there because they're eating these animals. And so it gets more and more spiraled as it comes out and we can tell them apart from like bobcat, because bobcats kind of get this, they're more almost, I don't want to call it a pellet, but they're smaller segmented and they're kind of just one side's concave, one side's convicts of each pellet and so you can tell them apart, that's actually can be more difficult for some people than the dog.

Speaker 1:          00:16:57       And the coyote. I found some mountain lions, shit wants to Santa Monica, not in Santa Monica, excuse me, Santa Barbara. And it was very disturbing because it was a rope, like a fat rope of hairy shit. And I was like, what is this from? And I sent it to a friend of mine who is a, he's very knowledgeable about animals. He's like, it's almost definitely a mountain lion. It's like, Whoa, somebody's got got here. No, it was, it was pretty thick rope, like a human sys log with, with, uh, all this hair in it. We actually have alliance study going in our mountains too. We've been calling them outlines for a long time. Sure. You've probably heard of [inaudible] in Griffith Park. I have. That's actually an animal that one of my colleagues collared. Oh yeah, that's the famous photo of the Hollywood hills. Exactly. That is an amazing photo of that enormous cat.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       Would that collar on? Yeah, that was Steve Winters with National Geographic. Got that photo. I mean, it's pretty impressive. He worked hard between him and my colleague Jeff. They did a lot of work to get that photo. And Jamie says, go and pull that photo up when you take a look at it. Now that is, that is an iconic photograph, man. You know what? I think we should have that photo in the new studio. We should get a print of that. Can we buy a print of that? You know, we're in Silica bioprinted that um, I believe you can get it from Steve Winters. Let's see. Jamie, make a note of whoever's gentlemen is and if he sells that because dad is like, that seems so crazy. It doesn't even look like a real photo because the Hollywood sign is so perfect in the background and the cat is fucking huge.

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       You know what's amazing about the Hollywood sign? There's no lights on the Hollywood sign. He got that photo because he was able to do enough camera work that he made the Hollywood sign Claire Out. That's just from lights from the city. Really. If you look at the Hollywood sign at night, it's not lit up like that. Wow. Look at the forearm on them thing. Yeah, I mean that's like a thigh. Yeah. So it's a huge cat. Yup. How big do you think that is? A big male. I think the last time. So we've captured him three or four times now and I think the last time he was about 101 20. One 30, I believe. I'm not positive of that, but it's somewhere in that area. Oh yeah. He's a good size cat. I mean, what's amazing? He's running in Griffith Park. He'd never leaves the Griffith Park General area because he's blocked by freeways and yet there hasn't been any conflicts with him and people besides the time he got underneath that guy's house living of him.

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       But Jesus Christ. That's so weird. So joggers, no one gets interrupted by him. Interrupt is a funny word. Jack is a better word. He doesn't. It doesn't mess with people at all. No. We get sightings everywhere where people report it. But yeah, we haven't had anything, any conflicts with them, which has been amazing. I mean he's four. He's got the smallest home range of any mountain lion, male mountain lion that we've know of. Like. So what is like a square mile? Is he just the park? He's just the park. I mean he goes, he's been up by like universal studios right in there once or twice. Like in some green strip through there, but for the most part, yeah, he's just hanging out in the park and dwp property next to the park. How big is the park? I wish I could call that number off the top of my head.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       Just roughly. If you had to guess who? Yeah, I'm not good with that. Yeah, like 4,300 acres or something like that. Okay. See the biggest in America or maybe the world? Urban Park. It's a pretty big park. It is. But when you compare that to mountain lions, that our main mountains, we usually think to mountain lions can live in the Santa Monica mountains, which is about 150,000 acres. So his range is pretty small, 4,300 compared to about 75,000 acres. That's incredible. And he's mostly eating deer heat, some coyotes and raccoons. But it's almost most of the, most of all of our mountain lions, all their diets, dear. Well, that's one of the reasons why there's so few deer in California. I hear that when we don't, we don't know if that's truly what's going a mountain lions, they do kind of self regulate. So the big males usually killed the smaller mills and so they do kind of control their own populations of some level.

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       Oh, that's interesting. So the competition, they kill competent. Did Not. They're not cannibals though. Uh, I don't believe they eat them. They usually just kill them. That's interesting. So do they kill them to bring the females to Asteris or they'd do them just because their competition? We believe it's just because it's competition because they're usually killing those yearling. Okay. Males killing them once they were independent. Exactly. So, um, and they also, we have had them kill a female lion as well. So really it's not that simple. Hmm. Yeah. That's interesting. And is this in the park? You found this? Yeah. Wow. So you find a dead mountain line in the park. I mean they have radio collars on them, so we kind of know what's going on now. Is there any concern, like does anybody make the argument that they shouldn't be there? Does anybody ever say, hey, you know, this is where I live.

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       I don't want this cat here. Why do you guys let this thing is a giant Predator wandering around our neighborhood? Yeah, I mean we definitely hear that but we also get the other side as well, a lot where they want to protect every lion. I mean, same thing with coyotes. People don't want the coyotes. They're coyotes. Even more tricky because we've tried to kill coyotes for a long time to try to get them out of areas and we have not been successful. I mean, places like Chicago with coyotes, I mean they'll go through and do removals, like a lot of the landowners will do removals and the coyotes has come back pretty quickly. Interesting. Though. It's really not that effective. Let me start trying to remove these animals. Yeah. Especially coyotes. Right? They're so crafty. Um, I've read a really disturbing article about mountain lions where they were talking about the number of mountain lions that are killed every year by.

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       I'm a professional mountain lion hunters that the government hires because they're preying on cats and dogs and that they said that 50 percent of these animals, this was around the San Francisco area, that 50 percent of their diet was domestic animals. Like domestic cats and dogs. Yeah. I'm not familiar with that one, but we definitely haven't seen that with ours. So this one is just got a good supply of deer and that's just what it's eating on a regular basis. That's what it seems like. I mean, even Griffith Park, that's what they're focused on. I mean, like I said, they also killed the coyotes and raccoons and stuff as well. But sure, that the other thing that was really disturbing about that article, because it was the, the author was trying to make a connection between missing children, you know, they were talking about, uh, several cases over the years where children were missing and never found again.

Speaker 1:          00:23:16       And these are the same areas where these mountain lions roaming and they were wondering whether or not that had been the case. That makes you go, whoa. Yeah, I mean, I think it's probably more likely human caused then wildlife caused. I mean, maybe we're, we're way creepier than these animals are. That's true. But do you remember about two years ago, uh, there was a case in Cupertino right near the apple campus where a mountain lion attack to kid. And, uh, the father had a fight the mountain lion off. I mean, these stories definitely pop up every once in a while. But we also have lots of places where there's lions and there's no issues, right? Our mountains, we haven't had a light, a human lion issue. I mean, we've had livestock taken, but that's about it. And we're talking our park. That gets huge amount of visitors.

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       Griffin lion will griffith, but also the whole Santa Monica mountains, so we're part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation area and we've got at any given time we could have 12 to 15 lions in there. Wow. Really? And we've never had a human lion issue besides the livestock. What is the big issue when they do attack people? Because it's always like someone either running or on a bike, is it they think that the person is trying to get away? Is it like a cat thing, like a regular kid, you know, like if you roll a ball of yarn in front of a cat that just jumped on it. Yeah. I don't think we really have a full understanding, but it probably has something to do with the prey drive because I've read a few, a mountain lion attacks on people that had to do with mountain bikes and I was.

Speaker 1:          00:24:43       I was thinking like why would they want to attack someone on a bike? It seems like a bike would be scary. Yeah. I mean, they're an ambush Predator and they're big animals so they're not used to having anything bigger than them take them on so they're not. They're not fearful of most things. I mean a lot of times when people see the lions, they don't run and so people freak out, but that's actually not that uncommon for them just to kind of sit there and look at you and judge the situation, try to figure out what they can do with you. They should eat you hope that's not what they're thinking, but most likely not. Most likely not like what are the numbers of attacks on people? Do you know if you had a. you'd have to talk to my colleague. I'm definitely not the lion guy in our office.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       Some much more focused on. Do you remember the last time you heard of a lion attack on people? I'm now and I've taught my head. I mean it might've been at apple thing or there was. There was attack in Orange County quite a while back, but that's really it. It's not that common. There's a magic number of lions that are here. This is a mountain lion in San Juan Capistrano that's been attacking this farm. A buddy of mine, Ian Mccall, who's a UFC fighter, has a friend who owns this farm and this mountain lion has been hitting this farm every now and again and the other day it killed 37 ducks in a goat, just goes on a rampage and doesn't even eat them. Just fucks them up and leaves and so what we usually see with them is, I mean because they almost always eat what they kill.

Speaker 1:          00:26:07       It's just when they kill something in a farm, they usually end up being uncomfortable afterwards because we come in, we see the situation, things change and so they don't come back because they'll feed on a deer for a week or more. So it's, it's. I think it's more of a factor when they leave those things. It's more that they just all of a sudden like, oh crap, what I do, I gotta get Outta here. Why they killed 37. Then it just prey drive. I mean they can't help themselves. They get in. There's times when they get in pins with bigger animals to things like llamas and stuff where they'll end up killing multiple animals just because they get into this pan and all. Suddenly they're jumping around making all these noises and so then the animals get excited. I made it just like dog dogs are getting after chickens.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       All the sudden the dog goes in and kills the whole flock of chickens. Right. Same type of deal. They just can't help themselves. Yeah. There's that one that's in the Santa Monica Mountains. What is it? P 52. Is that the name of it? P 45, 45. I'm guessing if that's what you're talking about. The one that killed a bunch of llamas and the woman got a depredation permit to kill the mountain lion. Then people freaked out and started sending her death threats. Yeah, got a little out of control. It's like it was really creepy listening to this woman's position because she didn't know what to do because she's, you know, she lives there. She's got this farm and this big old cat is, keeps coming in and fucking up like 10 llamas in a, in a setting. Yeah. So us and National Wildlife Federation actually started working with her to try to help pin or animals that better because a lot of it just comes to making sure your animals a secure at night.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       Is that what it is? Like you have to figure out a way to close the areas of the mountain lion can't get into exactly what did she take? Anything that complicated. We actually held a workshop for people in the local vicinity and we'll be holding more to teach livestock owners how to secure their animals so that stuff doesn't happen. Is there a way they can, um, do something that like a emits a sound or something that scares them off. So there are some devices out there that are being tested and being used in some vicinities, but nothing's 100 percent. The problem with a lot of devices, you've got livestock moving around so they're going to be triggering the devices all night. So it, it's, it's kind of a tough situation. The best thing is to try to pin the animals up so you have to put something with a roof on it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       So the mountain lion can't get in it over the top. Exactly. So when you're talking about an animal like that, like when they, sometimes they capture them and then they move them to a new area. Right? Um, that is very rare to happen. Is it really? Yeah, like when we kept our animals, we don't move anybody just let them go right back to where they are and we call our own. We take blood, we do what we need to do to them and then we just let them go right there. So it was the idea like mess with them as little as possible. Exactly. Yeah. We didn't have to capture them, we wouldn't capture them. We would just throw it. There was a way to get a color on the animal without touching it. We would do that like maybe a dark that shoots a gps unit in him or something.

Speaker 1:          00:28:48       Yeah, whatever the technology is, if it ever comes up that way, most wildlife people would prefer because the least we have to do it on. The more we're going to understand their behaviors. Yeah. I would imagine this cat and Griffith Park. You said it's been captured three times. Yeah, that's kind of crazy. This can be for. I can't remember. I'm not. Like I said, I'm not the guy that does all the lion work, so I just help out. The cat must be like Jesus Christ. So they got me again, like it's probably like I'm so tired of wearing the stupid jewelry they keep putting on me. Yeah. Why? Don't know. You might've saw the pictures to where he got. He was really sick with mange. Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. And so they got a medication and so we caught him and we have a topical medication that we can give animals.

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       We do it, the bobcats and stuff. So what we found with this mange disease is that it's caused by a rodenticides. So all these rat poisons we put out there basically ends up getting into the mountain lions and bobcats. And the coyotes, there seems to be some sort of correlation between those poisons and why these animals get sick. Oh, is that him right there with mange? Yep. That's. Yeah, that's fascinating. That is a real issue with people poisoning, um, these animals so that it also affects owls. Apparently that rat poison is causing a drop in the owl population because our are getting ahold of these rats are sick from the, the. Oh, that's interesting. Oh, it's amazing. I mean, to think of a mountain lion getting rat poison. It's not like they're out there hunting rats, but it's because they're killing the coyotes, the thinner that are eating the rats that are sick.

Speaker 1:          00:30:12       Oh yeah. It's happening. So we're a mountain lion would need a rat. I mean they might, but for them to eat enough rats, they're not just sitting there focusing around. So it's really a great source for that. So they're, they're definitely focusing more on the coyotes and the bigger prey. I can't believe there's that many mountain lions in the Santa Monica Mountains. That's crazy. Yeah. And these are colored mountain lions, correct? Not all of them. There's definitely some out there that are uncolored we can only get what we can capture. So. And so like when you make an estimate of like, what'd you say? 15. Is that what you said? That we think that's our upper size limit. How many of them are collared? Um, I think right now we're at around eight or nine. Yeah. I wish, I wish jeff was in here. He can answer these questions a lot better than me because like I said, I'll get jeff in here next time.

Speaker 1:          00:30:56       Yeah. So it's, it's so fascinating because California is such a unique area in that we are very urban, you know, but we're real spread out and we've got the Santa Monica mountains right there, like in Topanga right there. I mean to pay. I have a buddy lives in Topanga. You go in his backyard, you would swear to God you were in Colorado or something. I mean, it just, it, it seems like the wilderness, you know, the mountains are amazing. I mean it's 155,000 acres. Oh, Jamie's got a map he pulled up of all the mountain lions. Wow. We'll get them all. Jesus, so obviously the Santa Monica mountains are just. They're south of the one. Oh one basically. So the park is basically from the Hollywood hills out the point Magoo and then incorporates most of Malibu and then it goes a little bit up into the hills, but the mountains themselves are mostly south of [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       This is such a unique place to live that were so sort of surrounded by nature and a lot of ways and there's so many different places like you could go to big bear and an hour and a half and you're in the woods. I mean you are literally in the wilderness. That's a great thing about La. Yeah. I like living here and it's pretty cool. It's pretty cool. But people are super uncomfortable with the fact that this wildlife sort of interfaces with our urban environment and that's where guys like you come in, right? Yeah. I mean we're. We're hoping to help reduce some of these conflicts and a lot of it comes to what we do. It's not so much with animals. I mean with coyotes, a huge amount of the issues are because somebody next door to use feeding them and so the coyotes hanging around.

Speaker 1:          00:32:26       It's really common like the people leave out food. Yeah. Sometimes it's intentional. Sometimes it's not like feeding your dog outside. It's never a good idea. Having fruit trees in your backyard that are just dropping fruit constantly and no one's picking it up or cleaning it up. That's attract and so it's all bringing in coyotes, raccoons, possums, skunks, all these animals are coming in and take advantage of that stuff. So do you think they eat olives? Have we seen all lives? Probably would take advantage of him here and there, but I don't think it's like a super big food source forum. I haven't seen any spots. So we've been doing this diet study for a little while now. And Olives or not one that pops up regularly because my dogs eat them. That's why I'm asking. My Dog's catch them when they fall out of trees and it's the same yard.

Speaker 1:          00:33:05       Obviously we're the coyotes had been visiting. Yeah, I mean I wouldn't rule it out, but definitely if you have anything like figs, we find tons of figs and the scat. Yeah, so they really liked figs. They do and figs fruit twice a year. A lot of the varieties of figs and so they're there a lot so the coyotes just kind of learned to key in on him. Oh, okay. And probably a lot of calories. There are two former. Exactly. What are those little tiny red berries that they like to eat? A pirate Kantha maybe. Is that what it is? I think so. That's not even edible. The humans, right? Not. I don't think so, but Kyle is Canadian. Yeah. I mean whether it's edible to us or whether we would want to eat a different question, I guess. Yeah, there's a lot grind in. Exactly. They're eating a lot of things that we would not touch.

Speaker 1:          00:33:45       Yeah, no kidding. I mean they, they go pick stuff up off the road and nasty little it looks like just putting on the road. I've seen them grab stuff. Yeah, I seen coyotes. They're just, they're crazy. I mean, there's a lot of these talk about Katie's going after cats and all that and there's no question that eat cats. I've seen them. One of our collared animals was actually eating a cat in to have his pack mates were sitting there just eating this cat in somebody's front yard, which I'd never seen. I knew they. Adam. Have you seen that video of the coyote eaten the cat that someone captured in Los Angeles? Uh, I don't think so. It's a great video because this, these people from their car or film in this coyote that's right there on the street in busy la and it just staring at people chewing on this cat that.

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       Yeah, that's like Jesus Christ. We played it for Dan Flores and Dan has the opinion, he's of the opinion that a lot of these cats that are getting killed by these coyotes, like here's some coyotes just wandering across the street. I mean, this is really crazy because this is as urban as it gets. I mean, busy street and this kyle is just hanging out and so these people followed this coyote all around the street. Does it look like that as a collar? What did I say? No, no color, but it, Dan thinks that the coyotes are eating the cats because they're competitive predators. Um, so that has definitely been seen with things like fog of areas. So just chilling, eating the cat right in front of everybody. I mean, that's crazy that they actually see it. I'm guessing they didn't see it actually catch the. No, because the cat is stiff.

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       Stiff. That cat is that cat. It looks like it's been dead for quite a while, but he's just chewing on that cat in front of everybody that coyote actually you see how it's face looks kind of bald headed may actually have. And you think that could be from rat poison? Uh, with the coyotes. It's a little more complicated than that. Um, we think it's a different type of Maine they get. So we don't think that's directly tied rat poisons. It could be still, but where does, it's kind of uncertain with those guys. And some of it is because of bugs as well. Right? So Maine is actually caused by a mite. Yeah. And it just irritates their skin and they end up scratching their own for off. Oh, that's it. Yeah. Really? Yeah. I thought it just felt like it. That one cat. So like, oh, that's my friend a dude.

Speaker 1:          00:35:56       That cat is so crazy. He's just sitting there watching this coyote. Yeah. So what a dumb cat. Well, I saw a cat in the middle of a street. A coyote was walking down the street. I thought it was a bag of garbage. I was about 100 yards away and I was sitting here watching this video, go to it. I was like, oh, was going to get into this garbage? Next thing I know there's coyotes circles at three times. Walks off also. Anything jumps up and walks away. I was like, whoa. Did I just see that? Wow, I cannot believe it because even like, I know it's complicated, but I was like, that was a pretty easy prey. They could have just grabbed it. So coyote is much faster than cast. Is that what it is? Well, and that's an area. Didn't have to be faster. The cat was just laying there like it could have grabbed it at any point and I wonder why the cat felt calm enough to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       Yeah. I don't know. And why they didn't go after it. I have no idea. I think it's just, it's just not that simple that they go after every single cat. Yeah. Well they obviously don't. Right? Yeah. Now you. So you say that it is fairly common that people feed them. It is. I've just, with tracking these animals, I've been to a bunch of places where people feel like they need to put dog food or cat food out on the street just for the coyotes are the skunks or raccoons or whatever. They're feeding something intentionally out there and then the coyotes are taking advantage. And do you talk to these people? Do you have to have. So I will occasionally. Usually I just tell animal services about it and they'll talk to them or if it's somebody I'm like already having some sort of communication with, I'll definitely be like, eh, you don't really need to feed these guys.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       They're doing fine on their own. Yeah. All you're doing is encouraging them to come here. Do they get that? Do deal with some nutty animal people that don't get that? Yeah, we definitely deal with some people that don't understand. They feel like these animals are going to starve to death or die of dehydration if they don't put that bowl of water out there. So crazy. So yeah. Dan Flores had a woman who came to him and was doing a documentary on saving the coyote and he was like, I don't think you understand, like they're doing great. They've expanded their range incredibly. Like they're living in every big city around. I mean from New York, Chicago, Toronto, and that's all saying. Yeah, it's crazy. They're everywhere. Yeah. They literally are in every state in every city in the entire country except for Hawaii. Except why puts what that is so bizarre that the think that are in Queens during they've, they've found them in the bronx was amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:38:12       They've expanded their range over a fairly short time span to. I mean, it's really just since Europeans had been here that they've been able to kind of expand out and do that and that's through all this time. It was trying to kill him and all that and so I get a lot of people that want to remove coyotes from urban environments. I'm like, well, we've been trying to do that for a long time and it's not working. What is the solution then? The solution is just to sort of mitigate their impact on us. I think we need to change what we do. Yeah, I mean it's about not making sure we don't have food out there. I mean if the more food they have, it's been shown. Coyotes can increase their litter sizes and so they produce more coyotes and so it's really about trying to reduce the amount of food that we are responsible for. That's also what I read in Dan Flores is book that the more we impact the coyotes as far as like people trying to push them out and pressure them, the more they produce extra babies like it. Especially if they do that roll call thing when they scream out in the night and you hear him, which is amazing. That is one of my favorite things about coyotes, man, when I'm out at night and like, you know, like you're sitting on the deck, like having a cup of coffee or something here.

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       You like, wow, this is wild. Like they are really out here like grinding. It makes you feel you're actually out in the wild a little bit. Yeah, a little bit. Even though like you're sitting on your deck sound into music. Exactly. Tie it to going off. Yeah. Drinking a nice cup of coffee or something. It's just um, it's just, it's such a unique relationship that we have with that one Predator where it's like, I liked them around, like I would be really weird if that was a, you know, any other kind of like scary Predator, but coyotes are kind of cool to have around. Yeah. Yeah. I mean definitely. I think the same way a lot of people may not feel quite the same when they're getting in their backyard, but I know. Yeah, I get that. Yeah. I do too, I mean I'm, I'm a dog lover, I've got chickens, I've got all these things that coyotes could effect me as well, but I also realize that there's things I can do to make sure that they're not going to get to my chickens are, they're knocking on my dogs.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       Well, I have a puppy right now and that's my, my big fear is because I have a golden retriever puppy and he is like golden retrievers under if you ever had one. The early, the most non dog dogs, like they don't bark at anybody. They're terrible watchdogs. They love everybody and they just have zero killer instinct, like zero. They're just sweethearts and I'm just worried that he's going to get jacked. Yeah, I mean I would definitely keep them secure until it gets up to that 40, 50 pound range right there. They're generally pretty safe. Yeah. So now they do sometimes ambush them though, right? It happens. It's rare. Usually most of the attacks are smaller dogs. However, there are definitely cases where they've gone even after something as big as your master, if that's crazy. I mean, it's pretty rare that happens. Um, the whole coyote dog things complicated.

Speaker 1:          00:41:05       I bet you if you googled dogs and coyotes playing on Youtube, you would find a dozen videos very quickly because we've actually looked at some of that and it's just like that, that relationship's not as simple as just like they're going to go after the dogs know they play around together, but then they'll kill them and eat them. Just like, what kind of relationship do we have, man? Yeah. Well we don't know how often they actually eat them. We think sometimes they just kill them and carry them off because that same thing they do with foxes. Really? Yeah. So like gray and red foxes, the coyotes will kill them, but they generally don't eat them. Which really when you started thinking ecologically it makes sense, right? Like they're so related that there's lots of diseases they could be transmitted between them. So it's kind of a risk.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       Any time you eat something that's very closely related to you. Oh, that's fascinating. So essentially the same thing as like a mad cow disease. Exactly. Which has comes from the prions, which is we feed cows, cow material and then they get that. What is it called? Jacob's Krogh. Spelled disease. That's right. Yeah. Which is the same disease that they find in cannibals in. Um, what is it, what country is it that they find that in Indonesia? I forget where it is, but it's interesting and it's essentially the same thing. Same. Yeah. Yeah. I mean anytime you start and that's just one disease. I mean there's lots of parasites and stuff too that if you were, they transferred between similarly related species much easier than it does to say between a cat and a dog. Wow. So I mean there's a lot of spillover and zoonotic diseases between wildlife and domestic animals.

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       Luckily we have lots of vaccinations for things that I'm sure you've heard of, like Parvo and distemper, and so there's, there's vaccinations we can give our animals to take care of that. Obviously these wild animals just have to deal with it. You had distemper is very common, right? I had a dog down. Yeah. But in Parvos it's also deadly to puppies. Right? They get that exactly. A Parvo is very common in this area. We actually not just right down the street here, we lost some pups to Parvo. And is this something that's transmitted through wildlife as well? It can be a so we're not exactly sure if it's only wildlife to domestic, it's probably both. It's probably being moved between the different populations. So I mean luckily if we vaccinate well we can reduce that spread but people have to be good about vaccinating their animals.

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       So do you guys have a mandate like when it comes to studying a coyotes and when it comes to dealing with them, like what is the overall emphasis on, is it on just understanding their range where they are or is it, do you try to do something with them? So our role is to try to help protect wildlife within national park areas. And so what we try to do is we try to get as most understanding we can so we can help reduce conflicts, help reduce disease transmissions, help, just basically help the whole ecology of these animals to make sure there's not things coming into our populations that are, are going to end up affecting them. It's interesting because, you know, think like when people start cutting budgets and they start looking for like a, well, where can we reduce spending? Like there might be a few people that come along and go, hey, why don't we give a shit about these coyotes, you know, does that, does that come up?

Speaker 1:          00:44:22       I mean, that always comes up anytime budgets or dealt with. But for us, for an important thing for us is just to make sure that we do everything we can to protect our resources within our park. And so we, we have identified that this is a potential risk for our local wildlife. And so that's why we've started studying the things like the mountain lions, the bobcat's. So our park is completely surrounded by urbanization. Um, we have lots of influences. I mean our mountains are about 50 percent of it is privately owned and so there's a lot of chances for development, so it's important for us to understand how development is affecting the wildlife so we can help try to mitigate that in the future. That's awesome. Now when you are dealing with these animals and you're collecting data and information, do you guys share it with people that maybe a other peers that you have that work in much larger areas and do you find like similar patterns and similar similar results?

Speaker 1:          00:45:16       So we generally share it through scientific publications is usually how stuff is shared between us. Um, that being said, we definitely talked to other parks like it. I just recently went there to help them do some raccoons stuff. Um, and so we will definitely share information to try to help deal with similar issues. And so I was up there for about three or four days and we talked about lots of things, but one things they've had with coyotes is people feeding them out of the car. So like people will drive through, they'll take food because the coyotes hanging off nearby and they'll throw it out the car to the coyote. The coyote got so habituated to that it would just be coming up to every car and start jumping up on cars low. And so they're like, this is. They ended up having to remove the animal because all these people just ended up feeding it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:55       They would go up and scare the thing and they would, I think they even tried, I think they said they tried to paint ball at, um, but it ended up learning who they were. Like they learned their cars that learned who they were. So every time they would come up the kite, it would disappear back into the bushes, even if they tried it in their own cars, but it would still do it to their own cars. The coyote recognize them now. Over time it ended up learning to recognize the people. They're too smart. They are. Wow. That's so interesting now. And I definitely noticed that even with trapping and stuff and we're trying to capture these animals, I feel like there's times when they definitely kind of avoid the area because some of these animals had been on the air for years and so we, we try to capture them as many times as we can to keep them on there.

Speaker 1:          00:46:35       So our callers only generally last somewhere between a year and three years depending on what kind of color we put on them. And so a lot of times we want to keep them on long term so we actually understand the whole life cycle, what's going on. Um, and so we'll go in and try to capture them again, but they're there. They're smart, they kind of learned to avoid once I start going into an area, well coordinated. Dan is a big part of their cleverness. And also their adaptability comes from them being preyed upon by gray wolves and their relationship with gray wolves and gray wolves had left and then come back to North America. And in the meantime, coyotes kind of thrived. And when they came back, there was a period of thousands of years of them being preyed upon by these gray wolves. So they've adapted all these different sorts of mechanisms in order to stay alive and to avoid predation.

Speaker 1:          00:47:21       And one of them being that they expand their range. So as we've tried to kill them, one of the things that Dan was saying is that when they do that roll thing, if someone's missing the female will actually have larger litters and then they'll expand the range. So when you shoot one you think like, Whoa, we're keeping the coyote population down. No, you'd probably raised it up by like 10, 15 percent and expanded the range by a few miles. Yeah. I don't know if it's just based off the calling. I've heard that before and there's some dispute about whether that's the full case or not, but definitely because there's lower numbers, there's definitely more food resources available and so it makes sense that they would read then reproduce more because we definitely know if food resources go up, coyotes can increase their numbers. So. Oh, that's interesting because he was saying that it's a direct result of them being preyed upon you.

Speaker 1:          00:48:06       Do you think that's probably in dispute? Well, the preyed upon hot or killed or you know, removed, I mean truthfully doesn't matter how the animals, how the population decreases and the fact is that it's down. So then pray numbers go up and so then there's more prey and so then they reproduce more because Dan was implying there's a direct correlation between, there's a physiological event that happens inside the female that when the population grows smaller, their litters grow larger in response to the population being smaller, not necessarily in response to the increase of food supply. Um, as far as I know, the only things I've read, it's usually Dave associated somehow with food supply. So it was probably, maybe a combination of those factors are very well could be. I mean, it's complicated, right? These are crazy with what they can do. It is absolutely fascinating how adaptable they are though.

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       Is there anything like them? Um, I mean when you start thinking of things like crows, they can be pretty adaptable to. They can live in a wide variety of areas that through three d space they moved to the air. That's a different sort of bargain. Yeah, no, I mean the coyotes, they definitely, there's not any of has pieces the move around the country, like they have a very able to live in the most urban environments we can imagine. I mean places that people generally think of maybe raccoon and be able to live. I know in Chicago they've gone into areas where they have coyotes living and they did not have raccoons living in those same locations or if there were, they were recommends were very rare and you, the coyote seen to be able to persist, which is amazing for an animal that size. Um, it just shows how intelligent they are to be able to move around us and be able to take advantage of us. Is it because they've, they've run faster, they're just, it's probably a combination of things. They learn how to deal with roads. I mean, anytime you get these urban environments, like one thing I always like to say, so like the West Lake neighborhood, it's one of the most dangerous neighborhoods for pedestrians. Yet this coyotes running this neighborhood all the time and it didn't have any signs of ever been struck by a car. Do you think the smartest coyote is smarter than the dumbest person? Yeah. Whoa, that's deep.

Speaker 1:          00:50:11       Deep. Yeah. I mean they live in places that I don't know if I could live there. Wow. So now what city has, is there any city in the country that actually has a legitimate problem with coyote? Depends who you talk to. I mean, La, we definitely have our issues. I mean been bites. There's been other situations been bitten. Yeah. Yeah. Elysian park had some bites. There's bites down in Orange County or mine had some bites. Are they biting homeless people? Are they biting people? Take naps. What are the. It's all over the board usually it seems to be tied to people been feeding it and so it's almost coming up and biting like people on the hands or people on the leg. Um, I don't think any of them know. The ones I've heard had been like, where they're trying to take the person down real type thing.

Speaker 1:          00:50:53       They've all been more like where they're coming up and none of them, none of them have. Yes. Do you heard about the woman who was a folk singer in Canada that got killed a couple of years back by coyotes? Yeah. I actually went up there a couple of years after that. They actually got a study going on, coyotes up there. They radio collared a bunch and I went up there and helped him capture the first couple of animals to kind of see what's going on. And that's just a crazy scenario up there. It's way different than what we see down here. The coyotes first or there, eastern coyotes, so they're a little bit bigger, but they're also, they kind of, there's very few food sources up there. They're dealing with snowshoe hares, which their cycles kind of fluctuate up and down. And so sometimes there could be tons of food and other times there can be almost none, but they've learned that they can take advantage of Moose during the winter and they're actually killing Moose in the snow, which you think of this little 40 inch pound animal.

Speaker 1:          00:51:40       Take it on this huge Moose. But they're seeing it. They do these snow surveys and they're finding these dead moose that were very clearly killed by coyotes. Wow. So a full grown moose. Yeah. That's insane. Yeah. A full grown moose is like more than a thousand pounds. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's, it's amazing. I mean, obviously these moose in the winter, the snow gets deep right there. They're definitely. They can get stuck in things. And that type of scenario. How do they know that it's coyotes have killed him in a wolves. There's no wolves there. Wow. That's crazy. Yeah. I did not know that a coyote could kill a fucking moose will. And they had them radio collared. So they were able to see the coyotes at the carcasses and stuff too. Wow. So when they have the radio collar, how much information are they getting? Do they get like a full, like if you could see a map, would you see like the trail, like everywhere they go?

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       Um, it depends. So the colors have different settings, so their gps units, so there's always a trade off between battery life and the number of locations you can get. So you could, if you only cared about a two week span, you could have that GPS unit take a location every 30 seconds and you can map it out. But generally we're interested in a broader timeframe. So a lot of times we're getting. So like the Lions, a lot of times it's about eight locations a day and that's a pretty good size color on the coyotes. I usually do somewhere around six and then I'll do these little bouts where I'll do 20 minute locations a day and so then I'll get more intensity to, and then I can map out like where they come up to roads or where they do different things where they're feeding.

Speaker 1:          00:53:11       Um, so yeah, you can get some pretty detailed data on how they're moving. So what kind of a battery source are you using on these colors that you can get such a long, like how long does it like if you stretch it out the longest, how long can they last? So there's different sides of the collars and so like the lion callers are, they can be two d cell batteries in them which are just Lithium d cell batteries. Um, and those go about two years with a two D cell battery. Wow. Um, you can put them on tiny little things. I mean people have done not what gp s yet, I don't believe, but they've even done like little bugs where they've put the. So the colors have to different things. They have a gps and they have a vhf function. The vhf allows us to actually go out and track the animals.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       So when you see the biologists out there with those antanas, so you literally know where they are. They are. Yeah. So that's how like all of these observations I've talked about, that's how I see them. It's because they have that little beacon that goes off in a color and so I can track them with that antenna and see where they are and get pretty close to them and see them, what they're doing. That's incredible. So the, the, they literally the last two years with two D cell batteries. Yep. And then when the two years are up that you don't know where he is exactly the well, what's amazing about the lions is that we can recapture them. We have really good success rate getting those guys back. And so jeff's been amazing. I mean he's been able to get these animals time after time after time.

Speaker 1:          00:54:23       And that's why like a p 22 has been captured so many times because we have to replace the collar. So it's usually about every two years we had to replace the collar. So it. So how are they tracking that cat? Um, I mean there, we've done multiple things. We've gotten lucky one time and he was actually down in a hole and me and jeff were actually there and we darted the thing and it just fell asleep in the hole, which was pretty sweet. So you saw in a whole like a hole in the ground. It was kind of a, a drainage channel was kind of eroded away and he was kind of down in this and there's a bunch of brush covering it and so he felt pretty comfortable I guess and he just stayed there and so we were hiking into don't know if we were looking for a kill or if we were just checking on him.

Speaker 1:          00:55:04       I can't remember what we were doing but whatever. We saw him and so we're like, well let's try to Darden. And so I stood there and waited for jeff to go get the stuff and jeff was able to darden when he came back and the cat just laid there like we put a dart in him. He growled out us. He laid back down and fell asleep and we were able to process them. How crazy is that when a cat growls at you? Uh, it was actually pretty freaking cool guys. It's pretty amazing being that close to such a big animal. Just how far away were you? Probably from me to your wall. Oh No, really? Oh my gosh. It's so pretty. Oh my God. Do you have a backup gun or a Taser or. We carry person America Shield. Get them out there in the captain America Shield.

Speaker 1:          00:55:47       Come on. Gotcha. I would think that would actually be a good move for a cap. Right? Like a big Ole like gladiator shield. I'd probably be confused. They'd tried to Jack you run into the shield. Where is he? Nice. Yeah. I don't think I want to carry that through the brush though. Good point. No, we, we do carry bear spray. Does that work? I mean we haven't had to use it. So retail, you just use it once and tell me. Because I was thinking like I run through the hills. I was thinking, you know, I do. This is an area where I run where it's really desolate. There's no one out there and I know this bobcat's there, um, but I also now know that there's a mount line there because a buddy of mine saw a mountain lion there and it had a collar and then he heard about a mountain lion that got killed on the five freeway and he checked a website.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       Is there a website that shows you that track, like, were where the animal has been? Um, there are that we can see. We don't share that with other people, but I wonder how he found out he, he knows a lot of people. Maybe he asked somebody but, but found out that it was the, the was the mountain lion that he saw in his neighborhood and he lives pretty close to the five. Okay. And so, uh, he was, uh, explaining that, you know, like he saw it. Yeah. I mean, we don't have any cats that are up there near the five. So probably he could have probably just looked at that map that you guys put up there. Even it could have easily been one of those because there's just not many up in that area that we have collared, but they do occasionally get hit by cars.

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       Right? Yeah. That's actually one of our biggest causes. Mortality these days is them getting hit by cars. So we, we work a lot with Caltrans to try to improve permeability of the roadways for wildlife and protect them from being hit by cars. I know there was a ramp that was being proposed that they were going to put a ramp over the highway. Right. Oh, here it is. Caltrans proposes wildlife overpass on the freeway. Now where were they? Kind of try to put that. So this is supposed to be near Liberty Canyon. This is, where's Liberty Kenyon? Um, it's just a little bit west of here near a Gora Oh, okay. Um, yeah, so this, this overpass, it will be big from outlines, but also lots of other wildlife in our mountains. So we have seen that the 101 freeway is a major barrier to gene flow. And so things like, even coyotes, even though they are able to live in this super urban environment, not one, oh one.

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       And the development along one-on-one is serving as a barrier that they're not getting across regularly enough to keep the population genetics up. So genetic diversity south of the freeway is a lot lower than genetic diversity north to the freeway. Right. Right. Now for Bobcats, mountain lions and coyotes. I have a friend who works at the tone ranch. Do you know where that is? Yeah. I have a buddy that works there too. Oh yeah. I was actually just there this weekend and they were explaining to me that they had a camera trap on one of the waterholes and they saw 16 different mountain lions. Wow. They've got 16 photos of 16 different cats that are on there. A huge ranch, 270,000 acres. It's enormous ranch. Yeah. Yeah. I, um, I don't know how they could identify each individual lion. That's my first question is how to do individual.

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       Um, but yeah, the mountain lions, they can be quite a few of them. I mean, a lot of times with mountain lions will come back obviously with, especially with something like a water source there. Um, so I would, I would question whether it was different or not, but yeah, I mean it's a place like the hone. I mean, it's amazing, right? There's lots of different prey animals. They're from elk to deer to a special place. It is, it's really crazy. Just mean everything. The wildlife, the flowers, the pigs, like it's just a crazy, crazy place. It is. So many pigs there. It's, it's a nutty farm, nutty ranch and it's so large. It's just amazing. Like my buddy's like cowboy up there and so he took me for a tour to kind of see the ranch and it's, it's amazing. Yeah. Well it's the biggest ranch in California, 270,000 acres.

Speaker 1:          00:59:33       It's almost hard to wrap your head around how big it is, but when you're there and you go, how far does it go? And then you go see that third mountain range. We go to that. You're like, what? Yeah, over to the desert over. Yeah, it's everywhere. And then the water for Los Angeles goes through it. If you see that gigantic water pipe that goes through the, uh, your iphone ranch. Yeah. Yeah. And you go, what? That's where all the water goes. It goes through this thing. It's just, it's just crazy. That's amazing. Yeah. Well, it's weird that we have a place that's an hour and a half outside of La that has elk. I know this like, we're so lucky. Like it's, it's just such a unique spot a lot of ways. Yeah. It's amazing. I mean, used to be tons of elk here, right? Like all the Tuli elk, they used to cover the whole area at the stories of Tulio pick out in the San Joaquin Valley.

Speaker 1:          01:00:19       They're just amazing numbers of elk. So yeah, we'll also. Grizzly bears and grizzlies. Yeah, that's, there's a, uh, there's a town up near to home that's named after the last guy that got killed by a grizzly bear in California before they wiped them out. God, I'm trying to remember. I'm trying to remember the town's name, dammit. But the, uh, it's been confirmed that he was killed. They actually exude his body and found it broken up into pieces and one of his legs was chewed off like, wow, like you really did get jacked by a grizzly bear. Apparently we had enormous coastal bears and that's why they wiped them out. It was just like when the settlers came here, they were like, okay, fuck this. We've got to kill these goddamn things because they were like, you know, Kodiak sized enormous bears, but obviously they did a good job since we don't have a single grizzly left in California.

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       Yeah. That's one animal. Lubeck. Thank you. Jamie Beck. That's, that's one animal where people are not clamoring for reintroduction. Yeah. You know, like let's truthfully, there's no area left for them, like the area that grizzlies occurred. We've developed, turned in agriculture and urbanization. So bringing grizzlies back. I mean, you hear it every once in a while somebody say that, but I'm like, they're too big and they need too much food and too much of that food is living animals and that would be a problem. Well, even if that's. I mean, even all that, if there is no habitat, where did you put on? Like they're not sure they're not going to live up in the high mountains. That's what we have. Say That's what we have protected is the Sierras and those types of things. That's not grizzly habitat. So when we do have quite a bit of black bears, right?

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       We do, but they can live up in the mountain. They do much better in that scenario. Yeah. It's really fascinating to me how the whole thing is sort of like a, a balanced system and they all sort of keep each other in check. You know, California is a good example of that because it's one of the few states that has a large healthy mountain lion population, but they don't allow hunting of mountain lions. So because of that you have less dear but. And people will complain about that hunters, but also because of that you have less car accidents with deer. Yeah. Like if you live in like A. I have a buddy lives in Iowa. You have to drive slow because the fucking deer just jumping out in front of the road every 50 to 100 yards. I mean, it's crazy how many, especially during the Rut when they're breeding and they get silly.

Speaker 1:          01:02:40       See just dead deer every couple miles. He had dead deer on the side of the road. Yeah, I mean we're a lot different obviously than the midwest like you're talking about too. We got a lot less vegetation or a lot more lawless rains. We have a lot less of that good quality vegetation for the deer. So our deer numbers are also going to be in check partially just because we don't have the highest quality habitat for deer and most of our areas is what, what are they? Just eating grass and stuff, right? Like what are they either date? A lot of. Browse, a lot of brush sage, right? These, a lot of sage. They can definitely eat sage. There's a lot of like deer brush and just lots of variety of types of broaden and you walk through there. There's tons of different varieties that they eat.

Speaker 1:          01:03:15       Um, we actually have a couple of deer radio collared right now that we're following and they're, they're always browsing on something when I see them usually something taller. And how do you capture them? We dart them. So you do, do you set, do you trap them? And then Darden, like we freed artem. Okay. So how do you do that? Um, you basically just try to find where they're at and he's basically hunting basically hunting with a rifle. So it's a lot like archery basically. I mean we're ringing just to be like really short, right? Yeah. So somebody really good with the dart rifle and probably get up to 70 meters or so. Oh really? I'm not that person. I'm about 30 meters with mine. How many deer have you darted? I've only started to here. Um, but we're hoping that we still have four more we need to do.

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       So is it an air rifle? Uh, so there's two different types. There's one that's basically powered off of a 22 shell. Then there's another one that's powered off CEO to. Hmm. And so do you practice with this thing? How do you get good at it? Yeah, you practiced. I mean it's, it's like a rifle. You got a scope and all that so you can kind of, you get it all it in, but the ballistics must be terrible. Oh they're bad. And it's even more complicated because you want it to arch really lightly. You want to hit the end of the soft as possible because if you hit them hard, they're going to run and the drug, it's not like the drug takes them down immediately. We usually have about 10 minutes for the animal to go down and. Oh Jesus, you'll never find them. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       So it's really about like arching that shot in there really softly hit them as soft as possible and then lot of times they don't go very far. Wow. So like what's the feet per second of the dark? Oh, I don't know. We haven't, we don't have the chronology or you don't have a radar thing that you shoot it through and we don't want to borrow mine. Sure. Yeah. I want to know. Yeah, because I think that's interesting. Like what? Like [inaudible] you must have like the the drop must be huge. It is like how do you cite in a scope for something for people to know what we're talking about. Like if you shoot a rifle, rifle, a bullet goes very fast so you could shoot out into a 100 yards and it essentially is going to go exactly where you're aiming at. But then when you go to 200 yards it gets a little tricky and you have to adjust your scope because it'll a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       You get to 300 yards, it'll drop a little bit more. Four hundred yards in oud is where it gets really weird. Like you're dealing with wind drift, you're dealing with drop. So I would imagine that a dart is not going very fast so it probably drops quite a bit. It does and it's heavy. They're fairly long there. I don't know how many grains is it? Half inches. I don't know how many grains they are. They don't come those measurements and I've never weighed once. I'm not positive, but obviously because they are going so slow, they're dealing with wind drift at. Yeah, five meters, then you can start doing it. So if you're not aerodynamic either. Right? It's not horrible. I mean it's basically looks like a syringe with a needle on the end and we have some feathers on the end. Oh, so you have like flushings to make sure I wouldn't call it fletcher genes.

Speaker 1:          01:06:04       It's, that's what it looks like. Yeah, exactly. Like that. Twenty ml air for 10 point. Oh, ml dart was at me. So that's a, you can put 20 milliliters of air for the tin. That dark. That's holds 10 milliliters of drug. Oh, I see. So that's not the exact drug we use. We use one called a, I believe it's a nude art. It's a little different. It actually has a. So ours, at least the ones we use for the deer, we use these types as well. But for the deer we use ones that have a little charge and um, so when it hits it discharges basically by like a shell would gunpowder in there that trigger triggers off Jesus Christ. Wow. So you have to sneak up on these deer and then do this. Yeah. So what I was going to tell you what kind of, how we adjust for that distance, because that's the last question you were asking.

Speaker 1:          01:06:50       So the nice thing about our rifles versus a regular rifle. So you get one chill and that's what you go with us because it's air powered, we can adjust our pressure. So to account for that distance, we know at 20 yards we do two bars of pressure at 30 yards we do three bars of pressure, that type of thing. Wow. So we have a little bit more adjustability than typical rifle would. So you walking around with a range finder and then you're, you're changing it on your rifle as you go along? Yeah. As we make our decision we. Because we don't like we don't walk with it charged. We, I mean our darts in there ready to go, but we don't fire. I mean we don't have our, our pressure up until we know what deer we're taking in the distance. And Are you aiming for center mass?

Speaker 1:          01:07:34       Hip. Hip? Huh? Why hip? Because that's where the biggest muscle is. Oh, I see. Okay. So the DA, the drugs enact intramuscularly, so if you accidentally hit the ribs, it's not good. It's not great. No, it's still will probably put them to sleep. The needles aren't long enough that it should do much damage. So I'm gonna hit a vital right. I mean you can never say never, but yeah, it shouldn't, but it's not going to kill him. It shouldn't know. Um, and that we practice a lot to make sure we hit where we want to hit. How do you practice? Do you have a rubber deer that you shoot at a. We have archery targets that we shoot at. Yeah. Wow, that's interesting. And do you use a regular rifle scope or do you have like a scope specifically designed for darts now? It's a regular rifle scope.

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       No kidding. Wow. So how often do you practice in? Um, before we do it, I practice quite a few times. I go out like I don't practice daily like you do with the archery, but I practice pretty regularly when I, right before I was starting, these last two were kind of taking a break right now because they're falling and so we don't want to dart them while there. Of course I'm dragging and dropping fonds we weren't until fonts a little bigger. That's interesting. Have you ever missed one? Um, I haven't taken that many shots. Did I miss any of my shots? How many of you darted? Just the two. Just to. Yeah. And we, this is our first time doing dear stuff. So fish and game came out and helped us with these guys and which was great. And you have to dart to Moore's that would just said for more.

Speaker 1:          01:09:04       For more. Yep. And why six? Is that just like you just want a good study number that. So we're looking at roadways and trying to identify crossing points for what I mean we're not just doing dear, we're doing other species as well, but we're trying to identify where we can make improvements, things like that. Wildlife overpass in other areas. So that's why we're doing that and so we're just trying to get a sample size that we can kind of work with and the colors aren't cheap so it's, it's about resources and what we have that we can use towards the project and what and what are you trying to gather? Like what, what, what data? So it's all movement based data. So they, these are gps collars, they transmit us, can be anywhere from I think the color 60 points a day down to I think my lowest eight points a day.

Speaker 1:          01:09:48       And so it'll tell me, it'll give me an idea of where the deer are approaching the roadways and how they're moving relative to the roadway so we can help come up with mitigation to improve their ability to get across. Oh, okay. So it's all about their migration and where they're moving around and keeping them away from danger. Yeah. I mean I wouldn't quite call it migration, but close enough. That's the idea is just to help them build, to get across. Now, are they Columbia blacktail? These are not. These are mule deer in our mouth. Mule deer. No. Kenny. And are they like a pure mule deer? I believe so, yeah. The black start a little bit north of us. I don't remember exactly where the cut off line is. But so like right around here, like in the hills and like encino and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          01:10:29       Those are mule deer. Mule deer. Wow. That's interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I always thought that too because I, I've deer hunted for years and I've always thought blocked hill. But no, once I got here and started working with them I was like, oh, these are on mule deer. No, how did they make the differentiation, how they understand that there's some just physical characteristic differences and I think there's been some genetic work done as well because traditionally when you think of mule deal, you think of a large deer with a big rack. Like mule deer have enormous racks. Like that deer right there. That's a mule deer. Yep. Like if you saw one of those around here, you'd be like, Holy Shit. Like you never see a deer that big around here. No. I mean there's some decent deer in these mountains. But yeah, it's. I mean, but mule, not all mule deer, that big course where there's mule deer that are still quite small.

Speaker 1:          01:11:13       That's just what we're dealing with here is the smaller end. Do you think it's because of the predators, like they never really get a chance to get that big because there's the populations are pretty small or is it a genetic issue? We think it's a genetic issue. I mean there, this population's been kind of isolated for a long time from others, but California generally is not thought of to have monster box even though there's plenty of mule deer in this state, so it's more just the factor of what's here and so north of us is where the blacktail are and were like, where did that, what does that range begin? I wish I could. I'm not sure off the top of my head. The inner breeding, correct. I'm sure there is. Yeah. And they're viable. Are they hybrids? I would assume they're viable, but I am not positive.

Speaker 1:          01:11:53       Hmm. Yeah, I'm not. I'm definitely not fully up on all the deer literature. So what other animals are you guys concerned with? Like their, their, their safety and populations. So I mean we're worried about the whole community. I mean we do things with frogs. Salamanders, we do surveys for snakes. Um, we actually have a red legged frog reintroduction. Reintroduction. Yeah. So there's people complaining. Not enough red legged frogs. Well there used to be here and we had a, well we don't really know why they disappeared but they disappeared 30 years ago or so and they were left in one little pool in one place. And so we're just trying to help them get reestablished, do it. Don't let Donald Trump find out about this cut funding frog what we need that money to go to bankers. Yeah. I mean it's just seems fascinating to me that we do have these programs to like help out like a frog.

Speaker 1:          01:12:45       Yeah. I mean it's all better but man hours, right? A, it takes some but it's not huge amounts. May. It's one person going out and doing these projects and it's not like that's their only job. They have lots of different things they did right. So it's just one small part of their job. So they just bring like a bucket of frogs and thrown into the bushes. It's not quite that simple. They have to move egg masses basically is what they do. What they do when they move the egg masses. Do they move the mom as well and, or the, the, the frogs just develop independently and the new area. Yeah, they develop independently. They would even do that in their own area. The mom doesn't care for their frogs or any of that to bitches bitches. So when they do that, when they, um, when you drop off these egg masses in this place, so this frog will be born or hatch in this area rather.

Speaker 1:          01:13:31       And they just assume this is where they live? Yup. Oh that's interesting. So if you took a fully developed frog and put it there, probably wouldn't know what to do with the area because it would be a new area for it. It'd be like, why am I here? Yeah. This isn't my project either. So I'm not 100 percent on it, but from my understanding is that they will try to move back towards their native range and then they don't end up making it, so it's better to do the tadpoles or the eggs and then they'll hopefully stay there. That's cool. So what is the benefit of having these red legged frogs around? They're just a part of the ecosystem. We think it's a good idea to exactly it. Just trying to protect the overall ecosystem. We don't really understand. I mean we like to think we understand all this ecology and all that, but they're, it's, it's complicated, right?

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       We don't know the interaction between all of these species. So a lot of it's just trying to make sure that our full suite of species is there. So our ecosystems healthy as possible. So when you reintroduce the red frog, will there then be subsequent studies about the impact of the reintroduction of the Red Frog red legged frog? And it's hard to know at this point. I mean it's all based off funding, like there's potential there, but right now we don't really know. Sorry, let me, uh, propose this to you. What if you had an unlimited budget? What if I made Justin Brown king of the world and I said, listen dude, you can do whatever the fuck you want with the all this money and what, what would you do if you make any promises here? No, I wish I could. I wish I could. Obviously I don't have that kind of power, but of course if I did though, if I said, listen man, I'm going to give you an unlimited budget to take care of this wildlife as you would see fit, what would you like to have done?

Speaker 1:          01:14:59       Well, one of the first things would be that wildlife overpass you see for our released. If you're talking about doing things for what's good for the local ecology here, that would be probably the highest thing on my priority list because that is something that's not just affecting one species. It's affecting everything that's within our mountain range, which is fairly large hundred 50,000 acres that there's just completely being disconnected from other wildlife. So to me that that's our number one thing. The other thing is, so we have lots of issues with these poisons there. I would try to find alternatives to these poisons that are being spread throughout the environment because that's a major issue for our wildlife. Yeah. That is a giant issue when you see the main on that cat and he's. I think that that all comes somehow or another from rat poison, like whatever that happened to rat traps.

Speaker 1:          01:15:43       Like I will just use a trap and people don't like to see blood. Is that what it is? That's my best assumption because people, you try to recommend traps and they just won't do it, but there's such a trickle down though when you're using those toxins, you know, it sets. That's frightening to me because that gets to people in some way, shape or form. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, that's, that's my worry as well. It also leaks into the ground. Like there's, there's all sorts of weird effects that you can get from poisons. Yeah, and we don't even understand the facts. We put tons of toxicants out there that we have no idea the actual longterm effects or how it's gonna change things. I mean, like these rat poisons, there was a long time, they said it wouldn't move up the food chain, but we are quite clearly seeing it move up the food chain to have a mountain lion die of rat poison.

Speaker 1:          01:16:23       It's crazy too. They dive in. Yeah. We've had three mountain lions dive rat poison. Wow. And you believe it's from coyotes. That's what we think. Yeah. So one of them, they went back to a few kills that it made right before it died. And they found that it killed a couple coyotes. Uh, wow. Wow. No, it doesn't kill the coyotes. Uh, who knows? The coyotes could have been really sick at that point. And maybe that's how the mountain lion got it anyway. Exactly. So because with these poisons, a lot of times these animals don't die for four to 10 days. Oh God. So they're walking in circles. I don't know if you've ever seen like wrath walking circles that are running into buildings, like I've seen it a couple times about walking around and that's generally what they're dying. They're dying, they're dying of dehydration basically because they're just bleeding out internally.

Speaker 1:          01:17:06       Yeah. So that was actually in Dan Flores, his book is that they had developed certain types of coyote poisons that were slow acting so that they could trick these coyotes into eating this stuff and the other coyotes wouldn't know where the caio got sick from because it took so long for them to die. It wasn't like strychnine where you eat it. You watched the other one die and that that's also what rats do. Did you ever see that documentary on Netflix? I heard you mentioned it, but I still haven't seen it yet. You got to watch it. It's amazing. It freaked me out. It's nuts. Like when when they show the amount of rats that are in New York City and they show all the people dealing with them and they show them in the sewer system and everything, it's mind boggling and then they talk about how the rats will literally send a young dumb rat over to the poison and they want that rat eat the poison and died and they're like, fuck this, we're out here.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       And they all take off. Like they've got a whole system for dealing with poisons. Yeah. Well, because they did the same thing with rat poison. It's my understanding they, they kind of come through different, more for the poisoned to try to make them last a little longer. So the [inaudible], the rats will do the same thing. The coyotes do not to eat it. So that didn't surprise me. They saw that documentary. I'll have to watch that. There's no way to mitigate the problem now. I mean, the rat population is so large in New York City. They think there's many rats as there are people or more. Yeah, I believe it. I mean, I've been in little intersections down in la at night and just rats, it looks like the ground is moving at times and these crazy locations, like most of the places you go, you don't see that many rats, but then all of a sudden you'll hit this called a honey hole for frats and they'll just be like, whoa, look at what the hell's going on here.

Speaker 1:          01:18:45       I was in New York City way back in the day. It was so long ago. There was payphones and uh, I uh, had to make phone call and I was getting gas so I pulled up this gas station, put the pump in, filling up my car and I go over to this payphone to make a call and as I mean in the time it took me to walk from the pump to the payphone, I'm watching rats jumped onto the wheels of my car, like they're jumping on the wheel and crawling up and down to like, I don't know if they're looking for food or they're looking to get into the engine for warmth or whatever, but apparently people have a real issue with rats getting inside the hood of their car and like nesting there, like climb in there for the heat and they stay warm inside the hood of your car.

Speaker 1:          01:19:30       Good Lord. Yeah. I mean they're so adaptable, but they instantaneously did it. I mean, I pulled the car up, put the pump in, walked, turned around like, what the fuck? I'm not talking about like one rat. I'm talking five, six, seven rats just hopping up. And another one would hop up and one would hop down. It was terrifying because I was trying to figure out, okay, am I going to be driving, there's going to be a rat on the floor and then I'm going to hit the gas instead of the. So I'm going to freak out like a little girl. Yeah. It was terrifying. Yeah, that would be creepy. But there's just so adaptable. I mean, and it's, it's another, essentially we don't like to think of them as a wild animal, but a rat is a wild that lives in this weird symbiotic relationship with people in urban environments.

Speaker 1:          01:20:12       I mean, it's amazing there. That is the one species. It's probably more adapted to us than the coyotes are obviously because they are able to live in almost everywhere that we live. Yeah. And they're, I mean, they serve a purpose in some sort of a weird way. I mean, and if they were removed, I wonder what the impact would be. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure we'd probably have more nesting birds and some of that kind of stuff because we know that rats definitely impact bird species. Um, and who knows, there may not be, if there were, wasn't rats, whether coyotes or some of these other small predators would be around the urban areas because they're obviously another prey source know. But trying to get rid of rats is a whole nother ballgame. Good luck. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's the one that's probably harder in coyotes, theaters and nuke that city.

Speaker 1:          01:20:53       You'd have to get everybody to agree and then they'd probably move back in within a couple of years. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, you're not going to do it. So this proposed bridge across the 101, what is, is there a roadblocks as it a funding issue? Is there anybody that is against it? As far as we know, there's not anybody really against that. There might be a few people in the nearby community that's worried about more mountain lions come in or something, but we don't think that's a realistic thing because that holding capacity from as far as we understand. So we don't think that's going to be a major issue. Um, but it's really about funding. We're trying to. National Wildlife Federation is leading the charge to try to raise, I think the cost is over $50,000,000 to do this. Yeah. So it's, it's a big price tag. Um, the bridge is going to be quite wide.

Speaker 1:          01:21:38       It's going to be natural covered and it's going to ask to go over the road and the one on one both. And so. Oh, it's going to be a big bridge. So I hope wide. Is that who I wish I could call that off the top of my head. I. Yeah, sorry. You'd have to look it up. I think it's probably on that thing he had up earlier. So you probably deal with a few hundred yards or something. Yeah, I mean it's almost as wide as it is long. Oh Wow. Yeah. So it's going to be big. It's gonna also how it's going to be used for hiking during the day as well. So it's not just for wildlife so people can go across it. Exactly. Because currently there's no easy way to go from the Santa Monica is in the south to the cme Hilton, the north, which are all public property.

Speaker 1:          01:22:20       So there's no way to get across there so people can hide, they have to go down on the Liberty Canyon road and cut across there, which is kind of sucky. So how does one raise money for something like this? Do they try to have like a go fund me or do they just rely on the state budget? No, it's all they're doing fundraising, trying to get people to kick in. I believe the Annenberg has already offered to donate a million dollars matching, so they've got to raise another million to get that amount. It's all for the most part, I believe it's all from either conservation agencies or from private donations. So if you were king of the world, that would be the first thing that you would work on. As far as wildlife in California, I'm definitely for our region, yes. What about other issues? Other issues? I mean habitat protections just obviously incredibly important.

Speaker 1:          01:23:08       If we want to keep all of our species, so protecting more land is is always a valuable thing to make sure that, or at least to make sure what development we do is done in a proper way. Now when you say protect more land, would that be like buying up available private land when it comes for sale and then turning it into public land? Um, to some level I would consider that. I don't know if that would be my ultimate goal. To me it's more important to lock it up so it's natural versus public versus private. Oh. So like to stop a development stop, major developments from coming in and putting things right in places that are going to be major blockages to wildlife movement. Boulder's kind of interesting in that way where they buy up all the available property and then turn into open space.

Speaker 1:          01:23:48       So you can't develop on it ever. Yeah. They're really smart with that because they, I think boulder is an amazing place and that they've really recognized that they have this incredible sort of beautiful little community that's surrounded by this inescapable beauty of the mountains, the rockies. You don't get much more beautiful place in around boulders. Makes Sense. I mean, if you want to keep your communities the way they are, you kind of have to protect some of the land. Yeah. They're not into anybody developing there. They're like, no, no, let's not do that. It's a really wise of them, but it's amazing that they've a managed rather to go so long without being co opted by. Money, you know? Yeah. I mean that's kind of the name of the game. I mean, obviously we need developments because our populations keep growing. So to me it's not always realistic to say we need to protect every piece of land.

Speaker 1:          01:24:36       We can protect what development we do. We need to do it smart and make sure that things are protected in the proper places. Is there any other wildlife issues in and around this area that, uh, are being addressed right now? Um, I mean that's, that those are the two biggest things going on that we're, we're, we're, we're actively trying to deal with. Um, yeah, I can't think of too many. I mean there's always the little nuisance issues that everybody's trying to deal with where a coyote is in somebodies yard or going after dogs or whatever that we try to deal with. But those are the two major ones would be connectivity, um, habitat loss. And then just poisons. And are there a lot of raccoons in this area? Um, a lot. I would. It depends what you're comparing. Healthy population. Yeah. There's a decent number of raccoons if you're comparing it to somewhere like Chicago.

Speaker 1:          01:25:25       No, we don't have goggles. Larger population records. They're just much more adept there. They're just the way the landscape is a lot more mature trees, mature forest, which is what raccoons, like a lot more water. Um, which are all things that attract raccoons where we're a lot drier. Raccoons can occur within like our mountains, but they do seem to be more focused near roadways and some of that stuff taken advantage of whatever resources are there. Well, a big garbage hunters too, right? They definitely take advantage of garbage. They'll also eat lots of fruits and stuff. So some of the scats you see in your yard that you think are coyotes. They could be raccoon as well. Um, they eat a lot of berries and stuff. So yeah, I found some skunk poop. Real friend. Yeah. My friend who recognized the a mountain lion poop. I sent him some stuff and I said, what is this?

Speaker 1:          01:26:10       He said that skunk poop skunks are amazing. Like I, before I started tracking these coyotes and downtown La, I would have never thought skunks could be down in that area. There's actually a decent number of skunks like in that West Lake neighborhood. I could not believe how many skunks that I smelled. Skunk and Hollywood last night I was driving through. It could have been strong weed, but I don't think it was. I'm pretty sure it was an actual. Scott was leaving the comedy store and it just stunk of skunk and I was like, how weird that these animals have figured out a way to live right here in like right near sunset. Yeah, I know. And they're little short legs. Not Super Mobile, but yet these stripes gunk seemed to have figured it out. Yeah, they, they, they were going after my chickens to the little creeps. Really?

Speaker 1:          01:26:50       Yeah. Yeah. Dare there. Apparently they like to eat chickens. That's interesting. Yeah. One night I actually had a. We were sitting in the house, me and my wife just hanging out and all of a sudden I hear my chickens going crazy out there and I'm like, we both got up and took off running and we have a lot of feral cats around our house and I was like, oh, this thing cats are in there. We go looking around. Our chickens are flying all over the yard because we hadn't gotten out and closed the door yet because my chickens can kind of free range my yard and we're looking around. We don't see anything else and I open up the coop door and there's a big old paths. I'm just sitting there grinning at me so I didn't get anything. It didn't affect, didn't grab one of my chickens even though one of my chickens was just sitting there like looking at it in squawking.

Speaker 1:          01:27:25       It's like you should be doing trying. He was trying, but he just didn't. They're not very fast. They're not. Yeah, they're with possums. You like for me there another species. You don't need a drug to handle agent. Just you can just grab them up by the tail. Usually in. Oh really? Hold on to them. Yeah. No, you can just run up to them and grab them. People do. There's definitely. There was a guy doing his masters work on possums and he would drive around town and when he saw what he had jumped out of his car, he'd be out hanging out with his friends. You'd see a possum jump out and grab it and cram it in his trunk. Oh, Jesus Christ throat. It is trump. Yeah. That's dedication right there. What did he do with it once you got it in his trunk? He was colored.

Speaker 1:          01:28:04       He's doing kind of like what we do here. Trying to identify their movements and what's going on with them. What did they find out? Anything unusual? I don't know. I've never saw his talk. I wasn't like. I ran into him at a conference one time and we got chatting about what he did and I was like, that's pretty hilarious. It is really weird how many animals we live around. I mean, it's really weird. There's so many different and such a wide variety, especially when it comes to birds. You know? One thing that I see a lot of is, well, there's a lot of hawks in my neighborhood and we did this thing in our backyard where we had a a wrought iron fence and we changed part of it and put a glass fence and these hawks hadn't figured it out and they would swoop down and slammed into the fence headfirst.

Speaker 1:          01:28:44       We got quite a few of these poor hawks. Yeah, I can imagine. Yeah, but it's just amazing how many you find out there and how many predators and there's the occasional golden eagle in this area too, right? We get reports of them coming through every once in a while. Yeah. It's not rare by any means are super common by any means, but they come through now and when you say, how would one know whether or not you're looking at a Golden Eagle? It's just because it's really big. It's really big. There's some other little characteristics that I'm not as good with, but they're significantly larger than like the red tills, which would be the one you'd be most likely to confuse it with? Yeah, just the wide variety of different raptors and these. Yeah, it's, it's amazing. I mean red shouldered hawks once smile will be traveling for bobcat and we'll catch a red shouldered hawk on our traps.

Speaker 1:          01:29:29       It's like, oh, this is so cool. We've even caught a great horned owl once and so it's pretty neat seeing some of these animals up close. Yeah, I'm worried that the owls in my neighborhood had been poisoned because I used to have quite a few of them and used to hear them all the time. It used to hear them hooting all the time and one time I went out on my back porch and there was one sitting on the fence and it was huge. I mean I don't know how big it really was because I'm sure it was kind of freaked out by it, but I, I was shocked. It was at least two feet tall and it was just sitting on his back. I mean, at least that tall. I mean, no exaggeration, but it looked like it was like four feet tall. It looked, it looked.

Speaker 1:          01:30:06       I couldn't believe how big it looked. Great personalities are huge. Huge. Yeah. I think they can carry away foxes to study in Bakersfield that they've documented and house coming down, grabbing the kit boxes and carrying them up to their nest sites. I had a video on instagram. It's still up there that I got online of this. A owl swooping down and jacking a hawk and it's next. No. Have you ever seen that? I haven't, but I've heard about it. My one of my coworkers actually as a falconer and he when he released or what did he do? One of his Hawk's got away from him and he said the tree was as being swarmed by grade horns. He stayed there all night trying to keep the. Trying to help his hawk stay alive. No kidding. Now he's crazy. Owls eat hawks. Yeah. I didn't know that until he was telling me that.

Speaker 1:          01:30:52       I'm like, that's crazy. I mean, great horns are huge though. Check out this video because it's really nuts. Do you know how long I was? Legs, legs. Never seen that before that. That's crazy. Hard to find something even close to it, but wow. Yeah, they're amazing. I got a, I worked at cal State Bakersfield in there. They had a raptor rehab thing and I got the handle. Great horned owls. When those guys flap their wings, it's like, whoa. It was pretty crazy. I comparable to the the Golden Eagle, the Golden Eagles. Definitely more powerful, but the goal of the long or the great horned owls were pretty amazing. Our perception of them is so interesting because they're a serious predator, but most people don't think of an owl as a predator. They just think of them as some wise forest creature that gives advice on fire. They're obviously not a threat to you or me, but obviously your cat, they could potentially grow 100 percent.

Speaker 1:          01:31:46       Right, and who knows? Those people get smaller and smaller. Dog. Watch this because you see the eyes and the distance. See the eyes. Check this out. I love this video being, wow, the other arc doesn't even know what happened. He's like, what's up? What's going on? What's was that when a man. Is that a juvenile? I do not know. I don't know. They look a little fuzzy. Yeah, they do a little bit right. Especially the one in the back, the one that gets jacked act. Wow. But the way it gets jacked, it's like, boy, that thing's dead before it leaves the nest. Those claws and towns are so gigantic. They are. They're amazing. That's kind of why we want them around. Right. Rabbits and rats and everything else and also because they're cool. Yeah. Yeah. I mean now I think that's a big thing about coyotes too and I, I wish some of these short sided folks that don't want them around because they're worried that they're going to get their dog and all this different stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:32:41       Like, man, we're really lucky that we can see these things. I mean, nature is cool. It's cool to see. Yeah, well that's amazing now being in downtown La, but a lot of these people that live down there, they don't ever get to see wildlife right now. All of A. suddenly there's this medium sized carnivore running around their neighborhoods that they get to see and some people. I mean, it's funny, I talked to one person that's like scared to death of this thing and the next person's like, it's the coolest thing they've ever seen in their life. Right. And it's always that balancing act. I mean I, to me, I've always been pretty fascinated with them. Yeah, I identify more with the people think it's cool. It's just, it's really like we, we're talking about, we're really lucky we live in a very unique area in that we have this big city, huge city and then just outside of it we have all this wildlife, like real legit wildlife you can get from downtown La to 100 percent wilderness in an hour.

Speaker 1:          01:33:34       That's crazy. They were less, I mean, yeah, you can get into Santa Monica. It's pretty quickly from those spots in La and it's, you get in there and it's pretty amazing. Well listen man, I really appreciate you coming on here and sharing all your information and educating us on this stuff. It's super cool and thanks for everything you do. And, uh, it's just, it's really interesting that you get to share all this stuff that you're learning about these things. They appreciate it, man. Thanks for having folks. We'll be back tomorrow with my pal out. Magical. See that.
