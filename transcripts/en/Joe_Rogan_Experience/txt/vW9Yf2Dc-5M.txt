Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches. I'm just something has hit the Internet that I need to show you. I guess it may or may not be legit, but I decided to retire young thanks to the cheese catches later. Conor mcgregor. He's trolling you think so. Fuck yeah, there's a lot of people have been hitting me up telling me to show you and no one knows what's going on. I decided to retire young, which means like 34 eventually.

Speaker 2:          00:27          Listen man. Unless he got fucking head kick today and knocked into oblivion. The idea that he's going to go out on a loss like that to nate Diaz Hook. He's got plenty of cash. If he wanted to retire young and step away, I mean I guarantee you, he probably made somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 million bucks of the Aldo fight. He probably made more than that for the Nate Diaz fight. I would. I would imagine after he spent a fuck load of it, he's probably still got a few million bucks laying around. He's a hero in Ireland. He could always make money. You can always run a gym and be fine, but if I had a gas, it doesn't make any sense. The only reason why it would make sense, the only reason why it would make sense as connor had actually thought about retiring from mma before he got the call for the UFC. There was a point in time where he had some friends that were experiencing some serious health issues from fighting and then most recently that young man from the Portuguese guy died in an mma contest, which I think took place in the UK.

Speaker 1:          01:33          What wasn't he involved or related in some way to one of those guys that just died too? Didn't he know him? Are trained with him?

Speaker 2:          01:40          I think he trained with the Portuguese guy that just died recently. It is entirely possible in that sense, but if I had to guess, there's no way he'd do it like this.
