Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Scott adams, ladies and gentlemen, here we are. Hey Joe. Good to see you again man. Good to see you again. Um, I met you decades ago. Do you remember that? Horrible story? I don't remember a horrible story, but it was on news radio was horrible stories you remember about humiliation that day. Know what happened. So for those of you who weren't with us on that set, I had a small line, just one line on news radio because it was an episode that mentioned Dilbert. So I was invited as a guest and you were giving the line before my line. So I just came in and they said, joe is going to say this. Joe. Say you're lying and you've turned to me and you said you lied. And they said, when he says that you say your line. And of course I panicked because I, you know, I don't do this right?

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       Not An actor. So the scene starts and it's one of these scenes that runs continuous from beginning to end. It's not like a movie where you cut it every 10 seconds. So you have to do a ride all the way through and we get to my, my line and you're turning the other direction. So the line I'm waiting to hear instead of hearing it clearly, like in practice when you were facing me, I hear Walmart. Oh No. And I think to myself, I don't know what his other lines are, so I don't know if that sounds like my line or is that, should I go? And I said to myself, 50 slash 50 chance either. Either ruin the scene by saying something the wrong time or I ruined the scene by being silent when I should've been talking. So I said I'm going to go with silent and I just, I just stood there in silence and everybody, everybody got really quiet.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       I don't know if you remember why you did. But uh oh, it's burned in my mind. You were very nice that day, but you just sort of slowly turned around and looked at me and meanwhile all the other actors sort of slowly turned around and looked at me because that was the source of the problem. And then, uh, but I have to admit I was impressed because that all the actors went back to square one and did the entire scene through again, perfectly. There is very impressive if you're not an actor to watch how many lines a bunch of professionals can do without screwing up any of them. It was, it was, uh, it was an awesome kind of an afternoon. Well, news radio was a very unusual show in that we did. There was a lot of changing stuff on the fly. Like the writers come in and rewrite a line, like on the fly, like they would do one line that we do one take and then Paul Sams, Josh Lieb on these guys would get together and they go, okay, that's, let's try this.

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       Let's try this, we'll go back. But then when he went, Scott turns to you now to say this and then we'd have a totally new line for the next scene. And so we'd have to like be standing over there by the elevator going, no, that's not gonna work. No, that's not gonna work. We do like come up with a bunch of different ways to say it and then just run with it on the fly and people don't realize how hard that is. Isn't that hard? Honestly, it's not coal mining. What will you have to have the right kind of mind for them? Memory? Yeah. Sort of like when a musician

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       can do you know, 50 songs from memory. Yeah, and I'm thinking I could do seven notes, you know, and then I'm good. That's all I can remember in a row and after that it'd be just be guessing. Well, if you think about how many you just think about language itself, how many words you can access just instantaneously. Just pulled them up from your memory. You know, it's just that's what you do all the time and if you all the time we're reading sitcoms, scripts, you just get used to that sort of flow and how things go. It's not, it's not really that everything looks difficult if you don't know how to do it. Exactly. Exactly. People say that about my job as well as how do you do that? It's like, well, it happens to be the one thing I can do well and I can't do most things well, but one little thing I can do well.

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       Well, one thing that people have a hard time with the Sitcom world, especially the old school sitcom world is the audience like performing in front of the audience. This is a weird element, you know, I do feel that, well, you know, I do tons of public speaking, so in that environment I liked the energy and I like all of it, but usually if I'm speaking I know exactly what I'm going to say and even if I mess it up, it doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be specific, but that was a, that was a frightening situation because. So, so keep in mind also that most of the actors were stars, you know, there, there were pretty big names and so I was meeting everybody that. So I was a little bit star struck and you know, I was completely out of my element and that completely blew the scene.

Speaker 2:          00:04:27       You know, just me. It was like, oh, maybe there wasn't anybody else. It was just me, sounds like I fucked up. Sounds like I was looking in the wrong direction, which is totally possible. We were standing in line so you have to be facing the way you were, but. Oh. Oh. So I was looking at you during the rehearsal or something. Yeah, the setup was we were standing in line to get coffee and so during the practice you turned to me so you. So I would know exactly what you were saying, but in the actual thing we were in line. So you're talking to somebody else. Right? I get it. I get it. I get it. Yeah, man, I don't remember that at all. It's like it's so funny how like one person can remember something and it's like a big moment and then another person go, like, I just erased that.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       Well I knew that I met you and I remember, oh, Scott Adams is cool. I like that cartoon and then all of a sudden it's over. You know, it was that. It was, you know, there's no other memories in my database at a totally different experience that day. Well, it's also, I did 100 of them or 98 or whatever the hell we did. So it's, it's a weird thing as you get older too. Like I, there's memories that I just have scrubbed. I'm like, no room for him. I got new data coming in, I got to make some space. It's like cleaning out your garage, you know, so there's nothing scarier than getting together with your siblings after you haven't seen him for years and you start talking about your childhood and one of you will be telling the story like, do you remember the time? I know it doesn't matter what it is. I, I jumped on a zebra and I ran it across the zoo and they read the Ltb and the other sibling will say, that wasn't you. That was me. I was the one on the zebra. It'll be such like, you know, a memory

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       that you couldn't forget what you did. You actually wrote yourself into a scene. You weren't even there. You were watching and you, you wrote yourself into the hero's theme. That does happen with people. Human Memories really flawed. It's really flawed. Well, if you want to go real deep real fast, you just gave me the good opening. Uh, uh, I am a proponent of the, we are all a software simulation, um, view of reality and that would also explain why memories are so screwed up and the explanation would be that the past doesn't exist until you need it. In other words, the past writes itself on demand because if we're software you wouldn't have everything in the universe preprogram just in case you needed it. It would take too much resources. I might have to spark up a joint. So you just want real deep, real quick.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       I was hoping I was hoping to go that way. Do you want some smoke? The weed? I could do it for the first time. I'd be willing to try it once. Well, I don't know if I want to give it to you for the first time and I want you to freak out. You don't smoke pot at all. The truth is I smoked pot once ever was in first day of college, but I never stopped. So that's really just once. Oh, I understand. So you smoked pot all the time, so he did it once and you just kept going. I'd be willing to try it a second time is what I'm saying. I understand what you're saying.

Speaker 3:          00:07:16       Sure, sure. What you like, what has life been like for Scott Adams during this election? You, um, came into the, well, you're obviously always well known for being a creator of Dilbert, but I'm along selection cycle. All of a sudden there was, I had, you know, people that are already in contact with. They were saying, you know, Scott Adams is a trump supporter. And I was like, what? Scott Adams, the Dilbert guys and trump supporter because everyone assumes you meet someone and they're a, in the creative business, you know, you're in a creative business, your, you write a comic strip, you would assume that you would be left wing guy like almost, almost immediately.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       Well, I'm neither left nor right. I'm sort of all over the place. My, my views didn't match, you know, either of the major candidates on anything. So you're a free thinker. I like to think I'm right and everybody else was wrong. I would like that too. I'm actually, um, my larger philosophical grounding is that is informed by my experience as a hypnotist. I'm not sure if you knew that. No, I didn't know you're a hypnotist. So in my twenties I went to hypnosis school and became an actual train certified hypnotist. Wow. Yeah. One of the things you learn as a hypnotist is that the world is backwards to the way people normally perceive it. So normally you see the world as, Hey, you know, 90 percent of the time people are irrational and doing rational things, but 10 percent of the time we just go knots and we do stupid things and it's because something happened.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       This sparked, right? That's the normal view of the world. The hypnotist view of the world is opposite. The hypnotist says that 90 percent of the time we're a completely irrational and we're just making rationalizations for why we did things after the fact. Ten percent of the time we're rational. But that's only when there's no emotional content to the decision. You know, you're balancing a checkbook or something, you know, trying to pick a, you know, the best route to someplace. Um, so that's how I see the world. And so when I look at either the trump supporters or the Clinton supporters, to me from the hypnotist perspective and someone who's studied persuasion for decades, I used it in my writing. Um, I see both sides as completely ridiculous both and both of them are grounded in complete absurdity is they're just different. Yeah. But nobody knows why they're deciding the real reasons that people make decisions.

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       Our fear identity, um, you know, they have some aspiration, they've got something they're trying to solve. There's something that they're trying to work out, but the reasons we give are usually completely false. And the grounding for this is that if you think about evolution, I assume you believe we evolved. Yes. Um, there was no requirement in evolution that we ever understand our environment the way we imagined we do. And here's an example of that. You could believe that you are a monk. You know you're reincarnated from the 10th century monk like Steven Seagal. It does. He believe that, yeah, he's like a Buddha or something from an actual, like he actually got it bestowed upon him by some Tibetan character. All right, so let's use Steven Seagal. So Steven Seagal can be standing in a grocery store next to, let's say a Muslim who believes that his profit literally flew to heaven on a winged horse.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       Those two people don't live the same reality, but they both buy groceries. They both go, they cook it, they live, they survive. So it turns out that understanding your reality at an actual, you know, I really know what is objectively happening and I get it and I've got a mental model that's quite accurate. We don't need any of that. So it would be deeply unlikely that we evolved such a specific skill that's completely unnecessary as far as we can tell. You know, we do need to know that if I, if you run into this wall, you know your head is going to hurt. So there's some basic stuff, but we're probably all in even interpreting that experience differently. So there's no reason to think that the way I think of it as the way you think of it. So I see the world is this big irrational ball and I use the hypnotist persuaders skills to back up and try to deduce, you know, what's really driving things.

Speaker 1:          00:11:37       And when people said that was a trump supporter, what they meant was, um, they may have only seen part of what I was talking about. I was writing about his skill as a persuader. And what I mean is that I noticed in him the skills that I've over decades for persuasion, but I had a higher level than I've ever seen. Meaning that he is the most persuasive living human I've ever experienced. And I mean that in terms of actual technique. You know, he's, he's full of technique and it's all the time. I'll give you, give you some examples. That first time I noticed it was the very first debate when Megan Kelly was asking him the question about the insults he had allegedly said to women, not allegedly. You said them. And this is a setup that any other politician with this setup is totally trapped because they can either try to deny, they set it and then somebody has a videotape and that doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          00:12:37       Or they can say, oh, I didn't mean it. There's almost nothing you can say. You're just trapped. And that would've been the end of his campaign. First debate should have been over. And if you remember, do you remember what he said? No, I don't. She said, you said this, this and this about women. And he smiled. He sort of looked at the audience and it looked like or the camera. And he said only Rosie O'donnell and the audience erupted in laughter. Completely unexpected and a place inappropriate. Provocative. And what I noticed was that Rosie O'donnell is a, is a visual image that everybody shares, right? You've got a picture of her soon, as I say the name and for his base that he was catering to. It was an unpopular image and one that would just suck all the energy away from the question which was toxic.

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       And really, you know, you can't touch the question. You just have to suck all the energy into another part of the room and wait for the time to run out. And that's what he did and it became the headline, Blah, blah blah. And He, you know, uh, certainly, uh, highlighted the things he said about women maybe more than it would have, but the way he escaped that got my attention and I thought that doesn't look normal, right? That, that's a, that's operating at another level. And so I looked for more examples of it and you can see it everywhere and it was especially clear by the time you started saying, well, the other visual things he does is he says, build a wall and you can just imagine a wall when he says, uh, we're, we're paying too much ransom to Iran for those soldiers.

Speaker 1:          00:14:08       He says, we paid $400, million, or whatever the number is. He goes, imagine that money piled up. It'd be so much money you would fill this room. You can't even imagine that big pile of money. He always goes to the visual because we know that the visual part of our brayden's the dominant part. If you can get its attention and get it on your message, it talks to the rest of your brain into anything you want it to. Um, when he talks about Isis, he goes visual also. He doesn't say they are bad people who's religions has been distorted to the type of thing you might hear from Hillary Clinton. He says they put you in cages and they trained you in the cage. They chop your head off. I mean you can see that you're playing in your head. So everything he does, he gets more attention than everything everybody else does because he puts it into a provocative picture.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       So that was the first thing I noticed. Then when he got to Jeb Bush and he needed to defeat Jeb because he was the strongest competitor. So if he couldn't get past two of them, there was no point. And he went after him and strong and he went after him fast and he went after him with a low energy kill shot. That's why I call these linguistic kill shots. It's not just an insult. It was not just a clever nickname. And we saw Clinton tried to come up with clever nicknames that had no, no purchase whatsoever, like dangerous Donald, you know, it just didn't work. But look at the. Look at low Energy Jeb. Here's how it's engineered. It's engineered for confirmation bias, meaning that you want the future to make this look like a better nickname every day. And you want it to match his physicality. So before I ever heard low energy Jeb, I had a good impression of Jeb Bush.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       W, when you look at Jeb Bush, didn't you say to yourself, this guy, it looks like a cool character, like if no, but he looked like he was an incontrol. I'm calm, reasonable. Exactly the person you'd want if that. If the nuclear question came up, if there was some big decision Jeb Bush isn't going to get excited about. Seemed like a competent CEO competency. Yeah, exactly. And as soon as trump said low energy, could you see him? And the other way he was low energy, low energy, lying ted, lying ted. Lying Ted was beautiful because you knew that because he's a politician, sometime in the next several months he's going to say stuff that you can say is a lie, whether it is or not, just it doesn't have to, but more importantly a ted has a physicality about him that unfortunately he's got beady eyes and I've said this before, if you're going to cast a movie, you know, we need a guy who's looks dishonest.

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       It would be his face and unfortunately, I mean, I don't know if he's actually dishonest. I'm not going to make a judgment. So came up with the Zodiac killer thing. Was that a trump fan or was it trump himself that started saying that Ted was the Zodiac killer. I think that probably started with the fan, but. So the other thing that was fucking harsh man, he be given speeches. Are you the Zodiac killer? People would scream it out like you imagine having to deal with that. And did your father killed somebody? Yeah, yeah, yeah. His father was maybe dad was the Zodiac killer. Is that with the Zodiac killer? It was like the seventies, right? Might not be old enough. Uh, so crooked Hillary, Crooked Hillary, same thing, circle millions of brilliant one. So she wasn't physically, you know, as limber as a young person. So you could imagine her sort of a little bit crooked physically, and you knew that there would be stories coming out in which people could say, well, there's another example of that crookedness did you see? But you thought that that a physical sense, like

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       the way she looked all I thought about his corruption, I heard Crooked Hillary. I saw her like with like a burglar's mask on trying to sneak away with bags that had dollar signs on them. You know, that's what I saw. If you look at anyone of these individually, his nickname's you, you could say, well, it's sort of random. He just got lucky. But if you look at a ball, they all have that physicality. They all have the, uh, the priming so that, you know, you'll confirmation bias will kick in. Whatever you see. After that, we'll just fit the label because it's the first thing you think, well, he's a performer. You know, you, you, you can say Donald Trump is a businessman. He most certainly is. It certainly is a real estate investor, but he's been a public figure for decades and when you're a public figure, you're a performer and he's performing all the time and he's also, he likes to win.

Speaker 2:          00:18:35       And so when he's engaging in people, he makes it personal. So he's gotten very good at what's called playing the dozens, you know, playing the dozens is tell us it's a insult thing, you know, like you can like one guy like guys in the hood, in the inner cities, this started out as a black term, but it's essentially like a version of your mama contest. Like some guys are way better at your mama jokes. They're way better at playing the dozens. They're way better at shitting on other people around them. And it's for the entertainment of each other. So huge thing amongst comedians. We shit on each other constantly left and right, but it's generally encouraged and we all enjoy it, you know, but when a guy has decades and decades and decades of this like Donald Trump, but a very high level because he's known to be a billionaire investor who puts his name on everything, everything and still win big, which I talk about developing systems for succeeding.

Speaker 2:          00:19:27       One of the systems is to you do this to a stack together, what I would call ordinary skills until your stack is different than anybody else's. So in my case, I'm not a great artist. I didn't take any writing courses, but I'm pretty good at drawing and I'm pretty good at writing a little bit of funny so it put them together and I couldn't do a comic strip because it's rare that you get somebody who's, let's say in the top 10 percent of three different things, but it's not hard to be in the top 10 percent of things if you're. If you're going after them. So if you look at trump, he wrote a book on negotiating. So he knows business. He knows negotiating. He knows public speaking, he has a sense of humor, a really good one. He's quick on his feet now. He knows politics from both the inside and the outside.

Speaker 2:          00:20:13       Um, he knows twitter. If you, you know, I could probably go on and you would say if you looked at any one of those things, he's not the best you've ever seen. You know, he's not the best public speaker, the funniest person, etc. But there aren't many people who can do all of those things in the top 10 percent. You put it as a puBlic speaker. I don't think he's nearly in the top 10 percent. I think he's a, I mean, I'm just being honest. I think he has a very poor efficiency of, of words like, um, he uses, he repeats himself when it's not really important. And when it repeats itself, what I usually see is like someone's searching for the next thing to say, you know what I'm saying? Like he'll say, you know, I'm gonna, be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you.

Speaker 2:          00:20:57       Okay, I'm going to be honest with you here. He'll do that in a way that is not. It's not efficient, not efficient, but it's persuasive in this way sometimes, but it also. No repetition, repetition sometimes. Sometimes, and sometimes it's clunky. Yeah. I feel like he. I feel like there's a lot of times where it's his style to do that and he's done it before, but even like in delivering lines, you've got to know when to not talk. Like here's a perfect example. When he said that he called the president of the president of Mexico up and they had the conversation about the wall and he said, the wall just got 10 foot higher. He's like, yeah, that's what I said. That is what I said. Like he repeats that said he should've just let it hang. He should have just said the wall just got 10 foot high.

Speaker 2:          00:21:40       They would've went crazy and you gotta walk back and forth and just sucked it in. But he kept talking. So that's not the best speaker like obama. I feels way better public speaker, way more efficient with his words, way better control of the sentences that he speaks, but it's more professional. I think you're judging a standard that I probably wouldn't use, so I took the dale carnegie course teaching you how to be a public speaker and their course taught you a zero technique. It was, it was a course on public speaking in which theY tell you nothing about technique. The things that you're saying he's doing, not necessarily technique. Well, let me just finish this off shore. I'm sorry. What they tell you is just confidence and, and if you were happy and confident, you would almost always do well even if you make a mistake, you correct.

Speaker 2:          00:22:28       so he strikes me as the confident dale carnegie type of speaker, the person who's selling an emotion. It's an experience. You're not going there really to get information. It's not really a well crafted joke she'll looking for. You're going there to feel something and you can't. You can't deny that 30,000 people in a stadium with red hats on know they were feeling something. So in terms of delivering and emotion, top 10 percent. Hmm. Interesting. Well, I think that for absolutely one thing you could say is he knows how to do the Donald Trump thing and the Donald Trump thing is very different than the rest of the politicians thing. The Donald Trump thing is not humble. The Donald Trump thing will tell you about his past successes and use them to tell you how he's going to be successful in the future. The Donald Trump thing when confronted with certain things like the thing about it, you know him saying something about hillary, lacking stamina, and then you start goes off about having a winning temperament. I have a winning temperament. There's not a lot of people who could do that in that sort of a political forum. Like if if say mitt romney was running for president, he started saying, I have a winning temperament. I. They'd be like, oh, ms dot gone fucking crazy. Right? You remember how howard dean got knocked out of the race just for screaming. He just screamed at a rally and it was over. The wind came out

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       of the balloon, but you know, you know what howard dean did wrong. What you always screamed once, it's all, it's all about contrast. Well, he also didn't make fun of it, you know, he should have come on and he should have done something to make fun of it. He should've had a speech where he talked about. So I got a little carried away folks, you know, like he, he, he hid from it. It feels like he could have fixed that. Yes. Yeah, I had that at the time. Well, if the problem was it was contrary to what he was selling, he was selling this buttoned up, packaged deal and in the middle of that package deal is a fucking pro wrestling fans screaming from a suplex, you know, like hulk hogan suplexes the iron sheik. And I mean that's what it was like. I mean, that's not the guy who, you want to have the button.

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       So have you heard of these studies? I think this has been replicated in fairly reliable that if you want to addict somebody to something, let's say this year, your show, if you gave them a really good product every time, it actually wouldn't be as addictive as if once in a while it wasn't good and they had to sort of like wait and anticipate, oh, there's that good weather again. So a unpredIctable rewards are far more addicting than predictable. So a hillary clinton who reward you every time and it, but it's just about the same is not gonna be nearly as addicting as Donald Trump. Who disappoints the fuck out of you? You're like, god, I was just starting to like you. Why did you say that that way? And then two weeks later he comes out with something. You say, shit, I love you again. And you know, so it's, he's got that addictive pattern going.

Speaker 3:          00:25:18       Well I'll tell you what, once all that grab the pussy stuff got out of the way. He was doIng a lot of speeches and the rundown the last few days and I watched a few of them on television because I almost felt like even though I knew I was gonna vote, I almost felt like some sort of a spectator like this is this cannot possibly be real to speak to your software simulation idea in the beginning that a lot of people share, by the way, it's not just crazy Scott Adams and me, but there's a lot of folks out there that think that we're living in a simulation. Right. But as he would give these speeches, and there were some of his speeches he gave where there was these moments where you're like, if someone could tell that guy to keep it at seven, like where he's at right there and talk like that always and avoid all the crazy shit. But man, the crazy shit is what you get. Like that's. That's the thing about people like trump or like any powerful super dominator type character like that. You'd have some flaws. A lot of them, the liquid,

Speaker 1:          00:26:18       he kept saying all the time, he was always saying he was the energy guy. Yesterday. I look at my crowds. The other one has no stamina. This one's, you know, low energy. Um, he knew the facts didn't matter, he knew the policy didn't matter. And by the end, I think everybody agrees they didn't mean by, by election day. Not a lot of people were saying, well, I sure like that tpp stand, nothing like that was happening. There was no,

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       no issues. It just, it just came down to which one you hated. The more. Well, there was one issue though that was real and that was amongst feminists, there was amongst women who were willing to exonerate hillary on all the weird shit that she had ever done involving women. Uh, all the stuff that she had done involving deleted emails and, you know, and I had heard people even say that people were giving her a hard time because she's a woman on her health and I was like, you are out of your fucking mind if you believe that she's falling asleep when she standing up. That is bad. That is so bad. If that was anyone close to me, anyone close to me, I'd be like, you're not going to be president. We got to get you healthy. You're fuckIng blacking out while you're standing up and it's not just.

Speaker 2:          00:27:28       Once she fell down once in 2012, got a serious concussion and was fucked up for six months. Me as a person who's terrified of brain trauma, that freaks me the fuck out because I know the repercussions of brain trauma. I know the impulsiveness that it bestows upon people. It's a horrible curse that happens. It's happened to a lot of people I know, so I knew there was this weird delusional thing where people didn't want to address the fact that our health is poor and then it was revealed that one of the wikileaks emails that she had suffered from some sort of a, not a stroke, but a seizure in 2015 like that's a fucking year ago what is happening, but nobody wanted to talk about that and there was this strange air that she's not being treated fairly. I'm like, here's treated fairly. She is a person who deleted 30,000 emails after she got a subpoena.

Speaker 2:          00:28:21       She's an older rich white woman. If she was a 40 year old black guy and she deleted 30,000 emails after subpoena, they would just shoot you. It would just come over here. They would kick down your fucking door and cuff you and drag you off to a cage somewhere. So how weird is. Am I right way here? What's going on here? How weird is it that we went through the entire election cycle and so many people like it wouldn't like, like me were saying, I'm not sure she looks healthy enough. She's definitely not healthy now. She of course metal the standards, best presidents, but what to what person ever interviewed her and said, look, there are a lot of questions about your health and so the question this way, can you look the american public in the eye and tell us there's no major health problems that you haven't disclosed?

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       I would never ask her a question like that because I don't think she'd ever give you a real answer the same way with the fbi, but you could tell by the way she evaded it whether she was. She's a wizard at that though. That's her shit. That's the shit man. That red cape with the bull just goes flying by. wow. You could always tell a lie or light. Layers will say something like, so if so if you said to me, scott, have you ever had any major health problems? I'd say, I haven't met all the requirements of the presidency. I was like, oh no, no. I'm asking you a specific question. Is there not disclosed? And then I say, Donald Trump hasn't disclosed any more than I've disclosed. That's a person who's hiding something. right? Otherwise they look you right in the eye and they go, I swear I'm great.

Speaker 2:          00:29:53       You know, everything's good. I promise you nothing's going to come out lAter when I'm president. You will not be disappointed in any way because nobody can say that if they think they're going to get bitten in the ass in a year and a half when they collapsed in the white house lawn. My, my point was insane. that is that if you, if you anyway described her health issues, that you would somehow be a sexist and that the idea of her gender and being the first female president, which obviously would be very historic, right? Huge issue. Huge, huge honor that, that, that was a part of what they were votIng for. It became a part. Her gender became a part of what they were voting for. And so that was an issue. Let me give you the, the, the positive spin on the same topic. Cnn polished 24, a pundit explanations of why trump won unexpectedly.

Speaker 2:          00:30:45       Twenty four different theories about why we didn't see coming in the top 24. None of them were. she's a woman, so couldn't get, couldn't get it. Not in the top 24. Right? So if we may pause for a moment from piling on. Ms dot clinton. I got to say that the whole breaking the glass ceiling thing, she fucking did that. That's toast. There's no six year old born today who says women can't be president. That's not even in their worldview. That's not true. I'll find you five, six year olds and say it right to your face. I'll bet not. I get a bunch of them together. Can a to be president. I get some boys together. I give them candy high five them. You can trick them. That's true. You can talk. Talk buys into anything for candy. I mean, I know what you're saying though.

Speaker 2:          00:31:31       I know what you're saying. That she got as she won the popular vote, right? As far as current count. Right? But who are you seeing saying, oh, if it was sexism that didn't get her elected feminists, feminists, that I know. I mean there's a lot of people that actually believe that. And you know what man, there's a whole spectrum of variables and if someone's thinking about if they're hovering over a, you know, if they're looking at Gary Johnson and hillary clinton, maybe that was. Maybe they'll never trump. Maybe they're one of those people, they're like, one, one of these motherfuckers going to get my vote. They might start thinking, man, I don't know if I want a woman president. That's absolutely a factor. Have you heard anybody say that? Yes. Yes. And what dId they say? Did they friend of mine? A yoga instructor? So as a woman, she was, bitches are crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:32:11       I don't want a woman running this country. That's for real. That's a real statement. I mean that's a human being who was just talking to me and we're friends and no one was around. And do you think that she would vote on that? Yes. I think there's many people that would vote on that, but there's many people that will like, fuck this man. I don't care what hillary did. I don't care if hillary's got a bunch of rape victims buried in her backyard. That's a woman. She represents women and probably donald's got more. You know, there's that attitude too. There's a of people that would only vote for a woman if given the chance. Other know how you'd net it down because I think it was a net positive. Three hundred million people in this country plus mexicans. I don't think you really can net it down like that.

Speaker 2:          00:32:52       I just think there's too many of us. I don't think. I think that's one of the things that we learned from this really important lesson when it comes to polls, they're not real anymore. They're not real. You're not talking to me. You're not. You're not answering polls. Jamie doesn't answer a goddamn pole. Look at them. So no one, no one, you know, answers poles. It's a such a small sampling of people and the people that answer polls, they don't have anything better to do than answer a fucking pole. Right? That's not good as the jury duty product. That's exactLy what the problem is. So I think we learned that definitively. These polls do not work well. If I could defend a native silver for a moment was okay. Again, he does 5:38 to a website. The best best statistician on politics. What's not his fault?

Speaker 2:          00:33:37       He's worked with the data he has. Well, but he was also within two percent I think wasn't. yeah. So yeah, so at the end, but you know, they, they always converge toward the end, you know, they started out wIldly ridiculous and then when it's clear that it's going to be one way or the other, all the polls are coming toward the end because they want to say, well, if they hadn't, that was only two percent. Well jamie and I were watching this video clip of the young turks calling down the election yesterday and at the beginning of it they were 100 percent convinced that hillary could not lose. You know, there's this one guy was saying, you know, hillary can't lose. She like literally it's mathematically and then by the end they were fucking screaming and swearing. It was like, wow, these numbers that people like count on like 84 percent say this 15 percent.

Speaker 2:          00:34:20       Try to Imagine my life. I don't know if you know this, but a year ago, more than a year ago, I predicted that trump would win with 98 percent certainty in a landslide win at all. I was one of the few people who said it earlier, and this is because of the way he was so persuasive. Yeah. Just based on his, his talents. Not. But this was pre the rosie o'donnell thing. If it was a year ago, I think it was over the summer. That was like august last year, the first debates where I think yOu're right, but that wasn't a year ago, right? There was a little bit more than a year ago, but whatever. We're splitting harrison. Okay. Um, so back then when I predicted it, uh, you can imagine the heat I took because it was such an unlikely pick and how many people just wanting to dance on my grave for be enrolling and the angry at you and angry. Yes. Going to be going over to amazon and get me a bad book reviews because they didn't like what I said about Donald Trump. So that moment when I found out that I haven't wasted my whole year because it would have been a terrible year to be so wrong for a year, and then there's like no pay off whatsoever. It was like, it was like the worst gamble ever. Bad risk management. Um, but then to have it come, come through just the way

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       I predicted it was this amazing, amazing moment. You only get a few of those in your life. Well, he did really lend win by a landslide. So that you were off by that. That's an electoral landslide. Oh, electoral. Yeah, I guess so. Electorally one by quite a few points. Right? But it wasn't. It was pretty close up until how many hours in, as soon as you started, it doesn't, doesn't matter.

Speaker 3:          00:36:01       Yeah. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Here's the thing that I think it's important to make a distinction, and this is what I recognize. I knew when I watched some of your periscopes and when you just weren't making a moral judgment of him as a person, and that's what people expected. People expected a line in the sand to be drawn morally. What you were doing was talking about all of his traits, you compounding all of his positive traits and what he what he does well and then people got mad at you for bringing your. You're analyzing it like say if you're a scientist and you take up a plant that you find in the amazon, you're like, well, what is this plant consists of? What's break down the parts? You were kind of breaking down the parts of what he does and where what is effective and it didn't seem to me.

Speaker 3:          00:36:46       Now I'm like, this doesn't seem like a guy who was like, oh, there's a few guys out there that are like rabid rah rah trump supporters and some of them were at super transparent. There's a few guys out there that I'm watching them and I know what they're doing. What they're doing is they're latching onto the trump train, the latching on like really shamelessly where they try. They tweet about trump all the time now where they never give a fuck about him. Awhile ago, like over the last six months, they've jumped on this because they recognize there's a tremendous amount of loyalty and momentum behind being a trump supporter and a fan because it's a tough stance to take. So guys that are already marginalized or already kind of like fringe and people think they're kinda maybe creepy. They're like, fuck this, I'm going to full cream and they jump right in and it's kinda, it's real transparent. Interesting. You know, obviously that's just my take on it. They might actually be really trump supporters and they're super excited, but I sent some disingenuous behavior out there. Careful, careful trump train. He might have some hobos on your fucking wagons.

Speaker 1:          00:37:44       I think what's different about this election and about trump in particular is that it used to be we're electing a leader, someone who would be a role model and all that. I think he threw that all out the door and social media throws even moral authority. What I mean is I think the public is the leader knew. I mean, I think no laws get passed that less than majority of the public wants it to get past anything that gets a little adeline. Social media just throws it back in line. And more than ever I think we hired an employee rather than a leader. I feel like I hired a plumber, you know, someone who's just really good at a specific set of skills, negotiating, you know, maybe doing something with a budget, whatever it needs to be done, secure the borders. But it's sort of like picking a lawyer.

Speaker 1:          00:38:29       I don't care what he's doing in his personal life. He's not my role model. And by the way, which of our kids are looking to 70 year old men as their role models anyway. I mean, I don't know if that happens a lot anyway, but I think I think he really is going to be the first sort of people's president you see as policies changing in real time. And the example we talked about earlier when, um, you know, he had, he misspoke and he said women should be punished if they get an illegal abortion. It turns out that the law and both republicans and democrats think that's crazy because it would discourage, you know, who didn't encourage the wrong behavior and so only the doctor is punished, but you saw him change his opinion in 24 hours just by being a little more informed and hearing that the public was all on the same side, so that's interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       So he, he'll beNd with the breeze in and I kind of flip flopping. Common political term is in the political realm. It would be flip flopping and you know, he has no moral backbone, but you're saying it's receptive to the public's desires. He's a businessperson in the business realm is more like ab testing, which is you're rapidly testing things. You see what the response is and you adjust if you don't get the right, but that's also like one of the criticisms of him is that he talks off the cuff without really having researched or thought deeply about these subjects. And when you're talking about a guy who's supposed to be the leader of the greatest country in the world's ever known, like, that guy should probably not do that. I'm going to put, I'm going to put a different filter on that. Okay. From the persuasion filter, since facts and logic and policies and stuff don't matter as much as you want.

Speaker 1:          00:40:05       When you See him ignoring things that you just think, man, a reasonable person would not say that a reasonable person would not ignore that he ignores things because they don't matter. You think he's ignoring something very important and he would perform better if he did what you imagine is the right way to act? I don't think so, but you don't think it's important to not arrest women who get illegal abortions? No. I'm saying, do you know what I'm saying? Like that's an important thing to pay attention to, right? If you have an opinion on it. Well, what I'm saying, what I'm saying is that the things you would need to know to be a president. Okay. And let's say, let's say hillary clinton knows them all. Let's let's say she's attended attended of just knowledge. if he's a six, which probably is a generous, there probably isn't any decision that he won't have.

Speaker 1:          00:40:52       Advisors were filling it. Say they becomes an informed as he needs to know exactly the way a ceo would run something. Okay, so this is not really related to that one particular subject. No, that was just an example of him. I understand what You're saying is changing. When he became more Informed, he didn't. He didn't stick to an old opinion. Even as the facts change. And this has done the same thing with obamacare as well. Right? Met with obama and said, okay, maybe there's some things about obamacare that we might want to keep. So what he does, we call pacIng and leading in the. In the hypnosis I the bullshitting. No, and here's how it's different. What he does is he agrees with people emotionally first. It gets you on your side emotionally. So if you're really concerned about immigration, for example, he doesn't just say, hey, yeah, I'm, I'm concerned about that too.

Speaker 1:          00:41:37       That would be sort of a hillary clinton approach. Being less concerned that you are, but you know, I got other priorities. he's way more concerned than you are if you're a little bit worried about immigration and he's worried about, you know, isis coming over here and putting people in cages and cutting off heads and my god, there's a hordes coming over the border, so he's so on your side that when he changes toward the middle and you knew we had to because you have to do that when you get in the general election that his side was not feeling betrayed because they're saying, well, if he's changing the specifics of his policy, it must be because he looked into it and that's what's interesting. that's what's practical, so they're willing to go with him if they feel that he's on their side emotionally, so he always sides with people emotionally goes as big as possible. Uses hyperbole. He says he does that and it gives them also gives them room to negotiate back to the middle and everybody says, my god, I'm happy now you're negotiated back to the middle.

Speaker 2:          00:42:32       Wow, that's interesting. It's interesting, but why do I feel like just getting lucky? I feel like it's really shitty competition. Hillary clinton is a terrible example of someone who should be running the country in so many ways and she beat him in the popular vote. You know what I mean? She's like, she's got a lot of dirt on. So she beat him in the contest. They weren't having the result. That was the only one contest. It's true. And he won that one. That's true. What's hilarious is in 2012, he was saying it was a rigged system because of that contest. You know what I mean? He was talking about the popular vote and you know, how it, what was it? Which, which, what year was it where it went to al gore? What year was it where al gore won the popular vote, but it was, it did carry when. No, kerry number one the popular road. Right. It was just al gore. Al gore won the popular vote against bush, right? Yeah. By like a half a million.

Speaker 1:          00:43:21       Yeah. So every year there's going to be this conversation anytime the voter's rights close. Um, but what you see is that trump doesn't care about, let's say, the consistency or what somebody would say is being a hypocrite. I've tweeted this recently that the least persuasive thing you could ever say in politics, if you're trying to change somebody's mind, is that person's a hypocrite in all, in all of history. That's never changed anybody's mind. Nobody ever said, oh, slap my head. I didn't really realize that bottoms up. You mean about a politician by politician? Yeah. Well, we accept a certain amount of bullshit, but we also accept that they used to say one thing and now they say another and it just seems so normal. It's in the baseline. Don't you think that the being the president is an impossible job? It's impossible. It just doesn't seem like anybody could really do it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:13       It's both impossible and the easiest job in the sense that the office of the president and all the advisors and all the public opinion is going to force you down to just a few possible options and those two options will, you will not have enough information to know which one's better. So, so anyone, anybody among the last two options that they've narrowed it down to, there's a little bit of luck involved. I got to say now. So what do you mean by this? WeLl, you have to match the personality and the time, right? So you could have a, a president who is just terrific in wartime but weren't much good at anything else. So they'd be, you know, next thing you know, they're on mount rushmore because. But you have obama whose primary job was winding down to ors and basically cleaning up and bass and keeping us from a larger product problem.

Speaker 1:          00:45:04       You know, the economy melting down. So obama is really the presidency of things he prevented that could have been worse, but I would put them in the top 20 percent of presidents. So my view of him is very positive and I think even obamacare is a genius persuasive move even in its failure because he set it up that way. And he said that publicly. He said, I'm going to launch it ugly. I'm paraphrasing, didn't get exactly what I wanted in this law, but once it's out there, it will be impossible for politicians to pull back coverage. They'll just have to fix it. So where are we today? Everybody's saying obama, total failure without obamacare because we're going to keep the good parts. Keywords keep the good parts exactly as he fucking plan and said so publicly. He said it, he said it publicly. He said, I'm going to do this ugly, wrong, and you're going to have to fix it because it's going to be the only choice you have. And that's what, that's what trump's gonna do. He's gonna fix it. So what is he going to fix? Probably he's going to keep the main parts and probably shift some money around from something, you know, I'm not, I'm not sure that fix looks like a miracle fix. I don't knoW that that's in our future. And I'm. No, I'm no expert on obamacare.

Speaker 3:          00:46:23       Well, there's this weird thing that we've done now with, uh, with trump that I've never seen before. We've, we've narrowed them down to chance and slogans like I talked to in this podcast about I was in New York city at the time of the protests because I was there for the ufc and uh, we were walking from the gym to the hotel and we just got caught in this wave of people screaming with really fucking crazy science man. There wasn't a whole lot of love and compassion on their signs that we were talking about this before the podcast started, that the left has become something very different. It's like this really aggressive, uh, insulting shaming and even the call for violence, like there's people with rape melania signs. It's like, this is crazy. Yeah, there's pictures of him online. So the big question is,

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       well, I have one foot in the, you know, the alt right world because I sample everything over there. But I'm also watching cnn and regular media and these, these folks live in completely different realities because they have different inforMation because they're looking at different sources. So within the conservative of things, it is, it is understood universally understood that the protesters are professional and they're paid by soros. And by the way, I'm not saying this, I'm saying what their view is on the other side, people think it's a true grassroots movement. Um, and so the view is completely two different worlds.

Speaker 3:          00:47:47       Well, there may very well be some people that have been paid to protest, but there is absolutely a bunch of people that are protesting because they're upset. I mean, it might be fluffed up a little bit, I don't know, but there's definitely people that are just young people that are pissed off or old people that are pissed off. There's people that are just upset. The question was whether the protests would have lasted in spread. And ben as well organized protest. Scott adams. It's fun. You feel like you're doing something. You're blocking wilshire. Fuck you people, you know. And this guy, I mean, what I was saying about it boiled down to a slogan like, there's a bunch of, not my fucking president, you know, like that kind of shit like Donald Trump, k, k, k. It's like they want to like yell out things they associate with him, which I've never seen before. So there's about a president.

Speaker 1:          00:48:37       So. So I write about this extensively. So the best persuasion is fear, right? So in the beginning of the election, trump had the best persuasion because he was saying the terrorists are coming in and you know, I'll stop them. There's criminals, criminal cross the border. Clinton was talking boring policies and um, experienced. So she didn't have a chance against, you know, you're going to die tomorrow by summer. She obviously had some professional help, meaning somebody who's a cognitive scientist or a professional persuader. And she started using the term dark all the time and all the surrogates used it at the same time. It's dark, dark, dark. And she started coloring him as a huge racist. Dictators. Dangerous to the world and the most dangerous thing in the world. Because if you're worried about terrorism, you're really worried about somebody else getting killed because you're not really thinking you get killed by terrorists.

Speaker 1:          00:49:30       You know, even if it's pretty bad, somebody else's getting killed. But clinton painted a picture to make you afraid of, of, uh, you know, the nuclear holocaust created by trump tweeting something at 3:00 AM and I don't know, hitting the button accidentally. And so that was the ultimate fear. So she really had that going. So, uh, and when she lost, she had all these people activated who would've been instantly deactivated if trump had lost, but there's no deactivation on the bottom. Now she created this society societal bomb that is these protests in the way people feel they're. These people literally believe that hitler was just elected, you know, a version of hitler who will will. And I saw, I actually saw today journalists talking about concentration camps and that sort of thing. I believe nothing even remotely like, that's going to happen or you know, or I would obviously be on, on the side of the protestors. So it's not their view of the world. Is that the trump supporters? No, he's a racist. And they installed them because they want them to go do racist things. Trump supporters know that even within the ranks, it's like two percent people are our actual races. And I've never met one, like the hardcore guide and I'd never even met one.

Speaker 3:          00:50:53       I bet we can introduce you to some people if we just asked around. I think it wouldn't be hard to find one, but the boat and had a very funny line. He said not all trump supporters are racist, but all racists or trump's

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       porters. So the, so what we have here is a situation where the racists are living in their own little world and they think they actually got their guy. Most trump supporters just like, hey, less taxes, you know, that they're thinking they like his personality though, just like something about him. And the clinton supporters think that hitler actually got elected. So they're acting on that. So. And so what's happened is that clinton has somewhat accidentally, because she thought she was going to win, at which point this whole problem goes away. Uh, somewhat accidentally created this gigantic societal bomb that there's no way to diffuse. But a number of people including me are trying to figure it out. I had to literally d hypnotize people who were in this illusion that the world war three just started. Well, it's,

Speaker 3:          00:51:54       it was very disturbing to me. One of the, one of the big ones was when she was confronted about the dnc hack and uh, her emails and all that stuff, the hacked emails from our server where she diverted attention by saying that it was Russia that did this and that there would be repercussions. And tHen she said, even possibly militarily, like that's the worst diffusion of responsibility ever. Like you were talking about you deleting emails after a subpoena and your argument is that the russians got those emails and we should bomb them. I mean, that's literally what she saying. That was crazy when she said there would be repercussions militarily to fucking Russia. Like what? Russia. We're not talking about invading puerto rico. It's fucking Russia. Like you're saying there's going to be military invasions because someone stole your email

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       that wasn't secure. I'm going to defend her. Please do. I'm going to go to surprise you a little bit. Oh boy. Here we go. We should have a drink. Do you drink? I don't anymore at any moment. You stop. It just gave me sinus problems. So I stopped several years ago. I feel much healthier. Alright dude. Um, no pressure. What was I talking about?

Speaker 3:          00:53:10       Uh, you were gonna defend hillary clinton because I was saying that her saying that we're going to attack Russia because of emails is kinda crazy. So the way leaders stock

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       with each other Is, you know, this is my red line, don't do this. This is serious. That's not the same as saying if you got my email, I'm going to you tomorrow. There is, there's a certain amount of seriousness which you must convey, which is separate from what he actually going to do. So she was conveying I'm a Ten and a 10 maximum code red seriousness if you, if you got my fucking emails. And, and, and it changed the course of our, of our republic because that's where she was at the legend. Now I don't know if anything, any of this happened and they're smart people who said maybe the russians were in or some russian hackers were involved in.

Speaker 3:          00:53:55       WeLl, here's the problem. There's no evidence that the russians did it. Not only that, the fbi and the cia don't think there's russians don't think the russians did it. Like it wasn't something that there was any definitive proof. It was find out who jamie see if he could pull this up, who believed that it was Russia and who didn't believe it was Russia because there was some like very prominent security people that were hired to investigate zero evidence. It was Russia, so it was just a diffusion. It's an end. You could tell that it was a planned diffusion because of that white house correspondents dinner. She made a joke about riding a horse with putin. like she made this russian joke. So there's this like theme and it was a shit joke to whoever wrote it should be slapped. It was terrible. Like the way it was set up was it was if somebody, if somebody pitched that around the joke writers table, you know, like it was like it was tony hinchcliffe and Jeff Ross, or they'd be like, no, no, no, that one's not going to do that. THat's a terrible joke. It's just not a good joke and she, you know, didn't know how to deliver it either and it was just a clunky, an extra attempt to connect putin and trump because people are scared of Russia, but it was so shitty and ham handed that it just didn't work. And everybody knows there's no fucking evidence. I mean, there's no evidence of russia's doing anything. None.

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       Russia thing took her from, you know, serious statesperson, you know, the most experienced person who ever ran for president to a little bit. Ridiculous. Yes. She had desperate

Speaker 3:          00:55:28       bose desperate move. So you didn't have any other options. She, she went code red. She started talking shit back. She started making things up back and connecting him to like, he was just. The whole thing was so sorted. To me that was the most unfortunate thing about it. When you do see all this stuff on tv, one thing that you can't deny, it might not affect you and it might not affect me, but there are certain people that fall the tone of the leaders of this country. And when you have a guy who's the president, who you know is going to say insulting, should call John Stewart a pussy in, in a tweet at 1:30 in the morning, like that sets the tone for the country and it's going to make some people very happy. There's some people that love to talk shit. They loved insult people and they're like, fuck yeah, open season.

Speaker 3:          00:56:12       the way I described that, I said political correctness took a missile to the deq because that's what it was like. This is the, this is the guy at the top of the totem pole and we can relax our standards now. All The things that had been annoying you, but people nitpicking about behaviors and insults and safe words and safe spaces and all that stuff's kinda gone. Uh, yeah. I mean, yeah. So it does affect the way people think and behave right there. There's almost nobody who won't use the word pussy in public. They do, do, do, do you remember so many months ago when that just wasn't a thing. You couldn't say that. That's so drew. It became like a constant like dinner table talk, like people sitting around talking st grab the pussy and discovery from women. It's not even deciding. Not even bend. My girlfriend says so true.

Speaker 3:          00:57:00       It's so true. That is so true. That's interesting. Yeah. Well, you know, I think that we go one way and we go to the other and I think that people get tired of too much left and they want some. Right. And I think that's why we went from carter to reagan. That's why we went from bush to clinton. I just think that's what we do. I think it's what we've always done and I think people are. I, I also believe, and I've said this publicly, I think the whole caitlyn jenner thing had a big effect on because people were like, why in the fuck are we doing? That's the athlete of the year. This is woman of the year for glamour magazine, and then you see her on the ellen show and she doesn't believe in gay marriage and you're like, we're, this is madness. We're, we're accepting madness as being okay.

Speaker 3:          00:57:43       And I think because of that, like we're so accepting and so sensitive that anything involving gender gets a free pass on all of its ludicrous aspects. Like she's a ludicrous person. but we gave it a free pass because she used to be a man that she became a woman. She will fucking doesn't believe in gay marriage. It's so crazy. When, when ellen asked her about it, she was like, well, I'm cronenberg traditional welsh. Like, what? What? Wait, what the fuck did you even just say you're, you're a traditional girl. holy shit, this is crazy. But we're not supposed to say anything. We're supposed to just accept it. Well, there's people at home all across the country throwing their fucking beer cans in the kitchen. Just flipped out. Fuck. Are we doing? What are we doing? And I think there's this reaction when things go way too far left when there's 78 different gender pronouns that you have to learn.

Speaker 3:          00:58:31       When you know political correctness, take some crazy path where you're removing the general these confederate flag from the roof and pulling it off a tv land. We've got to get this fucking. It just like things go so far left that there's an automatic slingshot effect and they start going right again. I'm okay with getting rid of the confederate flag By the way. I think they could have. Well, you know, it, it does represent bad things to people, but can you just fucking go in there and cgi that shit or something or is it okay to have it in there because it represents the past, right? like you could go to, you can go to watch, um, al jolson videos on youtube and you could watch them. Here's my take on that. People don't ask a lot from other people, but you. So you have this confederate flag, bunch of people like it because it's like, oh, it's the best. It'S the south. So you know, you want to respect the people like what they like.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       But another big part of the public, it's just really, really offended by it. Like not in a normal offensive way, like you said, a bad word, but like, you know, the deepest pain the country has ever experienced the slavery. So if you can't, if you can't allow your fellow citizen, you know, that little bit of respect, it's like, yeah, this is really inconvenient. I wish I could keep my confederate flag, whatever. But they're not asking a lot. It's just not a lot. It's true. Unless you own the dukes of hazard, you're like, where's my fucking mOney? What are you kidding me? We've had played it for 50 years. What happened? Well, it represents not just slavery, which is one of the most awful things that has ever happened to human beings. The other awful thing is war represents a war civil war, so the two most awful things, slavery and war, it represents both of those represents a war between two people in the same two groups of people on the same land, mass over slavery.

Speaker 2:          01:00:25       So It's death on top of horrific in capturing and enslaving of people. It's like everything bad, and I hate to be insensitive, but they weren't the winning side troops, so they did lose. But what's interesting is it just a few decades ago, whenever the dukes of hazzard was on tv, it didn't bother us at all. That's really fascinating to me that they were allowed to have it and it wasn't an issue, but I don't know. I don't. Yeah, maybe just people weren't thinking about it that way, but once you started thinking about it, so the thing isn't that fascinating that it wasn't an issue, but we were all aware of it. All of our issues or psychological. I mean, you know, once you got food and nobody's shooting at you, your problems tend to be mental. Yeah. Yeah. Unless that whatever that image is provoking violence. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:01:10       You know, like the nazi flag you can't have, they lost to which you can't have that one. We won't give you that one. Right. Yeah. And again, it's like people don't ask a lot. That's just not a lot to ask to. Isn't that fascinating? Like the english came when we had a war with england, right? For our independence. They killed a lot of americans. You could have an english flag flying high. Nobody gives a fuck. You know, that ended so politely though, did it? I mean, I think, I think the british, they lose territory better than anybody. They'll give you their sword. Well, we conquered much of the world, but uh, okay. This one didn't work out. You put up a good fight, good for you. Good for you. Take your country back. it is interesting though that there's some people that would argue for the confederate flag, but almost no one would argue for the nazi flag. Well, it was probably somebody does, but yeah, I know what you're saying. You know what I mean? The nazis. I mean, it couldn't have been that everyone in Germany was represented by the nazis. Right. There's never a group. There's never 100 percent compliance and group mindset of any fucking country. It's never existed. Right. It's just not how people are. So we give the

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       germans a pass because they were a part of that whole nazi flag thing. But when we look at the confederate flag, like if you're down with that, you have to be. It has to be like the two core things. One, you're at war with the north until you believe in slavery. That's it. You know, it can't just be, I'm a leonard scattered fan, you know, images, images. like I said, in the very beginning, visual persuasion is the strongest it is. You just want, you just don't want to look at that thing if you're on the wrong side of, you know, that part of history. I was thinking about that once because I went to cheech and eatsa the where the mayan pyramids are in the yucatan. And uh, when we were driving, it's a long drive to get to the pyramids. And as we're driving and saw this giant cocacola billboard, I said, how bizarre is that symbol like that symbols so etched in the consciousness of most people in the modern world.

Speaker 3:          01:03:11       But to see it in the jungle was so strange. It's just this giant thing that represent. I mean, it, it's like instantaneous representation. Was it new or was it leftover from the, the, the mayan civilization that had it. It was newer than that. Newer than that. but I mean, symbols are very strange. I mean, we, we, uh, we accept them and they have become a normal part of our society. When you drive it down the road and you go, oh, what kind of car is that? And you see the bow tie. Oh, it's a chevy. Like these symbols, like the instantaneous recognizable symbols. Have you noticed how easily boys can recognize the model of a car? Oh yeah. There's some kind of weird, um, gender specific skill. Oh, I don't think so because brian cowen doesn't know jack shit about cars. Brian kennedy could recognize like a tesla and a car.

Speaker 3:          01:04:01       Maybe he's owned maybe, but it would have to be in the last couple of years. He is. No, I've never met a grown man. It's like a manly guy who knows less cares less about cars, but still if you said what's that model of car? And it was probably wouldn't know. He'd see a mustang and the camaro. Okay. Trust me, lIke he is just brutal. I've had conversation with them. I'm not a fucking 69 mustang. You can't tell. They look at that. The debt doesn't say that's a [inaudible] 69 mustang to you turning your god damn America card. Turn it in. Boy. Sixty nine camaro. Casey. A 69 camaro. You should fucking know what that is. You should just know as a man. I wouldn't know a 68, 69. You should look at the headlights. Taillights are different. Everything's different. In 68 have the same boxy tail lights that the 67 hand, whereas the 69 is lengthened a little bit. Well, $69 a year. That's the right year to change my name to caitlyn and no, you don't have to get. Maybe she knows a lot about cars.

Speaker 3:          01:04:59       That was the other thIng about the caitlin thing that drove me crazy. She killed somebody, knock someone into traffic, knock some leading the traffic and she wasn't paying attention. Lady went head on into traffic. Someone slammed into her and killed her hummer. One of the last hummers in America slammed in her and killed her and it never gets discussed. She goes, does talk shows and instead of talking about this horrific accident that caused some fellow human their life, she talks about gender and nail polish. Well, yeah, exactly. I did not know about this. We didn't know about that. Yeah, you didn't know. See, that's a big part of the problem. I've been bad at caitlin, uh, since, since, uh, she was bruce because I happened to be at a flight one time across country and bruce at the time was in the seat in front of me and leaned is a seed all the way back and I couldn't use my laptop for five hours.

Speaker 3:          01:05:47       And you're mad about that, but that's. Can you lean your back? You have more room? It doesn't really work that way because can you put your laptop on your lap? Like a actual lap top? That coulD work. You could have done it if I was right next to you how to fix this whole thing. If only the lab you were like, I'm glad he's a Chickie. Fucking ruined my typing this. This is why it's called the laptop. Yeah, it sits in your lap, but then your balls get really warm and they say it kills sperm. So it depends on what you're trying to accomplish. For some people they'd be just heating them babies up all the time. It was a long flight. I might want to kill a few just to. Just to take the pressure off is to relax the my friend already should fear always gets mad at that too.

Speaker 3:          01:06:33       People lean back on him because he's so big. He's like six [inaudible] six three or something. Six four. He's super tall, so he's got these goofy ass stork legs and he can't fit them under the seat. Anyway. God, I feel sorry for tall people. Anytime they try to travel anywhere outside their own house. Even in cars, you know, you get in someone's car sometimes and your legs are jammed up. I'm like, I'm fucking five. Eight and my legs are jammed up on what is a giant person do. Yeah. I'm trying to think like what would be my equivalent, like how small would the car have to be so I could feel what was shack feels like when he gets the car, he has to take seats out and put seats in the back. Have you ever seen him with a do to cars for him? Really?

Speaker 3:          01:07:10       Yeah. He's had some custom made cars where they literally take the seat out of the front and install it in the back. I mean, that's not, that might look, you know, you think about it, he's seven feet tall so that this thing about how much more length you're dealing with his arms, his legs, and then his, the height, like I bet they would have to lower the seat down so you could see better out of the windshield. Otherwise he has to kind of bend down every time he's driving. I just says this vision of him with a miata sitting in the trunk, the trunk open, you know, just. I bet he can't drive a miata. I bet he can't. I bet there's no way that he can get farther, far enough back strap one to each foot and skated. Well he would, he could do is just put the steering wheel.

Speaker 3:          01:07:52       He's so rich because could have the steering wheel put in the middle and then push everything back. No, forget that idea. But I know for sure for sure they had one of those custom tv shows, custom car shows where they do things for people. Maybe it was west side. What does that one show? West coast, west coast, west coast customers. Maybe that one famous company, so they took her car and they put the seat in the back for him. Probably still needed extra room, like suddenly you do for tv. Can we gotta we gotta put the seat in the back maybe because I got a feeling he drives a regular cars somehow. Maybe there's probably some cars that he can't drive though. Like one of those old porsches little tiny ones. Probably most of the. Yeah. Anyway, point being what were we? Oh, it's terrible to be as general leaned back and fucked up your day.

Speaker 3:          01:08:41       Yeah. All went bad from there. You know, and look, there's nothing. I mean he's not terrible person. She's not a terrible person. It's not the worst human in the world. It's just like when this gets paraded out as being like this very important point. As soon as he gets paraded out and you make a big deal and you want to go on all these talk shows, you want to talk about yourself and done well, they have to examine you as an actual person and not just stop at gender. You know what I'm saying? Like there's, there's a lot of representatives, like for instance, um, the, the woman who created sirius satellite radio and also, I believe she invented gps. She was born a man and had a sex change. And uh, I met with her and had an interview with her about her. Um, her.

Speaker 3:          01:09:29       She made a robot, she's super fucking smart, like crazy smart and is working on artificial intelligence and programming this woman, um, this like it's ahead of her wife being like she married her when she was a man and then became a woman. They stayed together and being a is like this, uh, artificial intelligence thing that she's consistently updating as technology gets better. She updates it and gives it more and more intense. Like if you want to focus on someone who's a transgender person, like maybe that would be a good example instead of just concentrating on a guy who used to be really good at running and uh, you know, and now lived with a bunch of materialists on a reality show, not just running, but they come and they have no, no purpose. And really. Yeah, I mean, so now no one's really into the decathlon.

Speaker 3:          01:10:17       Sorry. I'm sure he's awesome, but nobody gives a fuck. That's why he does any of those sports where there's no professional side of it, like it's probably a reason for that. I say that, but then that's not true because a wrestling. I think wrestling is a great sport. It doesn't have a professional venue, you know, other than like fake wrestling. Do you ever think about how weird it is that people can get invested in like a team? Yes. Like why? Why? Why do you care so much about your team? I think about that all the time. I'm constantly. Really? Yes, all the time. We talk about it all the time. It's a tribal thing. People love being in a group. They like being on team trump. They liked being on team hillary, you know there's there. I saw I was watching so much tribal behavior leading down like arguments between people on twitter.

Speaker 3:          01:11:03       It's like you guys are crazy. Like what are you doing? You're arguing with people you don't even know, and I look at their timeline, I'll look at the timeline. They're arguing for seven, eight hours in a row. You could be doing so much to improve your life instead of like insulting. Hillary supporters are insulting trump supporters. They're all, it's, it says weird natural thing. People joined teams that joined tribes. They have groups that they like, but it makes sense when you're looking at say your ethnicity because probably biologically we're, we're primed to prefer it. Whatever it looks like us, you know, just just naturally primed for that. Do you think that's true? Explain black eyes and asian chicks ready. Go. I'm done. So, but in general anyway, so, but so it makes sense if you're looking at like big groups or a country or something, but a sports team as such, a random collection of rules that, why you could be emotionally invested in that.

Speaker 3:          01:12:04       I've tried because it seems like such cheap entertainment. Well, I want to. You live a wonderful life, Scott Adams and you're wealthy. Successful man. And uh, for some people there's not a whole lot to look forward to it. And this is not. Obviously I'm not using a broad blanket to paint all sports fans, but I think that there's a lot of people out there that look to the success of their team and they get happiness or sadness from that and if you're in a team, like if you're in cleveland and they kick ass and win the world title, I mean they have the world heavyweight champion of the ufc lives in cleveland too. Like you get some cleveland pride, you know, well that almost works until you consider that there are like raiders fans, like they just keep losing and losing raiders is a different thing and they got to be thinking this will not make me feel good at the end of the year.

Speaker 3:          01:12:54       He. But raiders is like, I'm a bad ass. Raters is a weird one because raiders is like rap music. I'm a thug, you know, I don't give a fuck. I'm a raiders fan. It's a different thing. Raiders is a, that's a whole different animal. And then the cubs fan cubs fans up until this year, we're like the loyal we, hey, I'm not really in it for the winds. I just love the cubs. Meanwhile, the cubs are new every year. It's a different fucking person. Yeah, that's what's crazy. It's a totally different group of humans. Then the cubs from five years ago, how could you love the cubs? These aren't the same people and then the team can just go to another town. It's not. Yeah, it's fucking nuts. Like the la rams. How do we get the rams? What the fuck happened? What are we doing here?

Speaker 3:          01:13:32       You know, like, and then what's going to happen to the raiders are going to go to vegas now. Then the raiders fans going to follow them over to vegas. You know? Sometimes they don't. Sometimes people get mad. Teams leave and they get pissed off. Vegas seems like a good fit though, doesn't it? Yeah, but he was all created because, I mean, all sports teams in this country essentially were a response to war being over and people thinking with real good reason that men at least need war. They need some form of war to develop character and to, to build strong like strong definitive nations almost need to unite and bond with war. And the concept was like, well, if we can't do that, let's figure out some sort of a game that they can play. And that's where football emerge. Do you think that was conscious or unconscious?

Speaker 3:          01:14:24       Yeah, no, it was, yeah, it was actually discussed like it's been discussed and there's been a lot of historians that have concentrated on leaders that have talked about the importance of conflict, the importance of war in the, um, the, the bringing the country together and uh, the support of nationalism, the supportive loyalty and honor and pride. Like all of that. A lot of it has to be connected with consequence and loss. Hmm. Yeah. I like that line of thinking. well, there was a radio lab podcast about when they invented football that went into this and pretty, pretty much in depth. God dammit, I think it was radio lab, I'm pretty sure it was. It was either, I don't know how else it could have been, but it went into it pretty, pretty in depth about the creation of football and how it was originally put together.

Speaker 3:          01:15:12       So that would explain why sports that are just clearly dangerous or it's still illegal and popular. And. Is that a jamie? Yeah, that's it. American football. Yeah. Cv. Make that a little larger for my shitty eyes. Scroll up there. Yeah. Okay. 18, 79. Yeah, that's right. It was made in the carlisle indian school formed in 18, 79 to assimilate children. The grandchildren of native americans who fought in the plains wars fields. The most american team of all. Yeah. This was about these american indians that were fucking kicking ass playing football. There was another. There was another one that was about the ghost of football past. That could be what? Hm. Maybe this was the one that was about this american indian team that was really interesting. So football was invented by native americans. No, no, no, no. There's just one bad ass team. Here it is right here. And to the 19th century, the civil war was over. Frontier was dead. Young college, better anxious. This is what great struggle with test their character. That along comes a new craze. Football, a brutally violent game where young men show a stadium full of fans, just what they're made of. Harvard, yale, princeton, penn, the sons of the most powerful men in the country are literally knocking themselves out to win these gladiatorial battles. So that's when it came up. And then the carlisle indian school, they were beating the fuck out. All the white dudes.

Speaker 3:          01:16:31       Surprise. Interesting. Yeah, I think. And then I forget. I think they all assimilated. I forget the plot of the rules came because the indians kept beating every to make, making a new rule and they all right, going to change this. Native americans need to make a back. They had a lot of cool ideas. I think we fucked them over by giving them casinos to other towns. Vegas, I've got a small amount of native american in me. Can you get money? Not, not a profit. What do you need? Like 16 percent to get money. You need like a certain amount you can get some cash.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       Uh, I think it's even maybe less than that really. Or to qualify for whatever. I'll have To look into that. It might be the worst thing you can do too. some people just tuck them away and this little patch of land isolate them from everybody else and you know, they're watching the rest of the world changed around them, some sort of a strange way and they're americans, but they're not. They're in some sort of a weird territory that they have ultimate control over and then they started having gambling there and doing whatever the fuck they want. Very strange, but in some ways like what are the other, what were the other options at the time? Giving them territory. Probably pretty ugly optimism. Sure. It's dark. You really stop and think about the genocide of the native americans in this country and how that, how rarely that comes up and there's no flag.

Speaker 2:          01:17:56       Which is really interesting when you, you know, obviously there are some plaques, are some nations, but I mean there's no, no one thing that represents our war with them. That's no, no offensive symbol other than like a few sports teams. Right? Like the redskins are. The braves were both my high school and college were both the warriors. Warriors is not specific to a nationality or ethnicity. logo. Logo was, you know know. It's weird man. It's real weird that the fact that it was only a couple of hundred years ago is really weird. It's a blink of an eye. How long do you think people are going to live now? It's a good question because I'm thinking I'm good for 100 at least. Oh, okay. But you personally? Yeah, I think you're probably, you look healthy, but a kid born today, thousand years old. It's going to be able to read minds.

Speaker 2:          01:18:45       Well, it depends also upon what it person becomes because I have a feeling they're going to come up with legs that are artificial, that work way better than your legs. Like I have a bunch of friends that have like fake hips or fake knees or you know, they've had surgery and they had a bunch of stuff fixed. I know a lot of people that have had hip replacements, like maybe a dozen. So I've figured out that if I create enough public information about me, you know, there was enough times I'm recorded like I'm being right now. Uh, enough of my writing is in the public. There's no video of me that after I die I could be recreated and software almost in full because you would have my, everything from my personality, my sense of humor, my choice of words. So some future program could just go to the internet, google my name and take all those sources and bring together an actual physical hologram that walks and talks like me a hundred years after I'm dead. What jamie, you were just telling me about some software that they've developed that you can take someone's, someone can say like, I could make a statement. Scott adams is a really cool guy and I always love hanging out with them and they can move the words all over the place was where it's a jumbled sentence that it doesn't make any sense. And then change the inflection and it sounds perfect. Like, listen to this. We'll play some of it here called I'll see if

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       I can get

Speaker 3:          01:20:10       and, and, uh, uh, I kiss my wife and my dogs

Speaker 5:          01:20:17       other dogs. Okay. How can we let the dogs out who, who mIght not be a great example of it was terrible.

Speaker 4:          01:20:26       Yeah. It's like a five minute video where they just think he's called like photoshop for audio. Oh, okay. Like it's manipulating audio in a way that people aren't used to or I've even seen up until they've just shown this kind of demonstration.

Speaker 3:          01:20:38       So the point being, if you could automate this, if you could put this inside some sort of an artificial intelligence structure that kneW when to inflect, when to have a question when to like, or maybe you will be a tech guy and talking up, speak up. Speak is right. I love up speak because it's so fuck it. It's this weird thing that these tech dorks do where they sort of talk in this really weird, unpredictable way and they all do it and basically it makes you seem like you're sensitive and intelligent and on the ball and it's a weird fucking little sneaky thing that some of these tech guys do where it takes you a while to go, oh, you're not smart at all. You're fucking crazy. But you talk in ups speak, you know, they've, they've decided to take on the persona of a tech person.

Speaker 3:          01:21:23       Somebody is really into, I believe in android, android's the future and they, they start, they have this weird thing that they do at the end of each sentence. They go up. I'm not sure that exists outside of Virginia or California, silicone valley. It's huge in silicone valley. I think it's more, it's more prevalent in northern California that it is in southern California. It's almost like they're halfway like an npr sort of a radio personality halfway that and halfway a strip club dj. It's like they have this thing going on where it's a fake voice and they're talking about technology. That's all. I'm going to here now. Now I'm going to hear that. Oh, you'll hear it. I'll, I'll, I'll give you some audio of people. There's a bunch of people that they speak and it is an accent. The same way in New York accent or a boston accent is like you can recognize, oh, that's a tech dork.

Speaker 3:          01:22:13       Like it's a non original tech person who's speaking in this weird there. You want people to understand that you're a tech person, so you're speaking in a literally a tech accent, up speak. I might try that and it's really fascinating. Women can do it too. It's super important. You know, like there's a, almost a woman up speak that you'll see occasionally on daytime talk shows where like a bunch of women will sit around and they'll be on a show and the woman or it's all audience, the wwe women's. Um, the audience is all women and there's all women on the panel and then they're cooking or they're talking about clothes and what the woman's up speak. His sentences don't end. They just sort of stopped talking. Do you ever notice somebody who didn't have any way to end a story? Yes, they would. They would talk forever. They keep going. And then

Speaker 2:          01:23:05       during the time of a early cell phones when one person was talking, the other person couldn't talk because you didn't realize it all the time, but it really was one way communication. And somebody would start and I would start yelling into the phone, stop stopped. Okay, bang, bang, bang. You know, let me in, let me in. Well, with what I mean by sentences don't ever end. It's not that they don't stop talking, but that they don't have it. Like if I said to you, hey scott, it's 3:00, we should probably wrap this up in about an hour. Instead of that, they would say, hey scott, it's 3:00. we should probably wrap this up in about an hour and um, and then just keep going and then someone else chimes in. What about 4:00? It's 4:00 a good time. Four o'clock is a good time. Five o'clock is a good time. Six o'clock is a good time.

Speaker 2:          01:23:52       what about seven? Can we do it at seven slash 11 is fine. We can definitely keep going and there's no end. There's no. This is my laptop. My laptop is black. Do they hear it themselves? They love it. They love to talk to get together. Do you think, do you think that if you meet somebody who has heard this podcast and they talk like that normally, would they be unable to talk to, you know, it'd be to self coach now. They'd be fine, they'd say he's a dick. And also I think that's what he said, dick. Um, it's, I didn't give the best example of it either, but yeah, I think what it is, is that's how they enjoy talking. I think they're, they've had to edit their conversations because men get tired quicker. We just don't want to talk as much about certain stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:24:35       Like we'd be like, jesus christ, get on with the story, finish it. When does the story end? But women get together. They love it. They can just keep going. a lot of them can you reminded me of the, the worst advice anybody ever gave his be natural. Be yourself because what the hell does that mean? Who are you? If I were myself, I'd be like, you know, sitting here and make it masturbating and really, well maybe not right here, but yeah, that was a terrible example. Sometimes let's go back, get rid of that. So that would be used sometimes. right? And that's, that is yourself, but it's like yourself varies depending upon your company, depending upon the environment, depending upon the circumstances were all acting all the time. We're, we're adapting to every Situation. Yeah, and you and you also want to be different sometimes, so it's not even necessarily an act.

Speaker 2:          01:25:24       It's like, you know, someone says, hey, he's got, show me. Show me that fucking crazy handstand. You did. Like, it really does not me right now. Right, right. Yeah, but we're always adapting to the situation. Yeah. But there's women that are like men too in that way. The women want other women to shut the fuck up and they want men to shut the fuck up to like I like got damaged people. They're long ass boring stories. It's not necessarily genDer specific, but it seems to be like women on talk shows during the day that are Cooking. Do you ever have people who can't tell when they've gone on too long? Yes. Maybe me right there. And you look at them and you think, do they not know? I'm giving the signals

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       of stop. you know, in the corporate world, you know you always have a pen in your hand. If Somebody came into your cubicle and you wanted to leave, you wouldn't put the pen down so you turn toward them, but you keep the pen in your hand to signal them that you're there for them, you know, you'd put it down and you turn toward them. But if you, if you turn to but just the pen and I'd be like, dude, the pan, you do not see, this patent is still in my hand.

Speaker 3:          01:26:29       There's a weird thing that people will do to you. If you're on the phone while you're on your cell phone, they will come up to you because you're, the physical presence trumps whatever you're. Whatever you got going on digitally, right? So like you're on the phone. You might be having a really important conversation and someone go, hey man, Scott Adams. Hey, how you doIng man? And you're like, hey, I'm the phone. Hey, I just want to tell you I really love dealer. Why white still talking? You? Fuck, you know, I'm in the middle of another conversation. You've decided this person isn't here. Fuck them. You said, I want your attention. I'm right in front of you. I can touch you, Scott Adams. Dilbert's my hero. I love you and behold, juror shoulder,

Speaker 1:          01:27:01       but you know, you, you, you get the, you get the celebrity thing that I don't get because I'm invisible. Like your visual,

Speaker 3:          01:27:07       you're visual. You're on periscope. I knew exactly what you look like. Oh, you wouldn't? 7,000 people on earth. Uh, it's, I think it's more, I think their shadow banning you. Uh, I like that term that we were talking about that the other day, hillary for prison. Remember when we were saying rape? Melania was actually a hashtag, but hillary for prison wasn't. That's not what people were saying was people were saying was they were shadow banning that hillary for prison. Hashtag meaning if You put hashtag hillary for prison, someone could search it and find it, but if you put it, it wouldn't show up in other people's feeds. I don't know if that's true though. Has that been proven?

Speaker 1:          01:27:43       I, I'm having a real tough time with what's proven because lots of people are sending me my own stuff and saying, here's proof that you have been shadow banned because look at this page and then compare it to this page, and I always look at them and I go, I'm not really a lawyer. I, I can't tell

Speaker 3:          01:27:58       how you find out. Very simple reason. You're wealthy, man. You have two laptops. You make a second twitter account. Don't use it for nefarious reasons. Don't get on and start shitting on people under 59 or whatever the fuck you call it, but you start a laptop, you follow you, you follow a few other people just for a goof, and then you sit there and you watch your timeline.

Speaker 1:          01:28:17       Well, no, I, I do know that people are not getting my stuff. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:28:21       but here's the thing. You could find out yourself. You could tweet from another computer as scott adam says, so you do. Scott. Adam says you're followIng you on another computer that's in a different account and you're such, but have you done that?

Speaker 1:          01:28:35       No, but I'm saying that other people have done that and they sent me the screenshot,

Speaker 3:          01:28:38       but when I look at her crazy, they just want to talk to you, scott. They want to be your friend. They want to talk to you when you're on your cell phone. Hey man, I love gilbert. Who he talked to. You don't fuck it. I'm right here, man. Why don't you try it yourself?

Speaker 1:          01:28:51       Um, I guess I wasn't that curious.

Speaker 3:          01:28:54       Come on and he talked about it. You have to be curious. I kind of liked being shadow banned. Do you like being shadow banned or you liked the idea of you being shadow bands? I liked that definitive proof that your shadow bands I liked, I liked the thought that I might be so dangerous to the minds of America that there's a major corporation who is actually making a conscious decision to say who the americas had a little bit too much of this guy. So let's dial it back a little bit. Well of like that if twitter didn't have a history of banning people, you know, like the milo thing, milo yiannopoulos, that was a big mistake, big mistake because they didn't ban them for anything that like you could like put your finger on. TheY banned them for influence and other people were saying mean things, but you looked at the stuff that he actually said, man, you can't ban them for that.

Speaker 3:          01:29:41       That's just not, that's not fair. Well, certainly not compared to everything else that's on twitter, not even compared to the things that leslie jones wrote, you know, I mean, the, the person that he was supposedly attacking and what he was doing was he was targeting a piece of art and he critiqued it very harshly, but that's what he does and he's very wise with his choice of words is very snippy and bitchy and that's his persona and that's what he's put together. He's a lovely guy. Like I've had them on the podcast a couple of times. I enjoy his company. He's a fun guy, but god damned. People get pissed off and then it's kind of hilarious. And so when that whole thing went down with the leslie jones things, and I've absolutely didn't agree with all the people that were being mean insulting to leslie, but that's kind of what happens if you put yourself out there with a piece of art, right, that people don't like.

Speaker 3:          01:30:32       And all he did was saY that they were all ugly, you know, he was saying that it's a bad feminist film because all the men are buffoons and all the women are saving the world. And he's like, it's preposterous. It's sucks, it's not good. And the women are all gross. And that's what he said and you know, for that was that the last part was all the trouble. Well it was, I mean, the fact that he was saying they're unattractive. He was saying that not just to be bitchy, but also at a point it was like he, he made a point, he's like, they've decided lee picked people that were unattractive to make this sort of feminist point of these overweight women can save the world. That they're the ones who are gonna like they're targeting. And that's why all the men are buffoons. it's sort of revenge, like the idea being, if you wanted to look at it broadly, the idea being that these are the type of women that the guy like the thor dude, what's his name?

Speaker 3:          01:31:20       the guy who was in that movie, that really handsome fellow that plays thor, chris quits name. Now chris is super spy. Captain american to see liam hemsworth. Is that the grams worth comes worth chris hemsworth, right? It's one of them. Am I right? Or is it chris? The guy who plays captain America hemsworth. Let's just call them thor. Okay. Doors impossibly beautiful. It's beautiful man. It's super handsome. Big fucking perfect body. And of course in this movie, he's a fucking moron. I mean he is the dumbest guy that's ever walked the face of the planet. He's preposterously dm and then becomes the villain at the end. So he represents this unattainable goal of like a having this gigantic beautiful man be attracted to you. So they've turned him in this complete retard. Like if this was a woman in a movie, it would be one of the most offensive portrayals of a woman ever. And I'm sure it's been done. I'm sure it's been done right. Especially like in the old days. I mean, there was how many fucking dopey secretary roles were there in the world, right? so he was that the male caricature of that. But there's not a single other male in the movie that wasn't a complete buffoon. Every male iS a failure and ultimately gets killed and dies. Every woman's saves the day. And this was my lowest point.

Speaker 1:          01:32:30       So in most forms of entertainment you need the dumb one and the smart one, you know, there's always going to be that contract. Sure. And in earlier times there were other people you could poke fun at and society would say, oh yeah, we make fun of that. And you know, the, the, the wife was the dumb one in the fifties and now some of it is just what target can you get away with? So there's, there's a little bit of that. It's like, you know who's a soft target, nobody's going to complain and men are the, you know, the current target. If you look at commercials, almost all the commercials are. The woman is the smart one in the man. Did something stupid that she had to fix it. Every sitcom, every sitcom.

Speaker 3:          01:33:10       But I mean, even in the fifties, that was the case like the honeymooners. Ralph kramden was a fucking moron. His wife has one is always keeping them calm, right? He was always to the moon. Alice, he's threatening to beat her. Right. And his buddy, his buddy was this fucking idiot to. And his buddy's wife was keeping him in line. Yeah. That was true for the honeymooners. Yeah. I mean, at any couples sort of comedy, the man is a buffoon. Married with children. Pegs always want sex is all fucked up. He's trying to get away from her. He hates his life. Everything falls apart on him. His daughter's acting like a little hussy, right? I mean that's the whole thing. This poor guy, his life's falling apart. The guys never. Okay. All those movies, that guy's a buffoon and all those sitcoms. That guy's a buffoon. That's what people like to see.

Speaker 1:          01:33:55       Yeah. But you know, I'm looking at elvis right behind you. Let's different animal baby. Yeah. come on in. So there were a lot of movies where it was, you know, frank sinatra, charles bronson, maybe you have to go back further where, where the man was the competent one and the woman was always losing her high hill. OH, there's plenty of movies like that. But in sitcoms and the sitcom world and the comedy world, it's pretty much always the men's. A man's phone. Yeah. I think that's fair to say for a lot. You know, king of queens. There's another one, Kevin James is always ridiculous. His wife always had to figure everything out. He Was ridiculous. But how did you get this hot wife? She's on tv.

Speaker 3:          01:34:34       I mean, this is a. I mean, we're going back to the twitter thing. This is the problem with censoring people, uh, Is that if you don't like what they stand for, you know, you're not really, like they were looking for the reason to pull the plug on him. It wasn't a good one. So it left people like what that like that him saying that. And then when you pull up things that she has said about white people that she has said about other ethnicities and some of the, she's like literally said get someone, like someone tweeted something matter. She was telling people to get them. That's like this targeted harassment, right? Like that is like actual targeted harassment and the idea that she's doing it in revenge for someone coming after her. I understand, but in the position that she's at, like she's a huge celebrity for her to actively say go get this person.

Speaker 3:          01:35:23       Like that is the clearest example you're ever going to see of targeted harassment. So if that doesn't get punished in any way, shape or form, like you got to say, well why is it because she's female is because she's black? Is it a combination of those things is because she represents what you think is like liberal progressive mindset and then he represents this all right, that people are terrified of and hate. He represents the gamer gate which gave birth to the alt right, like gamergate allowed people to realize like, hey, there's actually some intelligent people that are tired of all this bullshit that these feminists are trying to push down our throats and intelligent people that are coming together and go, no, laura croft is not the fucking bane of civilization. It's fun to watch her run around with her tits. Jiggling, shoot guns at things.

Speaker 3:          01:36:07       It doesn't mean you hate women just doesn't. You know, and women were playing that game too anD saying the same thing and this portrayal of these people as being these ugly massage. Just monsters. The backlash of that is what gave birth to gamergate and a loT of gamergate was harassment, targeted harassment of women. Horrible stuff. Right? But I think as you were saying when it was, when you're talking about trump supporters, there's a certain percentage of these trump supporters that probably are racist, doesn't mean they all are like, what is the number? Is it two percent? Is at four percent. There's a certain percent of the probably absolute misogynist. What's that number? I don't know what that number is, but there's also some other people in there. There has to be that a reasonable. Because if you look at the number of people that voted for obama and you look at the number of people that voted for trump,

Speaker 1:          01:36:50       a lot of those people at the same people will actually, if you look at romney's vote compared to trump, I think ron, the trump did better in most ethnic groups. Yes he did. Just across the board. They didn't trust that white dude. And, and what was the, what was the problem with romney? He just didn't have the policies they wanted to write. I mean, it was also the mormon thing. Well, yeah, but it was also the mormon thing. But the mormon thing was pretty big, I think. I mean, he, he believes one of the wackiest strains of christianity would even call it christianity. Well, we don't know. We don't know which parts of it. He believes literally. Well, we know that his dad was actually born in Mexico. Do you know the whole story about that? I don't.

Speaker 3:          01:37:31       Oh, I'm going to school you scott, because this is wonderful. Please do. Mitt romney comes from a faction of the mormons that were so hardcore that when the United States banned polygamy, they went, we'll fuck this. We're moving to Mexico. so they moved to Mexico. So mitt romney's dad could never be the president United States because he was born in Mexico. It was a mexican citizen. They have these giant compounds and they have to fight off the drug and there's more than one gigantic compound owned by mormons in Mexico. They literally have carved out their own camps down there and they're armed and they did as vice piece on them where they interviewed them and went over there and talked about it, and that is the whole reason why mitt romney's mommy's dad's mexican. I mean literally mexican, born in Mexico, mexican citizen, they'll look at that.

Speaker 3:          01:38:20       Mitt romney's mexican roots. His father was born in Mexico and could choose. He could choose dual citizenship. That is interesting. Yeah. How did I noT know that? How did you not know that matters? Anything? Well, I'm a. I'm obsesseD with mormons, so that's how I found out about it and obsessed for a long time. So did you do The deep dive and look at all this stuff that they believe in? Oh yeah. Yeah. The seer stone, like Joseph Smith in 18, 12 found magic tablets that were the last work of jesus and only he could read him because he had a magic rock and he was like 14 at the time, which is fucking hilarious. All this happened when he was 14. This is when he first concocted this goofy ass story apparently where he lived. It was fairly common for people to come up with this kind of calm.

Speaker 3:          01:39:06       Really? Yeah. I mean it was, it wasn't like the only one doing this. It was. I read that somewhere is just stuck. Yes. my sources. I read that somewhere and I misremembered it now, so I'll say it in public because that settles pretty authoritative thing about mormons though. They're really nice people. I really, I like a lot of mormons. I'm frienDs with quite a few more minutes. I know a bunch of them and like in general they promote a lot of camaraderie, a loT of community. They're very friendly. The people like in the mormon church, like the friends that I know that are mormons, they go to church on a regular basis and it's almost like this community gathering of super polite people that agree to be super polite. I've said the same thing and I don't know if it's because they don't drink and don't have coffee or something, but I don't think I've ever met a mormon, but I didn't really like.

Speaker 3:          01:39:51       they're nice people. They just all seem great. Just almost like it's okay to believe wacky shit if it works for you. I've never met one that really believed the, you know, the deeper stuff. Oh my friends wear the underwear. Seriously. Yeah. They have to wear the underwear, but that's not a belief so much as a customer, wouldn't you say? Yeah. Well they're a little hypocritical, right? Like you're not allowed to drink coffee. so this do drinks, energy drinks, monsters, those giant ones. He pounds those things and you know, you're not supposed to do drugs, but you can get away with it. If the doctor prescribes the xanax, you're allowed to take that because it's not in. It's not any of their books. They didn't have xanax. Xanax is a loophole. You just can't. You can't pound booze. So he just fucking pop pills and freak out all day.

Speaker 3:          01:40:38       That was a good compromise. That's a good. Religion is flexible. Well, they're nice people. They're really nice people like, um, I'm a fan of the mormon people. Like in general, I think what they believe is nonsense, but maybe they don't really believe that. Maybe you're right. I said that I've talked to one who actually believed the, the stuff that's just be. They enjoy the community aspect of it and the bonding of it and they believe in god and maybe they just let all that other stuff slide. That's totally possible. That feels like it. I mean, I don't know if it feels like, you know, if they die, they get their own planet. That is a perk. You get a whole planet. You know what? I die if I die. You know what? I get what she had. Dude, that's not true. I decomposed. I'm going to get you in tight with the mormons and you're going to get a planet because I like you.

Speaker 3:          01:41:25       If you're seeing the osman brothers, um, album where they, uh, they all have. It's named after the planet that you get. What the fuck is the or named after this, this thing that they believe that makes you get all these planets like this place that you go, you get your own planet. But in the osman album, the osbourne family album, whenever the fuck it is, they all have like their own little planets and it's inside like the album jacket, like he opened it up. There's like planets. It's hilarious. It's really fun, but again, perfect example, Donny osmond and marie osmond, very nice people. Uh, I'm going to shop around for new religion because They'll have different afterlives and I think you have to compare them to do because the planet thing is due. So it was pretty appealing. Well a may imagine if we go back to your original idea that this is some sort of a software simulation and that's why your memories are so wacky and nothing sticks and imagine if you literally are choosing by virtue of your decision to join a certain religion, what your afterlife will be like if you're in a video game and there's like a bunch of different doors you have to figure out which one's the right door to go through and you go through that door.

Speaker 3:          01:42:34       It's a totally different adventure. What if we really are a software simulation and just like you say, the software allows you to pick an afterlife and you do actually. I mean that's what you're actually experiencing because for software that would be totally practical if we're software that would be totally practical. And that simulation theory thing is a mindfuck because you don't know what we're talking about. Here's the rub. The rub is one day without a doubt, if we continue, if we don't get hit by an asteroid, if we don't get swallowed up in a super volcano or a tsunami or an earthquake or something crazy, human beings will reach a point where if you look at the exponential growth of technology, we are going to be able to create an artificial reality that is indistinguishable from regular reality. If that's the case, how will we know if we're in it?

Speaker 3:          01:43:25       We won't. So how do we know if we're not in it right now? I'll take the math one. One step further is that by the time there's one of those, if it's a perfect simulation, the simulation will create another simulation and so on. So it's turtles all the way down. So then, so this is actually what the scientists, they say that the number of original species will be one and the number of copies will eventually be gigantic. You know, it could be thousands, millions, trillions. So the odds that you're the original copy, you know, the original might be one in a trillion if that's a real, that's the big f, but it's an f tHat if not possible now or if not reality will one day be. Yeah, we can't tell where we are in the cycle. If we're, if we're a simulation, we don't know if there were hundreds of simulations before us.

Speaker 3:          01:44:19       There's no way to know. Well, there's also the very slippery aspect of consciousness where we shut it off every night and then turn it back on in the morning and we assume that our memories when we wake up in the morning are all accurate. We assume that we really did, you know, wake up November 17th, 2016 in our bed, put our clothes on with his database of life experiences leading up to that point. But how the fuck do you know? It didn't just start, he just woke up and they might have been installed with this goofy life memory that you might have started this life this morning. Yeah. If you look into physics, we know when I say we, I mean people much smarter who are physicists, know that things don't really exist until you observe them. I'm going, what the hell does that mean? That's a tricky thing that people say.

Speaker 3:          01:45:08       That's not necessarily true. You know what they mean by that? That when you observe something in the act of observing it, you change it. Now that's, that's a different concept, but. But knowing that something's true like the. There's the tree falls in the forest, right? Is that what you're saying? The, the observation changes that so that the change thing. Maybe we are talking about the same. Right, but the observation really only changes it when you measure it. That's what it's the measurement. When you know they do those particle tests, those are off. Have you ever talked to a physicist about that? Observing is enough. You don't have to. It doesn't have to technically be made. You have to observe it. If you're not measuring well, just looking at it like looking at what? Seeing it or seeing any sign of it. Right, but not anything that's an indication that it must have been enough to solidify the past.

Speaker 3:          01:45:56       Well, if you never observed it before and then you are observing and how do you know that there's a difference between the two results? I don't know even know what I'm talking about. I have no idea the way it's been explained to me by a friend of mine who's actually a physicist, he said it's often, there's a lot of woo woo that's tacked onto this, but when you're talking about these measurements that people say like that in the act of measuring something and looking at something, you change the result. He's lIke, that is much better interpreted by the measurement itself, the actual act of seeing something or recording something or interfacing with it in some way to get them a reading. As a result. He's like, that's much more likely what's going on. There's no real evidence that looking at something changes it because if you weren't looking at it before, how do you know if it was different? Whoa, well that was good. It was crazy, man, and that's not the way I understood it, but I'm

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       also not a physicist, nor do I have a friend who's a physicist who can explain it to.

Speaker 3:          01:46:54       I get confused at these things because they're often repeated and the repeated by people who haven't looked into it and it gets me worried. It's one of those things like the wage gap thing. Do you know The wage gap argument versus reality? I do. I've looked into it deeply, so crazy one because people really smart people will tell you, women make seventy nine cents for every dollar a man makes, and that gives you the impression that they're working side by side in the same factory and the woman's make it seventy nine cents and the man's making a dollar. That's not what it means. What it means is overall men make a dollar to seventy nine cents that women make because of career choices, because of jobs, the different jobs that they choose. If you're going to make the argument that it's more difficult for women to get those jobs, that's a different argument and you might be right, but that's not when you're saying that the wage discrimination gap.

Speaker 3:          01:47:40       Like when obama says we have to change with wage discrimination, like, whoa, what are you talking about? Like do you think that an engineer should get the same as you know, a person who works, you know, whatever, fill in the blank some, you know, typical female job. But like when it comes to science and engineering and a lot of those stem sort of subjects, men sort of gravitate towards them. Men gravitate towards riskier jobs. Men are more likely to die on the job. Men choose different paths because of testosterone and their gender and to die. That seems kind of silly, but so when they start talking about this gender gap, which everybody throws around all willy nilly with no research whatsoever, they really believe that. You're talking about two lawyers working in the same firm side by side. The man makes a dollar. The one who makes seventy nine cents. So it's not

Speaker 1:          01:48:24       how many statistics, how many times have you been in a conversation with somebody who believed in in the 79, seven figure and then you explained it to them and they said, oh no, I don't think that's the case. Then you showed them a link, you proved it beyond any doubt and it still didn't change their mind.

Speaker 3:          01:48:41       I won't accept the fact that could have been wrong about something because they've attached their identity to being correct. Right. It's a huge problem with anything gender related. The gender thing is that the idea is that women have been suppressed and they have for sure. I mean women didn't get the right to vote until the 20th century. Right. That's kinda crazy. You know, I mean we, we went through a Long time in this country where women couldn't even vote, so absolutely they been suppressed and absolutely, there's a lot of things that brought them out of that. First of all, birth control, like the ability to choose whether or not they're going to be pregnant. The, the, the, the laws, changing discrimination laws, changing people's perceptions of what women are changing. All those things are absolutely real, but that's. You can't lie about numbers. Like as soon as you bullshit people, then they have reason to disbelieve you, but everything.

Speaker 3:          01:49:27       So if you start bullshitting about the wage gap, and this is not saying that it's not More difficult to be a woman. I think it is. I think it's moRe difficult because I think men are pieces of shit and there's a lot of violent, dangerous, creepy men that probably want to rape you and I would hate to be a woman in that sort of a scenario. So I'm not denying that. It's probably more difficult in our society because of a lot of shitty men. it's more difficult to be a woman, but you can't lie about numbers. As soon as you start lose students, you start pretending that women get paid less for the same job across the board. You ruin the whole argument because now we're not dealing in reality. Now we're doing the same thing where we're not looking at caitlin jenner is a human.

Speaker 3:          01:50:05       We're looking at as a gender identity hero. You know, like, well, what about as a human? Like we were supposed to celebrate someone or or not as a human being as a total package. We're not doing that and this is where we're treating the whole subject with blinders because it pertains to gender. We can't look at the reality of it. I would generalize that to say that nobody's ever won an argument with data. It almost never happens because the problem is that people just say, well, your data's role, so and that's the end of the conversation, but does that. Isn't that less and less the case now that ever before issue would be shed, but I'm, I'm actively in conversations with people in which I can show them all the data that I want. It makes no difference. Humans are twitter people, even regular people in the world in real life.

Speaker 3:          01:50:54       yeah, but you know, there's a broad spectrum of people in the world, right? He's. When you're talking about people that you respect, your peers, colleagues, fellow cartoonIsts, I mean, you're talking about them. are you talking about regular educated people? I've never seen anybody change their mind on that topic, that specific topic. That's a weird one. Yeah, that's a weird one. Yeah. I've seen people have some pretty heated discussions about it too and completely uninformed. If people don't have an emotional, a lock on the topic, then you can move them with data just because they don't care. It's like, oh, there's better data. Okay, but people are so dug in on that particular topic. It's very insidious, very insidious because I think it like we were talking about what the hillary clinton thing about lying about Russia. As soon as you lie about that, as soon as you lie about something, well I'm going, what the fuck?

Speaker 3:          01:51:42       You know when when you see you, I'm sure you've seen it, that director comey video where compares what cami said versus what hillary is saying. He said, and it's like, holy shit. Like you're just lying. Like you just keep lying. Like this is a crazy moment where you seeing this because it didn't. DIdn't exist until recently. We had This youtube phenomenon where you can watch and get millions of hits on these videos where it shows the reality versus what you're saying and when you. When you soon as you throw a non-reality into it, I know that you're dealing with it from a team perspective, like you're just trying to manipulate whatever the facts are or wherever the argument is to get your team in. You don't really care what's true. You women get paid less period. You fucking piece of shit. Seventy nine cents to a dollar, read the facts and you know, you can't even argue with it. You can't even bring it up. But that's everything all the time. If there's any emotional connection, we just think that, you know, logic and data and you know, arguments matter. But yeah, they're just so rare. And if you disagree also, you're like, so happy to be a man. You must be so happy to be a man. You think

Speaker 2:          01:52:45       men are the only ones who could run this world. You think men don't discriminate against women every step of the way. It must be really nice to have that white male privileged. Scott adams. The sarcasm as a replacement for reason is probably the most annoying thing in the world. And I've been, you know, the sarcasm has been raining on me for a year for writing about trump, but yeah, it's exactly what you said is like, so then trump would get elected and then he'll just make everything good and then there will be just unicorns, right? Yeah. That's a weird argument that people love to put words in your mouth and then force you to defend them. I talk about the word, so as a tell for that, whatever's going to come next as a hallucination. So, so if you say to say to me, you know, it doesn't matter who said, uh, you know, uh, I went to the store yesterday, I would say.

Speaker 2:          01:53:38       So you abandoned your children, have, you know, whatever comes, we'll just won't make any sense. Oh my god, that's hilarious. That's really funny. Yeah, you can definitely do that. I mean, that's the art of persuasion, right? That's hypnosis. That's what you're into. Do you have a pocket watch? You have one of those? No, that's not part of the process. Weirdly enough. But it isn't cartoons and movies. Yes. I think there was it ever. I think there was one movie, so that's well known in the history that this one movie, I don't know what it was a showed somebody doing using a watch to hypnotize and then it just became a thing, but it was never a thing within the hypnotist world. Was theRe ever a moment during this whole campaign where it was getting really crazy and people were angry about so many different things?

Speaker 2:          01:54:25       Like how about when all those women came out in mass? Right. There was this and moss and moss. There was at one time were all these women were coming out saYing Donald Trump tried to grab my tits and Donald Trump and some of them were pretty innocuous, but it was all together like a coordinated effort. Was there ever a moment wHere you're like, what the fuck that I do? Like why did I come out and supported this guy? Like what Did I. The hate that I'm getting right now that that was the moment that I switched my endorsement that Gary Johnson. I remember that and my reasoning was because Gary Johnson only touches himself and that's something that I can respect in a leader. No trouble there, but that was tongue in cheek. It was tongue and cheek, but I was also getting out of the blast zone. I remember I was never as supporting him based on policies or I was just talking about is persuasion, but was there ever a time where you thought, I should probably make a moral distinction because I'm getting caught up in this wave of angry white people and their massage and racism and all the credit.

Speaker 2:          01:55:26       I mean that was the worst aspects, right? That the two percent that we already discussed it and you get caught up in this association game that people are doing when they have this us versus them little battle going on. Did you ever think like, what the fuck man, what did I do? Not in those words, but I'm. I'm fortunately

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       in, in a situation where I have what I call fuck you money and I can. I can kind of take some risks that you wouldn't take earlier in your career and one of them is the risk to say what ever I think is useful and necessary and I want to say, and so that is a huge risk to be associated with anybody unpleasant. But uh, at the same time I self identify with being ultra liberal, like liberal people seem a little too conservative for me. I'm left to them.

Speaker 3:          01:56:13       That is interesting about you and I, I definitely wanted to get to that because you're not a right wing guy. You know, you, you're very reasonable. And that's what I, what I thought was so fascinating about this. I'm like, and it actually makes sense now. You say it, you have fuck you money, so why shouldn't you just speak about whatever attributes, positive or negative you might see and when look at it, almost like you're looking at a puzzle, you know, all low. We'll look at this piece here. This piece is going to go right there and see there's an opening here.

Speaker 1:          01:56:39       It's weird. There was a space for this of somebody who didn't have a team. Yes. As part of the reason I don't vote, I don't join a party. You didn't vote at all? No, it isn't that ironic. It would bias me. Oh, I see. As soon as you vote, you joined the team but you like a klingon in this world. He just wrote roman through the streets and then people make those rules and use to bide by them. How does that work? Ah, non participant in our democracy. Scott adams. Well, secretly canadian by California. And so I didn't think it mattered that much who I voted for. Um, but I also think that staying unbiased is important. So I'm just not a joiner. But wHat about others?

Speaker 3:          01:57:24       Things like you could always write in a presidential candidate if you want to do that, but like voting on things like legalizing marijuana, things that are really important. I mean that's.

Speaker 1:          01:57:32       You don't notice I go right to that. Forget fuck the death penalty. There's a lot of important issues you could vote on, right? Yeah. But my take on that is that the people who think they understand those issues almost never do. And the few that I could understand well enough, like legalizing weed, um, it was going the way I wanted it anyway. so according to the polls that thought that hillary clinton was gonna win, see all these polls, the problem, the weed pulls where we're much more accurate and it

Speaker 3:          01:58:02       or a gap there, the weed pulls are more accurate. Well, they are for sure it won. It won by a landslide. But I thought it was important. I felt like if I was going to vote, I mean the voting for freedom, wherever it is, wherever it's possible, especially freedom is not, you're not hurting anybody and you're removing the possibility of being locked up for something. IT's not hurting anybody across the board whether it's pot or whether it's wearing dresses. Um, for that I would be just as enthusiastic about a transgender law if someone made it a law where a man couldn't become a woman, you know? And then we were fighting against that. I would be as enthusiastic as I am about almost almost enthusiasts to pot thing to is a, represents a freedom issue as much as it is anything else.

Speaker 1:          01:58:44       I put those in a different frame. So, um, you know, the birth of the nation, there was this debate about states' rights and you know, what's the federal government do and the idea was that the more local the government, the better they understood the people and stuff like that. But fast forward today with the internet and, and more and the states are like little laboratories so we can watch, hey, how'd it go in Colorado? So we're, we don't Have to argue on principle or morality anymore. we're actually beyond that because we can measure, we can ab test with the, uh, with the states. So with everything from abortion law to a weed, um, you can say, hey, let the states Do it and let's just make sure we measure it, make sure we have a real, a thing that matters, that, that we can say if it reaches this level, they work. If there's crime it didn't. Um, and I think that's the direction we're going, which is insanely useful because it takes all the emotion out of it because like we don't have to wonder if it's our right to smoke weed or anything, just see how it worked out.

Speaker 3:          01:59:49       I, uh, I don't disagree With what you're saying, but I also think that it's that too. I think the morality and ethics play a part of it as well. I think reading for the first state. Okay. But after that you can just see what happened, man, I don't know because that means in the 49 other states you leave open the possibility that people are going to be locked up in jail for nonviolent crimes that don't hurt anyone. And that seems to be a giant ethic temporarily. Even if it's temporarily, it could ruin their life knowing that the law, the law, is this temporary, it was temporarily still, they're still there. That's not optimal. It's not optimal and the consequences are too grave. You're taking away people's freedom. So to me it becomes primarily a freedom issue. The same way it'd be if men wanted to wear dresses or if women wanted to wear combat boots and all of sudden we said, we can't have that anymore.

Speaker 3:          02:00:38       Well, you're giving two examples that I consider easy. You know, the weed and the, you know, the, the gender thing. Those are easy. Those should be available to everybody. I go, okay, so let's go with one that's hard. Which would be automated cars. Oh, that's. I love that one. Yeah. How about this one? Good example, like when we get to a certain point in time, will we lose our freedom to be autonomous? Will we lose our freedom to be able to drive a car and be able to steer and trust you to hit the brakes when you're supposed to?

Speaker 1:          02:01:04       Oh, all of your autonomy is going away. It's going aWay. So. So think about this. I blogged about this today. Suppose you had a fitness band and it was like the future. I'm not, not long time of five or 10 years and they can do everything from tell you when you should take a sip of water because you're dehydrated. It knows what kind of food you should eat and when it was, when you should sleep and it tells you how the, in the beginning you're going to say, oh, good suggestion. I'll either do that or not, but eventually you're going to see that their suggestion is better than whatever the hell you would have done on your own and you're just going to start following the app and eventually that app is going to be controlling your

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       life while you have the sensation that you're deciding. maybe you dude nomy rebel out there. I to make my own choices. I'm going to rip off that fitbit. Yeah man. Fuck that. Fitbit were free. I'm going to run and when I feel tired I'll stop or keep pushing because that's what I do. Push harder. Hashtag push harder. Um, I know what you're saying. I agree. I think also people like when things become, when you have less stuff to talk about or think about, you know, and as soon as you get in your car and the car drives itself, well now I don't have to think about that anymore. You know, I was going to invest in alcohol companies, you know, companies that produced and manufactured alcohol because it could be drunk in your car now because self driving cars are coming. Right, right. And the day they do, 80 percent of the reasons not to drink just goes away, which is how do you get home?

Speaker 2:          02:02:34       That's a good point. Yeah. Do you think they'll have no steering wheel at all? Like what? If everything goes wrong? I think it will have his steering wheel because you know, you have to get off the road and present. If you get drunk you're like fuck it. I could drive. You want to drive. Even though it's autonomous, right? You'll be too drunk to program the address and you're like, what kind of drive? And it started driving. Good point. We don't have that problem with uber, you know, no matter how drunk I am, I never tried to come out from the back and yeah, but it's not right in front of you. And also with uber you're too busy trying to figure out whether the guy driving needs a serial killer. You need a breathalyzer on there to get control of the steering wheel. You need to be able to take a swab and run it through machines from them.

Speaker 2:          02:03:18       What kind of dna that's fucking creep. Has you ever gone through security lately and they do the little swab. They put it in the machine and I'm thinking, what does it know about me? How much can it figure it out for me? Because from your odor and your dna or whatever the hell they're looking at, they could probably know a lot about me. Yeah, they definitely could if they. Well tHat's the big argument about those fingerprint scanners on cell phones that they're slowly but surely accumulating a database of fingerprints of all the people in this country. Yeah. That's scary to slowly but surely the boundaries between people and data are eroding. So let me ask you this. So in the news today, um, I don't know who said it, it wasn't trump himself. I think that the discussion of a muslim database, did you hear them? The idea of collecting names. I think only the people who are noncitizens coming into the country which raises, you know, every kind of nazi concentration camp alarm and should um, but do you think we don't already have that list? Don't question, don't you think that somewhere in our big data, which they can't tell the citizens and in fact they can even tell the politicians because they're probably only a few people who

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       know, probably a few people in the government who know what we know about citizens. But the idea that there's anybody coming into the country and we don't have a really good idea of where they are at any time. I mean if they have back doors into everything from the credit card processing companies to, you know, all the other big cell phone companies, they have a working profile on everybody. If they want it done. In other words, I have to push the button to run the program. But if they wanted to know, if they wanted to know your religion, they wouldn't need to have you fill it out in a form becauSe they could check your credIt card and say, hey, you buys gas next to the, you know, the synagogue or the mosque or whatever. And his friends are. They use because they do the same things at the same time. Big data already knows your religion.

Speaker 3:          02:05:22       If someone wants to track down all that stuff, it's the thing is who is the someone? How many? Like I have a friend. It's always worried. The government's like looking into his email and following them. And I. This is what I always say, like who's, how many people are they doing this to? There's hundreds of millions of people. How many people work in the government? How are they doing that? Like, here's a, here's a good story. This is how people will think, oh, the following me, man, listen to this story. The guy who broke into the white house, do you know about that story? The guy who ran through the white. I add a bit about it in my last netflix special because this is where progressiveness goddess is ridiculous idea that everybody's equal. They left a woman guarding the door of the white house by herself. This is a true story.

Speaker 3:          02:06:05       The guy hopped the fence. He was crazy. Ptsd down out of his fucking mind veteran ran across the lawn. The guy who was in charge of monitoring the, the, the, the grassy area where this guy ran across, took his earpiece out and was on the phone with his girlfriend. So this guy was like having a conversation with a girlfriend while this guy's running across the lawn. The guy gets to the front door, the alarm system is down because he kept fucking up, so they just shut it off. So they left a girl by herself at the door with no alarm or a guy just ran across the lawn. Then you find out about the guy. Well, the guy turns out was arrested just a couple of months before this with 800 fucking rounds of ammunition for like four rifles, two handguns and machete and acts the arm to the tits with a fucking map of Washington dc with an x where the white house is. They weren't watching that guy like they weren't even watching him. Like we are dealing with way more in competence than we would like to believe or that we would care to admit.

Speaker 1:          02:07:15       So that was the case of a criminal investigation that the law enforcement people didn't coordinate. Right?

Speaker 3:          02:07:21       Well, it was both that and complete arrogance and not having an alarm system on not having more than one person guarding the lawn, not having more than one person at the door, having a woman at the door, like by herself with his fucking giant

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       soldier comes running through and knocked her to the ground and runs around the white house. Say thIs is a perfect example. So since that never had happened before, like, you know, probably. Well maybe not 100 years of 18. 12 was the last time it happened before that. Oh, well, 1912 excuse, so you're never really ready for the thing that hasn't happened. I always think about if if nuclear war broke out, like let's say Russia and the United States decided, all right, it's on and we're gonna launch. I don't think they'd work the two bombs, the bombs, because we'd never done it before. like we've only tested. We've tested the bomb and we've tested the missile, but we haven't tested the missile on the bomb and the chain of command and who puts the codes and sure we've tested all the parts. imagine it was all fucking for gazy scheme and like there's nothing even in those things.

Speaker 2:          02:08:22       I just taken that tax dollars and using it for satanic rituals and flying on private jets everywhere. did you read all that stuff? That podesta stuff that came out in the wiki leaks emails about all the weird rituals they were going to the spirit cooking involved sperm and blood and why in the fuck are they doing like, I don't like to believe when Alex Jones goes onto his fucking crazy. TheY're all satanists. EverY one of them. They're all worshiping satan. You know, you'd go wIth Alex Jones is crazy, he's going crazy. Obama is a devil, literally a devil in hell. and you go, Alex Jones out of his fucking mind. and then you see this pedesta thing where you know some, they're doing satan rituals like this went to it went to watch something called spirit cooking. Well, but you heard the explanation. I did not. So the explanation was the woman who I guess was the hostess says, oh yeah, it does mean those other things, but we've sort of, you know, cutely just generalized it to whatever we're doing.

Speaker 2:          02:09:25       So, so the spirit, carole king, but didn't meet any of that. I don't buy that. I don't buy that for a second. I'm not sure I buy that they were all getting together to eat blood and sperm. well, why are they even talking about it? My friends and I, we never get together and talk about blood and sperm. No, never comes out. They didn't talk about it, but somebody did. well, the email just said, do you want to go to the spirit cooking thing? right? But then when you find out what the spirit cooking is and involves blood and sperm, right, was one of the things that means. So is there a good party by the way? It's not a party until somebody believes so many bleeds and somebody comes. I didn't look into the explanation because to me it's one of those things that I don't want to know any further pat because it's too fun to think these wacky fucks are out there. Just a puck bucket of blood and drinking it and throwing it on themselves. That's more fun to me than rational explanation. I think the best moment of the whole year was related to that. It was a mike cernovich was tweeting about it the most. And I realized that, I think it was the Washington post ran a piece by piece sort of explaining why it wasn't what it was. And I thought, where have we come to the point where mike cernovich makes, uh,

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       the Washington post, uh, defend how much sperm pedesta it's like, no, no. It was way less burden than you think. It was a couple of drops. That's all you need. That's all you need. A couple of drops. It's, it's a symbolic thing. this is totally unrelated, but did you see the real sports from this week with a beak from yoga guy? You see brian? Uh, what's his name? Brian gumbel. Thank you. Uh, he uh, did this real sports, one of his episodes, he had this woman go away and investigate a beaker from knowing, I think his name is. He's the guy that's the lead of bikram yoga and uh, apparently he's allegedly banged a bunch of chicks that work there and you know, sexually harassed him, allegedly, allegedly, allegedly keep saying that. But he was, they were saying. And he was like, why would I do that when women will pay $1 for one drop of my sperm saying he was saying, yeah, he was saying there's thousands of women signing up to fuck him and that four of them committed suicide because he wouldn't fuck them and that people are willing to pay a million dollars for a drop of his sperm.

Speaker 3:          02:11:48       Well, they're out there folks. That's a good argument. There's some crazy fucking people out there. I would have defended myself differently. I would say, well, the women who come here for yoga, they were very flexible. That's money laundering right there. Someone's paying a million dollars for his sperm for one drop of sperm. That's a guy who's selling drugs, trying to get rid of cash, is trying to move some money around. That's what he's doing. Well, I mean it's the ultimate telecommuting job. It's like, I can't come to the office. I'll be home today. I'm like, what is a gallon today? Well, one drop. I mean, you got a lot of drops if you're. If you're healthy, if you eat eggs and drink milk. Do you? My point being that there's a lot of fucking crazy people in this world and this guy, podesta guy being involved in this wacky spirit cooking thing.

Speaker 3:          02:12:37       I'm not shocked. I'm not shocked. This yoga guy, this guy that you think of as being like peace and sot nom and not my stay and we're all going to flow together and realize we're all want. He's like, I did pay $1,000,000 for one drop of my spam. He suck. He's crazy and he's the head of this yoga organization, which we all think we immediately associate yoga with peace and love and happiness and he's talking about all these women that accused them of being human trash and pieces of shit and it's like, whoa. Like think about how trump responded to the allegations against him versus how this yoga guy responded way worse. He should have gone with a nickname lying yoga hose, what we call them, but my point is that there's some crazy people out there involved in all sorts of weird stuff where you would never imagine.

Speaker 3:          02:13:36       Well, it also gets to the fact that I just tie that together pretending I had a point, but it kind of goes to the point where we'll never have a nice person who is president again. Oh, because it's true. No, it's because the only reason you thought anybody was nice and he didn't know enough about them, but that's not true. This is nice people, right? You're a nice guy. Don't you run for president? I'm a nice guy. But if you were to dissect my entire paSt, I would look like, you know, satan incarnate by the time they got done with me, maybe now, but I think within the next four years, by the time trump is a on a second term, if he decides to run again, and if he wins, right? Which would be crazy. Right? To term trump who, that's a shirt. I see it.

Speaker 3:          02:14:18       I see a bumper sticker now to term trump. Trump, trump, trump, trump, trump. Like if you guys start chanting that shit, I want credit. Okay. I came up with it, but I, I really could see that by that time it will be way more difficult to just. First of all, we were going to have to acknowledge that you can't just edit little pieces of someone's life and make some sort of a, an absolute definitive statement on who they are based on out of context statements and things. And also this idea that like something you did in 2001 somehow defines you in 2016 and you're the same person, right? Isn't the point of life to improve 100 percent to say trump did terrible things 30 years ago and I think that what's he doing, he's trying to do things good for the country. Isn't that like the arc?

Speaker 3:          02:15:05       We're all supposed to be on where you used to be kind of a, you know, not a good person, but you're getting better. Well, we would hope they used to be a really good person and now you're a god. That's what I'm looking for. No, anybody like tHat. I would. I want someone who is perfect in the nineties and is now transcended humanity and is ready to lead because that's what we need. We can't have people leading anymore. We need some, a real guru. You want to go the full cult? Turn this nation into a cult? Well, we'll see. We'll see what donald wanted. The full. I just. I think we Haven't completely unrealistic expectation as far as someone who would put it like jfk, right? Perfect example that everyone always uses. If he was running today, he'd be picked apart. Clinton, another perfect example.

Speaker 3:          02:15:49       If you look at him on paper as far as policy, take out the monica lewinsky scandal and just look at what he's done with the economy was like during this time and make your arguments plus or minus that he, you know how much of it was because of him, how much of it was he was in a lucky spot as far as being a president. Right. There's those Arguments, but you look at him like that and you go, wow, there's thIs guy who was a great guy, but then either Jennifer Flowers in Nepal on jones and the this and that and all these different. Then you have a totally different idea of who this guy really is. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, right? Yeah. And and the technology for forming, forming opinions that are incorrect about your opponent is just better than it's ever

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       been because now they can test that stuff in real time. They can put down several ads. You clicks on what and test the persuasion. So, so the best persuader of 20 fIve years ago was an amateur compared to the best persuader in 2016. I wonder about that because I think that jfk was a fucking magnificent persuader. Have you ever seen jfk speech about secret societies? Uh, no, but I would agree. he was great for television because he was great on television. Well, he had an incredible speech about secret societies and the importance of not having secret societies and government and uh, it, it was really like, to this day, it's one of those ones that conspiracy theorists loved bring out and go, this is why they killed him, bro. This is why they killed because I mean, it may very well be that, but you know, he was talking about the importance of transparency amongst the government and amongst the people and how dangerous it is to, to hide secrets and have secret societies.

Speaker 2:          02:17:30       And it's incredibly, it's incredibly brilliant. And it's, it's amazing because you couldn't imagine a president saying that today. It's like, do you remember, I believe it was an eisenhower that had the speech about the military industrial complex before he left office, right? Yeah, it was eisenhower, right? It's an amazing speech, but it was a speech that he gave one night that no one ever saw again until the internet came around. Like it wasn't something you were played in school. It wasn't something you even aware about probably until youtube came along and then you watched that thing on youtube where eisenhower saying, we must be fearful of the military industrial complex. You know, he waS basically saying there's a whole machine that wants to go to war and they're looking for excuses to go to war, and he named it, you know, he called it this thing that you would never fucking see that today.

Speaker 2:          02:18:22       You would never see that. What kennedy did and what eisenhower did. It's almost like they've buttoned down those holes. They found out where those issues were in the difference in the what, the, you know, what the people that are actually running the government want to direct into project versus these mouthpieces. These guys like eisenhower, kennedy now it sort of the military, industrial, mainstream media conglomerates, because they all seem to be on the same side right now. Sort of, but aren't the. And different sites like fox is different than cnn. Right? Well fox Is sort of by itself. Yeah. I was watching fox and cnn back and forth before the, like before the election I was just going to watch fox for like an hour and then I'd switch over to cnn for an hour and I was, I was getting schizophrenia. So if you seen how a reality as bifurcated, so if he switched between fox and cnn and fox, the trump transition team is doing a terrific job picking real adults, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 2:          02:19:27       You go over to cnn, it's chaos. It's, you know, there's, it's, there's just this big cluster fog going over there and everything's falling apart of the country is going to fall apart. They have access to the same information as far as I know. Um, and those are two completely different views of reality. Yeah. There's two completely different views of reality. Also. Um, if I've gone to some liberal sites websites that are urging people to contact the electoral college and block trump's rise to power, like what is that even possible? And how isn't that anti-democratic like to, to have a few people contact the electoral college, which is like you're talking about like the representatives, like every state picture representative, that representative is supposed to represent the state. They almost always do, but they have this sort of weird hidden power where they could kind of change the, like if California voted for clinton, but they said fuck that.

Speaker 2:          02:20:20       Trump. Like if someone actually did decide to do that, some crazy delicate. Yeah. So apparently that power is intentionally built in just to prevent a monster from being, you know, didn't, weren't elected, they, it didn't work, didn't work. Uh, but that's what people are saying like let's go. But that would be, there would be a revolt in this country if they ever did that. Good lord, if they think it's bad now the divisiveness and the, the, the, the, the angst and this fucking weird line in the sand across. I mean, it's almost civil war style, bitcoin between the right and the left right now. Well, some of that might be exaggerated by the media as well. Could be accentuated. Is, is. Yeah. They're blowing on that fire with the protesters. Be out there. If it wasn't an intellivision do you. What? Do you, what is your opinion on the protest, do you think?

Speaker 2:          02:21:10       I mean, I've seen ads where they said they would pay people 35 bucks an hour to protest. Is that true or is that bullshit? I don't know. I would, I would say low credibility. I had heard that you can't snopes things anymore because snopes leans towards hillary. Yeah, I hear that too. But where do you hear it though? From snopes? I didn't know either outright forums and so I would say, uh, that one is grain of salt, but there certainly are things that are subject to interpretation for sure. So you got to figure there's some bias everywhere. Yeah. I wonder if people are really getting paid to, to, to protest. So it seems like a good gig if you're broke. Fuck, I think it's just assumed to be true on the right doors. They think that this is proven and lots of different ways. Well, when I was in New York, I do, it may be.

Speaker 2:          02:21:58       There was thousands and thousands of oscar winning actors wandering the streets, but honestly, to me it didn't seem like anybody was acting. It didn't seem like anybody was a paid performer. Well, they wouldn't. Most of them could be naturals, but you need a core that gets everybody excited. You know, there's gotta be a core of this shows up and then other people can. Or is it that the people that are willing to take that 35 bucks an hour, they hated trump anyway, and this gives them an excuse to some cash while they're hitting trump. What is this here know someone wasn't paid $3,500 to protest Donald Trump. It's fake news, uh, created by paul horner who post fake news and a variety of websites. Oh, how dare you. He took credit for the fake news. Well, that makes sense. He goes, his followers don't fact check anything.

Speaker 2:          02:22:44       They'll post everything, believe anything warner said, referring to then trump's campaign manager, corey lewandowski, horner said his campaign manager posted my story about a protest getting paid $3,500 as a fact. Like I made that up. I posted it in a fake ad on craig's list. Here's a screenshot of those since deleted. Tweet. That's funny. So I'm glad I said low credibility before you showed that that makes. That would have been really embarrassing. The amount of money you'd have to have to pay thousands of people. Thirty five bucks an hour. Well, that supports the. George soros is behind everything, which I'm pretty skeptical about. Yeah. Um, what about that peter thiel billionaire character that funded the lawsuit against gawker? Isn't he in some way, shape or form a part of the team? He's part of the trump transitions. I don't know if he's technically on the transition team.

Speaker 2:          02:23:36       Yeah, it's all very interesting. It's very. Well there goes the anti gay thing. Wherever you seen any evidence that he's anti gay, that trump's anti gay. I am not sure what they're even looking at except that he picked a pence as his running mate in penn says stuff of this history. Yes, he does. He has some stuff that I tweeted the other day that rachel maddow was highlighting that he was saying that instead of giving money to aids research, you should give money to educate gay people about the risks of their behavior. Yeah, so ears. Here's what I think's going to happen. If you want to put this in the positive perspective, the vice president will adopt the president's policies, at least in public by the time mike pence, he might run for president or something. My guess is that it will be hard coded.

Speaker 2:          02:24:23       In other words, this gives them an opportunity to evolve to where the country you would find him more acceptable. Anyway. Show do you want to do that? And it's sort of a what I call the fake because it gives them an excuse to do it without being a hypocrite because people say, yeah, you had to do that because he's your president. Oh, now that's just your policy. So my guess is that trump is moving a lot of people to the middle because that's where he is, but that pence guys, he's not very persuasive. I don't. I just really have a hard time seeing him as being in god's going to run for president some day. I think he might really. Yeah. I, I think as a pick, you know, all I'll say that I'm no fan of his history with, you know, gay rights stuff and I'm not, I'm on that team. Um, but as a personality on tv, like he's really good at interviews. He's really sticks and point and the only had one thing you needed to do, which was when a debate against the other vice president, tim kaine, which he did. He's trying to highs emails though. Well

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       he's, yeah, I'm sure they would all like to be seen that though. That was the latest thing, right? Like they want access to his emails. He's like, fuck that, you know, we're waiting for that shoe to drop. Who knows. I mean, it's going to come a time when I think we're probably all going to have access to all of our emails. I mean, I think you, you're going to have to come to the conclusion that when you're, and you should now really, you should think when you're sending an email, you should assume that this is not really private. I kind of do already, first of all, because someone on the other side who gets the Scott Adams, dick pic co, we'll check this out and they just, there's so many out there down and said, well, hey man, already. So like own it to you. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          02:26:07       No, no, no. Look what charlie sheen did. Made a career to own it. So I've, uh, I've speculated that the perfect world, would it be no privacy if everybody knew everything about everybody? The worst world is where most people have privacy, but if people lose it because then they're just victim so everybody could but hear any of it. But everybody knew everybody's shit. Suddenly you'd be like, really? You're terrible. I'm terrible too. I think it would. I think we would get used to each other so quickly. I think it would also force people to evolve. I mean, we all know our best friends stuff, you know, and you know, we know the, the failures and that we all have together collectively and we still love each other, but it's just like letting those other people in on it, letting those strangers in on the time that you had did that bad thing, but the reason you care is that they'll think poorly of you and that that will affect your life, but if you have mutually assured destruction, which is that everybody's bad because you know everything about everybody.

Speaker 3:          02:27:04       You know, everybody's got something they're proud of. Everybody just thinks, well, I don't think I'll throw a stone because it's going to come right back at my house. Well, I think it's step one in this complete and total assimilation. I think losing privacy. I agree with you 100 percent. I think it's inevitable whether it's 30 years from now or 50 years from now. I think essentially everything you do from then on, it's going to. I think there's going to come some form of technology that is a leap. Very much like the internet is this crazy leap, right? The internet provides us with this incident, tanium access to all the answers to all the questions you've ever had, which is just unprecedented in history. There's never been a time where you say, well, what did happen on the native american trail of tears? Like, why is it called that?

Speaker 3:          02:27:46       You can just fucking open your phone to sit down for a few hours, and then I came back to you. What would he got for me, Scott? You could tell me like exactly wHat the fuck went down. This is like unprecedented stuff, I think in that leap, which I think we're in the middle of. So it seems like it's not as big of a deal as it really is. Like there's going to be another leap that's even more speCtacular than that and that leap is going to integrate all of our minds together. It's going to integrate our memories. It's going to integrate our ability to communicate and we will literally are going to become a technologically technologically created hive mind. I might've written a book that

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       has something to say about that. I'm god's debris. Um, what was the idea behind your book? Um, if I told you it would ruin your book reading experience, but spoiler alert, can you say that? Uh, but I will say that I've had this thought using periscope because when I'm using periscope, unlike the conscious mind of this gigantic brain, which is all the people watching me, so I can say things like, hey, I think this, this law might go into effect. No, I don't know the answer to that. Somebody tells me what the law is. And within three seconds a period on my screen in the periscope session will be somebody who knows the answer that. And there's almost nothing I can't throw out there that there isn't someone under the thousands of people who were alive at that moment. And it's the live part that's interesting because you can, you know, the internet is kind of like one person's alive and the others, you know, looking at data on the other side.

Speaker 2:          02:29:17       but when it's live, people who are contributing to a thought and you're watching a forum in real time on periscope, it is like a new intelligence has been created by this technology that's temporal. You know, as soon as I turned it off it turns off, but it is a large freaking mind that multiplies whatever I have going on by the power of all the people watching. It's really, really thrilling. But when it's spinning, how come you have so many people that are talking to you so often? You get thousands of people on there. How can you pay attention to those comments? Well, I can't watch them all. So if someone has a good answer, well I usually, if I, I try to ask a question and then I look. But otherwise if I'm talking and I'm focusing on what I'm saying, but when you're looking at their answer d, can you click on that answer?

Speaker 2:          02:30:01       Can you freeze your screen or something like that. So like, because it's like I see how it works. Like, um, usually what happens is something go past so quickly. I'll say I missed it, I missed it. Say that again. And I look forward to it comes back. Uh, the reason why I asked, because we did something similar yesterday. We have this tri caster that runs a video stream on youtube, that multicolored keyboard lit up, christmas lights looking thing. That fucking thing is crashed two days in a row on us in the middle of broadcast where it never crashed before. Now jamie updated all the software and we're hoping it doesn't do it again in this show has been fine, but I said, well, if anybody knows a better solution, please let us know. And so proud. The comments were just filled on instagram with all these really good solutions and a few of them, few the machines look pretty bad ass.

Speaker 2:          02:30:48       So I mean, who knows what, we'll have to research, find out what's the best, but that when have you ever been able to do that before and you know some. There's a bunch of dumb answers, but somewhere in there is probably the right answer. You know, in some person who's an expert. Like if somebody asked a question and it was on an insert, a instagram forum or an instagram picture and it had something to do with being cartoonist, well who better to ask than the guy who created dilbert? You would be able to answer and give your your expert opinion on how this works or that works. I

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       think also our government is going to run that way. At least if trump is a transparent sort of public president like I think he will be. I think there's going to be a lot of policies that get created in this sort of collective brain that is trump leading the discussion and the entire public weighing in through social media and mainstream media in every other way. I think he can do that and probably will and it's going to be like this thrilling experience of watching good thoughts turn into better thoughts.

Speaker 3:          02:31:52       Boy, that is the rose colored glasses view of the trump presidency. If I've ever heard one, that Would be the best case scenario and also that he wants. Now that he's in the office once he's no longer in contention, now he's the president, so now he's fighting with any way the same way anymore. But what people are worried about is people that write things about him. Like if people write poor reviews of his presidency, that they're going to be attacked. They're worried about getting sued, they're worried about being targeted. They worry about the fact that he's in control of the nsa and he can, you know, he could hire some edward snowden type character to fuck up your life if you write an article about them for the wall street journal or something, you know.

Speaker 1:          02:32:30       Uh, well, um, I talk about this as well. If you look at any individually thing, he does like, hey, it's 3:00 AM and I'm tweeting about, you know, miss universe or something. I always imagined them with the socks on in the lazy chair, right? Yeah. Like a boxer shorts with a boner angry, no shirt, red face screaming well on is doing something with the kid and better yet barefoot with yellow toenails. I imagine he doesn't take care of his feet. uh, but what he does is he a, he praises and rewards people who are good, good to him especially. And he attacks without, without exception. He just never makes an exception. He will attack you if you go after him. He doesn't start the fight, but he likes to finish it. I think bill burroughs one who said that he would have those black socks on.

Speaker 1:          02:33:21       I might've. I might've co-opted that. I'm thinking of. He might've said, well, we're drunk durinG the end of the world podcast if you haven't heard that. We get a podcast while the presidency was being called and bill burr was on fire. It was on fire. It was one of the funniest podcast ever, but It was all like watching it all go down. At one time he got into an argument with the other comedians, sarah tiana, because tiana was talking about how uh, anybody who supports trump is a racist and sexist and then. And then bill made fun of it and it was just, it was perfect. It was the perfect thing to see why it was all going down. It was like you were seeing in bill and her. You're seeing it in a physical form the Way people are choosing to frame this thing. Fascinating. I'll watch that. yeah. Anyway, I was just saying trump likes to leave the biggest gap between pleasing him, end up pleasing him and it has nothing to do with the thing he's fighting about it at the moment. It's about setting it up so that the next who's thinking should

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       I fuck with him? That didn't work for the last 700 people, but if it had worked for some people to fuck with him in the past, you would be tempted. You like, well, sometimes people get away with it. This is a different thing though. Once you're the president versus once you're just some billionaire real estate tycoon. Because there was. There was one guy that was writing about it where he had been sued by trump and when. Because he wrote an article and when they started examining the actual data it got pretty ugly pretty quick and then they abandoned the lawsuit and this guy trump wound up getting him a seat for the fights. Like he got him a ticket and I think he flew him out to atlantic city and maybe someone with them as well for the fights and that became like an issue.

Speaker 3:          02:35:08       Like, yeah, what, how does that connect with the. I'm missing the string there. Well, just you know that he's just a master manipulator. Like in the middle of this, he has this lawsuit thing with this guy, you know, and the guy calls him a shithead or whatever you called them and writes this article about him. Trump get some tickets to some fight. Susan loses in court or loses the, you know, when they're going through all the data, they abandoned the lawsuit. Trump gets of tickets to the fight with the whole thing is just crazy. It's probably all part of rewarding people and punishing people so that you. Yes, you feel there's a state game of thrones type shit that came with us. It doesn't look like. I was just thinking of that in the weirdly as I was doing something the other day, I was thinking that you could map all these family dynasties unto the game of thrones thing.

Speaker 3:          02:35:58       You could in some way. I mean it is bizarre in to the extreme that we've dealt with these family dynasties like the bush family in. We almost did it again with jeb. You know, I mean, who knows if it wasn't for trump, if trump wasn't around and he didn't come up with that low energy jeb things that, what you called them? YeAh, low energy. If he didn't see. And also jeff just sucked. I mean when, when the pressure was on, he just wasn't good. This wasn't good. It wasn't. And when all that stuff was going down or like rick perry, like when remembering rick perry's in debates, you just didn't know what the fuck he was talking about. He's like, what was I even saying? Like that's it, you're done. But if it wasn't for that happening with jeb bush, he might have very well gotten the same position that donald got into.

Speaker 3:          02:36:43       I mean, when you looked at all the other people, he least had that familiar name. People might've been inclined. He didn't have any real crazy like horrible stories in the past that got brought up immediately. He could very well and they would have continued that family dynasty. The clinton family dynasties another disturbing one. You know, that's a weird dynasty, you know, is a chelsea next is Michelle Obama next. Oh yeah, I think she's definitely. That's the question, man. That's the big question. She would be excellent. She would. She's like a reallY good speaker. She's very intelligent. She's very articulate. she's a very measured and composed and stately and

Speaker 1:          02:37:25       as mcgregor said, and the fight, She has lots of attributes. She has a lot of attributes. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:37:31       Yeah. I mean, and she carrIed herself extremely well for eight years in the white house under some incredible pressure. I mean, I dunno what she, what her, you know, her responsibilities were what our days looked like, but she's never made a misstep. There was never, never been an embarrassing interview. Never important. yeah. Nothing much less controversial than hillary clinton. Much less, you know, because even before the, uh, like she tried to run for president, there was always the whitewater thing that she was connected through the vince foster thing that she was connected to. HAve you seen that meme? You know, they're doing all these joe biden memes. Have you seen the recent joe biden meme the one with and see if you could find it? I think I retweeted it. I retweeted it yesterday. Somebody tweeted it it to me, um, it was, um, joe biden and obama laughing about, uh, about hillary having something in common with monica lewinsky now. Yeah. Pull it up so you can say you could see it. I don't want to blow it. Check this out. Look at this. Look joe. Then it says joe. Then I said, hillary. Now you and monica have something else in common. You blew it. And then obama and he's laughing. Throws his head back laughing and obama's look at that and look with his eyebrows raised and it says, you know, she kills people, right?

Speaker 3:          02:38:53       These are fucking great. Do you think she's killed anybody? That kid that got shot outside of his apartment at 4:00 in the morning or they didn't take his cell phone. they didn't take his wallet. They didn't take his money and he, according to wikileaks, was the one that leaked all those documents about the dnc and the dnc favoring hillary clinton over bernie sanders. Who knows what else that guy knew. If that was the guy, if that is the case,

Speaker 1:          02:39:22       I don't know, but it seem more likely that even if they were murderers because of some hillary clinton, the connection that she wouldn't know about it. perhaps just somebody who thought, well, I'm going to change history. You do a favor perhaps perhaps, but this is also the woman who was attributed in an email. Whether or not it's correct. She said about julian assan, can't we just drone that guy? This guy is some thumbing his nose that America can't. We just drone him so I don't want to drone him because I think he's done a great service. But from the butts, from the, from the context of a government looking at this situation, if government secrets have been stolen and It's your job to, you know, make sure this doesn't happen and you know, to get justice. That's actually kind a fair question.

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       No, I wouldn't want because you're saying what are all our options? Well, it could be off the cuff, flippant statement that she didn't really take serious. Like can we just drone him? But she said some creepy shit. Like one of the things that she said about gadhafi, you ever see that interview where she's talking about. She goes, we came, we saw he died. Ha ha, ha ha. Yeah. That was a startling and shocking is after she hit her head. Oh really? Yes. that would explain. It wouldn't 100 percent. Yeah, very irrational to think that way and I'm very impulsive to to say that out loud because you're dealing with the dissolving of a nation. Libya is in complete total turmoil and has become a breeding ground for isis and a lot of that can be attributed to it being completely destabilized by the United States, helping out all the people that wound up killing gaddafi.

Speaker 3:          02:41:07       It doesn't mean good. Naafi wasn't a huge piece of shit and the world is in better because he's dead probably is, but Libya is not better right now. Like olivia became completely unstable after that so that he came, we came, we saw he died. Ha ha, ha ha. That's like laughing in the face of these poor unfortunate people who just got a shit, roll the dice and grew up in Libya and now they're stuck there and then the right side of the character from how skilled the politician she is to say something that's so clearly the wrong thing to say at throwing. Well, wHen was the fall of Libya? Was that 13 or 14?

Speaker 3:          02:41:46       When did a find out when gaddafi died? When gaddafi was killed? What? I'll never forget it. I'll tell you that that video is fucking terrifying. The video of the rebels capturing him and they're sticking things up. His assets. Two thousand 11, I believe the interview with her was in 2012 or 13. See if you could find that out. If it's in 2012 or 13, it's entirely possible that this is directly post concussion and a severe bleeding. Apparently on her brain, she had some serious problems. She's fucked up for like 12 months. I don't think people realize that that can permanently change your personality permanently. The the average person doesn't thInk that's a thing, but I've seen it. You know, I have as well, I've seen it many, many, many times because I'm in the head trauma business in a lot of ways because of my experience with the ufc.

Speaker 3:          02:42:39       Um, but I know people that have been hitting the head outside of the ufc and have never been the same. Um, that is one of the things that I've always said about sam kinison. Sam kennison had a great book written about him by his brother called my brother sam or brother sam. It's a great book, especially for me, huge kennison fan, but he basically says sam was one person and then he got hit by a truck when he was a little kid and became a completely different person. Became reckless and wild and it came out of a head injury. Oh yeah. The lack of control didn't give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       That's where it came from. Well, yeah, like literally from brain trauma. What is it?

Speaker 4:          02:43:18       Yes. This video that's got a million and a half to 2011 was uploaded the exact same day. It says he died. Oh, okay. Possible. That she already interviewed and was recorded and put. This was up on, I mean It may be possible. It happened like that morning. That doesn't seem right.

Speaker 2:          02:43:34       Yeah. Especially if you're saying that this same day as. Maybe that's why she's giddy, but if that is the case, well why don't you find out because this is just one. It says 1 million, 542,000 cbs news interview with hillary clinton. There it goes. Laughed about killing gaddafi. Go to that. That's for 2016 and let's see when it says it says flash back. Maybe it was like right after and she was so giddy. But if that's the case, the link to that video I just pulled up. Okay, so if that's the. But what does it say in that article and that article that you're reading before you click on it, see flashlIght right there. You like, what does it say there? Well he died in 2011 and she supposedly had the big head injury in 2012. So you can't even blame It on that. Then I'll look into it.

Speaker 2:          02:44:25       If that's the case, you can't really blame it on that because that means that she hit her head after this. She's laughing probably about gaddafi died and she fell. Maybe when you laugh really hard and you're not that healthy, she was drinking or or do you think she loses it up but were saying Scott Adams? Well, you can't rule that out. Definitely can't. She doesn't look too healthy. She's definitely not eating the best foods. You know? I was saying that no matter how much she drinks, if she is a social drinker and you know, people were just social drinkers who have had two drinks, let's say you don't want them driving. Right? So why isn't that disqualifying for somebody who's going to be in control of the nuclear arsenal? Who admits? Yes, I'm a social drinker now. In the past you never had to ask that question because it was too social drinkers running against each other. So you're going to get a social drinker no matter who got elected. But trump's the first time you had a non drinker. He doesn't drink at all. No, no, no. He hasn't had a sip of alcohol in his life really, or a drug. He claims I'd like to get them drunk and high. How about that?

Speaker 4:          02:45:26       This issue was being interviewed in Afghanistan on that day and news hit so that, I guess that video was not being taped or it wasn't a supposed to be taped, but it was like an unfair kind of record. Yeah, it was definitely an unfair recording,

Speaker 2:          02:45:40       but so, so that was like right when it happened, but she was laughing about it right when it happened, but that explains why she was out of character for her normal. Yes. That does make sense. She was giddy. It was off camera that they just killed this guy and she was off camera. Yeah, that makes sense. That's a lot more logical. I'm glad that we solve this. We solved it. We should be detective Scott Adams. Um, we solved a lot of things today I think. I think we cleared up a lot of people's misconceptions about you that not only did not vote for trump,

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       you don't vote. You were essentially just looking at this thing as a, a person who knows a lot about persuasion and knows a lot about public speaking and what you were looking at this and you were going, this is, um, you're almost like watching a game. You're watching a game play out, and if you say, look, the raiders are going to slaughter the dolphins. It doesn't mean you hate the dolphins, means you're looking at the actual law, that defensive line, the offense, the quarterback. I see where this game is going to go.

Speaker 1:          02:46:37       I thought when this whole thing started developing the trump candidacy, that would open a crack in the universe where I could talk about this persuasion stuff and be believed and in order to be believed, my technique for that was last year I predicted so that when the day came, when I was right, I would have enough credibility to say, okay, so the other things I said, maybe you should pay attention to them too. So it was sort of a long game. I was playing for credibility. And um, I thought that persuasion would be the most important variable.

Speaker 3:          02:47:09       It's certainly a huge variable in this world, um, as is what we discussed earlier, the ability to speak publicly with confidence, not just persuasion, but just to not look rattled. you know, even if you're not persuaded like you don't, he's not getting defeated even when he's losing. and I would see like these debates and I would say, well, she made some salient points. She seemed more articulate. she seemed smoother with her words. She seemed more stately, but he never felt like he lost. He didn't act like he lost. That's giant

Speaker 1:          02:47:39       to. Yeah. People. People are, you know, they pick up their feelings for other people. We just look at them and say, hey, he's happy. So happy. Just picking that up. People walk in the room and they're downers and your energy goes down as soon as they enter.

Speaker 3:          02:47:53       Watching someone super uncomfortable or unsuccessful is very. It's hard to do like watching someone bomb on stage. Very hard

Speaker 1:          02:48:01       do. Uh, one of, one of my great moments when I started to understand the world better is the first time I smoked pot in college. And for most of my college experience, I found, I found this weird pattern that people were nicer to me if I had just gotten high and it was years before I realized that I was causing them to be nice because you were nicer to them. I was just relaxed and you were given a better vibe out. Gave anthony died. And I realized that I can, I can control how they act simply by my emotional state.

Speaker 3:          02:48:35       Well definitely we control how people react to us based on what kind of. And I've given off the wrong energy before and you see it in people, you know, like, ah fuck, you know, like maybe you're too caught up in what you're doing and you don't want to be bothered or whatever it is. We've all been there before. And then we've all been on the opposite where maybe someone's like, this guy's a dick. And I'm like, really? I just had a wonderful, pleasant conversation with him because you interface with them in the perfect way, at the right time with respect. And the guy lord his guard and you know, and gave a little back to you and you gave more to him and everybody's good. We, I've seen, I think we've all experienced both of those things and I think that's one of the problems with one person accounts of any bad thing that went on.

Speaker 3:          02:49:15       Like can I. And I've looked at some of this trump stuff and I'm like, man, what? What really did happen? What really did happen with the clinton accusations? What was really going down between these two people because one of them is talking about and the other one isn't and we don't know what the fuck the answer is. And I think that that's often the case. It's like the actual reaction that people have. They want to think that the other person was being a dick, but maybe you were being something negative too, and they're reacted to that. Then it compounded. But maybe as Scott Adams was talking to the guy and use the exact same words, none of the disagreement would have taken place in the first place. The messenger is always, you know, the message. Well, we're both, we're, we are more than one thing and when human beings are interacting with each other, we're, we're doing, it's almost like we're putting on a combined effort.

Speaker 3:          02:50:05       We're, and we're, we're piecing together a conversation and this conversation is a joint effort. It's like we're both contributing to it and it might come out terrible. Um, but it might not be your fault. It might be 100 percent my fault or it might be 100 percent your fault. Like, but the way it comes out is because the two of us together didn't sync up, you know, and oftentimes they say, I met Scott Adams. He's a fucking piece of shit, but it's not really you. It might just be the way I hear that a lot. How dare you. But it might be the way this person talk to you. Like they might've started out right off the bat trying to joke around and, and you know, said something rude or said something they thought was funny and you didn't or caught you at a bad time or, you know.

Speaker 3:          02:50:46       Yeah. I just try to be aware that I'm causing people to be the way they are more often than you imagine why. I also got to think that being the president has got to be. I mean, you want to look at yourself the way the world looks at you, the harshness of the view of the people on the outside looking in. There's no better way than to be the president. I mean, he's got people walking down, wilshire blocking traffic, screaming. They fucking hate him like that. If anything is going to cause you a narcissist, clearly obviously he's the guy has a great love for himself, which is part of his success. Part of why puts his name on the buildings is a great love for himself. That takes a hit when you see thousands of americans, hundreds of thousands, in fact wandering down the street with signs saying they hate you. I don't know. You don't think so? I'm not sure it does because you probably have your critics as well and they're not blocking traffic. Imagine if the fucking people that hated you were blocking traffic. Fuck dilbert, and they just had this gigantic stream of people would chance donald champ, k, k, k, k, and the screaming and you know that this things a true. I just imagined myself in the oval office looking out the window. I'm the president and they see the protesters

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       and I'm thinking, I'm not having a bad day. I'm the president of the United States. So I think it gets lost in the noise after you get elected. I mean if civilization breaks that you're talking about a guy that if Someone tweets something negative about it, he's got a tweet back. You're talking about A guy. If somebody writes an article about him in the wall street journal, he'll go on his twitter page and call that magazine or that newspaper a piece of shit. The failed New York times still won't stop lying about me. He's not a guy who was immune to the impact of criticism against him. So if that criticism is coming in the form of hundreds of thousands of people protesting the idea that he's going to suddenly become enlightened enough to ignore that. Totally, but don't. I don't miss the pattern. He, he attacks professionals, so he, he goes after people who were in the cage.

Speaker 2:          02:52:52       If you're not in the cage, you're cool. so those people on the street that are just screaming and what is he said about the protesters? I think what he said is kind of interesting because I think what he did say is that it's great that they have these rights to protests and he likes the fact that they're all getting together and voice their opinion, but we're all going to work this out together and he likes her energy or something. Yeah, something like that. So, so that's, that's my point. Yeah. If any of the, if the, if the parade had been led by, you know, a reporter for the New York times, he would have eviscerated the professional and he wouldn't have touched anybody behind him because they're there. The citizens. No, that's a good point. It, you, you make a very convincing argument for this all being a positive event.

Speaker 2:          02:53:37       And I think one of the best arguments for it being a positive event. This is the first time ever, we've had someone who has no, no political background or aspirations and they're already famous and successful and they become the president, so we're going to get to see, and it was a guy who wants to dismantle a system, like one of the things he said about passing bills. See, when you pass a new bill, you got to get rid of two old ones. And I was like, well, regulations, regulation, excuse me by my first reaction to that was, oh, that is a stupid oversimplification, but I'll bet there are enough old laws that they want to get rid of any way that for a long time you could get rid of two for one. Yeah, there might be some ridiculous ones that we could get rid of it.

Speaker 2:          02:54:19       It's entirely possible you can't do that rule forever. And of course dr. Deregulation, um, when it comes to environmental efforts is one thing that terrifies people. And this, um, climate denier a concern. That's a real issue. That's something that could affect us. Let's talk about that. Sure. Please. Because people have been begging me please to give any argument that doesn't make Donald Trump look like a science retarded. I'm soRry I shouldn't use that word. I apollo use it. It doesn't have any bearing on science. It's not a medical term. Retard is people that are retarded with their. They're slow to catch on. And we're not talking aBout mental illness. We're talking about retards. Alright? But I apologize if anybody was offended or you're going to do that.

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       They don't let you do it. Um, so here's, here's my best argument. Let's say I'll just play lawyer for a second and I'm going to defend donald trump's climate change position, which disagrees with all of science was. So you're starting from a deep hole, right? So you acknowledged that they've got a tough task year to what's state his opinion for what is his position first? His opinion is that we don't need to actively work on climate change. Rather he would rather work actively on cleaning the air and the water and I think he thinks that gets us to the same place. Um, and it might, uh, here's my argument. I believe, and again, I'm going to speculate a little bit here so I don't want to put too many words into the president's mouth, but I think that he's separating the data collection part of the science, which is you measure things and sure enough temperatures seems to be changing and historically significant ways and sure enough, humans seem to be behind some part of that change.

Speaker 1:          02:56:06       I think trump accepts that part of it. The second part of it is not the data collection is the complicated models that predict what happens with all this data. I think the trump things that those models are unreliable and not credible and probably bullshit, just like he thought the polls were inaccurate, right? Remember you just watched him defy every expert in the world. One hundred percent of pollsters said, no, Donald Trump. Look at our numbers. This could not be more clear. It's independent people. These are legitimate professionals. There's no freaking way that you win with these numbers, and Donald Trump said, I don't believe the polls, and it was right. Donald trump was right, but there's a big difference between poles and scientific measurements of our carbon footprint. No, I'm not saying that the same thing, so I'm not gonna I'm not going to leap and say case closed based on it.

Speaker 1:          02:56:59       I'm just going to say that through our history. If you try to find the context, how many times have we built a complicated model on that scale and got it right? All right, so there's nobody who's doing a good job of predicting where the economy will be next year. Those are very similar in the sense that there's lots of variables and different models and stuff, um, that, that turns out to be just random. If the economy's largely based on confidence, it's, there's a bunch of factors involved in the economy. How much is involved in the atmosphere. I mean, if you can, their models figuring out that there was a volcano over here, there's something happened in the ocean that you didn't expect. Some, some seaweed, hobo. Do you don't think they have accounted for that when they're talking about the models of the earth being warmer every year? I the past decade and scientists being incredibly concerned that have been studying this their whole lives, seeing unprecedented levels of change. You don't think that that's. I think that. Here's where the analogy to the, the polling

Speaker 2:          02:58:02       is similar. We all thought the pilot polling was reliable because it's sort of math and you know, the science seems to work. What you realized later is that there was a whole bunch of judgment that went into which variable to include and you know, who, um, assumptions about who's going to show up on polling day and nobody could have any good idea what was going to happen. So the most important part of the models was literally just people sit in the room say, I don't know. I think it would be like last time these case with science though, and climate change. That doesn't make sense to me. I think that it seems likely, and again, this would be subject to smarter people correcting me and I, I could easily be corrected on this. Um, I think that when you have big complicated models and lots of people working on it, there are probably places in which people are using judgment.

Speaker 2:          02:58:48       For example, in this just be a, you know, just to make the point, there may be two sets of data and you could say, well this one seems more reliable than that one because of whatever. So I would think they're probably different scientists could get wildly different projections and all of them tapping the same source of data just like the pollsters got the wrong answers, but they're all looking at the same data. I see what you're saying kind of. But I really don't see the connection between that and the polls because everybody knows the polls is based on a very small group of people. Whereas the vast majority of the problem of the population is largely uncounted. Like we really weren't. We were guessing and gauging but their opinion. But that wasn't the problem because polling is scientific enough that it can capture it in some way.

Speaker 2:          02:59:36       But they're, the conceit is, I mean you, you have to admit that there's a certain percentage that we absolutely know. We're not measuring those people when you're talking about the temperature of the earth. He or you're absolutely measuring. So we're measuring the climate all over the globe. You're actually measuring, measuring the sheer heart numbers. There's no opinion based on there's no fluctuation of opinion. I'm agreeing with you that the data collection is probably pretty solid because there's an extra. The interpretation of the data is what you're disagreeing with. By the time you put it into an economic model, there's almost certainly some fuckery, a judgment call that somebody who doesn't think as a judgment call that's almost guaranteed to be part of the model building procedure. Now, I would love for somebody to educate me on this because I've never talked to somebody whose job it is to build a climate model.

Speaker 2:          03:00:26       Like, I'd love to sit in a room and say, is there any part of this where two people who are both experts could have picked a different variable and I'm almost certain that's the case because it's a lot of variables in this complicated and so he's going to be the case, right? But when you have a mass consensus, when it comes to scientists, you're not talking about politicians, you're not talking about cnn versus fox news, you're talking about scientists, right? When you have a vast consensus that believe that we have a real issue with our carbon footprint and that we really need to slow down the amount of pollutants and the particulates we put into the air.

Speaker 1:          03:01:00       So is that a word? Particulants particles. What's the word? What's the word with like the thing that people worry about a lot of is not just the, like the carbon in the air, but also the fucking dirt, the dust, the, the, the actual pollution being. So. So here's the third leg of my, uh, particulates. Yeah, it was right. Okay. Thank you. I love my defense. So trump's thing is clean the water, clean the air, good move, but it seems like that's going to get you to the same place right now. Let me give you another, maybe give you another really hot. No, let me give you another analogy. Um, I put solar panels on my house when I built it nine years ago. Um, what those solar panels have saved me enough electricity and I can predict forward that I'll definitely get my money back from putting on solar panels.

Speaker 1:          03:01:47       Question. Was it a good economic idea to put those solar panels on? Knowing what you know, that the cost will more than be made up in my savings. Was that a good idea for me to do? It seems like it wrong. It was a terrible, terrible idea wrong. And I knew it at the time. But by the way, I have a background in economics. That's my, my degree mba from berkeley. So why is it terrible idea? Because I knew, and this is what happened to the cost of solar cells, dropped so quickly, that if I had simply waited three years and bought it, then I would have only you know, three years of savings, but I would have gotten it as such as a lower price that I would pay it back much faster and then it'd be gravy from there on if you only wanted to look at it that way, but if you didn't take into consideration the variable of you affecting the carbon footprint of the earth by gathering up your electricity for three years due to convention.

Speaker 1:          03:02:44       That's actually why I did it and so I made made a bad economic decision because the, what we call these stupid rich have to go first. Okay. But it wasn't a terrible idea. It just wasn't a good idea. Economically. It was a very good idea. It wasn't a good idea economically, the economically. Okay. So I'm sure you can't consider all sorts of other variables. All right, well all, all analogies breakdown ultimately. So I tell you, but they're good for. They're good for explaining. Okay. If they're not good for proving a point to say that. So here's the analogy. Odds are that technology is going to save us from climate change. Really? Yeah. They're there already, um, you know, on the drawing board, ideas for putting like a giant hose into the upper atmosphere and in somehow sucking bad things that will suck all the clouds out to but yet. But chances are, chances are, and again, you might not want to take this risk. I'm not even saying you should, but she has this are if you waited five or 10 years and then got serious about it, you'd probably be in a better position because we'd have better technology. And, and starting from that point, we just be in a better place or no, I'm not saying we should do that. I'm just saying that you can't know this starting now is the

Speaker 2:          03:03:57       smart thing because like my solar panels, the technology's changing so fast, that waiting a little bit until you really can get some purchase with some good technology and just go balls to the wall and say, all right, fucking $500,000,000,000. We're going to spend now because we've got the solution, maybe this is a convenient way that you're interfacing with the software simulation that we're all trapped in your choosing to take this path of a success based on technological progression rather than based on taking care of mother earth. Well, it doesn't. Doesn't every model assume that everything stays the same and there's just more of it. Right? So here's one thing I can guarantee your climate change model does not include, okay fucking hose to the upper atmosphere. I never thought about until you brought it up and isn't that going to be the biggest factor? It will be the technological change that happens between now and that in fact, that's the whole point of alarming us.

Speaker 2:          03:04:56       So we'll work hard on the technological changes. I thought they should make a skyscraper sized air filter. That's one of the plans there. There is a, something like that. Then they could actually take that carbon out of the atmosphere and use it for fuel. Right? And Burn it, burn it back. I, I've seen some amazing things in headlines recently, but I never trust any of them and it totally makes sense that if we can clean air in your house, like you know we have that right behind you right there for when people smoke cigarettes, we have that air filter and it's pretty powerful. If someone can sit in your seat and smoke a cigarette and this room will be bearable. Well yeah you can. You can do that. And that's a very simple portable unit. Some buildings have very sophisticated units, so I think the technology for scrubbing the atmosphere already exists.

Speaker 2:          03:05:45       It's just not implementing it on a large scale is not economical. So just like my soldier pedals. So the point is if you started now and spend $500,000,000,000, you might get a billion dollars with a benefit because you don't have the right technology. If you waited, they had the right technology and then put your effort into it, you might get it for cheap. Okay. We don't know that. So that that's a risk. That's a risk. Everybody is got to assess that a is much more comfortable than the idea of a climate change denier perspective. Like a climate change optimist, like, yeah, I know it's kind of fucked up now, but we've got some stuff in the works. Don't worry folks. We looked at the progressions that are going to be fine. Well I think trump is trying to have it both ways. You know, he's got people he needs to satisfying the right, but he doesn't want to be a crazy man and left.

Speaker 2:          03:06:36       so we've had testified in some story that both people can find some comfort in because this is such a big issue and I think that middle ground is where he's trying. He's sort of ab testing it now by saying let's clean the air, you know, clean the water because how do you do that? You can't, you know, you do all the same. Don't you know, but you really can't do that yet. No, I clean all the water and clean all the air. I mean you would have to woof. Oh well, but the technology is to get there, right. Are going to be at Least overlapping with whatever you need to do with climate change, hopefully, because you still want your electric car either way. It's just different way to get there. You also gotta think that whatever byproducts that are in the atmosphere and in the water, all that stuff could probably be used for something.

Speaker 2:          03:07:19       I mean the, the, the whatever these. Yeah. I think. I think there's already, at least in the lab they've, they've made it useful. That will be really fascinating if we figured out a way someday to get to a zero emission state, you know, where everything we use gets recycled and we keep the air pure and we just figured out a way to be completely efficient and how we burn things or how we make things or how we recycle things and that we all leave. I mean it just seems like. Well, I think what you're saying economically, once it becomes economically feasible, there's becomes like this big financial boom and taking whatever the particular incident, the, the carbon or whatever it is, out of the atmosphere and you make mass amounts of money from doing that. You know, and people figure out a way to get really rich doing it.

Speaker 2:          03:08:07       Yeah. Somebody just got to figure out a way to get rich. Every solution has that. Right. And then somebody found out a way to get rich. Okay. Problem solved. Is this one of the first podcasts you've done like this? Um, I've done other podcasts but sort of prepared yourself for something like this by doing periscopes. Like you're really good at these like long form things. Have you ever thought about doing your own podcast? I have actually. I'm curious about it. Just tell people gonna be mad at me right now. They get fucking mad every time I tell somebody to do a podcast because I'm like, dude, everybody shouldn't do a vlog, a blog post, but I think you should do a podcast. I really do. I would be remiss if I did not bring it up. People have been asking me. I can't tell you how many people just begged me to come onto your show.

Speaker 2:          03:08:48       Really? It's the single most requested thing of my year. Wow. Holy shit. You specifically. Wow. Well, it was worth it for me. I enjoyed it. I enjoy. I had a great time. We do this again. This is a peak experience. Let's do it again. I would definitely do it once a year. Let's come. Come back in here and we'll see how this fucking crazy plans working out. I'll do that. Let's do it. Sure. Thank you scott. I really appreciate it, man. Thank you very much. Scott adams says on twitter, your blog is dilbert. Just go to [inaudible] dot com. [inaudible] dot com. My book, how to fail at almost everything. Still win big and look at my app when hubdoc and what is the app when the hub. What? What is it? Oh, it's a imagine the uber app without the uber car where You and your friends can just see that you're meeting going toward the same location. Oh, so if your friend says, oh, I'm stuck in traffic, and you're like, bitch, you haven't even left your house fucking house yet. Ooh, I like it. Keep people responsible. Thank you very much, scott. I really appreciate it. I had a great time talking to you. I likewise. All right folks, we'll be back on monday with shannon, the canon briggs. Let's go see thAt.
