Before we were just sitting around going, what is this fucking thing going to start is the other ones I've gone to are just bullshit

Speaker 2:          00:00:41       compared to this fucking Mark Marin and Brian Pro San Ladies and gentlemen. Good to see you, buddy. Good to see you, man.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       I've been reading crazy, crazy things about you and marijuana that you have.

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       Oh Shit. Yeah. Go like sacred. Yeah. It's so weird that got out there. Like, who cares? Common QuickCare quit pot, dude. People kids are going to do now. I got nothing. Any changes that you make in your life. Radical changes. People. There's going to be arguments, message boards, debates. Uh, I was really surprised and then uh, people are mad at me cause I'm doing a gathering of the Juggalos. I heard about that as well. I think I lost a few fans. Why? Wow. People are like, what the fuck dude, why are you doing? I thought you were cooler than that. Like if people are like, that is so not metal in a, you know, it's metal getting a nice paycheck so my kid can go to nursery school next year. That's, that's pretty much super metal. Well you know, it's also, and it's going to be an experience as you go.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       If somebody offered you a nice check to go, very possibly. Very possibly. I would think about it. I'm called God, what the fuck would I say? What bits would I do where they gotta to go? You know, I'd have to like figure out how to edit it and do it right. I have to do fine on it. I have two months to do that. Like it's in August and so I've got time to prepare. You know what, man, there's the cynical in 25 minutes and I'm falling. Harland Williams who's a yeah, it'll be fun. Like yeah, he'll get up there and go uh, you know, platypus. Vagina and I'll go, okay, I get to follow that. What is the concert for people that don't know? Cause I, I, yes, yes.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       The, the gathering of the Juggalos is all the insane clown posse. It's all, and it's a fee. It's to me it's a very fascinating, fascinating movement because I kind of look, it's so easy to poke fun at them. It's so easy to point a finger, but it's also like I kinda identify with disenfranchised people. Most of them were really given a shitty fucking hand in life. Yeah. That's what my, that's why family is like their big thing that they say at this thing and these insane clown posse concerts, they'll say family, IDL, a family. Like we're all like together. They feel like they're a part of something. And how has that bad,

Speaker 2:          00:02:47       no, I know that's part of why I said yes to it. I was like, you know, in another world I could have been one of these kids. You know, cause I was a mutant that sat at home reading comic books and listening to iron maiden and didn't have a family, you know, didn't have other guys that would like the same shit as me, you know, so at least they've got that, you know? I mean we can't have been in that situation. Yeah. And people, yeah. People in the Internet really poked fun at them. Like they do the shitty band there. And two is so much better than the insane clown. Posse says the arctic monkeys something billion levels above the ICP. Write something really obscure. But yeah, that you can only get at Amoeba and people were like almost disappointed. I can tell, you know, when their tweets, you know you only got 140 characters, but it's still like, oh dude, why are you doing that?

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       You know? And it's like, why do people care what you're doing first now, if you're still doing, you're still being you. You're still doing your am not going to throw a clown makeup on and go out and throw my feces at everybody. You know, why not? As long as he filmed it, make a youtube video. Yeah. Fuck it. That's the other thing. I'm going to do my thing there. I'm going to see how that goes over and I'm going to have experienced stuff's going to happen to me that night when I fly out there and go to this crazy cause it's out in the middle of nowhere. That's the other thing about it. Like where is it? Uh, it's out in Illinois, but like some place I've never heard of. So this is a national thing. People fly in from all across the country and these guys are fucking gigantic right now, aren't they? Yeah, they're pretty big. So yeah. But you never hear their music? No. Nobody so strange. They played them on MTV, like in the 90s when they first broke and then everybody went, oh these guys suck.

Speaker 2:          00:04:31       And then they kind of, those are what I love about them is they went dick, they wanted to keep doing it and they went underground and they went like made their own label and these guys have made a fortune, you know, uh, putting their own stuff out, which is like, you know, a lot of comics that we know that do that thing. You know, like don't go for comedy central records. I'm going to go to those other places. And I kind of respect that, you know, that they've been able to build this crazy fan base out of and most people had never heard their shit at all. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       Yeah. There's something interesting about it and like I said, they obviously appealed to a very certain, a distinct group that need something, right. It needs someone, you know, I mean what we were talking about earlier about the pot thing about people freaking out about you quitting pot. That is also a part of a movement. And there's a lot of people that like to think that, hey man, you know, for 20, you know, and Bob for 20 on Twitter and they want to think that they're part of this thing too. And then if you leave this thing somehow, I know that you make it a decision to do something different with your consciousness that you're leaving this group, you're leaving the

Speaker 2:          00:05:33       Sandman. Well, you know what, that's a big part of it. That's a big part of why I quit is I didn't want to be that guy anymore. And I get why some people like to still be that guy, but for me will the big part, it wasn't working anymore. And I just have always been one of those people that like, I always hated people that went into Aa and, or you know, or like I did cut. Okay. I messed around with coke and I messed around with crystal meth and dumb shit like that. He's really, yeah. Yeah. Well like before I knew it was really bad. Like, you know, I moved to Phoenix in 1986 and that's like where uh, crystal meth was invented pretty much. Wow. You know, and a rate at that time and uh, it wasn't a big deal but, and I did it, I messed around and then I was able to just go, this is stupid. I don't want to do it anymore. So I've always been that kind of gay and part, you know, I smoked for 20 something years and I was an every day guy and an all day guy and I just didn't like the way I was feeling anymore and it just wasn't working too. Like, do you ever get like that? Like did you ever take your tire blunt and it's, and you don't even feel any different than you did before you lit up the board?

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       I'm a huge proponent of marijuana, but I'm also a big proponent of moderation and pretty much everything every day. I don't smoke every day. This is when I smoked. I smoked before I know I'm going to fuck my wife smoke before I get some sex. I smoked. Sometimes we're going to go on a date when he gets some good food. I small global, then I smoked before I write comedy. I smoked before I do comedy. I smoked before, do Jujitsu before movies, before video game, before I moved. So this is like, there's a few times where a whole day will go by and none of those things will happen. And I want smoke pot and it doesn't affect me. Or when I go on vacations, I go on vacations, I go on vacations with like five, six days and no pot. And I never feel bad. I just feel like me, you know, I enjoy the feeling of marijuana, but I also think it's good to know who the fuck you are outside of the influence of all these things. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       And for some people have to go back at some point and uh, and do it the way you're talking or maybe not even that much, but, but do it like when I'm going to see rush going to see the new eczema could, but I want to, I want to give it, I want to get it out in my system completely on how long, right? Three months. Yeah. And just went cold Turkey. Yeah. It's easier when you have children too. And I know you have a, and that was the big thing. Like I talked about it on what the Fuck Marin's thing. But uh, one of the things is it got, I don't know about where you smoke here, but it got delegated to outside because of the kid. And before he came, when my wife was pregnant, we have a smart house. But anyway, I there, I couldn't smoke in my office anymore and I couldn't smoke in the living room. So then I became the outside guy. And so it felt kind of dirty. Like I need to have a shed that I was going out to in the back. But I was, you know, and it's a nice place, but I'm out by my pool, just kind of feeling like a scumbag, you know, out there by myself. Just to kind of get day.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       I always do it outside just so my house doesn't smell like weed. Like we did it inside today just cause I got this new thing. It's a hemp wick instead of a lighter, you light it with a lighter and then the it, the hemp is like a wick and it's made out of hemp rope. So it lasts a long time as opposed to, well no, no, no, it's, it's to light it instead of using a lighter, because I do use a lighter and I'd smoke it out of a pipe, I'd go, Ooh, I smelled a lighter. I smell that fluid. I tasted a little bit. Yeah, that's shit can't be good for now. So this hemp WIC, I started doing this, but it wouldn't work outside. It was windy so we smoked it inside. But I have an air cleaner in my office that I had on before the show and I, but most of the time I'm a joint guy and most of the time I go outside, I do it on purpose.

Speaker 1:          00:09:05       But yeah, I've had the, I just had a debate at home. I've had that the wife conversation now does she smoke it all? Not right now. She did, but then she had two babies in a row and the first one, you know, she breastfed for a year as she did the second one. And so that was like the baby's born, the baby lives for a year and then she's pregnant again. And then the baby born the baby breastfeeds for a year. It's been a long time since she smoked pot. So you miss it. Do you know? She's down. She's almost ready but, but um, the um, you know, the, the, the effects to me are important, but like anything else, they can be abused. Just like masturbation. I think masturbation is great, but I've had points in my life where I was beaten off three, four fucking times a day and and beating off when I wasn't even hard. I would just keep going. I go monkey. I think we all have, I mean

Speaker 2:          00:09:52       comics and it was like combined with the weed to doing it in a shitty hotel room most of the time. So the process does something really depressing about hotel rooms when you're high blown it out the window. Just sitting there with my flacid common threat I think, you know, he's like don't want to watch just as like seen everything else.

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       Yeah, like eighties movies. Yeah. Check from sex and the city was hot. Remember she played a mannequin that came to life at the trial. She was fucking mannequin. Yeah. I can see what you were talking about. You were doing, you were, you had a pretty extreme pot thing going on. They all day, everyday pot thing. Is it

Speaker 2:          00:10:33       that totally makes it not work. And I got, I've had been to that point before and then I take like three days off and then the weed works again automatically. You know, for years I wasn't awakened bake guy and then it just became, if I didn't have a job, if I didn't have a writing job I was going to in the morning I wake and bake and then you know what I'm supposed to be like trying to write things to sell or, or work on my own act or you know, write a book and it's just fucking impossible when you start smoking at 10:00 AM or at least for me.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       Yeah, I think everybody's got a different biochemistry cause for me, man, I smoke and that's when I do my best writing. I smoke and I sit down and I just get into the groove and I just lose myself and there's a window for

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       me. There's a window for jokes. I mean, I've written, you know, the last 20 years of my standup, most of those jokes have been written high and so that's kind of a challenge for me now is like to see, see what happens, not high to see what the materials like has it changed? Have you noticed any change? Shit. What about your sets on stage? Uh, they're feeling good though. They're actually, I'm way more focused and a faster like a faster rhythm speak because I'm more present. Um, my wife's definitely noticed that just in talking to me. Like when I walk into the house she's like, Whoa, you're like, you know, you're not hey man. Yeah, yeah. That, what kind of plot did you smoke? Uh, you know, that's the other thing.

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       Like I've never been one of those guys that knows every strain. But uh, what's the one that puts you to sleep? Yeah. Diva. Oh, they're so different, man. It's really like talking about two totally different things. It's almost like talking about alcohol versus a stimulant. I mean, there so completely different. Do you find your self having problems being around it now? Like he hung hang out with Doug Benson. Me Like I can't Damon. And I don't even know if he knows. I quote. He texted me, he texted me right before the show, make sure you ask Brian about quitting pot cause you know, Doug flies that fucking fly high crowd to him and he's like, what the fuck? You know, I'm the guy that started him on that road. Really? Yeah. It wasn't really a smoker and I bought him his first pipe first moved down there.

Speaker 3:          00:12:37       He didn't know. He, you know, he did. He did occasionally done it, uh, when he'd come up to San Francisco and hang out with us. But I moved down to La and he and I had a writing gig together for MTV and like 94. And uh, at that point was not a stoner at all. And uh, I was already and uh, you know, just got Amanda the everyday thing and then he's one of the biggest donor comics while you're his sensei area, since he is kind of, it was just to be so hard for him. It must be really weird. Yeah. Have you seen Doug on that old curb your enthusiasm? It doesn't even look like him. He looks like this clean cut gentlemen. It's so weird on that. No. How Caribbean enthusiasm. But he's only not that old. Yeah. Five, six years ago. So weird.

Speaker 3:          00:13:19       It's totally different. Yeah. And like in what way? What looks different? She really clean cut back then. I don't know. I mean of course it was probably his character also. But yeah, I mean he just looked very different anyway. So He's, has he contacted you about it? No, we haven't talked. Uh, obviously he's concerned. It's hilarious. And I'm hanging out with Sarah this week. Who was another one in my pothead friends, you know, Sarah Silverman. So it'll be weird like to be at the Improv and not go around back. You know, that uh, that alley where, uh, we've been smoking for 15 years. Have you? Um, you got to try it. Well, if you ever do, you got to try sativas before. If, if you ever decide, I mean don't do whatever the fuck you want to do, but no man, if you ever decide this is a different thing, you know who to somebody, one of my friends was like, oh, you're taking a sabbatical.

Speaker 3:          00:14:09       And at first I was like, what a stoner thing to say. Like, like that, I'm for sure going to come back. But, uh, I, I don't want to be back to what I was. And so the idea, like I said, yeah, I'd love to get to the point, I'm going to see Russia next month or next week. You have to, and I'm not going to do it with this next rush show, but next year when they come back, you know, I'd love to then be able to go and you know, when they play passage to Bangkok and you're right on, what's your goal? Like what's your time wise goal? Do you have like a milestone a year, you know, and I'm using the program, which you're going to the classes. So you be somebody, you say the program you're doing, you're doing an alcoholics anonymous. Yes, I am.

Speaker 3:          00:14:48       Yeah. Yeah. Why did you decide to do that instead of this club right now? Well, no, I've taught, Nah, well, here's the reason I'm going to, you know, this is, it sounds like a joke, but, and it will be a joke at some point, but I'm not big of a map of a loser to go to Ebay. I think it's just pot. You know, it's, it's a couple of hundred bucks a month, you know, there's gonna be guys like, you know, I just told my mom for heroin and shit like that. You know, we're where the stories are way more than Brent material for me. Yeah, no, I know. Certainly. Well, this is going to be a huge bit for sure. Yeah. That's all kind of a fascinating thing, isn't it? It's true. When the hard drugs, the really hard ones, man, those stories are horrific. That's the dehumanizing drugs.

Speaker 3:          00:15:31       I just felt like I'd be the biggest pussy in the ram if I went to an Aa from, uh, from, from half baked that happens in that I wasn't, they had a meeting. Oh no, no one ever suck cock for pot. I'll, okay. It was a Bob sad sack. That's probably a scene. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I to watch that again. No, that'll make me want to get high. Have you ever thought about doing the Dr Jury Show? That would be pretty funny. We get tonight, are you? I'm doing the regular blah, blah. Any Rehab? No, no, no. It wasn't. I don't know what they showed me the career too. I actually still work true, dude. You don't understand. You're not sort of quote unquote in the business you do that. It's over you celebrity basically saying I suck and I have for a long time.

Speaker 3:          00:16:20       You don't just say, you're not just saying be packing in and that's what you're saying. You're saying, I really don't have anywhere to turn and willing to be in this house for six weeks because I need a paycheck. Right. The only two people that do it or if you're desperate for attention in some way or another, you're going to think you're gonna f fashion. Some reality show career. Again, those people are real drug addicts. Almost everybody except the weak people. Yeah. Well, there was only one weed guy ever, right? No, I think there was more than one wrapper. The wrapper was a week to some girl. Well the worst one was Eric Roberts. Eric Roberts was there for weed. The fucking guy. There's nothing wrong it is that what his, everyone's shaking and wedding and it was weed. He's drinking coffee, reading the newspaper. Not only did he fucking smoke weed, he used a vaporizer.

Speaker 3:          00:17:02       So he's doing it healthy. Right. He's like, I just thought he's, I think he just want to get the fuck away from his wife. Just like, honey, I've gotta be there for six weeks, six weeks. That wasn't a good dude. Just died. Didn't need from a grease. Uh, yes. Yeah. That was sad. That was a sad part of that show and I thought, yeah, he was, he was on my dead pool cause he was, he was in the class. I really have one, but a Conaway Jeff Conway. And he apparently he had some serious infection. Didn't know he had the infection because he was high on time. He was so messed up on that show. He was hard to watch. It was hard. I've only watched a few episodes of that show. I watched one with, um, Heidi Fleiss, which I thought was fascinating and I watched the recent one with that.

Speaker 3:          00:17:43       Uh, the old model lady. Oh, he's really kind of nutty. Yeah. What's a haggard? Yeah. I don't know, but it's fascinating because she's got this young boyfriend. It's really weird. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck that monster. Well, I think he's probably a regular guy probably works in a supermarket or something. So for him it's like, you know, it's Janice Dickinson still. Yeah. But she's horrible to look at. It's scary. Well, do you remember getting old? Having an old person's face is not nearly as scary as having an old person's face that's been cut up to try to appear younger. Yeah. That, those are surgery in this city, like terrific. My wife hates it, but I'll like, I'll whisper to my kid, you know, and he's only two, but I'll go, look, there's monsters, monsters, let's call it, I always call it monster face. It's, it's, it's like I was watching a, I'm one of those Joan Rivers things.

Speaker 3:          00:18:34       It was on comedy central. I swear to God, Bro, for 15 minutes. I didn't absorb a word they said. I was just concentrating on her face and how her, how terrifying. It's a cat. They're turning into cats. It's a mask. It's what it is. It's not moving. It's so obvious. It's like filled up with something. It's going to melt event, whatever the fuck. It's so scary. It's not good. Did you ever see the SQL to escape from New York escape from la? Yeah, I did probably, but I don't remember it. Not Great. But at one point Bruce Campbell plays, uh, do you remember this? Yeah. Bruce Campbell plays a plastic surgeon that has basically created these monsters and this 10 years ago before you really saw these girls flooding around La. And so that was the one moment of the movie that kind of works because it's carpenters saying, look out like this shit is, you know, it's on.

Speaker 3:          00:19:24       It's why I'm probably not the right thing. Yeah, that's, it didn't really exist back in the day. They're all like island of Doctor Moreau who just kind of horrible face facelifts had been around for a long time. Right. Pull the face back. But this is a new error when they going not slips. Yeah. Yeah. They do the lips and they do the cheeks and shit. There was a hot girl down syndrome, hot girl down syndrome because all the girls start to look the same. Like Down Syndrome. Johnny Carson to kind of, they all did. They all have the same look. You didn't know her Miss Mom Syndrome. Kids always have that same look in the eyes and the same. It's horrible. But it's true. It is true. It is that, that's monster face. They get that giant mouth. It looks like you got to bite your fucking head off.

Speaker 3:          00:20:09       Yeah. Lisa rented took care of her is finally cause I think so. How did she, I don't know. She took, she got a deflated or something. Some of the, I know a woman who had it done and then she had it taken out and it's just, it's, her lips are terrifying now. The whole thing is a mass. Before she had a mind of her feet. Big Scar too. It was real weird. Like you'd be talking to her and it was so obvious that her lips are pumped up. But it would be also weird because her, when she would move, you'd see the scar inside her lips. The God damn who, who said that should be legal. That's craziness. You're fucking with your lips, man. Looks he kiss him, he can feel it in the lips. You can feel like a little fucking hard gelatin in their lips and you see it in regular places.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Like if you got a, I've been shooting this thing out in Ann Arbor, Michigan and you don't see these girls walking around. Right? But yeah, here, here's especially where you, yeah, you go to the grocery store in Calabasas. Fuck yeah. It's all monster faces out here. 60 year old lady trying to look 45 but it's working well. The worst. Is Newport beach ever going around there? No, not in. Why that whole area? That area's really rich and really like nice and it's like, you know, everyone's driving Maserati's and everyone through Irvine Improv, which is close. Like there's people that make the trek. Yeah. You see a lot of monster faces out there. Poor women. Poor women talked into brutalizing their face. Those husbands let them or paint for it, I'm guessing. Yeah. Or they just gave in. I just gave in and he didn't want to listen anymore. It's just like, all right. All right. All right. Do you want to get your fucking lips done? You know,

Speaker 4:          00:21:41       and surprise it. Do you ever think maybe they're just, uh, did you know the worst nuclear disaster in the world happened in Simi Valley in 1959? Here we were taught they were just, that's not true. It sure it's not the worst nuclear disaster ever. Not even close. Well, this shit going on in Japan right now. Yeah, you're wrong, bro. The shit going on in Japan right now is unbelievable. The United States. No, no, no, no. Three Mile Island. No, this is 240 times more than that accident. Why that's are you getting, there's this is like above top secret.com. No, this, this, this, this happened in 1959 and they, uh, it was 240 times more than the accident at three mile island and they kind of covered it up and uh, somebody sent this to me the other day and there's actually like news stories all about it. There's a Wikipedia page all about this and I never knew about that, but it was just kind of odd that we lived

Speaker 1:          00:22:30       for accurate. So you, I assume you're talking about is Rocketdyne him about the Rocketdyne? Yeah, I don't think they have all the information about that. I think a huge amount of what they're saying about what the damage and all the, it's all speculation what happened out there. They did a lot of tests. Rocket Dyne is where they mean when they were involved in the space program. I'll throw the, you know, through the Vietnam warm and there's all sorts of, they're there, you know, they basically make arms and fucking spaceship parts and shit. There's a lot of, you know, it's doing a lot of nutty things up there, but it's not one of the worst disasters in the world. Do you? People wouldn't be able to live here. It'd be fucking six arm babies and dogs be born with no ears. There's not, it's not

Speaker 4:          00:23:09       from what the, the, the, what I heard is there was a, something happened there and instead of like most of these nuclear reactors have these huge concrete Glo, uh, Dome's over them. So if there is a leak or some kind of radiation, it's covered. But this was like kind of a test facility. So they didn't have all these ex, they didn't have to have all these extra things and all these extra gauges. It's 2011. We can't be having these, what I heard conversations, I'm looking at it right now. I could play the audio for you, but I mean, but what are you looking at the history channel? history.com. Let me

Speaker 1:          00:23:38       tell you something about the history channel. You know what gets on the history channel, Ufo shows, go shows, robot shows. Okay this is, this is what you need to know about the history channel. It's a network. And what they do is they buy programming, they want ratings and they want things to, but they don't verify the, you know, the claims. They don't make sure that everything is peer reviewed. The talking about the history channel's had a bunch of shows, pro and con, JFK assassination, pro conspiracy con conspiracy. So for you know, just the sake of everybody's brain, you can't just,

Speaker 4:          00:24:09       but isn't that weird though to think that the one of the craziest cities, you know is Los Angeles and everything like that and we have these people that are turning into nick cats, they look like cat women and we never even think about like our air pollution is so bad. Imagine it being also mixed with toxic shit cause I guess the rods that are in a nuclear reactor, I guess when they act they, something happened and they shut, shut it down. And then they were like, okay, I think it's okay. And they turned it on for two more weeks and then they shut it off again and there were like, like, I forget how many rods I courses

Speaker 1:          00:24:38       session Brian, because we don't really know the real story. We can't, you know, this is, this is so frustrating.

Speaker 3:          00:24:43       Call the cops live out there too, man. See there all the time. Radioactive fucking Zombie cops. Well anyways, you got to read about it. If you just type in, we would know about that. I feel like we would know about that. Where's that big of a disaster? I mean, maybe

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       nothing happened, but it was that big. I just don't see that you would avoid the effects of it. That shit was in the 60s and the 70s right? Wasn't it?

Speaker 4:          00:25:05       1950

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       1950 [inaudible] I just assume we would know about 59 apparently Japan has a melt through now cover man, that's government. That's way we're hipsters came from fucking, no, just radiation has nothing to do with these cat ladies are hipsters.

Speaker 3:          00:25:25       These cat ladies are there because they're trying to hang silver lake douchebags go weird mustaches somehow. The rods and the air. Weird Mustache, fucking skinny pants, all those broken rides.

Speaker 1:          00:25:37       The, um, the radiation is not doing that. Brian,

Speaker 4:          00:25:41       did you see your big movie fan or did you see it, the new super eight movie yet? Not yet. No. No. You guys are talking about it. Is it true? There's rumors. I heard that you played dungeons and dragons with a u and a couple of guys like pat and all that get together and still play dungeons and dragons.

Speaker 3:          00:25:56       But, uh, right before we had kids, we did, we were the only d and d group to ever stop because three of the guys got their wives pregnant. Like, I don't think that's ever happened before in the history of d and d don't think so. You don't think somewhere in Ohio, some guys had to pull the plug. They're not fucking, I used to hear about that and just draw. So tell me about, tell me about this. What did you do you get together? Just years? It was me. Uh, it started with my buddy Gerry Duggan. He writes for g four, and he was a, he and I wrote a comic book together. And, uh, we were just talking one night with another friend going, hey man, we'd love to get a d and d group gone. And this goes like, I want to be a DM. He's like, you know, I haven't DM to get, what is it? The Emory [inaudible] guest? Yeah, yeah. He's the guy that runs the show. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       And it doesn't, they don't play a, they basically, uh, you know, right. The whole adventure for you or use those, um, you know, use the books and uh, you know, basically walk you through the thing. And so we went to a couple of friends and it won't want to be in patent as well and our blend capacity and I'm sure you know, and then, uh, um, Chris Hardwick was in our group for a while too, so, and it was a lot of fun and it makes it basically, we called it nerd poker, I called it nerd poker because it just became a way of, you know, when your friends get busy and shit, and it's like the only way you can kind of hang out with them is to have like a ritual, you know what I mean? And that's what it was. We don't play poker and, and uh, you know, we had the video game, like when Halo first started having those land parties, yeah, we would do that.

Speaker 2:          00:27:29       And that was like a regular thing too. But then that kind of went away. You know, it'd be like 16 of us with four TVS on for people on four TVs and that was a lot of fun and a, that kind of shit. The bed and, and uh, we got this d and d game going and that became a way of, hey honey, I, you know, I got to go do this. Then you get to go hang out with your buddies and you know, we be there for four hours and we barely get any of the adventure done. Cause it would be just pat and going, you know, I just played the Shitty club and me going, hey, have you seen that stupid movie? You know, and Imagine Reporting Idiots, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:28:02       Yeah. You guys should have a reality show. Yeah. Dungeons and dragons. That should be a podcast that it's not a bad idea,

Speaker 2:          00:28:10       but the reality show, like it goes back to doing that a doctor jury thing, to me, any reality show is basically saying, I've got nothing. Right. You know, please, you know, give me, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:28:23       well let's not call it a reality show. How about a dungeons and dragons show with four comics, right? Where every week you sit down and discuss all kinds of crazy shit. You have subjects you want to bring up while you're playing dungeons and dragons. It's actually good. Yeah, we've definitely talked about it over the years and you know, and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:28:38       but for me, I always said no to it because I didn't want to fuck the fun out of it. It was just this fun thing and I'm trying to get it going again. I'd been talking to the DM about, hey man,

Speaker 3:          00:28:51       let's, let's get this going again back made it a podcast at the same time. Yeah, that's probably true. I think it would actually probably be more fun. You guys would be wearing headsets and shit and talking to Micah and you would know that other people are going to be giggling and enjoying it along with you. It might be the way to go. I've never played this game, so explain to me how it goes.

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       Uh, have you ever played anything

Speaker 3:          00:29:11       similar? Did you ever get no fantasy games? Although I was huge on fantasy books. I was big Robert, he Howard fan as a kid and I, you know, love just getting into fantasy football or fantasy. No. Cause I knew that

Speaker 2:          00:29:23       different from that because they don't really, you don't get together and, but um, it's basically you create a character. Will you, I'm sure you've played like a, what do they call those games? The video games that are,

Speaker 3:          00:29:37       what's that called? More role playing RPG. Yeah. Never those you never play

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       play first person shooters. Yeah, me too. I, I played and I could cut legends and a couple of things like that and I just couldn't get into it because I like playing role playing with my friends, but doing the video game, it's, it's too slow moving. Like I much prefer, uh, you know, first person shooters around just [inaudible] and even in vi, even in, um, dungeons and dragons, I was always the guy. Like I played dumb characters and it's like I'm the guy that runs through the door first swing in the battle ax. You know, just kidding. I'm that guy. I watched John The guy like, oh I've got to figure out my spell and I've got to say this incantation and I've got to have these runes in my hand and I've got to do all these things to get this one thing to work. I was the guy like I pick up my hammer and I smashed you in the fucking head. You know it was that guy.

Speaker 1:          00:30:30       I sat down with Dunkin once. When you try to explain to me the compelling magic of world of Warcraft and we went through a little journey and he met up with some people and I was like sat over his shoulder. I was like what the fuck are you doing man? This is so stupid. Never got it. I'm like let's go play quick. I'll show you how many people I can kill and a time, the time that this has happened I would have killed 30 or 40 people or brains work the same way. I just can't do that. Yeah. Cause I knew, I knew what it was.

Speaker 2:          00:30:55       Cause I know it's close to what I've played with d and d, But d and d is much more fun for me because of you've got the camaraderie and you've got the friends and, and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:31:06       did you ever have a landlord? Do you ever play video games on a landlord? That's what I was saying. Yeah. I did the Halo Halo land parties. I got addicted to video games because of news radio because the writers, the writers room where they had a land party, so that was in there quick to yeah, they would play quake to fuck. It was so much fun. It was crazy. It was so addictive. We would like, uh, I'd go up there in between scenes, like say if I didn't have two scenes, I'd go up there and play with some of the writers. We'd be screaming each other talking shit to each other. And it was so much fun. After it was over, it on my hands would be shaking and I'd go back to the set. Like I was on crank, you know, I went up there a couple of times.

Speaker 1:          00:31:40       Uh, who was her friends with that was on that staff was alley against. Yes. Yes. Al Higginson, Joshua [inaudible] and uh, went there a couple of times and got to hang out. So what a crazy set that was. That that was the weirdest writing room. [inaudible] didn't they start like at nine o'clock at night they started whatever the fuck they want it to. It wasn't, they start at nine o'clock at night, sometimes they didn't start until two o'clock in the morning. They just want the writing room works like that. Like, and it was basically a bunch of guys that nobody had kids at that you couldn't, you couldn't. And people that you know that like had kids and they knew not to even apply for the job but get everybody started. Like they would like sometimes he wouldn't even start writing until the morning and we would get there and then like an hour later it was first Bot would pull it out his guitar and start dicking around in his guitar.

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       Right. Cause they were so they were brilliant but complete children, like some of the smartest guys I've ever met. But we would like, we would get there, say it was a nine o'clock table read, we'd get there at 9:00 AM. It's usually later than that, but if it was 9:00 AM we would get there and we would have to wait 40 minutes for the first script. The first script we'll all we would get as a chapter and so they'd be like blocked this chapter and the next chapters will be coming in a couple of hours and then they would write the chapters literally, but they liked the pressure comes don't work like that. No, of course not. I did a guest spot on your Sitcom and just shoot me and it was remarkably well behaved, but it was the way they did. It was brilliant. All had kids. They were there till eight or nine o'clock at night and then they went home to news radio. Guys figured out a way to force themselves to be funny. They figured out a way to put themselves under a lot of pressure and that that really funny stuff would come with sleep deprivation and with a lot of pressure. I mean it's a, it's a method. It's not the best method. It's a method. But the funniest shows I ever worked on it. I just fucking

Speaker 2:          00:33:19       what? I love to have been there all the time. Like you, but yeah, just those two episodes I did.

Speaker 1:          00:33:24       Yeah, those scripts were really fun. So much fun. It was such a pleasure to be on it. And I got so lucky because I can't write a show. No, it was on another show. I went from the worst show possible to the best show. It's called hardball. It was a baseball show. Ahh. It should been funny. It was written by funny guys, Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran who wrote from married with children and they wrote on the Simpsons there was a great guys. Yes. And uh, when they got on TV, when the show got picked up, they, they, fox the network came along and said, listen, you guys can't run your own show. You know what the fuck you're doing. So we're going to bring in the worst hack we can find. And they brought in this guy from coach, I don't remember his fucking name, but every joke was horrific.

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       It was terrible. He got fired, but they couldn't pull it out of the out of the flames. It was just, it just died. We eventually had that. It just shoot me the final season. We jumped the shark like they changed all the writers and the new guys that came in were a total accident. That last season was miserable. It's the worst. People don't know how bad it is to do a bad show. Like everybody comes and says, oh, woe is me, Charlie sheen make it $2 million a year. It's true. You're right. He should not be complaining. No one who makes $2 million a week should be complaining, but there's a reason that fucking guy lost his marbles. I watched that show once, just recently. The first time it's unfucking bearably bad. It's unbelievably unbearably bad.

Speaker 2:          00:34:40       I like it because of how bad it is. Like A, and I haven't watched a bunch of them, but I've watched a handful of them and it's like, oh, okay, this guy, all these jokes are about, he fucks a lot and the other guy's gay, like that's all the jokes are. It's him making fun of crier for being kind of Wimpy, you know? So it's all these gay jokes. And then the fat lady walks in and says other mean gay jokes and jokes about Charlie Sheen fucking all the time. That's all it is.

Speaker 1:          00:35:08       It's one of the worst shows that's ever existed. I just like the opening, that transformation or the kid. That's all. I can never saw that part. But it's just, it's amazing that it's so popular. It's fucking incredible. Is it amazing? Yes. It's still amazing to me. It's still shocking. But you know, when I find out that 51% of the country's still thinks the earth is less than 10,000 years old, that's like a recent Gallup poll. When I find out shit like that, it's, it's, it's fucking disappointing and it's confusing. But you're amazed by it. Yeah, a little bit. Still, it's still around anymore. I mean, I'm not surprised in the movies that are popular in the music that's popular, you know? And, and the fact that the funny smart stuff doesn't last because people don't care and people are stupid. You know, the numbers though are monstrous.

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       The numbers of stupid people are just so, but I'm not surprised by that. I wouldn't say I'm surprised. I would say I'm shocked. I'm like, God damn it really. You know? I would wish that it wouldn't be like right. You've got to want to shake everybody. Yeah. It's just wish it wouldn't be the way studio is like good stuff. Well you know what's wrong with you? It's the big question is to how long people can stay stupid, you know, because he's, technology gets more and more complicated and more interesting and more, I mean your, your life has run connected to technology. It's pretty easy to be stupid. You Google anything, you find the answers, you know, if you don't want to believe reality, you find a message board of a bunch of other people that believe the same bullshit you believe and just ride it to the apocalypse.

Speaker 1:          00:36:38       It's easy as fuck to be done today. Oh for sure. He's here than ever. So anyway, my, my, I was in the worst case scenario from that show and then all the sudden best case scenario for news radio. So I've never done it. So can say like when you showed up, like did you like, no, like when did you know you're on a great show? Oh I knew it was great when I saw the pilot, I wasn't in the pilot. Fortunately I got to watch the pilot. There was another guy in place, well Ray Romano was the original guy who had my part. He got fired and they brought in another guy who did the pilot and then don't get fired cause it can act or, um, I just think that he was wrong for the part. I think they just wanted someone different. They wanted to do it different.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       So they decided to get rid of Ray Romano. And of course Ray Romano, there's the greatest thing that ever happened to him cause it goes on. Does everybody knows and it makes $1 trillion. But they, um, they did it and then they brought in another guy for the pilot and then he got fired. And then they had some sort of a, a thing, you know, and open call thing. And, uh, I had a development deal with NBC to do my own show. I just got it. And then they said, before we even talked to you about that, and we went to Montreal or something, or no, I got it after I did the hardball thing. Okay. It failed, but I got to deal somehow or another, I got good agents, so you're still doing a ton of stand up. I kept telling him I was always doing stand up.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       Um, so, and then I went to NBC and they showed me the pilot and then, uh, you know, they said, would you be willing to audition for this? And I said, fuck yeah. And then I auditioned and I got it. It was really just stupid luck, but I knew right away, it was amazing. You know, right away, the first day at table read, I'm sitting next to Phil Hartman. I'm like, Holy Shit. Like I knew Dave Foley was famous, but I didn't know of him. I didn't, but it wasn't really a true fan. No, I really, I did see a couple of sketches that I thought were kind of funny, but it wasn't like really into it, but it just sitting next to Phil Hartman at the table, it was like, this is fucking bizarre. And then were you a fan of his from Simpsons and you know, I'm just seeing, I mean it was hilarious. I remember seeing him on TV and thinking how funny he was. And then all of a sudden I'm sitting next to him on a TV show when I had never taken a fucking acting class in my

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       life. And it was like six months from doing this MTV, half hour comedy hour and then boom, six months later, somehow or another, I'm living in La on a sitcom. It was completely pissed off pretty fast. Ridiculously fast. I remember meaning you around then the first time. I don't know if you remember meeting me cause I remember you being on the set. No, no. Before that we did busters. Happy hour together. Oh Shit. I remember that. Blau I forgot that buster Poindexter the guy from Hanson? Yeah, from New York though. Yes. To this shitty character, that hot hot, hot song. I remember, I remember when he busted. Yeah, it's a made up guy. How weird that he did that? What am, I mean we had this weird that he did not give a shit about at all. Yeah. You hosted, what network was that on? I just want to say VH one or like how many TVs?

Speaker 3:          00:39:21       If it was comedy central, I'd be surprised. I think, well, comedy central used to be before comedy channel, maybe Buster's happy hour. Oh Wow. Dave Raf booked it. Wow. Yeah. So that's how, who else did it with us? I feel like it was you, me and Janine, but I could be wrong. I don't think so. I don't think I've ever done anything with this graph. I don't know. But uh, she knew what it was. If there was like, I think they taped several episodes in one day. I remember a couple of people being behind, uh, or you know, be in backstage while we were there. Oh, right, right, right. And they splice them all together. And I had never met you before. I never seen your standup before. And I was doing like kind of the alternative thing and you brought a stool out and like, dude, you're fucking this thing.

Speaker 3:          00:40:03       I did the tiger fucking bit. Is that what it was? Most of my clothes, that was the first time he did me. I don't even think we met like I think it was just like, oh that's one of the other guys I'm doing this show with. But does that still fucking guys? Yeah, it's a, and then we did, uh, I loved the show. I love news radio and watch it the whole time. And I think I probably got brought on my first one and yeah, no, they were both near the end. How many seasons did you do? Did you do the Phil Hartman Year or low? Was it? Love it. So I didn't do love. It's at all I did to fill episodes. I did, uh, the one where we were the acapella singing group. Oh yeah. He wanted to beat me up cause I kept, I kept the eyeball and yet that was so fun.

Speaker 3:          00:40:49       It was fun. It was fun. They always had the most ridiculous premises, like space news radio where we did the whole news radio, but it was in space or titanic news radio. We'll just ship. Yeah, it's fucking completely ridiculous. We were the singing group that tries to get Dave to come back cause we're all about to turn 40, I think. But we, and it was Kirk and me and cross and we all come on and try to get them to join this group up with this again to, it's such a joke. So yeah, that was, I mean, that's why I've never done another sitcom sense. Everything I've looked at since it's like, that's why I don't write for sketch shows. Mr Show did that ruin that for me? Like when you, right, a good one or you work

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       on a good job, like one of the best versions of that kind of thing. Like why do you ever want to go back, you know, have you considered doing a podcast? I am. Yeah. I'm going to do one with the, you know, Earwolf uh, it's Scott Aukerman started it up, uh, comedy death ray guys and, and uh, he's a good buddy of mine. He was mister show writer. So I just figured I, you know, now even though I'm more clearheaded, I'm not that motivated. Like I need somebody to ha like set it up for me and for you to have a regular place to go. Like for me to do it at my house, I'd probably never get off my ass and get it done.

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       So you can do it man. Look, you took this huge step in stopping the weeds do, you could do anything. Now you know what you need to do. This is the number one thing to get things done. Write them down. I write things down and when, when I write down a bunch of shit that I have to get done, I make sure I do them because otherwise they're just sort of a thought, you know, if, if it's concrete, so I'm a little PC, yellow legal pad. I have to get all these things on this list done. This is my day, you know, you've been doing this now, writing things down and podcast a year, a little over a year, year and a half to do it. Or just as a goof, I was depressed because, uh, came back, I shouldn't say depressed, but I was bored because I came back from Colorado.

Speaker 1:          00:42:47       Wa was forced to move back here because, uh, my wife was pregnant, she couldn't deal with the altitude up there, right. Cause we were like literally in the mountains. So we came back and a month later me and Brian were sitting around and we were like, let's fucking do what Anthony Anthony [inaudible] does on the OB. And Anthony show he gets is it does a little, uh, Ustream show live from the compound. So we sat down with like a Webcam. That's what it started out when we had like fucking snowflakes coming down while we were talking like fake snowflakes. I was like so stupid and cheesy and you know, half of the show was just us reading Twitter. Unlistenable if you tried to listen to in iTunes, it's terrible. And then somehow or another, everybody's saying this was awesome, do it again. We're like, all right fuckers, we'll see you next Tuesday. So we just all of a sudden started doing it on a weekly basis. We started doing one way and we never stopped. We just kept it up. You know, the only time I took any time off of it over a week and a half was recently I had to do a movie in Boston for two weeks. So we took two weeks off.

Speaker 2:          00:43:39       And how long did it take you to like decide on a format and that kind of thing?

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       We didn't decide on anything. It just sort of evolve and he started bringing guests in. All that. Yeah. I mean we always had cats but it was always like my closest friends. It was always like, you know, Joey Diaz would come over or each fear would come over here and then, you know, uh, as time went on, we eventually got like real microphones like we have right now. And was the guy that shows his pulse on the, yeah, it's done. The Manchester. Yeah. Brian Posehn was there for the ill fated attempts with demand shows. Well, you were a faded of good stuff, but it was still faded for a couple of reasons. One, it was I should have never tried to do something where I didn't have the time to do it. I just did. Yeah, you were pretty busy. I was doing fear factor at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:44:19       It was a ridiculous idea. The idea that I could do to TV shows it was doing the UFC. No, sometimes it was signed to Vegas to do fear factor, but that was pretty rare. Most of the time it was done in and around Los Angeles, but I feel like we barely, we barely had you in the room. It was too hard. I would come in and I would only have two days a week and it was, and then there was all this infighting going on him. It was a funny man. Greg Fitzsimmons. Yes, and time Janice running in the room. A couple of other funny guys. There was a lot of funniness and you and and a standout brought your own funny ideas to it. We had an issue. First of all in that as we started was when the Janet Jackson Nipple thing went down. You remember that shit?

Speaker 1:          00:44:57       That's when we got gutted. They came in and said to kind of remember like we had an abortion monologues. Yeah, we had an abortion monologue. It make it less massage. It didn't mean, no, not just data, but less shocking. They gutted it and then there was also, there was, they had one direct, we wanted to do a totally different thing and the network wanted basically the same. They kind of bullshitted me when to get it. They said, Oh, do new to dean. We'll blur it out. Swear and will be bid out. It'd be good if we got sued and he showed his bomb. Yeah, he did, but meanwhile I had a fight for that. You know how much I had to fight for that? Yeah. Zooey was fucking crying, but Friedman's daughter, she was crying because she didn't want it to happen. I just don't see why.

Speaker 1:          00:45:39       It's funny. I go, there's nothing you can do in life that's funny than this. I go, just watch. I go, we'll do two openings, we'll do one with it and one without it. So we did and he, Joey gets out there and the place goes fucking bananas because he's 350 pounds and he's got, he looks like he ate another human being and his stomach. And it's hard to even see his balls when he's a big guy. Well his balls or shit goes down. There's balls like grapefruits, there's a lot of charm. He's a lot of scars and shit, but his balls are like grapefruit and it old ladies, panty hose next to this uncircumcised monster, elephant trunk Dick. And he's out there screaming, let's get this party started. And he introduces me and Doug and that's a great way to start off the show. And I thought what a fun thing would be to have Joey on the show every week to start it off.

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       Just like, why is this funny? I don't understand why. It's funny. It's funny. It just is funny. You can't look, you guys are the executives. I'm sure you have your own tastes, you have your own hopes and dreams, but you know, creatively, you can't second guess artists. You have to either let them do it and if it doesn't work, then you come in and make corrections. But you can't say it from the get go that it's not funny. You gotta you gotta let, let, let us play it out in front of an audience if we think it's funny, chances are right. The one thing, like when the writer's strike happened, the writer's guild strike happened. I always wished that one of the things we would have asked for is, um, we no longer have to take notes from people that are less funny than us. You know what I mean? I'm serious. Like that's the big part that like cribs, funny thing and hurts funny shows is the unfunny people going, no, I don't like, I don't get that. Why are you doing that? And I know it happens at other networks, but I've run into it a lot of comedy central because I wound up there a lot over the years. I did that show. I did Sarah Silverman. I've done other things that haven't even made it on air because there's chimps that just don't get

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       what's funny and you know that they have those job that they're basically allowed to, you know, be the gatekeepers are funny and they're not fucking funny. It's brutal. It's literally like, and again it's, you know, guys that get paid to be funny complaining about, Oh, you know, I don't get to do this. Boohoo well, it's not just that you're complaining about a roadblock and the creative process, a real roadblock where someone doesn't get the look you stand. Could you imagine it? So one of the beautiful things about standup comedy is a, you are your own writer, director, producer, the whole deal. Could you imagine if you had a run your material by a group of people before you went on stage before you even went on stage with it so it wouldn't even be proven? Yeah, I've had that too when I've done special, when you do specials where it's like, yeah, I've had that in the, can you say this instead of that?

Speaker 3:          00:48:17       And my last special was the best because I didn't have to do anything. I did a spike TV when the spike and comedy central, first of all it's blank. And then comedy central. It was the first one ever where they said, just go ahead and do what you do. Well, we're worried about what we can and can't do after the network season. My next thing I'm going to do is going to be for DVD first and then if anybody wants to buy it and I'm fine, that's the way to do it. That's how I did my Netflix when nobody gives me notes. Yeah. Cause the, the two comedy central half hours I did like I had to tweak words and change where it's completely and if I call the move jokes and you know, and, and they wound up being okay and I'm proud of him.

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       But it was also such a process and, and, and uh, as a standup, like you said, we've never had to go through that. Like, you know, and if you did, it would be a design writing jokes for 24 years. And I never had anybody go, no, you know, don't do this instead of that. Well what's important about comedy? One of the, to me when I, when I go to see a comic, I don't even, like when I hear the guys have writers I feel like I feel like I'm getting ripped off. I feel like I'm getting lied to. I don't mind, you know, I mean some big name guys hire writers and that's all good there. The good writers and they write some great beds. But I really love when I go see a guy and I know that this is a singular point of view.

Speaker 3:          00:49:26       This is this guy's point of view. This is him sitting down and writing. I like him. I like, I want to see his whole pack or her or whatever it is. I want to see their whole package from them. The one that, the one guy that does it right is Chris Rock. He writes it all himself and then he has somebody else go with him and you know, cause he does those long sets and a lot of it is like he hasn't written it out first. So we had somebody, uh, I think God, who's the guy, the guy that used to show Mario Joiner, I think it's Mario joining or sitting in the audience watching and saying this worked. That worked. But it's not him going Mario. Right. Me Jokes. It's a consultant. Yeah. Which that works. But these other guys that have like a staff, and I won't name, I want to name names either, but uh, I knew a couple of guys that you think, oh yeah, I think it, how's that guy come up with an hour every year? Because he's got three fucking guys writing for them all the time. But then there's guys like Louis C k they don't have anybody writing for me. It still comes up with an hour every year. That's incredible. He's a monster. Yeah, he will. You know what it is. There's something wrong. He's

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       got momentum behind them right now. He's in a groove and he's, he's really and Co completely. How against how it used to do it. He used to do the same act for like the longest time and now he's in this completely new George Carlin sort of a thing. How long does it take you to write an hour? I did my last special almost two years ago and I have about an hour and 30 minutes now, but I been working a lot, you know, I jumped right back into it and I had a bunch of bits that I didn't do in the special that it was still kind of fucking around with, so I had a base to start. The real hard hour is the third hour. That's the hard hour if you do three years in a row because the first year you've probably been working on it for a few years in the second year. Well, if you've got a few premises that you didn't really touch on within that third year, man, you're starting from fucking scratch son.

Speaker 2:          00:51:11       Yeah. My first record came out six years ago and then my last record came out last year and I'm working on the third one right now. And that's the one where I basically started over, uh, last March when it came out and it's a year and I maybe have 25 that I love and I'm still doing stuff from that other, but I also had other things going on. And you know, what do you do when you do the, do the road? Do you do some old shit? Some new shit? I do. It's, it's 45 to an hour and it's like 25 brand new and, and, uh, some other stuff from the last record, which I can't wait to get rid of. Do people ever get bummed out? Shit online and stuff of people gone, you know, you're not as prolific as your friends and it's like, well then fuck you my friends. And if that's the worst is when you get compared to those other guys. And people compare me to Louis, uh, you know, like, or bring Louie up of like, why can't you do what Louis does? And I don't know, my brain isn't wired like his,

Speaker 1:          00:52:07       I don't mind if a guy does a few old jokes. I like hearing some old bits that I enjoyed, but I like a lot of new shit too. I see their point. I've had a peep places where I go and they'll say, hey, this guy was here last year and he just came back and he'd do the same fucking ag verbatim punchline

Speaker 2:          00:52:23       like, and I, I make it like if I'm going back to the same market that I was just out of, here I go, I go out of my way to write new stuff or, or let them know. Even like, hey, here's some stuff you might've heard and then here's, you know. Right, right, right. Yeah. I didn't even say in the setup like my accident, a transitional period and this is, you know, this is what's happening. And Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:52:44       I do a lot of, uh, where it used to at least I do a lot of Q and. A. I did that for the first time this weekend. I did Vancouver now for the first time this weekend for the first time. I've ever done a, um, an encore core,

Speaker 2:          00:52:53       you'll do an encore? No, I don't think so. Never done that before. Maybe at a college. I feel it. Yeah. I did have to come out. I feel like in Alaska I came out and did really like another joke that I hadn't done. What'd you do in Alaska? Uh, it was a school up there, up in Anchorage. Wow. What's it like up there? Is it weird? It's fucking weird. And it wasn't the, it wasn't the, in the middle of summer, but it was the beginning of summer, so it was a, it was light till midnight. Why? I flew in in the afternoon and then flew home at night, flew home right after my show. So it got to the airport

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       around 11 o'clock at night, just as it's starting to get dark and it was really trippy. Wow. Yeah. Alaska freaks me the fuck out, man. That's like the place where you go when you're running from the world. Right. You know, when you really want to be an outcast. But yeah, that was the only time. So you did your first one and yeah, it was weird. You know, they just screaming encore, encore. I did an hour and hour and something and then I went out and I did another 40 minutes. But it's all just, mostly I did some material that I hadn't done before, but a lot of it was just asking. They would ask questions, he's fucking around with the audience. I used to do a lot of that, but it became a lot of the same questions. And I also felt like the show didn't end it strong.

Speaker 1:          00:54:03       I like ending on a strong bit, so I was doing like an hour. I broke it down to what I feel like is the best performance and it's like an hour and 10 minutes going at it. Full clip and strong. Thank you. Good night. So I did that and then I came out and I felt like, okay, this isn't even the show. This is just fucking around and this is at least they've seen the full solid show and now I can fuck around with like the question and answer thing and it didn't, I don't feel like I'm ending on a bad note, I guess. Yeah. I ended strong luckily. But when your ad living like that, you don't really know where the fuck is going to go and you don't, you got to trust the crowd, laugh. Go all right. Yeah, exactly. And you've got to trust the crowd and the crowd was fucking hammered.

Speaker 1:          00:54:39       They were hammered and high as fuck. And the pot in Vancouver is insane. It's just as good, if not better than California. I never thought I would. I would say that. But we, we got ahold of some stuff. This guy messaged me and uh, we went to a dispensary, they have dispensary's then and we went and uh, I'm just like, how good could this be? We're, we're from California. We almost got too high to do the show. Sativa and Indica or sativa. Yeah. One area still where you can kind of score on the street to even sort of, but I think that's dangerous. I don't know. But the, the, the whole five of them in Vancouver. Rob, do you mean?

Speaker 2:          00:55:15       No, just a Bot Bot decent stuff. One day went back to the same guy the next day and he told her or assaulted me Schwag. Oh really? Yeah. Wow. So it wasn't, he ripped off, he just was shitty quality control. No, it was barely smokeable. Oh really? Yeah. And I actually had a guy there once, the same, uh, same city, uh, where, uh, he goes, follow me. He just came up to me on the street because you want it by the way. And I go, yeah, yeah, sure. Wow, that's a better effect they do. And I followed him around the corner and he goes, oh, I got to go into this household on. And as it, as it's happening, I'm like, there goes that 20 bucks. And I gave him the money and he went inside and I actually saw him go out the side door and climb over a fence, go away. Wow. Yes, I could see him run away my money and I'm just laughing at that point. I'm like, ah, the I deserve it. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:56:06       Well, they have a, Vancouver has a, they have a medical thing going on now will they take recommendations from California? So if you have a license, you have a California license, they'll allow you to get a prescription card, right? Yeah. Yeah. I never go up there. He never did a legal, really, you're a rebel borough and now why would you want to go to the dispensary

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       is amazing. I know. Well, I just smoked my friend's stuff from dispensary's, but I always had a weak guy that came to my house. Do you have a guy that come no fucking way? No, no, no, no, no, no. You, you, you. That's probably why he stopped smoking weed. You were getting all that, that stone or we'd you weren't getting it a space weed and you know, I wasn't getting less space. We'd with space, we space suite is the, the, the sativa. It's much more psychedelic. It's like you want to watch space documentaries. We want to go out and do things, I'm going to make an organic carton. Right? You get no, you're right. And I was getting the same stuff cause the guy always had to say, you know, he had the same buyer that you know, or whatever. When you go to a dispensary, then they educate you on it.

Speaker 3:          00:57:02       That's the beautiful thing of it. They'll say, this is a hybrid. This is a little bit of this. This is 60% indigo, 40% sativa. This is a pure sativa. This is gonna. You want to write a book? This is your shit. Right. You know, it's, it's a different feeling. Yeah, I gotta check it out. But when I have that, when you're done, if you do, if you decide to ever do it again, that should be the thing. But what are the reasons I kept this guy is he was my friend and I talked to him a couple of years ago. I swear to God we're were in my garage, uh, you know, or the transactions done and we're, I'm rolling what up, you know, before he heads back to where he lives. And, and, uh, I go, uh, this is one of the economies first starting to go south.

Speaker 3:          00:57:38       I go, hey dude, if I, if I stopped buying from you because I was thinking about getting a card, you know, and I'm like, if I stopped buying from you, would you take a hit? You know, like, would it hurt you financially? He's like, oh, absolutely. He's like, yeah, you're one of my regulars. And, and uh, yeah, that would suck him. So I then I was like, ah, I'm going to keep the little guy in business. I got to look out for the small businessman. Well that's cool. That's a good reason to, to keep with that guy then not get a license. That is, he was my old friend. I mean he was a guy. I'd been through wrath and, and uh, we've been, you know, I think at that point wrath was getting weeded somewhere else or, but uh, I used him anyway, you know, I kept him for 10 years or so.

Speaker 3:          00:58:18       That's good. And weird thing is, and I'm going to write a joke about it. Like, I haven't told him that I quit yet and I know it's three months later and he hasn't gotten a text for me. Like he hasn't texted me like, what the fuck can we, are you? Oh, that's funny. Maybe you heard about it online and he's just crying. Just know he's recalculating as bills. Trying to figure it out, how he's going to get by when that you're paid rent and two months now because the fuck, yeah, it's a, it's amazing how many people are in California smoke pot now. You know? Because it's so, it's so prevalent. People in other parts of the country really haven't, they don't have a clue. You don't have any idea how bizarre it is. You know when you go, if you go to Kansas City and he'd do a club in Kansas City had tried get in pot, it's fucking hard and if you get pods and I'm going to be any good, it's going to be okay.

Speaker 3:          00:59:04       When you're in California and you just drive down the street and you see these green plus signs everywhere, you see him all over the place. There's hundreds of dispensary's. He'd been to San Francisco later. Oakland? No, I haven't been to Oakland, but I have a buddy of mine who grows in Oakland. It's a while. It's totally allowed up there. Yeah. You'll stand up, you know cobb's uh, the comedy club in San Francisco and this never was like this when I lived up there in the 90s were standing in front of the place and one of the main streets in San Francisco, cops drive by, there's eight people standing out front smoking pot, you know, three or four pipes being passed around. The cops don't even slow down. And even though Carlos and say, hey, take it around the corner, they don't do any of that. They thought should be last time I was at cabs, I was smoking in the green room and I was passing joints out the window. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:59:55       handed them joints rather. Yeah. Yeah. That San Francisco is totally allowed. But that whole city now is, yeah. In Oakland and I haven't told is even more extreme. Like they called Oaksterdam that. Yeah. Well, they also have classes on how you can grow and you know, how do you consider your own business? Yeah, they have like some fucking university of weed up there. I don't even know exactly what this weird, there's some place in this country or is it Vancouver where they're actually selling it at seven 11 south. What really? Come on. Yeah, I heard that just recently. That one or two places where now it's allowed like in one store to two K. Awesome. That's cool. I heard that seminar could be, this is what I heard. Yeah, sure. Um, pulls up nothing for Google pulls up nothing. So I'm assuming this is bullshit. Okay, good.

Speaker 3:          01:00:54       But I think we're close if that's happening. But they'd be crazy not to. Why not man? Just fucking jumped in. You know, what do you, what do you know who's getting hurt here? You're already selling loco for 20 or whatever the fuck that shit is. What does that four Loko Shit stuff that people have their heart bursts. It's like five red bulls and five shot. It was, it's Tequila. It's whatever the fuck it is. Some strong alcohol and like really strong red bull type energy drinks. People are dying of it. Yeah. They sell that. They sell cigarettes, they sell booze. You know, you saw everything. They can kill you. I sell a little weed. How long do you think that's going to be before that happens? 10 years. 20. I don't know. I think we're closer than that really. That felt like that last election we were really close to get sloppy and it's just the next time somebody writes the right bill and, and words that in the right way that gets even that last people to go, hey, that's not a bad idea.

Speaker 3:          01:01:44       The real issue though is federal. The federal issue is a huge issue because it federally, it's still very, very illegal. It's still schedule one, which is a huge deal. That's a, that's heroin. That's cocaine. It's uh, not, not even, excuse me. Those are scheduled to schedule one is more illegal than cocaine. Right. But there are a lot of cities around the country that are starting to, you know, yeah. I know. It's basically illegal. Uh, you know, like I was saying, it was shooting this thing in Ann Arbor. It's pretty okay there. Yeah. And arbors really? Okay. Yeah, that's pretty legal there. I think they just approved medical in Michigan as well. And um, where was I recently though? It's really, oh, Denver. Denver is super legal. Denver is a lot like California. They call it mainstream. Damn. They got like one street main street or broad stir dam and it's all pot shops.

Speaker 3:          01:02:30       Josh blue. Like there's yes. Some comic that Joshua was the guy who has cerebral palsy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But um, yeah, it's, it means starting to happen. Starting to happen slowly but surely. And I was listening to rock radio in Detroit practically every ad on this regular rock radio station is either a gro growth, you know, go new grow store or you know, an actual medical marijuana store really like almost every ad. Holy Shit. That's cool. Wow. But then again, who the fuck's listening to radio these tests? That's true. But I had a rental car and you know, and they played a thin Lizzy and Metallica. So Nice was enough for me. You ever see the documentary wild to ocean wild ocean? What does, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:03:13       It's, it's as bad as I saw it last night and it's all about sardines and, and like they do that thing were birds do where they all become one group, like a mob to like a flock of birds where they move in one unit. Yeah, it's so bad ass. But they have it in three d and the three d TV thing in the past, you know, like I said, it's good for here and there and stuff. This is the most amazing thing you'll ever see in three d. It's just this huge mob. Like all these fish turned into like a monster, like a boss battle in a video game. You see these dolphins just trying to shoot through them and get it and they all kind of react as one whole. And then there's the seagull things that dive down and go through the water like missiles and it looks like underneath the water it looks like war. Like it sounds like war, like missiles and bombs and an, it's the most amazing thing. Everyone's birds do. They dive bomb. They're are like muscles. Yeah. Must be crazy in three days. Three body recommend. It's called wild ocean. It's the ocean. It's so bad ass. All right Max. Uh, speaking of, see, I watched the sativa before, that's it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       Watched a, a, a documentary. Somebody linked it to me on Twitter about the Salton Sea. Do you, do you know anything about the salt and sea? A little bit. This is a trippy thing man. And I was not aware of, I remember there was an invalid, I don't know. It's in California. There was a val Kilmer movie about salt and sea. It was like, you know, some crime. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Well, what it is is apparently at the turn of the century they, um, there was an engineering mistake and the Colorado River for two years was just dumping water into this one part of California and they thought that it was going to dry up and they thought that, well, this is a huge mistake. It created the biggest manmade lake in California, the biggest lake, the biggest bottle of body of water in California is the salt and sea. And it filled this whole area up and they thought it was going to drain out, eventually dry up, but it didn't.

Speaker 1:          01:05:10       And people were putting boats on it and people started building houses there and people started fishing in there. And then they started having tourism there and they started there. They're just commercials move to the, the, the Riviera in California, the end, you know, the, uh, the, the, you know, indoor Riviera or the Interior Riviera, I forget what they were calling it, but it was, it was this gigantic artificial body of water and people were pulling all these fish out and it looked like a fucking party. And it was, you know, it was like photos and video from the fifties where everybody was like driving those old cars and they're all smiling. And the women looked a little Chubby, you know, it was a whole, the whole, the whole, that whole era. Well, well, eventually the runoff from all of these farms made it into this see and poisoned everything and got so bad that there was mass Fishkill offs where there was a million fish would die in a day.

Speaker 1:          01:05:57       And the air was so rank with dead fish that you couldn't breathe. So it basically became this toxic fucking cesspool and everyone had to move out. All the schools shut down. Everyone moved down to the area. And there's only like a few like desert rats that are still living there. But try it out though, right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Still. Oh yeah. Now it's saltier than the ocean. Now it's like impossible for things to live in it. I think it was just like the salt flats. Now it's a dead like butter puddle of water and it's all like the apocalypse out there bad because all these houses that are like being overcome by this C, they're all rotted out from the salt water and the air and the fucking, everything's abandoned. And windows of Grogan. It's called the s the documentary. Um, let me find it. It's cause it's on my, it's on Netflix. Yeah, it's on, you can find it on youtube. Let me find the video on youtube because it's, it's, it's, it's fascinating enough to, people need to see it. If you just go last night to my Twitter, if you want to do some searching. Today is June 13th and you go to the June 13th Twitter cause I'm trying to pull it up here on 'em online and it's pulling on

Speaker 2:          01:07:08       not a documentary. It's kind of, I think it came out no six but uh, into the void. Do you ever see it? Oh yeah. It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. At least the first half of it is, I, I did you get pissed off with all the strobe lights and all the fast motion. We'll do tell everybody with this documentary as well. Oh wait, I'm thinking of enter the void. You know, you're thinking of that movie on Dmt. Yeah. He's talking about, it's like a skateboarding movie, right? No, no. It's, maybe I'm getting the title wrong, but it's a, it's the two guys a mountain climbing, uh, where uh, one guy breaks his leg and they're alone and uh, he basically lets us friend die or he thinks he like, I won't give it all away. He lets the guy go and then, you know, then it's told like buy them.

Speaker 2:          01:07:54       And then with the reenactments, the reenactments are brutal and uh, it's just really well made. It's these two British guys that were a climbing a mountain and a that had never been, never been done before. It's called the engine into the void. The void. Yeah. And I was thinking to enter the void. Yeah, I remember that. See I just saw this kind of movies stress me. Yeah. I, Oh yeah. It was wondering was I watched it in two sittings. I had to walk away and get something else done cause I was like so stressed out for these guys. Yeah. But you know that the fact that they're both talking, you know how it ends up, right. So yes, it's still, it seems like the only soften the blow a little bit. I didn't see that movie where they got cut his arm off either based on that guy or a hundred, 127 hours. Yeah. Not really interested in seeing that. Thanks. That's pretty brutal. That was why I made too. Yeah. I love Netflix streaming. I mean, how great is that nowadays? You can just stream these documentaries like instantly

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       do something particularly scary about the idea of getting stuck out in the wilderness and dying out there, away from civilization cause you're so unprotected and we're so, we're so not aware of how unprotected we really, are you one of those goals that even does those things? I lived in Colorado, in the mountains. I lived eight miles down a dirt road. My dog had eaten by a mountain lion. It's one of the reasons why we decided to move back. But yeah, I decided to just throw myself out into the wilderness and wanted to be, you know, I wanted to be somewhere. It was let way, way, way less people and just kind of like take it all in, but you're really fucking vulnerable.

Speaker 2:          01:09:27       Yeah. But I would never be mountain climbing one other data and I w I'd never be like this movie frozen. I really liked. Did you see that and haven't seen that. It's a harm with three kids on a ski lift and uh, the ski lift gets shut down at the end of the night. And then they're stuck over there for the weekend. Like I'm just not adventurous. I wouldn't be that guy. I wouldn't be that guy. Like we got to get one last run in I think. Okay. I Youtube never been that

Speaker 1:          01:09:50       do on youtube. It's called the accidental. See and you you have to, it's really quick too. It's only like six minutes and 30 seconds. We're details the whole a thing of the, the salt and sea. I said there isn't a full documentary that I think there might be more than one out there. There's a, there's a couple of the people when I posted this as a couple of the people a recommended on Twitter that were different than this one, but this pretty much tells the whole story in six and a half minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:10:14       It's insane. It's insane. It's, I mean it's, it's, it literally looks like Mad Max. I mean it's, it's the craziest shit ever. What part of California is it? Is it someone that desert? Wow. Is it like on your way out to Phoenix or mm, that's a good question. I don't know the exact one we could find out right here. Hold on. Yeah, off the 10 or the 60 year. I loved that abandoned kind of like ha, like neighborhoods and cities that, that kind of feeling of like, like post apocalyptic Zombie of any time you like that in real life, you know. I do. I like like a cat lives kinda. Yeah. As a kid we used to break into the old prison in Columbus, Ohio. We would break into it and smoke weed and stuff like that and we were like 14 and that was just so cool to me. But just the history of the, there's deteriorating building and that visitor Detroit is fucking huge. Those buildings or this thing, she didn't enjoy the sir. It's, it's 220 fucking six feet deep salt and see, wow, this is crazy. I got to watch that tonight. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:11:09       The deepest part of the C is five meters higher or five feet higher than uh, yeah, five feet higher than the lowest point of death valley. See is fed by the new Whitewater and Alamo rivers. It's still fed. Wow. It's crazy. They diverted it. They fucked up. It was just an engineering mistake and it created this crazy fucking spot. But it um, it occupies the lowest elevations of the salt and sink and the Colorado desert of the imperial and Riverside counties in southern California. Riverside. Okay. Yeah. I need to go out and check that out man. We need to make a fucking trip. We need to do a podcast from out there. Yeah, that'd be interesting. It's worth the price stinks. Like dude, there's, there's ground up dead bones from fish that up sand. Okay. There's so many difish died that there is a type of Sam there that is nothing but ground up fish bones and they were showing it in this documentary with her.

Speaker 1:          01:12:04       It looks like Sam, the guy's reaching into the sand and pulling it up and it's ground up. Fishbowls Dan helped spin out there. It's where drink that water. It's probably thinking about buying a trailer, cargo there for four days in a row, waiting for the end of time with the fish sand the giant carton of cigarettes. If you ever swam with dolphins, no. Yes you can. I was, when I was in the big island of Hawaii, the dolphins were out near, uh, people like people would go out and swim with them and the dolphins would come close to him. That's what I want to do. Yeah, dude, you can go in Hawaii, there's, there's parts of, uh, different parts of the world were dolphins, dolphins love people. Man. It's kind of crazy because they're pretty brutal though. The dolphins, there's this, a resort on a Wahoo Kahala where they actually have dolphins captive, but you know, you can, they take you into the pool with them and the capital.

Speaker 1:          01:12:54       Yeah. Which is kind of a bummer. [inaudible] me out, dude. That freaks me out what I want. Then you see how intelligent they are. Yeah, they are. We call them a lot of puppies. Me and my wife there because they are just like, Doug's, it really sweet though. They're like dogs, but they're a lot smarter. They rape you to love rape. Everyone needs to rape a little bit. If you don't have any hands, you know, they have flippers. You can't just rely on someone's kindness. Is there one rapey dolphin or are they pretty be like, they're all eager? Gangbanging couple like one of them like, Hey, look over there that, that you look and then the other one comes in and dolphins are particularly ruthless when it comes to breeding females because breeding females, when they have babies, they won't mate for a bunch of years afterwards while the kids growing up.

Speaker 1:          01:13:42       So male dolphins will kill the babies to force the women to fuck again. So one of those, yeah, people don't tell you about that. When they tell you how low dolphins are green, they're eco. I'll tell you how fucking ruthless nature is. I mean, dolphins are not separate from it. They uh, well, so the, they'll kill babies to force the female to breed. So fucking bite their heads off to kill him. They don't use guns right now. They start to break the name. Yeah. So they, um, they'll kill the babies and last they fuck the female. So because of that, the females, fuck everyone. The females try to fuck as many men as they can in their little pack. So that way when, when it all goes down, you know the guy comes around and goes down and this might be my fucking kids. I don't want to kill this chick. And so they don't, they don't kill the babies to force you to read. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:14:30       Fucking loved. I was so stoned last night. I was like thinking, man, dolphins seems so intelligent and they seem like they all like communicate and stuff like that. I want to take a dolphin and put it in a big aquarium and they just take it on land and show them like the sites of the land. Cause know dolphins. Dumb nine maybe it would help them out.

Speaker 1:          01:14:46       Take a dog in New York City, get super, super well. They're really, they're nearly close to being able to the grove dolphin. It's really nice out though. This is silver lake. They're really close to being able to decipher. They're really close to being able to decipher it. Dolphin language. Right. You know what I mean? It's something that we're really unsure of right now. What they're doing, what they're saying. But it's going to come a point where they're going to have some incredible supercomputer that's going to be able to decipher though cause they have a very clear language and once we figured out their language then you know this is going to be like Google, translate, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray and a bunch of racist shit at eight eight Jews. The first dolphin is the out. That's his first words. I hate Jews. Fuck man, we worked so hard for this. Dolphins are assholes. Like if you had a killer whale in a fish tank and he gave him a marker and he came back in a swat stickers all over the walls. Like fuck man. Really?

Speaker 4:          01:15:43       Let's see. I think there should be more experimentation on animals like that. Like I showed last night when I was watching the movie, I showed my cat 3-d, you know, I tried to place that that glass is this cause it's never been done properly. People don't show their cats 3d never know. Maybe the cap freak out.

Speaker 1:          01:15:56       I agree with some experimentation, but I don't agree with, I don't agree with any dolphin captivity that might as well be jail. Those are slaves and those are intelligent slaves. That's, they don't want to be there. That's gross. The killer whale thing that's gross kind of bummed out by the, by the dolphins at the Nice hotel, they probably switching at a four star hotels matter, man. They want to, they don't, they don't know what's on their pillows. The Room Service 24 hours. It's a nice, nice set up. You know, we have to be, this is what we have to think about for real and it sounds hippy space talk, but we have to really be concerned with the way we treat less or animals because that's exactly what the way there seems to be an ethic. It seems to be every fucking animal that's intelligent. We'll take the animal that's least intelligent and either fuck it or eat it and that's, that's how it goes.

Speaker 1:          01:16:46       That's just how it goes with killer whales. That's how it goes with dolphins. That's how it goes with people. We're the top of the food chain. So we take the things below us, like killer whales and dolphins. We treat him like shit. We put them in prison, we fuck with them, we killed them in tuna that's accidentally and nobody goes to jail for that. And then you think about what whales or what work is due to whales. Killer whales are called killer whales because they kill whales. They go after whales and you bite it is fucking horrible. Video of Orca is biting Wales faces off. I mean literally just taking, just swimming and taking huge chunks out of these poor defenseless, you know, peaceful whales fingernails. Yeah. Nerd whales, whales. And then we know about chimpanzees would, a chimpanzee is doing, they find monkeys, they eat them, they tear monkeys apart and eat him alive.

Speaker 1:          01:17:31       You know? So that's the intelligent life that we've documented on this planet. And every single one of them either fucks are, kills everything that it can control also to away. Exactly. So do we. So we have to be real careful saying that I'm really cool with, you know, animal experimentation. Because if some new thing fucking lands here from Nibiru, you know, and it goes, oh, you guys are stupid as fuck, you're still using the nuclear power. Oh you guys have cell phones and retires just start killing and eating hippies. Right. When I moved to Boulder, I saw that point. That's what I really truly understood the hate for hippies faces off and rape them and eat them.

Speaker 4:          01:18:06       The last south park was so awkward on if you saw it, you'd got to watch it though. It's about getting old and it was one that was so weird, right? No, I didn't say it was great. I'm just saying it was so weird that I haven't seen south park and have such a long way to go to south park studios. Watch the latest one. It's freaky man. The first couple of the season. We're not great now.

Speaker 2:          01:18:24       Felt like, oh, they finally hit on a really great idea and they executed it.

Speaker 1:          01:18:28       You want to talk about prolific, who is more prolific than those guys are insane. Incredible. And apparently it's all Trey Parker. Matt stone is a huge part of it is as well. But Trey Parker guys and alien and they have consultants,

Speaker 2:          01:18:41       the guys that come in and basically go, that's awesome. Do that, you know, like the, and then they get a paycheck for, for talent. Trey, how awesome he is.

Speaker 4:          01:18:49       Yeah. I got to sit in one of my friend now works there. He's that main editor guy and I got to sit down on the couch once and you know, like hanging out with Matt stone and talking and stuff. It kind of relax. They, once Trey came in, it was just this intense energy and everybody was just like, okay, everyone's got to go. And you know, it's so weird. He's, he's a maniac man. I mean positive. I mean I love him, but he's a, he's really a hard worker and you think you have to be that guy

Speaker 2:          01:19:15       day like during season three, like in the beginning. And uh, it was really impressed by just the way that guy runs, the fact that they were writing episodes, but you know, for comedy central and they were allowed to kind of do anything they wanted there. And I don't know if a lot of people that watch the show know that, but the way they kept so like you know, ahead of stories as they were writing shit the day you saw it, sometimes you know, they were, they were rewriting and then it's on air that night with the animation, you know, nobody else does. That's incredible. They are. That's like how then do we know when, uh, uh, Ileane consultants when that thing happened, they had an episode that day about it and then Terry Shave, oh, there was stuff about it and it was insane. Like no other show does that. Well, especially animation Simpson's you read a joke and a year later it makes it to TV, you know? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:20:05       yeah. That's a, they're pretty incredible man. What done is a, an amazing thing. And not just what that, but they're fucking movies and apparently there are new play isn't saying can we see it? I'm hearing amazing thing. I heard it's the same soundtracks out now. Did you ever see in the more I'm an episode they did. Yeah. They did a half hour on the show about Mormonism. And it was really funny. He does a lot of more men's stuff cause I think he's, he grew up in that movie gas. They've tackled pretty much every religion on that show by now. But yeah, there are more men. So they grew up in evergreen, Colorado, which is a pretty religious area. That's why South Park, south pus sorta based on evergreen. I went to evergreen. I looked at houses up there. So it's interesting. It's like a lot of rich people from Denver.

Speaker 1:          01:20:45       Columbine, is it up there? No, not quite. It's like near Golden. Okay. Like that area. It's a suburb of Denver and it's really nice up there. It's beautiful houses and incredible view. I mean it's just you got to deal with some snow, but my fucking God, it's gorgeous up there. Yeah, but there's a lot of religious people up there. A lot of churches, a lot of it's like very different than boulder. We looked at boulder and boulder was like all hippies and intellectuals and then evergreen was more like real right wing and a lot of Jesus bangers up there, which is a lot of Colorado, Colorado Springs. All Jesus bangers like that. Colorado Springs was hippies near Colorado springs is a military town. Colorado Springs is a, it's a military is like the big industry out there and that's where Ted Haggard was from. The Guy who was the gay Minister II, which um, you know, it's uh, it's, it's interesting man.

Speaker 1:          01:21:36       How many people uh, get in trouble with their dicks in, in 2011. This, this latest one, this Anthony Wiener guy. If you seen the photos of him sending photos of his dick from the congressional bathroom or the Congressional Jim, he's only congressional anymore. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. In the, in the bathroom of the Congressional Jim in the land, the locker room. He's taken a camera for cell phone photo of him naked holding onto his cock. Nice cock. And his name's Dina. So it's pretty cool. Decent kind of take a lot more pictures of my cock is bigger. Would you send them randomly to Twitter people though? Yeah, I'd probably put them up on my Facebook. Yeah, we'll look at what he did today. This guy, I think it's fascinating that he's not Hancock at the grove. We would see the x men today. Here he is.

Speaker 1:          01:22:21       I think it's cool that he's not quitting. Yeah. But why shitty? I mean, everyone fucking, who cares. Yeah. He's just, he's a freak. But yeah. How was that affecting his ability to, you know, to dictate policy or to do whatever the fuck he has to do in his job? You know what I mean? It, it compromises people's ability to take them seriously, I guess. But yeah, which ultimately hurts us, I think. I guess so. But the only reason why anybody wants to be a politician in the first place is because they, they want power. That's just a fact. There's so very few of those people really, truly want to help anybody. You know? I think the obligation is so overwhelming that to really want to do it, just to help people. I think people get into it and then it's just too much and they just fucking fuck, this is too, too crazy. There's a few Ron Paul's that I really believe are actually trying to make things right, but for the most part, so many of the people that are in that position, they're just trying to fucking pump themselves up. But as a Democrat, when stuff like that happens, I always feel like, you know, Chris Rock and the, uh, whenever a black guy gets in trouble joke, you know, like, oh great, thanks. Right. You know what I mean? As a adding that to us. Do you really believe in being a democrat? Do you think that's real?

Speaker 2:          01:23:27       Do, yeah. I mean, I, I vote that party yet.

Speaker 1:          01:23:31       Even though all this fucking Obama Shit hasn't changed anything. And in fact he's been more conservative and I am done more. He's basically Bush, Bush black, you know, he's almost done exactly the same thing. Didn't close. They'd gone down the way that's gone. But I mean, come on. He didn't close Guantanamo Bay. He didn't, you know, he said that he was going to close the wars and public and he's sent 30,000 more people to Afghanistan after he won the Nobel prize. I mean, it's all insanity. It's all insanity. It's, it's the idea that, that somehow or another Democrats operate any different than Republicans. It's all horseshit libertarian. Well, you know, I voted for Obama, but I did it just because I thought it was a historic milestone and I was hoping socially that it would make a big change and it would be different. Yeah. I mean, I guess maybe it has, but you know, and this whole fucking Osama bin Ladin nonsense, they killed him. Not, but we threw him in the water. Yeah. It's all done.

Speaker 2:          01:24:23       Oh yeah. And a week after the, it had like the lowest point, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:24:28       And you know, and he was talking about that in a speech recently and he said, you know, that it's proof that did this, this administration is on the right track. You need look no further than the fact that we got rid of public enemy number one, Osama bin Laden. And I'm like, wow, that is the craziest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life. Because what does that got done lately? Oh, was just a bad guy you were looking for. You fucked this economy inside out. It's asshole is prolapsed and hanging out, bleeding all over the sand. And you're saying that, you know, and it's not him, but it's the whole system has, it has not been repaired. In fact, there's millions of dollars and billions of dollars that they can't account for in this fucking bail out. They don't know where the fuck it went. And you know, there's all sorts of shenanigans have gone on.

Speaker 1:          01:25:07       So to have this guy say that that's how it's proof that it's all back in order that they've killed this number one bad guy like Jesus fucking Christ. What are you think I'm a little kid? Like that's, you know, I don't, I don't believe in him anymore than I believe in any of the other ones. I don't think he's a bad person. I just think that is the job you get there and then they give you a script and you don't really get much fucking saying what happens. I think we have this really a distorted perception of what a president is and it's based on like the ideal of like President Kennedy, the I the guy who's going to step in and put this country on the right track and you know, and look what happened to him. And I think that that is the thing you don't remember.

Speaker 1:          01:25:46       I think that's what happens when there's a guy who uh, some happen to magic TMZ was around when Kennedy was here. Awesome. I'm like, God, I want to see us going to get rid of Twitter updates. He'd be popping bottles with models every night like rose sex tape. I'm alone. Could you imagine how ridiculous of a B? Cause he would just be partying and people be pulling out their cell phones. Put that down. Please try to keep America free over here. He just be bitches and champagne and Frank Sinatra high five and whether fucking 69 and chicks. Awesome. Yeah, it would be a different world man. You know, now it's like fucking every week over the airport you see these dudes just scanning for someone famous to show up with cameras. Do you see them? Yeah. You know, I know when they're talking to me, times are tough pulling me, you know, you, you, you, what do you think of reality shows today? Ben was, yeah, I have a question. Is that I think they're awesome. You watched American idol. So we think about that guy, man. The guy didn't go in at all. What's, what's your favorite housewife show? I go with New Jersey cause they're the most savage who are the closest to animals. I can't watch that shit. Yeah, you can. If you do it once, it's all you need one, one, one.

Speaker 1:          01:27:09       Yeah. I don't think it's the best move. It's not a good move to get drawn in. It's some the grand distraction. Unfortunately. I watch it like

Speaker 2:          01:27:15       some of them and she hates that when I walk into the room and I, you know, I start scoffing or shaking my head like the other night she made me leave the room she was watching, which we'll show in New York and uh, they were arguing about some girl being late for dinner and I was just like, what the fuck? How can you watch this? You're a smart girl. I'm like,

Speaker 1:          01:27:35       you're well read. Did you like good things? Like why are you watching these fucking idiots? It's entertaining. It stimulates some weird part of the mind and it does provide some sort of a relief. And the relief is that you're allowed to get invested in these people's lives. We have no stakes whatsoever. So this fucking bitch is yelling at her husband and wow that guy. Well he is a piece of shit and she does have a point and you get caught up in these and it's a distraction from your own real live situation and your real life problems that you need to deal with. Yes, that's what it is. Can't get my head. I would never want to watch your show to con shopping. Shopping would be number one on the fucking the twat network and no time. Um, I spent a lot of time on the message boards, man.

Speaker 1:          01:28:21       And I'm, I'm amazed at a, and I've gotten to know a lot of people on message boards and I'm amazed at the energy that people will put into concocting arguments on the Internet. And like having like debates and putting things in quotes and citing exams. They put so much work into it yet I know that their life is in a shambles. Right. I know cause they're going broke. I know that that they might be losing their fucking house. They might be in the middle of a divorce, they might be fucking, you know, losing their job and yet here they are spending an immense amount of time arguing a sport or arguing about a movie or a song or a band and you know, and fucking with or

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       talking about you. Do you read, do you read the critical stuff about you or, I read some of it, you know, I know it's really, really negative. I mean, I see where the comedy just fucking door in a fire. Okay. I'm not going to listen to you. This is silliness, you know, but you can, I think you can get some things from people. I'm a big proponent of reading critical things because for two reasons. One, because I think it's like snake venom. I think if you don't, if you're not used to it and all sudden you read some shitty about you, like, Whoa, that hurts. I feel shitty. But I see it so much. It's like, you know, the snake bites here. I'm like, bitch, I'm not immune to this shit. I mean, I read that a lot where people say stuff about me and it's like, really? You're calling me a Yeti and that I looked like a child molester. I say that in my app.

Speaker 3:          01:29:45       Oh. And I look like a muppet. Never heard that. Uh, fucking think of something new mean to say about me because I've said every possible horrible about myself and my act. When you're a comic, you can't catch a comic off guard. Like we know what we look like. You're not going to get us like that. But when they'll say like critical shit, it's always to me like super fascinating. Like what are you trying to achieve there and why are you so upset about someone's art? You know, someone's comedy, someone's offering. It's like I have friends that will like, fuck Larry, the cable guy's fucking the Axa and I go blah blah blah blah blah. Who cares man, do you, does it really affect you? Does it really bother you? You know, it does. Like when you did the Carlos thing, you were, you were sticking up for a friend that had been right sticking up for the whole art form too, where people don't understand about that whole situation.

Speaker 3:          01:30:36       It was like creativity was under siege. We had a terrible situation, but guy was getting away with stealing shit left and right. But I don't give a fuck if he was doing it as, oh shit. If it wasn't good. But there's been other guys where people, like when people were first thrown Dana under the bus, I was like, it's not affecting me. Ryan and I are not going up for the same auditions and he's not taking food out of my mouth by him being a fucking unfunny hack, you know, I can't watch his act, but it's not hurting me. You know what I mean? Like, and, and unless the guy is like, you know, doing my shtick, which know that he's doing, I'm not going to get mad at somebody. You know what I mean? Like it just, I don't have the time. I agree with you.

Speaker 3:          01:31:13       A hunting or sound or the energy and some people did. Some of our friends, people we all know, you know, like that's how they spend most of their time. Bad mouthing other comics. How about your boy Dave Cross and then fucking huge thing he did about Larry, the cable guy that it took hours to write man, why are you even that guy? Like fuck your girlfriend, you know, live your life, go downtown and get drunk. For some people there's an underlying feeling of they haven't achieved enough success and when anybody else has success somehow or another, it draws away from their success. And if they feel that this a person who has success is cable guy from David Cross, he who knows it just, it's in the public eye. We didn't almost get arrested development and you know, you know what I mean? Like fighting same parts.

Speaker 3:          01:31:59       But it's not saying that then you're looking at rationally. Right. I think we all come from this really fucked up place. Every comic comes from some weird deficits, you know, and a guy like Dave is not immune to it and we are an Mri nor are you. And there's definitely been guys, I've been mad at petty shit, but you know, it's because it got personal and it's not because of, you know, cause they suck. And I think Dave's point was that he said that Larry was racist and w the stuff he was doing was like, it was like, but racist people love him. I think you could say that about it. Right. It's horrible, horrible fans. Some of them, you know that guy fills out stadiums like football still, Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Joshua Wolf opened for him in a football arena, I dunno. Fifth Office. He's a comic.

Speaker 3:          01:32:48       He does the Chelsea handler show all the time. He opened for him for 50,000 people. Even seeing the 55 dice says according to, uh, Ari Shaffir talk to dice about it. And then what you do is you just play pretending that your buddies are in the back of the room and tried to make them laugh. That's kind of what Steve Martin said. You know? Did you ever read the Steve Martin Book about why he quit standup or it's about him born standing up. I have it. He gave it to me for Christmas two years ago. I never cracked it out. And you're on a plane for six hours. Yeah. Yeah. Seriously. I do my best. I'll do my best writing and I do podcasts on planes. I can't read it. I read the thing and I think in one sitting and it really is. Yeah. It bumps you ever into him.

Speaker 3:          01:33:33       Huge. I love, let's get small. Yeah, I mean that's what he's one of the reasons I'm a stand up. Yeah. Probably the main reason. Yeah. Yeah. He was the first guy got really, really into and I would tell those jokes to my friends and at that point I was never like, I'm going to be a stand up. Cause I had this one kid in my neighborhood is a fat kid who thought he was going to be the next John Belushi and he was like, you're not funny. I'm funny. Oh God. He was one of those guys. Those guys are fucked. Kind of a bully about being funny. It's ridiculous. And the guy who runs around, you're missing the whole fucking point of it. Right? Almost everybody that I know. That's really funny. It didn't think they were funny and you got to talk them into being funny.

Speaker 3:          01:34:08       Yeah. Well that's what happened to me. It was a friend, uh, uh, was working at a Mcdonald's in Sacramento and this, you know, I'm 19 working at a shitty Mcdonald's and was, but he's like, you should try stand up. And I was like, no. He's like, yeah, you should, you write jokes every day, you know? And I was writing jokes every day. Why was, I was making jokes up, you know, and making like structuring them and doing basically what we do with that without knowing that that's what I was doing. Holy Shit. Just bits about the people. I would write little cartoons and put them up in the wall and shit. And uh, you know, but it was basically I was writing jokes. Wow. That's, you did that to me too. And Steve Martin was the reason I got into when I was in high school, uh, I was not a class clown. I was not funny. Like a lot of people, like when I was in high school, they found out that I was a comedian there. Like what the fuck you became a comedian. But what I did do, I was an artist and when I did do is I would draw cartoons of the teachers

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       that were hilarious. Like there was a guy named Mr. White. He was this crazy guy who got back from Vietnam. He was whacked and he was really short. So I'd always draw him standing on a stool, like everything. No matter what it was, he was standing on a stool and it was always like him going fucking crazy about nom and hookers and you know, and so I would do different cartoons about different teachers. Like that was the only part of my humor that that showed itself at all in high school.

Speaker 4:          01:35:22       Imagine you had a cell phone back then you can record this shit. Right. I had the same guy, he was like a Vietnam vet and he was just crazy. And he would say all these terminology and you're like, what's that mean? Like you'd be like, don't you get your h e double x are put you in the kitty bag. And everyone's like, what's a kitty bag? And I guess that's some kind of bag soldiers you, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:35:38       Oh, so he would talk and like IED talk and so weird and got acronyms are,

Speaker 2:          01:35:43       that was how I kind of turned it around in high school. You know, I was a giant nerd, but by senior year I was doing radio and I was also doing a, the school paper and I was writing jokes and that kind of thing. Really? Yeah. Being funny in these music reviews. And there was a teacher who had lost his shit and he was a nom guy and he killed a dog. He had, his neighbor's dog was staying at his house. And the dog started barking and, or like incessantly barking. So he killed the dog. And uh, I thought it was funny to bark at that teachers face and that got around school that I just did this crazy barking thing and made the guy kind of have a meltdown and like turned everything around for me. It was one of those things of everybody going, hey posting's not a retard.

Speaker 2:          01:36:26       He's kind of funny. That's fucking crazy. So you got in this Vietnam veteran dog kill or space and barked. What was his reaction to you? Barking? He peed himself. He wanted to hit me. Whoa. They turned really red faced and just had a total meltdown. And uh, did you feel in danger? I know cause I had other kids laughing and I was so like that was so much more important, you know. So when you left high school, you had a direct path, you knew you were going to be currently no, no, I was going to junior college and that's why I was living up. I got kicked out of the house cause I, I barely made it out of high school cause I, my grades had been really strong in the beginning when I was a total nerd. And then when I tried to turn it around, they got, it started going south because I just wanted to be the class clown.

Speaker 2:          01:37:09       I tried to make people laugh, I got kicked out of classes and while they didn't even know you were actually working towards a future yeah, when I was, yeah. And then, uh, just didn't know studying and you were, you were being literally studying. Yeah. And so whether it's an understudy Wani I actually, I called a bunch of comedy clubs in Sacramento and couldn't get into like the lab and limits, you know, remember those places. And I think there's two clubs still up there now. There's the punchline. But I tried getting in and couldn't get in and they said, well, when you turn 21 and so the week I turned 21 and went in with 10 minutes already written. And uh, uh, just that was it.

Speaker 1:          01:37:47       So similar to my story starting out younger? No, I was 21 too. Oh, you were? Yeah. So similar to the same story of uh, telling other people's jokes. Like for me it was Kennison and Richard Pryor. I would, I was delivering newspapers and I would go to the office and tell people like these Kennison bits that I saw online and I was still, you know, in my head, I could never do it myself. I just, you know, it was in my head I was like, this is, this is like fantasy funded. It was grammar school for me. Really?

Speaker 2:          01:38:15       Yeah. With the Steve Martin and I must've admin. But 77, six one was he popular? Yeah, I didn't, I had a totally different career path. I didn't think until, I didn't even think about stand up, think about it. I just thought I loved being funny. I never thought, like I said, I never thought I could do it. You were just inspired by it to love this love. I love making kids laugh. And uh, I remember, uh, as Kate at my school had never seen the bad news bears. And a in one day I told him the whole plot or the bad news bears like started it, the break and then we'll be getting, you know, between second period and you know, like a 10 o'clock in the morning. I started telling him and then, you know, we get called the class and then at lunch I met up with them again and I'm like, okay, so then this happens and just told them the whole, all the jokes, all the funny parts of the,

Speaker 1:          01:39:02       do you imagine if that kid didn't want to hear it at all and he was just being tortured by you all day? It's like eventually this mother fucker last shut up.

Speaker 2:          01:39:09       Laugh. Cause I knew like how to tell those jokes. I knew how I say, you know what I mean? Like how to set them up and

Speaker 1:          01:39:14       it's, we're, spoiler alert came, was born one of my parents when I was 13 my parents took me to see live on the sunset strip and a wow, that's cool. It was a crowded, yeah. My parents are hippies. They're pretty open minded and uh, it was a crowded theater and I remember laughing so hard. I remember there was one point where I stopped in the middle of it cause I was just so bewildered and I looked around the theater, I looked behind me, I looked to the left and me and people were like moving up and down and slapping their legs and everyone was moving and laughing. They were laughing so hard. I remember thinking, this guy is just talking, this is incredible that he's just up there talking like I've never seen anything like this before. And I thought about all the movies that I saw that I love like stripes and all these great comedy movies that was so funny, but they were never this funny.

Speaker 1:          01:39:59       I was like, this is a different kind of funny and it's just this guy talking. And I remember that stuck with me, man, that stuck with me for years now when I was 13 I still never thought about doing it until I was like right before I did it. That's when I thought about doing, I got talked into doing it by some friends, but he was 19 2019 and 20 years old. Yeah. Yeah. Once you get going, man, then you realize, God, why would I have ever wanted to do anything else? Have you been following this Tracy Morgan? Shit, I was going to bring that up. Yeah. Yeah. Tracy Morgan went off and said that if his son was gay, he would stab that little nigger and to death. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I can picture him saying it, but it's kind of fun, you know? Yeah. If he had said that any place else other than onstage, I would never give them a pass. But when people have to realize is sometimes you say shit on stage and you don't know what the fuck you're saying. You're just, yeah, you're ad libbing and you're going down a road and then maybe you'd take a choice just to be, and then

Speaker 3:          01:40:53       you fuck up and you say something really stupid and you don't know where to go with it and you try to be funny with it. And then I don't necessarily think that is what he believes he might, I might be wrong, you know, but it's saying something on stage. It sounds like a cop out, but saying something on at saying something in the real world to me are two different things. That's a performance as a character I'm, it's not really understanding what you think. He's kind of doing a character where it's more exaggerated, ignorant version of himself. I think that it's so close to reality. He's done so much fucked up shit. It's not like he's this really conservative, buttoned down guy and it's like his dice man character. What I love about him is he kind of doesn't give a fuck. Like I hear, I heard stories of when he was at SNL where he's like saying to women staffers, you know, like, I'm going to fuck you.

Speaker 3:          01:41:39       I'm going to put a baby in that it's like getting pregnant pregnant. Like I just feel like he has gotten away with so much that he probably thinks like there are no lines in his head and giggles to his wife. You know, like I think like, you know how we are, we're out our friends, like there's shit that we'll say around our friends. We would never fucking say on steam. Right, right. You know what I, I call it house humor, what I meant like I am not racist at all, but I'll say the most horrible racist or homophobic things to make my friend laugh. And I like how he is in his hand and I think that's what it was. Yeah. And I think because he has no lines on his act, his act has gotten dirtier and dirtier over the years, you know? And he's just good people love it.

Speaker 3:          01:42:25       And he's given this excuse to kind of push it and push it. It's chaos. And that's why he's so popular. And that's why people love him is because he's also playing that character on 30 rock words. It's basically, yeah, it's an exaggerated version of him. Kim, like mixed with Martin Lawrence like crazy. This was just a hateful misstep and that's where the issue lies. And I feel bad. Yeah. So I mean there's some, there's certain things that I say ridiculous shit. Sometimes, but I would never say anything like that. Even even in my most racist joke when no one else is around, how Schumer type situation wouldn't say that I was on this truck stop too close to that as bad as or flag just to make my wife laugh or make one of my, whoever's going to get you know back then or you know, he's in a lot of trouble.

Speaker 3:          01:43:14       They're going crazy. They're going crazy after him. Yeah. It's fascinating. It's fascinating to watch people get upset. Do they want to fire out? Yeah, man. It's stand up though and yeah, it's a bad joke. It's not funny. Yeah. He apologized. Look, I think, you know he's going to have to leave. Evaluate second. He said it. He probably went, Oh God. You know I've definitely done that. Where I take a joke the wrong way. Like you were talking. I'm, most of my stuff is written, but every once in a while I will go out on a river, you know, just riffing and Oh, I've taken some terrible rifts that cause the rest of the night I'll like, think of it what I sent them while you're driving home and like, just shit. Fuck did I say that? Because you just, you know, you don't know. Every now and then you take a chance and something crazy will come out and you're like, Whoa, this is a new bit.

Speaker 3:          01:44:01       And then it'll become seniors to write it down and then you'll start doing it and you'll do it on a regular basis. I have a lot of my bits, you know, that a lot of my bits are something that I said on spur of the moment on stage and the next thing you know, expand on it. But every now and then you go down a dark road and it's so different from the Michael Richards thing. I know people were bringing it up, but Michael Richards isn't a standup and it was, he was not good at that. That's why he had that meltdown. He had fucking no business being at the laugh factory on a Friday night or whatever. Right. You know, in the middle of a pack show. Yeah. He was basically an open miker who was a TV star and a lot of people didn't know that.

Speaker 3:          01:44:36       A lot of people assume that he had a background in stand up, but like do you ever seen him do standup? He was a software guy. You were there while he was at the comedy store first and then he went right over to, uh, down the street to the laptop and I saw some of these stories and ate at the comedy store. And I mean, honestly, I thought he was fucked up out of his mind on something that I thought he was coked up. Yeah. You and big called Brent. Yeah. Joe, that night he called me and then Brent Ernst came back. We went to the comedy store. I missed him. My spot was on after him, so I came to the comedy store and then Brent earns, came over from the comedy store and said, dude, I just saw the craziest fucking shit ever. He goes, I just saw Michael Richards have a meltdown and yell at people and call them niggers in the audience.

Speaker 3:          01:45:15       So he was at that, he was there and we were like, get the fuck out of here. But I thought that would be the end of it because I mean, we've heard a million crazy stories. I mean I've seen how many times you've seen Joey Diaz whip his dick out at the comedy store already or girls put cell phone, pulled her assets hallsband back in the day and store. Brian holds a con the first second go credit and having to dig himself out of that hole. I started Saturday night by the way. Still got it. That dude is, yeah, I saw him Saturday. Oh, flaring Connie. He's an an uncharted treasure. Yeah. Why do people have known about him? They, I don't know how to get him on the podcast. I would love to have on the podcast, you know he's like a meter maid, is he?

Speaker 3:          01:45:53       Yeah, he's like a meter maid slash dog catcher. Yeah. Yeah. He's like a dog catcher slash meter maid in Manhattan beach. He's, this is a joke I always quote. He goes, uh, students that Susan Smith, she drowned her kids. I heard those are bad kids. I heard this sat that close to the TV. They didn't put the blocks away. Those kids will not be missed. And we were sitting the back of the room and this was like the day after she got fucking caught drowning your kids. The first joke, I saw him dues in San Francisco. Egos like woke up this morning with a hairless Filipino boy up my ass. I, uh, pulled him out. I Fed them breakfast, set him on his way to the back of the room. Good. Who the fuck is this guy or lady him? Him and Brody Stevens. There's this, these characters that really go, aren't they characters or are they getting say is a little insane. And Brian's a little insane too. They're both of them saying, but that's why they're good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:46:49       I don't think you get good at comedy unless you're not at least a little crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:46:53       I was telling Brody, I saw Bernie also at the same night. I was like, I wanted to do a sitcom with you, Brody and Holtzmann and then you guys have a dog. But it's like three's company. You're not allowed to have the dogs when they were landlords home. You have to dress the dog up as a PR person. Why isn't that on it?

Speaker 1:          01:47:10       How high were you when you came over to this totally works. We'll go pitch that to the network is actually trying to get a show going for Brody cause he's realized that people need to see Brody. What kind of show shark tank he's been pitching around. Brian tried to do a podcast with him but apparently it was just a disaster. We talked about that at the, at the Improv I listened to about fun and the last time I got high in the Improv parking lot. Oh really? Probably haven't been back there in a while. So what a great club that is. I never realized how great the the Improv was cause I was always doing the comedy store. And then when my whole thing with the store went down and I started performing the Improv and like why everyone's so nice here. Such a nicer place.

Speaker 1:          01:47:49       Just such a bunch better club. Are you around this weekend? This weekend? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's brand per se and friends. Oh really? Friday and Saturday. So yeah. You should come by fucking sound by, yeah, this is one of my first weekends home for awhile. Uh, definitely one of the nights I'll talk to you. I'll call you. Yeah. Yeah. Well we're going out. Um, another thing that I saw that I wanted to talk about before I forget is that I watch a fucking, somebody sent me something about animals killing animals, which is my Twitter feed is a fascinating now because I keep retweeting fascinating things and then tweeting fascinating things. Like I'll read some science journal about black holes or my large Hadron collider type shit. And so every day people start tweeting me these weird fucking links and this guy tweeted me some shit about animals.

Speaker 1:          01:48:32       They get fucked up by like little cute animals, like animals that you wouldn't think would be bad asses. And one of them is the fucking bull frog. Tude bull frog. Yeah. Yeah. Really? Oh my God. You got to watch this video, man. I wanna. I want to fire up. Fire up this video, Brian. It's called bull frogs. Eat everything you got. You got to see this because it's going to fucking, they eat scorpions. They eat the poisonous snakes. They mice, they fly through the air and catch birds. They can jump like a motherfucker had no idea. I had no idea either. They have the crazy tongues. They have the Thomas, they have this giant mouth. It's bigger than their whole head. Right out of their mouth. Opens up a dumpster fucking kill bird to, there's a fucking video of it, man. I want you to watch this cause it's so trippy. We'll end with this and I just want to get to your point. What was that dirty or commercials? Commercials on these fucking videos. So, um, yeah, this bird, the terrain. Angela's Scorpions. I don't know why they don't die from these things, but they fucking, they also eat bull frogs. Date smaller bowls. The frogs. Yes. Check this shit out. You're going to freak out. Turn it up. Frogs are just a

Speaker 5:          01:49:47       selective eaters. Feasting only on flies and that's what I always thought it was. Just flies. Yeah. Rock. For example, spiders, snakes, fish, and just about him. Should I fucking mouse a mouse in his mouth? That's insane. But how do they manage to be such eating machines?

Speaker 5:          01:50:24       Dave, the Smith Center of using cross don't have big claws, sharp beaks or fangs, giant houses that what have you overcome? Pinchers poisons and spicy stingers. Great outdoors. How fucking crazy that he's just jack the score piano look up. Biggest Mount, but God, is he using his hands to put yes. Yes. Yes. Watch him. Jack does transfer. They've been known to swim 20 feet to shore and additional 20 feet. Rapamycin or were they always like this or these Newton bullfrog oh shit we're putting in. It's Rocketdyne. Yeah. Oh God. That had been known to stop and it's like a lion on the proud. Oh my God. When? How fucking crazy is that? I love for using their hands like that. Yeah. Really Weird. Don't even eat each other. Why not? Small Bull Frog? That doesn't watch it step easily. Look how big this bull frog eating. Yes, they are quite cannibalistic young. Both heart muscle quickly learn one simple, oh no, eat whatever we had once. Oh Jesus. That's like you eating a 10 year old in one bite. I mean you see how fucking big den is. How crazy is that in and out? It's closed.

Speaker 4:          01:52:02       Are you stat? I used to be in frog jumping contest as a kid. I was first place. It was the first time I ever was on TV. What does that even mean? We used to have, yeah, jumping frogs from Ohio. There's not much in Ohio. I said we get have fraud contest where you raced frogs against each other and I won like first place one year and stuff like that. But I used to have buckets. You're on frog. Yeah. I used to have tons of frogs and I would like train them and and do all this crazy shit but those motherfuckers are crazy. We had, I had this one frog that would have these crazy suction cup things on his hands and he could just jump onto like a window and then like it was, I think it was a toad maybe, but it would jump all over it and it just climbed it all over the house. It was, frogs are amazing. I love, I'm a big fan of frogs and one sec.

Speaker 1:          01:52:47       That's going to be a quote online somewhere now. That's fucking crazy. I've never seen that. There is so bizarre. It's just, if they were big, like I say about everything, if there are big, we'd be freaking out. You know? If there were a size of horses, you know, could you imagine how terrifying the world would be? A frogs were as big as horses. You know, they're, they're creepy at monsters. They're just little. So we're lucky. I think we're some genetic mutation away from that. Just like one step away from having prophecy type animals. Do you ever see that movie the prophecy? I remember that bear pig, whatever at the end, whatever the fuck it was. Well, why not, man? I mean, they're, they're, they're so close to doing all sorts of crazy genetic engineering. I mean, they've developed cows that develop a, that make human breast milk.

Speaker 1:          01:53:30       Now they're genetically engineered the identical breast milk, human breast milk, super injudicious friends, fringe, fringe. Now I heard it's good. Yeah, you might like it because it's about that. It's about us being like close to, you know, like this other world, you know. Well, we were, uh, Brian and I were talking about this before the show started, the, uh, the movie transcendent man. Have you seen that yet? No. It's Ray Kurzweil who is a guy who's a new, another name. He's a futurist and he's a proponent of technological singularity. And you've been talking about him online, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's, he's very popular. He's got a bunch of books called, one of them is the singularity is near, which is a fucking fascinating one. And his, his big thing is all about artificial intelligence. And, uh, but his documentary, he thinks the robots are gonna take over or are they all do, it's not just, yeah, it's not one person that thinks to us.

Speaker 1:          01:54:21       It's pretty much every single person that is involved in artificial intelligence, whether they call them our deluxe one guy calls it artilects artificial intellects. What was the company called? The terminator. Skynet. Isn't there actually a real company now called square? It's called Google. Yeah, we know. But you don't remember like an eye robot now. There actually is a company called I robot. Like that just seems like you're fucking tempting fate when you like take some horrible thing from Psi Phi and then make it real. It's like, what are you thinking? It's like actually opening a Jurassic Park and calling it Jurassic Park. What Brian went bad is gonna happen. We'll read the book. You know what Brian and I were talking about before the show was that this is all happening while we're just sitting here relaxing as if there's no consequences whatsoever. Like there's no meetings going on.

Speaker 1:          01:55:06       When, when the first artificial intelligence, which is conceivably one of the biggest things to ever happen to humans, the first sentience, artificial intelligent life, it will be switched on without any calls to the heads of nations without any vote from the people that, I mean it's one of the biggest consequences. Maybe the human race will ever face the idea that something is going to be not just more intelligent than us, but literally within days it will be millions of times more intelligence and asking, cause it will be artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence and sentience. So it will be conscious, it will be aware and it will be physically capable of creating

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       better artificial intelligence. So right away it will fix all the problems that it has in its operating system. All the problems it has. And you know, whenever problems it has with processors, I mean we, we will literally within a year we'll be obsolete, will be just like little monkeys that are at the zoo. I welcome the robot leaders and I'm just going to be really nice to them from that during the robots house. I don't care. You're dead there. You're the first guy that are coming to your house first there. They're familiar blow jobs. They want, they want that. Trust me. We're going to be like, how are we going to help them see level comedian to suck their dick? Is that possible? Yes. That can save you suck the robot cats. We can be cats for the robots. Be as bad as the regular Dick.

Speaker 3:          01:56:29       Yeah. Shiny, rusty, cold metal. You can clean it really well. You know for sure it's clean. Take off the plastic first. Lysol, spray it down. You know what you're getting into. It's inevitable though. Don't make him wear a condom. Prostitutes. I've heard prostitutes make you wear a condom. I think when you get a blowjob, something I just read. Let's read here. If it does happen, it's going to change the whole world and it's probably going to happen and everyone's just sitting back like it's never going to happen. I think it's gonna be great. I think everyone's just looking at the negative part of it. Okay. What's the positive? The positive is that robots are going to come. Our friends or lovers, they're going to make better lovers. Fuck, are you doing fine? Trust me, we're, we're fucking her lover. The fleshlight had had physician soft close. This is the song you're going to concoct robot song could take our, don't feel like we're super close to it going south and like we're going to see it. Yeah, we're going to see him

Speaker 2:          01:57:29       miss [inaudible] the whole civilization, you know

Speaker 3:          01:57:32       down shit. Her Shit is happy. It we could see we were, we were definitely at the apex of where there's, there's some sort of an event that's building up to take place and I don't know how much longer we can continue to progress until that event comes. Like, what do you feel about when that rapture guy a couple months ago or was it last month? I just had a stroke. Did he just had a stroke yesterday kind of or a couple of days ago. It was just kind of funny. Was there a part of you going

Speaker 2:          01:57:58       right, right. You know, like I've been going crazy. You know, like all the shit that happened on an years where a fish falling from the sky and all these dead things all around the country and then the big quakes and then the fucking Japan and you know, and New Zealand crazy tornadoes, tornadoes, like they have a good marketer. You know, like when I was in high school, you know, I grew up on metal and, and uh, I was a Christian kid too. And uh, and so I was raised, uh, you know, uh, being aware of the Armageddon and the rapture and all that stuff. And I never felt like we were close. Like that always felt like far away but, but things now, you know, where, you know, basically, you know, they, they picture like the Sodom and Gomorrah, like go to Vegas, you know, like

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       it's fucking about, you know, there is, if there is a vengeful God, he's looking at a Vegas, you know what I mean? Like I know it sounds crazy, but I know we're fucking close to that. I don't think Vegas is the issue of Vegas. Human depravity exists now. That didn't exist in 1984 when I read those things, you know, where things weren't that bad. And when you're, when you're talking about Sodom and Gomorrah, you need to go biblical scripture and all that stuff that said, that's nothing compared to what's going on in Afghanistan or I write or the millions of innocent people that died because of the bombings and all the other bullshit that's happened that, but there were tiny but, but you, you kind of see when a crazy Christian pulls that kind of stuff, you're like, sure, I sort of get where he's coming. Well there's you, there's clearly an argument that can be made that things are accelerating.

Speaker 1:          01:59:30       Yeah. No, I mean tornadoes, we've never had this many tornadoes before and would never, I don't remember ever seen a tornado that destroyed three quarters of a town before the Joplin Missouri town. Yeah. I mean in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, I believe it was too fucking like in a matter of seconds. And you're talking about things that are like a mile wide and wider and they just destroying everything in their path. I mean if there's, I don't remember that before and then the numbers are higher than ever, but you know what, we're dealing with such a limited amount of years that we have a database on as far as like my courtroom recording, uh, weather and you know, we know that things change radically. We know that, you know, the ice ages come and go and we know that, you know, a bunch of Shit's happened that over the, over the course of a, there's been like six major extinction events that have happened over the course of the earth life.

Speaker 1:          02:00:14       So I don't think we have a full handle on right. But I think unquestionably the scariest thing to me or the most profound thing to me is what humans are doing is not just what the earth is doing because even though all those things happened, the earthquake in Japan and the tsunami and the tornadoes and all that stuff right here where you and I are, nothing's happened. You know what I'm saying? But we're technology is developing, developing and growing. That's still going on while all these events are taking place. The large Hadron collider is still going off. Why all this shit is going down. All the different experiments that are happening in robotics and artificial intelligence and nano technology and genetic engineering, those are all still constantly taking place and constantly moving further and further and they're going to go somewhere. They're never going to end.

Speaker 1:          02:00:55       It's never going to stop. They have, they didn't stop with the atomic bomb. They didn't stop with mapping out the human genome. They're not stopping with anything. Yeah, so it's kind of like up in the air like are we going to have a biblical apocalypse or assign a Saifai apocalypse? I'm leaning towards Scifi, but then you look at something like the salt and sea thing that I was talking about. I mean fuck man, the apocalypse, hit salt and see if that was the only world that we lived in. If that was our only water and this was the only tribe of people of Earth, was there a little small place. It was only like a few hundred miles in diameter. Fuck man. That would be the apocalypse. They're going, we would be dead. There'd be no water. It would be all poisoned. I mean, that's the end in that spot, the apocalypse hit.

Speaker 1:          02:01:33       And that's, I think what the apocalypse really is. When people wrote the Bible, theoretically, at least they didn't have mass communication, they didn't have the ability to send emails. So the apocalypse was what experience, what they experienced in their area. Yeah. So Atlantis, that was the apocalypse for them. You know, anything that that took place that was, that was real, that was the for them. But meanwhile, on the other side of the world in New Zealand, people were eating coconuts and partying and getting their dick sucked and there was nothing, there was nothing. There's no, nothing going wrong there. So I think so in that sense, the apocalypse is here, it's happened. It's just not right here. Right. You know, and it may not ever get here. It might, it might rotate, it might move around. It might be cyclical. Just like everything else. There might be places that are good at places that are bad.

Speaker 1:          02:02:17       Tell yourself when you have a young kid too. That's true too. You start telling yourself all kinds of weird shit with young kids. You feel that? Yeah, for sure. You feel like much more protective of things. Holy Shit. Worried about your own mortality, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Worried about living in a big earthquake tidal wave that's going to get it. Hopefully were nine at comic book shopper in like a grocery store instead. We have to my first, after the first baby. That's the reason why we decided to move to Colorado or so. I wanted to let go. Why don't go where there's less people, people, things are more relaxed and you know, everything's like a little more chill or just a little bit more outside so that when Shit, if shit does happen that we're not stuck in this impossible. The headstart city to get out.

Speaker 1:          02:02:54       Yeah. You want to be in the valley when you want to get on the freeway and being stuck on the other side of that. Well that's also one of the reasons why I moved out here. When I first moved to Hollywood, I lived in North Hollywood and my car got broken into and they stole my radio. And then I lived in Encino for a little bit and uh, um, my yard got broken into and then I'm, and I started slowly moving further if those ones, I had frank the pitbulls and somebody broke in the yard and the dogs are there and they fucking ran out. But then I had, I think it was my gardener, I think my gardener was setting me up. Really? Yeah, he's was asking me weird questions. One day. It was really creepy. I got a new dog and my gardener goes, it was the way he asked me.

Speaker 1:          02:03:30       He goes, uh, he goes, uh, is that you're gone, your dog or your girlfriend's dog? I go, what girlfriend? Man? I go, what are you talking about? He goes, do you live alone? I go, what the fuck kind of question is that man. And so I asked him flat out, I go, you're trying to find out when I'm home, dude. I need that. No Man, no man. It was like this weird answer that he had to it, but I was like, the way you asked me was just so, it was like like a really clumsy guy trying to trick you like yeah, it was like I could tell that he was like prying for information and I wasn't famous or anything. You know? I need to get some bull frogs, Joe. I know. Right. Giant ones to protect my property and get them mixed up games with a bull bullfrog so then I slowly moved further and further out and I'm going to move further out still.

Speaker 1:          02:04:09       If I stay in California, I'm going to get a place in big bear. I think. I'm just thinking about that lately. Have you done any at all? Yeah, man. There's too many people down there that's just like this. This we were talking about with the monster faces, the Newport beach, you know those areas. I like San Diego, but dude, if the shit goes down and then everybody abandons the border there by a bunch of reactors down there too. Yes, exactly. For these places we're going to get hit if we ever get into a war with somebody. True. And if we get a hit by an earthquake and those reactors go nutty, then the shit goes down and everybody abandons that area. And guess what? That's when you're really fucked because Mexico's right there. And if the door to Mexico just comes down and there's a nuclear apocalypse all in the same area. Fuck. But we also have the bit of the biggest military bases down there. Yeah, Dude. Do you think they're going to stick there when there's a nuclear meltdown? Listen man, protecting our borders, they're going to be protecting from the air in led frisbees and there'll be dropping bombs on people running with bags of groceries from Vons. La Jolla will be green. You'll be able to see it from space. It'll be glowing.

Speaker 3:          02:05:16       Get a Zombie apocalypse or an alien apocalypse. The fun kind. Yeah, I went alien. Yeah. I have a feeling that we all unite together like all our enemies.

Speaker 1:          02:05:27       It feels to me that it's too easy with my Persian neighbor, you know, fighting off floating a psalmist like will Smith movie. Yeah, yeah, sure. I think that, uh, the, the idea of alien life, like some sort of a physical alien life, it's so hokey and so that to me it just seems like that's not going to be the way it happens. I mean, I might be wrong, but I think that the idea of some physical thing that comes here and starts walking amongst us and shoot and ray guns, I'm like, that's like some 1950s a super eight is right.

Speaker 3:          02:05:55       Yeah. Kind of. I don't want to give it away, but yeah. Robots, I think I can see that. I can see c three Po, some shit like that from another land that's going to be the last guy on the planet. Well that's why Battlestar Galactica was so fucking bad ass.

Speaker 1:          02:06:08       That was it. Did you ever get into that? The series a remake, the fucking bad ass people don't know if you've never seen him go get the DVD.

There's different forms of cylons. There was the one that looked like humans and you could and people fell in love with them or were fucking him and shit.
