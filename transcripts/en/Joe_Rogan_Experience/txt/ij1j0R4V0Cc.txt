Speaker 1:          00:00:11       It should be actually happening. It says live and recording, but I'm a fucking idiot.

Speaker 2:          00:00:16       So I dunno if that's true. If this is all badly as a gentlemen, I did not plan this out this well and I'm trying to do this myself. Just me and my man Brian. But I really need my little buddy red van to help me out with the technical shit cause I don't know what the fuck is going on so I got to go online to see if it is actually online. No, I don't want to go social with your fucking Facebook. It seems like it's on.

Speaker 3:          00:00:42       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       we're on. We're live. Yes. Fantastic. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by on it.com on a.com has some, a, a bunch of new shit in a, first of all, the hemp protein powder, which is a sensational, very delicious. I use it daily. Is it? Yep. You protein proteins. The Shit. I got to give you some of this, a hemp for stuff. It's sweetened with Stevia and yeah, it's got raw cocoa in it. Not a good spokesman for protein powder. That's not like we're looking at Brian can I took a shower, eat you, what do you do? Do Dance? Do you dance in the rain dancer's physique? If, yeah, if you want to do I have protein powder. Brian Cowen, he's a dancer in the rain. That's the, that's the, that's a commercial for hemp protein powder. Me Dancing in the rain because I look good wet when rain pitter patter is off my body.

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       Have you ever tried battle ropes? Uh, you mean the roles? I have some in my house. I call him, you call him battle ropes. I call a Mussel ropes dude to throw the shit. That's the only thing. We just started selling them at Onnit. Uh, and that's, uh, one of the other items that people are good, so fucking expensive for rope. I'm telling you it's not all right. It's, it's as cheap as you can buy. You cannot buy battle ropes online cheaper than the ones that we're selling. Ropes are fucking expensive when you're getting 40 feet of giant thick ass rope that's not cheap and it comes out to be like 100 bucks or something like that. The same thing as Kettlebells, kettlebells that we're selling. They're not cheap, but here's the deal. First of all, they fucking will last you forever. You don't ever need other gym equipment.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       You needed a chin up bar and some fucking kettlebells bells. If you want to be in some badass shape, those kettle bells will last you for a lifetime, for a lifetime. You will be able to have, there's so many different exercises you can do with kettlebells. Just looking off of youtube, there's fucking hundreds of different things you can do. These canon balls with handles on them are the shit. They're fucking the most manly shit ever for working out. You feel like you're fucking like, you're some crazy Russian dude. The worse, the worst workout I ever did was I had to push a weighted sled, then do the battle ropes. Oh, I call him Mussel ropes and then do kettlebells. I, I've, you know, wrestling, all of it. I've never in my life Jujitsu, I've never, ever wanted to die. And it was, by the way, it was in a six and a half minute workout. Oh, here comes Brian. Almost nowhere online though. Six and a half months. Do this online. Alright. Hey, little fella. Oops. Here we go. Hey, little fella. We're on the air right now. Well, are sleeping. How dare you? I'm, I'm in a panic because I can't get, I guess it doesn't matter, but I can't get that dissolve thing to work where you can't see the text at the bottom of the screen.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       Yeah. You know how you can make the text fade out? How do I do that? Should I sing background music while he did his? Yeah, his name. Okay. Right. Click on the scene that you're on. Okay. Edit shot long eyelashes. It's a really nice contrast. He's got a wide face, not black shale, so on and, but he's got, see, I don't see that. That's where it's confusing. It's just too, he's, no, I have, it's just you. I was trying to put Brian's name up because it's your name on it. He's got shoulders for days and a really wide shoulders is that are really low. So what should I do? The last one is Christina Ppas. It's gain. It's got like a names on it. Oh, the last seat on the far right, Nia. That one's just me now.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       Back and forth from Brian to me. Oh, be sac. Sac. Thank you for bearing with us in this technical break. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to keep singing the song about Joe Rogan. He's kind of well, okay, well we'll have to deal with this. So the, um, the text, there's no way to get rid of that text on the screen. He's got a lie back and he's really flexible. It name is Joe Rogan. He's got a wide neck wad, faith and a short neck. See, I don't see that though. When I'm trying to do that. I can't, it's not letting me do that means he can absorb punches really well. Should have been a fighter buddies. Jason, gentleman harm this is boring as fuck. I'm sure it shows logic, camera logic, camera built in eyesight. Those are the options. I'm thinking. Background music did builtin input. Uh, it shouldn't be anything on, it should have been a gymnast. He should have been. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, dude. We're going to have to have you, uh, get an a, this is a good job security for you.

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       The whole show goes to shit without redband. Okay. All right. Well now for some reason it says Eddie Bravo. I must have changed it. I don't mind being Eddie Bravo. Okay. This is Eddie Bravo. Now they used to, well, we'll just give him plugs to our friends. I'll be at the American comedy. Oh yeah. Let me check this Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Everybody, uh, the American comedy shows your mother flusters yeah, I should turn up my volume. Are you, what is he talking about? I'm just giving, I'm just, uh, I'm talking to Brian Cowen. He's talking on the podcast. The same songs about, you name is Jill rogue and he's got a wide band. Just trying to see if this thing is actually online. It's kind of long eyelashes and he's really flexible. He can do impressions. Nobody knows that. Here's Joe Rogan. He's really muscular. Got a wide face wide phase Santa Short neck, which means he can take a punch to his fucking knows better than you can. His name is Joe Rogan. Joe Rogan.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       Joe Rogan. I'm trying to come up with other words. Oh yeah. Okay. It's working. It's working. Right. I'll see you tomorrow, Jamie. Kilstein later. Bye. Let me, can I plug my a Gig this weekend? Oh Dude, for we're going to plug the shit out of your Gig this weekend. Let's not do it here because this is a only the commercial. Let's do it. A link to the podcast. We're going to plug the fuck out of you, son. Ladies and gentlemen, the Joe Rogan podcast. What is it called? The experience? Something like that. No. What the fuck this is? It's just, it's why label it. Do I have to label? Maybe when I'm going to not nit label them anymore. I'm going to stop calling it the Joe Rogan experience, but when I call my podcast, the man thoughts, the problem, if you don't label it, you can't sell tee shirts.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       Well, you got to make it bumper stick money, dog. You ain't got no label. The label don't take man thoughts. That's mine, right man. I like it. It sounds powerful. I'm calling from Bryan County, showed up to, man, you should be you doing fucking battle ropes. That should be like your avatar. Exactly. Just you with battle ropes. Dude, look at that. Swinging him around. He played golf or watch Conan the barbarian people were calling you d hired Jay Joe Rogan, because we pranked without sound on a 10 minute podcast. He goes, he goes, that's my pockets by the way. And he goes, um, he goes, uh, you're, you're like Joe Rogan before you add the water. We di we fucked around with the crowd. You could watch the video of it. I actually put the video of it on Youtube. Oh yeah, it was great. Well, yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll talk about that when we're done with this commercial A. Anyway, go, go to [inaudible] dot com check out the kettle bells. Check out the battle ropes, the new hemp protein, pouty, pouty. What does that kind of a spokesman or like Jesus Christ. I haven't had my Alpha Brain and gentlemen. I have it right now. I take them right before I do the show. I don't even know if it helps. Well, you know what, at least you, you do your own products, you use kettlebells, Mussel ropes, and you take your own product. So here, here,

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       yeah, there are those gentlemen, dude, I'd take it because it's awesome. If they didn't, if, if they weren't my own product that's still taking, I'm addicted to it. So is, uh, Lorenzo Fertitta owner, the UFC. He's addicted to this shit. Every time he sees me he goes, dude, it's fucking Alpha brains. Incredible. Because when you fly around a lot, why aren't things are happening? I'm picking right now. How many did you take for God's for I'm a savage here. An extremist. I am a little bit right. It might be a little crazy. You're my canary in the coal mine. Everything you do, I'm always like, is it safe podcasts? Is it safe? I'll do it now. Stand up. I guess I'll try. I'll do it again. We'll talk about this later. This is a fucking commercial, Brian Calendar. Sorry. Sorry. It's for God damn on a.com. That's o.

Speaker 4:          00:09:41       N. N. I. T. Um, and what is Alpha brain that I just took? It's, it's a, it's a competent Tori sort of a supplement. It's all a bunch of different nootropics. And what nootropics are is nutrients that have been shown to have a positive effect on brain function. And you can take gold on at.com and there is a plethora of information on the subject and look at Google too cause it's a controversial subject and you know, some people are not into it and you know, they don't want, they don't want to believe that supplements can help them. And that's fine. I'm not, I am not pushing it on anybody that's not interested. But if you're a person that does supplement your vitamins into your person like me, who absolutely knows that it affects your health, it does. I sometimes don't get enough nutrients from my food. You know, in a perfect world we would all be eating mineral rich vegetables and a, we would all be getting the perfect amount of water and we would all be having, you know, the best food ever and grass fed diet.

Speaker 4:          00:10:36       But the reality is it doesn't always fucking work out that way. And a lot of things get affected by not supplementing. Uh, I think, uh, I have, uh, it is most certainly enhance my health and the supplements that have been most interested in are nootropics and this along with a neuro one, which is Bill Roman House keys formula. That was the one I first discovered, Dell Rom asking Greg Gray middle linebacker. He had problems with concussions and he developed these, uh, this, this series of supplements to aid himself. Like it was his idea to eight himself and I took a shit because a no name. It was a radio DJ, uh, in San Francisco a few years back. He was raving about this guy and the formula was pretty, pretty interesting. Here's a little caffeine in it, I believe. Um, which I didn't want in, in Alpha brain. You know, I think caffeine is something that's kind of tricky.

Speaker 4:          00:11:24       It, it absolutely can help your brain function, but I don't think it should be in anything unless it's obvious. You know what I mean? Like caffeine I think should be in coffee. Caffeine should be an energy drink to take something with a lot of caffeine. And feel like, wow, this is what's working, but you fuck up and you don't read the label and you take it while you're taking coffee and you have a goddamn heart attack that, Whoa, that was what the Fed did. Yeah. Right. A lot of those people that are on diet pills. Yeah. All this stuff that we were, we're talking about here at folks. It's all vitamins. It's nothing that you have to worry about. Nothing that's dangerous. And the thing was on it is we want to make sure that nobody ever feels ripped off. So your first 30 pills, it's a hundred percent money back guarantee.

Speaker 4:          00:11:59       You don't even have to return the product. That's how confident we are of the product and we know that you're gonna enjoy it. And two, how the ethics of this company is, nobody wants anybody to feel ripped off. We want to sell you the best shit that we can find, the best supplements as far as health and athletic performance and the best nutrients we can find, the best late lifting equipment that we can find. We use Troy kettlebells. They're the best in the world. They're perfect. The, you can't get anything better. They're the highest quality available. They will fucking last through the apocalypse. You buy those bitches, you're done. You're done. You have them forever. They will never wear out their cast iron. Fucking cannonballs awesome. So this stuff is not cheap. Um, but we're selling it at the most reasonable rate that we can and we're trying to provide everybody with the best possible products that we can. That's the ethics of on it. And that's what we're all about. Um, and if you use a code name, Rogan, you will save 10% off all supplements. All right. You dirty freaks. Brian counts here and I don't know how to turn it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:02       Musica heavy guitars and wind blowing my hair back. It's the fucking park. It's the Brian Collins on the podcast with Joel Role Gum. That was the, that was a very interesting way to answer right there. Yeah. That was like a brainiac. It's like a gay Kenyan dance. I'm bringing, I'm bringing back some shift from like the 70 [inaudible] if you cook, if you cook and cast iron and it's an excellent way of getting iron in your diet, which I didn't know. Yes, yes. They say stakes in cast iron, like you're seriously fast, too much Ferris oxide and your diet and you have to be careful. So Tim Ferriss says in his book that a lot of these guys will like actually take a day and eat no iron to yes to bring their iron levels down. So there it is. See Ferris is fascinating. We've been going back and forth. He's going to come back on the podcast again.

Speaker 1:          00:13:52       Well let's do it. Let's look it up. He's a great guy. I got to get him on cause I had a conversation with them after I read his book and I loved him and it, he just knows so much. Yeah, he's apparently got a lot of stuff cooking and he's in the middle of writing a book as well. But uh, man, I love talking to him. I just love talking to do's done that are just filled with information like him. Rob Wolf, the Paleo solution author. What was that like? Fucking great. You know, because I'm reading the guys filled with information. It's controversial. Well, but I just, I just read the China study I talked to you about it, which is about, he's a very, very credible science and he looks at a lot of science says whole food plant based whole food diet is the best way to go.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       Problem is that I think like we talked about, if you're doing sports and lifting personally, I went, I went like about a week eating just whole food, plant based Diet. I eat a steak. The other day I wolfed it down. I inhaled it. I, it was literally like, I was like, oh, I made and I've never felt better. I mean, I just need some meat sometimes. Don't think that you can have the same diet for every person. Right? I don't think, I don't think everybody needs, I don't know why it needs a stake. There's a lot of chicks out there that don't need a stay. They really don't. There's a lot of dudes don't need to stay. Jamie kills teens coming on the podcast tomorrow. He's a Vegan, he's healthy, he's happy, and he loves it. It's real fitness. He does always constantly doing martial arts, Jujitsu and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       And he's a Vegan, weighs eight pounds, but he's a Vegan. I'm not kidding. He weighs eight pounds. I always look at it. I always like, you can't find too many Olympic athletes who are vegans. Well, Mac Dansik, who's also going to do the podcast, we, we're going back and forth. I love that dude. He's a really, really interesting guy. He's a UFC fighter who's a Vegan and he's also a photographer and a, you know, it works. His, his reasons are that he loves animals. You know, that's it. And I respect that as well. Look, I, uh, I love animals too, but there's a cycle of life and I think factory farming is horrific, but I think wild game, I think that's where it's at. I think in a perfect world, we would buy meat from hunters and that would be a new fucking industry. We'd have to make sure that people were at poaching, buy meat from hunters.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       I think she'd be able to hunt a lot of them because deer are fucking everywhere. The idea that there's a, they're glorify cows too and we could grow more of them too by the way. We can grow more of them, but my point is when they're wild and they're running around and then you just hunt them and killed them. The, I think first of all that it's the whole thing is way more humane because they live the real life. They lived a real life. That is, no, the deer's never lived a better life. They have one life that life forge for food, stay alive if you do that, you've won. They're also, by the way, they're also, they are food in the wild and one of the things that are, that's why they're there. What are they? Joseph Campbell. All I said that one of the, one of the problems with my original, the original sort of peoples in their mythology was that date they would look around in nature and realize it life eight life.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       And if you look at a lot of like, uh, whether it's native Americans or whatever, the tradition of killing animals, they were always fairly, most cultures were always fairly very uneasy with killing an animal, which is why when you killed an animal, there was a ritual around that. There was usually prayer said there were rituals because human beings, we're like, they felt the connection. Yeah, we're taking it were to end when you actually have to kill something with a spear or a bow and Arrow or a knife and you feel its heartbeat and you smell that animal and that's, that's very intimate and it's very, it's physically intimate. It's very, and almost all, almost all original or aboriginal cultures had all of that I can think of had a sort of a ritual around that. They would say prayers. They do all kinds of things because it makes sense.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       What we've become is so removed from our food. We're so removed with factory farming and things, it feeds a lot of people, gets a lot of protein and people, people don't go hungry anymore. I always remind people 30 years, 30 years ago, I mean half of half of India, China went through major famines, uh, and certainly most of Africa. But now that's, that's becoming more and more a relic of the past. It's because we've become very efficient at getting food to a maximum number of people. But there's, there's a huge disconnection. Yeah. So when you eat a pig, when you eat bacon that's been in an a gestation crate, you know, and goes crazy cause it's chewing on the bars. You're not really thinking about it, man. I'm just, I'm just hungry. You're not thinking it's a pig. You're thinking it's just a piece of Ham. We've actually given these really euphemistic names to, uh, meet.

Speaker 1:          00:18:07       Having said that. Yeah, it is. We, we, we do that beef ham, you know, you don't think of feel veal. If you ever go to a farm though and you were like playing around with the lambs and the goats and fucking, I mean and playing around them, but you start to, you get kind of, you, you realize, oh wow man, that thing is a living, breathing creature that is reacting to me and reacting to its environment. Lock this door. I forgot the lock. This door keep talking. Yeah. And it's, it's, it's a, it's an interesting thing you, if you talk to farmers who are round animals, they're there. They're very, very tuned and keyed into animals and nature on a way that most of us are not. They just have to be, they're very aware of the cycles are very aware of all the things.

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       You talked to dairy farmers, there was a mad cow scare and this, this woman was being interviewed because they had to kill all our cows in front of her. And then they had the burden, the cows that was, that was a government policy and Britain at the time, cause it's, you know, these premiums were very dangerous. So they took the, took out the whole heart and she was so devastated because she got to, she knows she knew her cows. She had every one of her cows. She knew how to its own personality, had its own name and she had her own relationship with it for me. I went to fucking cow really? And it was devastating for her. She was going to butcher those cows where they dairy cows? No, one of them had mad cow disease and they they in the law at the time, this is about 10 years ago, they had to put down the whole hurt.

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       Was she raising these cows for butchering? No, of the dairy. They were dairy cows and they were also there. I believe some of them were for butchering as well. But this was a dairy farm for the most part. So did they feed the cows? Fucked up things that they feed them like cow me. What the, apparently what happened with, with the development of these prions in the central nervous systems of cows. I'm not a scientist, but that from what I read, I remember you could eat a, if you had a cow that had mad cow disease, it wasn't eating the muscle meat that fucked you up. It was when you ate the brain. Yeah. The brain tissue, spinal cord. And they would ground that up into hot dogs and things like that. And you can take those prions, they're called preop I think. And you can heat them up to 500 degrees and they still don't die and you can still get the mad cow disease. So you can't, it's not the stairs. You can't stay more than a thousand degrees. It's crazy. And, and so, um, apparently that came from the fact that you had cows cannibalizing their own tissue because when you slaughter cows, there are certain parts I guess, that you don't necessarily need. You take 5% of that and you put it into the slop and they'll eat it. They were doing, I was chicken fucked up. It's become illegal now. What's fucked up about it as if they could do with pigs. That's okay. Pigs actually are omnivores, but you do it. Cows like

Speaker 5:          00:20:47       you're just jacking his whole system. Is that the reason you don't want an animal cannibalizing itself is because it, it, it leads to these really weird pathogens. These [inaudible] actually in the book of Leviticus, which regions are private, I think it's called preamps, but the, the, the, the book of Leviticus you were talking about in your show. The video is actually, um, a book in the Old Testament. That route goes into really stark detail about what you can eat and what you can't. And in, in the Old Testament, they always talk about the fact that you can't eat animals of prey. You can't eat a, so you can't eat a leopard or an Osprey, uh, an eagle, a hawk. Why? Because those animals eat other animal protein and you, you still don't find people eating leopard meat. Even in the mountain lions, I think actually bear and stuff like that.

Speaker 5:          00:21:37       But you wouldn't do it. There's a reason we don't, it's, it's a rarity. And we say, I think they do because for the most part, no culture is ever eaten the protein. I except for fish, but a lot of animals that eat other animals, apparently it's not. Apparently it's not healthy, but we kind of make sense if you think about it. Yeah. Well it's also, they're probably, they probably taste creepy. Yeah, I've heard, I've heard that when you eat bear meat until really oily, really like Gamion oily bears. Bears are mostly her before it's actually, unless you're talking about polar bears, which are complete and meat eaters. Yeah. We were actually just talking about this, about going hunting. We're saying that I didn't want, Steve Rinella asked me to go hunting with them to go bear hunting and I'm like, I don't want to kill a bear man.

Speaker 5:          00:22:18       I don't want to eat it. I don't want to have, if it's not something that I really want to eat, like I like venison. I'll kill a deer. Venison. I like die mouth waters. My Dad and I went to to uh, Alaska. Okay to go hunt bear. He goes, I want to hunt bear. I go, I'm not hunting bear. He goes, why not? I go, well, because I don't want to kill a bear. Oh, and by the way, either do you, somebody talked him into it. He goes, well I'm talking about guy. I go, well what do you do? He had already bought a rifle. That's how susceptible. He's like, the guy was like, well come by, I'll pile rifle. He bought like literally like a, like a $12,000 rifle. Some crazy with the scope and everything. So we go there and I go, I'll go to Alaska with you, but we'll go fishing.

Speaker 5:          00:22:54       He goes, I'll call you right back. Cause man, yeah, you're right. I don't want to kill a barrier. Let's go fishing. So he buys a crazy amount of fishing equipment. We go there. We didn't catch one fish, not one fucking fish. We're not fishermen. We lost all the lures. We literally lost all knew how to tie knots. I don't know how to do any of it. And it might say, just took chances. Like we went out there, we paid all this money for this guy. The guy who comes back, good knots, man, the guy, the guy comes back and he goes, we go, we don't have any more lures. And he goes, but you had all the thing. He goes, yeah, we lost him. He goes, what do you mean? We were casting over the lake into the trees. He literally goes like this. He goes, how'd you lose? All the Lords were like, oh, we never caught one fish. And then he'd say, he goes, I want to cite my rifle. This was, he brings his rifle, I want to cite it. So the former marine wants to sight his rifle. So he lies down and showing us how to shoot prong. Right. Problem. When you, when you're in the marines,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       you're shooting military weapons, they don't have the kind of recoil that a three 70 or whenever the fuck it was, I can kill an elk from half a mile away. So he's like, he's got his face right up against the scope and he's like, all right here. And I'm like, right behind him, right? And I'm like, all right, I'm going to shoot that log. I go do it. So I'm right behind him and I don't know if you've ever heard a fucking elephant gun go off when you're close to it. Oh, it was so loud that I Prac, I think I shat my pants a little bit, like a little duty, flatter mass. My face, the sound like hit where it was like a fire stick. I'm, and I was like [inaudible] he, so he goes to shoot and he goes, he shoots, I'm right behind him and it was so loud.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       I went, Jesus, he hit me. I fall back on my ass. He looks up, he's got this really deep around cut in his eye because the scope came back and hit him in the eye. So for the rest of the fuck that Alaska trip, we're walking around like a couple of losers don't stand next to me Bro. You look like such a fucking tourist. He has this huge around, is I like a half a raccoon? That is a lie. I don't know who that guy is. I know he looks like me, but he ain't my dad and I'm like, how are you supposed to shoot that through the scoby supposed to back way up. Yeah, you fuck, I don't know. I've to three 70 or whatever it, you just have to brace it. You've gotta to you've to brace it better. I shot at six times and I couldn't shoot it any more because I literally don't have the meat and my shoulder.

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       It hurt that bad. Jesus like the kick is that bad and one of the tricks you do, but when you don't have your plugs is keep your mouth open when you should've gotten that loud because it will cause the sound has somewhere to go steak rookies make as they keep their mouth closed. Really? I see you keep your mouth open and loose and I'm sorry life. We supposed to keep your mouth. That's I was told by the way, any soldiers out there, I don't know, maybe I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, but that's what the guy told me. This guy named Swede and he said, keep your mouth open. That's how you do it. Cause he was shooting no problem. I was like, doesn't that hurt it? The sound was so loud. It hurt my face for getting my ears. It's crazy to take it to like a level like that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:37       It's like the, they get guns to the point where you get to like the 50 caliber, right? Like what are you doing? What do you do? I'll do, what the hell are you doing? I want to kill something from a mile away. It's anymore. This isn't like a, I mean that's like some army shit. Like why? Why is a regular person buying so army shit. That's when you get a, when you get one of those high powered, the hunting rifles, it's to kill an elk. Do you think half a mile away, you know with this a raging gun control debate in this country, do you think that there's any, there's any possible way you could make this a safe world? Here's why. Here's what I always say about gun control is what I talk about with my standup. Speaking of which, I'll be at the American comedy club this weekend, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

Speaker 1:          00:26:20       That's down in San Diego. San Diego, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. That's right. Shit, I can't win. [inaudible] club by the way. We did a desk quad show there. We had a fucking great time and we did a weekend. We did two shows and doing all new stuff. I'm excited about my new hour, but, but one of the things I always say, my stance, what, what was the thing I was talking about with, with gun control is gun control in this country in my opinion, will never work in, in, in terms of what people are calling for it. Because I think that men like their guns, not because they're shiny and they go boom. I actually really believe most men own guns because it's the, it's, it's for them. It's certainly for me, a feeling that at least I can protect my family. If the shit hits the fan because a golf club or a sharp stick ain't gonna do it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:04       I want an arsenal in case, and I think most men go when a politician says, and they have good points, but if a politician says, we want to take your gun away, Americans in particular go, I don't fucking item that because you're not going to be there when somebody tries to break in my house at four in the morning, I could call nine one one but the feeling of a phone in my hand versus my Mazda 20 gauge, you know, pump action, shotgun feels a lot better to me. The real problem is that guns are out there. That's the real problem. Guys didn't exist. Then you have an ego and be a different issue. But here's where the debate actually lies for me after this terrible tragedy with the Batman thing, I do think, and the Nri Ras, from what I can understand, isn't that cooperative with us.

Speaker 1:          00:27:45       I do think there's a debate to be had about the lethality of weapons. Do you need a drum that holds a hundred rounds? I don't think so. Do you need a fucking elephant coming? Right? I don't think that you necessarily need an assault weapon that goes through a car engine or goes through a building. But you know what, all the law abiding people out there, like my friend Anthony [inaudible] from the opiate Anthony shows a gun nut. Why shouldn't he be allowed to have? Well, it doesn't bother me at all that he, I just want guns and I, I'm, you know, I agree. I mean, I wondered then the other dependency is a 50 caliber Jesus. He has one of those and things. I don't know. I mean, I, I think that there was a politician on, he said this about it and it was really kind of, he was honest.

Speaker 1:          00:28:23       It was really interesting. He said, what can we do about these mad men? And he said, unfortunately in a society like ours that's free and as big as we are, you can't ultimately do anything about alone. Crazy, demented human being who is whatever he has schizophrenia. I think though the debate lies, can you though create a situation where you can keep very lethal, um, uh, efficient weapons, like machine guns out of their hands? That seems to be the debate. I mean, I don't think you're ever going to stop crazy. He's from getting guns and shooting people, but I, it'd be nice if they got just a glock as opposed to a an ar 1415 with a drum of a hundred route. No, this is where the conspiracy theory kicks in is we're all these people believe that the government has brainwashed people like this joker guy to go and commit these things so they can clamp down on gun control and that when you he see what does this Eric Holder and you see like first of all, the nonsense of them selling illegal guns to Mexico and having those guns be used on American border patrol agents and murder.

Speaker 1:          00:29:30       They're retarded. That was actually, it comes out, it's actually a way to track weapons, you know, attract whatever they sold guns bad. I think that is the dumbest idea in the history of dumb. I don't know the details,

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       but does it sound very well? Alex Jones of course, put your tinfoil hat on, believes that they did that shit on purpose and they're making money off of it. And they wrapped it up in in a ridiculous, completely implausible plot, like a completely implausible plan. The problem with a guy like Alex Jones Johnson, my opinion is whenever you talk about the government,

Speaker 5:          00:30:00       the government is so diversified with so many different interests. There are so many people that actually are against gun control and government and passionate about it. There are a lot of people in government that are very for gun control. I think there's a lot of debate even within the U s army and the army and the FBI and the CIA about what we should do with our w about everything.

Speaker 4:          00:30:16       I think you're misunderstanding his tone though. What he saying is it's a much more sinister thing than the government itself. What he's talking about is like the world banks and the new world order getting together and physically engineering a situation where they can clamp down on people to take away their guns because they're worried about the economy going into the toilet and then you know when, when they're passing things like it is. It is. However, when they're passing things like the, the NDA, when they pass, things like that and you realize what well they are slowly but steadily taking our rights away in a place in a time where the, you know, it's really not necessary. This is where there is no personal attacks. I mean there's no, there's no tax going on here in America. I didn't need to, I,

Speaker 5:          00:31:00       I agree with you on that but I think it's a little bit more insidious and a little bit more subtle than that. I actually think that that it's kind of what the founding fathers warned about a long time ago. A lot of times human beings will invent laws that take their own power away in the name of things like safety in the name of look at the Patriot Act, right? You know, those kinds of things where before you know it, there is um, there is a fire and I keep telling you about this. My father, I did a podcast with my dad on the Bryan County jail and he, he was talking about how he spent a lot of time in government. A lot of time down there. I walked how it really works. It's not that politicians are bad. It's not that you know, Republicans or Democrats, a lot of people have good ideas.

Speaker 5:          00:31:41       They're trying to get shit done. Obama's not a soldier. It's it's governments in the business of intent, you're in the business of intent. You have an, you have a law and you have an intention. The problem when you have an intention is that there's so many different interests that you have to appease to get that law whole and passed. And what happens is what you intended usually has other consequences, which would make sense. And I think what we have to worry about is like what you're talking about, where we start losing our own power, but it's almost like it happens. It happens without us even realizing it. Like you pass a law that seems to be a good law. It has other unintended consequences,

Speaker 4:          00:32:21       right? And whenever you do anything that compromises people's freedom and liberty, right? Then you have to say, well, what is the end game in this? Because this seems like even in the name of safety, you're going to clamp down on freedom and liberty and safety isn't going to be worth nearly as much. You have to really look at that. My, my, my father was talking about corporations. He at one point

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       ran the biggest investment bank in the world. He knows a little bit. It was an amazing podcast. A lot of people really, really enjoyed it. I was so proud of it. It's, it's, you can get it on, on, uh, on Brian callen.com or if I wasn't so selfish, I would listen to it. Yeah. Well, no, I did this. I think you'd really like them cause he soaks fair. He's so, he's so, he's so he's just about personal liberty, but he also understands that he's very moderate about that stuff. But, um, you know, he's, he's somebody who, who, who talks about, for example, whatever your intention, whatever your intention as government grows and, and both sides of responsible Democrats, Republicans, it's, it's human. As a government grows with tax revenue or whatever it is, what happens with corporations, they behave just like you. And I would, which is why I got a lobby, my government, so I can get a favorable outcome here because everybody else is doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       So pretty soon you've got everybody feeding out of or influencing the government trough. It's just how you can't do business otherwise you can't be in business as a bank without having very strong ties to the government. You can't, you just can't. And there in lies the argument. So no matter what you say, yes you need government. Yes, there are good ideas out there, you know? But just be aware that regardless, the bigger it gets, even if its intentions are good, you're going to have, you're going to lose. The argument goes, you're going to lose some of your liberties. You're just going to, that seems at least to be what history says. And it seems to be that it's so easy to let something grow completely unnecessarily out of control. If you wanted to, you could micromanage every single aspect of society in order to create new jobs.

Speaker 1:          00:34:22       If you wanted to create new jobs and give more people the work of, you know, well they'll look what we were just talking about this this weekend, not explain to me how in any way making hemp weed marijuana, illegal marijuana is illegal. You and I were hanging out at a bar this weekend and I remember I said, and there was somebody acting up and they were drunk. And I said that I've never been bothered by a pothead like that. Right. But, but it's always somebody who's drinking now. Alcohol causes way more damage. We all know the story and clearly, but why? Why is, why is marijuana so why are those laws, those federal laws so difficult to repeal? Well, I'll tell you why. In my opinion, and it goes back to what you brought up. There's a lot of money and enforcing a lot of money and enforcing, enforcing marijuana laws. There's a lot, a lot of money. Yes. Talk to talk to the DA. You, you've got a lot of people whose jobs depend on this stuff. It's not anybody's fault. It's what happens, Matt. Yep. We are all, anytime you have a critique of somebody, just realize that if you were in their position you'd probably be the same goddamn way. You hopefully not. But that's what happens. That's why we need clear cut laws to protect people from their own instincts to protect natured. For you,

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       a person who's outside of it objectively looking at the situation from a, you know, a a knowledgeable point of view, you can sort of engineer what is and what isn't legal. We have to avoid this so you can't take money. We have to avoid that. So you can't do this, you know, and unless you stick by some well thought rules, it's on like, you know, you need a scaffolding for humanity to grow on and when you give people power with no scaffolding, I never, I never arguing more about a lot democratic or republican platform. I never do that. Not My argument always centers on one thing, which is hey look, you got your political point of view. That's great criticisms that we all agree we need some government. You just need some government. Yeah, we need some moral boundaries. We need some engineering of our culture.

Speaker 4:          00:36:26       You need law and order, you need roads, you need, but we need way less than we had. Well, there you go. And so then the question becomes how much less do we need? A lot less. And that's where the debate should, that's what we should talk about. Why and why? What is the objective to preserve personal freedom? Liberty, if they had less laws and more cops would, the world would be a way better place. And if the cops were paid better and treated better by people, if more people got their shit together. So it didn't look at the cop as like someone is going to come and arrest you for doing shitty things. Just don't be doing shitty things. Right. If we, if we could figure out a way to elevate our society to the next level, you know, I think that could be a way, you know, I was just reading an article about my thoughts of a competency, like, like a security person, like a friend.

Speaker 4:          00:37:14       Like let's put it this way. Instead of thinking of cops as like, someone is coming to bus to you or someone's going to take your shit if you had good cops in a community. It's like if you had a fucking fort and your buddy was the guy lied to watch the door with a gun because there's, there's, you know, crazy Indians or who knows what the fuck could happen. You need that. Like that shit is very important. You have to have some of the garden, the wall. And it did. Somewhere along the line it stopped being that and it became an us versus them, the society versus the cops. I do think though that, that, um, a lot of police forces that's not lost on a lot of cops and a lot of, uh, a lot of the brass, for example, and in New York, I just read an article that crime is down since the 90s by 80%.

Speaker 4:          00:38:01       That's amazing. Isn't cool. And mostly mostly in black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Mostly Giuliani came in and just cut the bullshit. And it was Bratton and their notion of a quality of life laws. If you'd, they said if somebody graffiti's a walk, they probably do other things that are bad too. So we're going to start enforcing those small, those small crimes because they lead to bigger crimes. That kind of notion. And it's interesting how many people were like so down on Giuliani doing that. It really upset that he's ruining in New York. I was in New York, I've shot a movie there three weeks ago. Whenever it's better than I've, I mean I've been, my family is from there. It's better

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       than I've ever seen the city in my life. It's incredible. It's, it's a better place to be than anywhere I've, I, it's the best I've ever seen it. It's the better place to be than anywhere in the world. Well, in some ways I don't want to get carried away. What's the greatest part about it? To you? Accessibility to everything. That's everything and feeling safe doing it. Um, you, you've got, first of all, you've got the lower east side, which is totally different than the lower west side, which is totally different than the upper west side was totally different than midtown, which is totally different than eating the upper east side. And there's an experience to be had in all quadrants of Manhattan. You can get there in 15 minutes by cab or less and or by subway. And most importantly, you're no longer walk around New York feeling like you're going to get mugged or anything else.

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       So that's what people, that's the feeling that people still have about Manhattan is that weird feeling of worrying about being mugged. Sure. Cause it's so big. But if you look at statistics, the police had done an amazing job of policing and you know, who else has done a really good job as, I can't remember the, uh, our police chief here and, and um, la, but they've done a really good job, really good job at controlling gang violence in this, in this. And it's an almost impossible in such an area, huge area. But they've done a really innovative job. You know, comparatively they've, they've, they've, they, they've learned, they learned a lot from, from the gangs, closings in the eighties and the nineties and they've done a really good job in a lot of places. It's kind of fucked when you really wrap your head around it. Like that should be the laws that people are concentrating on.

Speaker 1:          00:40:00       What is, what is causing that kind of shit? I know it's called, I have an opinion on that. The gangs, I think a lot of it comes, starts with, it's like a family. Exactly. I talked to a principal in Kansas City. I said, what do you, what would you do about education? And I wanted to get into a talk about it, you know, and he said nothing. Our schools are great, our parents are fucked up. They had good parents and be fine. I was like, Ooh, Geez. I never thought he goes, my school was great. I just got parents that don't, they're not present. They got three kids they can't take care of. And it, it comes down to that gangs are about kids who just want to feel significant and belong to something. Yeah, absolutely. Everybody has the need to belong to a team or a tribe, you know, I mean, that's why we call it solves a death squad.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       You know. That's why I love being a part of 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu, you know, that's, we, we, you know, when you, you, you become a part of like a team, you know, you become, you feel stronger. So some kid who's out there on his own, you know, it was family just fucking sucks and his whole life has been shit. And you know, he's there with some dude who will shoot a dude for them. That's what the podcast is too, isn't it? I mean, you know, you, you, you have a really, that show we were with, Joe did a show, um, this, this weekend in Denver and that crowd was so, they were so unbelievable. It was like a rock star. I went out as Joe and I, and I said, what's up? You fucking Frakes. Yeah. We wanted to see how long it would take for people. Really thought it was me. And they must have been like, what the hell? Joe got Skinny and a little taller with a beard. That's weird. But anyway, but they went crazy and I, I, and I'm, and then watching all these people in line up just to take a picture with you. They both, they feel like they belonged to an experience. You know, they feel like they belonged

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       to something. Like even the, the, the, my, you know, my 10 minute podcast, well I noticed a lot of young men, they, they, they, they, they come on to that kind of humor. You know, they, they liked the silliness that we do cause it's Kinda like recess. It creates a f you, when you create a following and you create a core group of people, it makes them feel like they belong to something. I think that's why they root for a team that, you know, you haven't experienced with it. It's the same kind of thing. This is an even more intimate experience because you know, you're in people's fucking heads. You know? That's why people get so annoyed. If you say something over repeat things or if you do something they don't like, like the euro, the people are allowing you like the most intimate, uh, sort of like input into their brain.

Speaker 4:          00:42:15       You're in the fucking your buds and you're literally playing inside their ear and you're, you're talking inside their head and if you're annoying, that's a mind fuck. But if you are really genuinely on a good path and you really are a genuinely promoting other people to be on a good path to and, and just brotherhood. You know, Tom Rhodes sent me a text today that was a really fucking awesome taxed cause Tom just did the uh, ice house chronicles show that we do at the desk squad at the Ice House, the Ice House, amazing old comedy club. And we've been doing these shows and we're going to do one this Friday night where we have all these comics go well, but it was Damo rarer, you know, this week it's Greg Fitzsimmons, Joey Diaz, Joey's on all time per crusher was there this week. I mean, these, these shows are fucking incredible. Okay. And were hanging around in the back room and we're doing a podcast and it's me and crusher and Tom Rhodes and Dama rera and Brody Stevens and we are laughing our fucking dicks off.

Speaker 4:          00:43:15       It's so fun. It's like the stuff we always did, but now thousand hundreds of thousands of people. But what, what Tom said, he's just, he goes, I really love the feeling of comedy, Brotherhood, you know, and that's what it, that's really what it was. It's like we have like a comedy brotherhood and we really genuinely like each other, love each other and want each other to succeed and are happy when each other's succeeds. That's the one thing that's missing in our group is that weird comic neurosis that often exist where people can't be happy with other people's success. Bitter, bitter, like narcissistic or bitter, kind of like damaged like islands. That's what you'd get a lot with like standup comics. They haven't been told, man, it's, it's like, it's like learning Jujitsu wrong or learning to play the guitar wrong. You haven't been told the way to manage your mind and what you, what you don't realize is that even though you are separate from other people, you're really not, and you get something from them, positive or negative, and that affects you and if you can generate positive feelings and other people, then you will get more positive feeling in your own life.

Speaker 4:          00:44:26       You know, it's really weird. I'm reading this book called the sociopath next door written by this Harvard psychiatrist.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       She's a sociopath. I read an excerpt about that where they were saying some frightening numbers. We were just, you were just talking about connection and how important it is and the feeling you get from when you move other people and then you and you get in and you get moved from other people. And most of us who are normal, we get this socio paths. They don't even get that from their own children. They don't even get like, like they could be very successful, but they don't get any satisfaction out of being at, you know, getting the adulation. The only thing that they usually get pleasure from is winning and controlling other people's reactions. Isn't that wild? So the idea is you, whatever they can do power over people is what gets them off and winning. That's the only thing that gives him the satisfaction because they can dominate.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       We know comics like that. There are a lot of people like that. I think we no one at least. And the ones that's usually the ones that are in trouble for being unoriginal, it says it's the desire for conquest, most supersedes everything. And they really don't have any problem fucking people over. Right. And that's where it gets really weird. Every time I've ever fucked anybody over my life is left a bad feeling. Like we were talking before the show about a steel in material and uh, I said, uh, when I was an open mic or I totally stole, I stole Greg Fitzsimmons and stuff and like, we stole it on perfectly. We, we spoke about it to each other. We said like, dude, if I'm on the road and I'm bombing, I'm doing your shit. Like we made agreements with each other. But even though I told those people his joke and it wasn't my joke, I still felt like I was full of shit and it was like fucked with me for years.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       You know what I do every, every time now. I do stand up. My Buddy Sam Brown, who was a great comic, died of pancreatic cancer about two months ago. And uh, I was really close when I knew him for 20 years and he was the first headliner it ever seen. We would cross, he was from Boston and now every show I steal one of his, uh, his jokes, I just, I just, it's like my little homage to him. I just put it in there. I just kind of slide it in just this, my little like, cause I know I wrote on his deathbed, he, unfortunately he couldn't talk, but his wife read it to him. I wrote, um, I said, listen man, you know, you're one of the greatest comics are you always made me laugh. If there's any way I can have your material, I mean, you know, I fucking rock.

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       And she read it to them and I don't think he, I don't think he was able to, I don't think he was conscious about hope. He can hear and I hope I made them laugh before he died. I literally, by the way, I'm, I, I recorded two podcasts with him. One he knew he was dying on my, on my, uh, on my podcast. So it's pretty, pretty cool. Pretty Pretty. Uh, pretty moving. You could do my shit if I die, I'll do your shit. I'll always, that's what I want to see my friends. I knew some of my notes. He had great, great bits, man. He had a fucking great pitch and he's like, he would talk about smallest ticket me behind the Greg. Oh Dude, no, no. You fucked the order of jokes man. Your jobs would be hard to steal though because like I was watching you this weekend and one of the things I loved was it was almost like you were, you were, you were. Cause I know a lot of this stuff is new and so, so much of it was just you of having an experience.

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       It's like, what I like about your standup is you're always kind of having an experience and you're doing it for you and you're working something out and you're looking at how weirdly how weird we are structured as a society. Our minds are why we do things that make no sense. Why contextually something makes sense, but then it doesn't in this case, and it was so fun to watch because I was like, you know this, the comedy is almost secondary to the experience La. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny. Yes, but you're almost like, I think I really think people are watching you kind of have your own very authentic and unique experience. Verbal experience. That's what I felt like. Like I come away with a very different perspective. It's very inspiring to me because I started writing differently. Really? Yeah. When I see you I go, I, it's a really nice, it's what I love about like having friends that inspire me.

Speaker 5:          00:48:19       What you've always done. Like it's just like you have that, that's, that's who your friends should be. You know? I know you, I have friends that are wonderful that are I play grab ass with. But then you have friends that are like that really inspire you to be better and push you just by their example. Well they make you better. They make you to make be better. Good. I like hearing that we all make each other better, but you always right. You have, your bar has always been, oh, I don't know how to describe where you place the bar, but I always would watch you and I've seen you at your best. I've seen you when you're shit is fucking so tight and you're just a machine gun. Like I remember when you were younger, I'd never seen you did something to a crowd in New York.

Speaker 5:          00:48:58       I remember was I was with Patty Jenkins, you are a fucking machine gun. It was like literally these New Yorkers, like all these comics gotten them and then Joe Rogan gets up and it was literally like, we were like looking at each other going, what the fuck? What the fuck is this? And it was what it was, was somebody who had never taken a day off and had only been working on being as authentic with their experience. And what a lot of people don't know about your early stuff, that you were so good at. Impressions, you did all of it. It was funny but really truth. So for me it was just literally like a fucking tsunami. We were like, Jesus Christ, that's how you do stand up. That's how you do it. Good luck. Anybody trying to follow that fucking ball of fucking energy cause you just come on like certain bits that I couldn't, I couldn't follow myself.

Speaker 5:          00:49:41       Oh my God, you were so physical, like muscular, but really flexible. Like you do weird shit like fall into the splits. I remember one time we had a meeting, remember that we were pitching a TV show and we're sitting on a couch and it's like, I think it was Eric with Eric Tanenbaum and like big producers and you go [inaudible] and we were talking about martial arts and you go, yeah, I'm flexible. And I was like, yeah, I'm flexible too. And you go, yeah, but you can't do this. And you grabbed your ankles and fucking pull them up and you did the splits in the air and we were all like, what the fuck is high? What is that? He's like made a rubber and you used to bring that shit to the, to the stage and it was just, it's just really wild to watch. You kind of continue to grow and change your expression, you know? Well you, you just keep adding information to the pile and you keep euro,

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       you're learned experiences. So if you're still into it and I, you know, you, you don't diminish your focus. And my focus is a real wrestling match because I, you know, like a, in Steven Pressfield's books, it talks about distractions and, and different things that you and I will, I certainly battle with those things, but I also battle with other things that I enjoy. Like when he calls distractions like that, I think make me better. I think the better I get at pool, this seems really strange, but the, the better. I am at comedy and right now I've never been better at comedy and I've never been better at pool. Like I've got this weird thing going on where, um, I can, I can tune in to, it's, it's, it's, to me it seems to be about tuning into whatever the fuck I'm trying to do, whether it's Jujitsu, whether it's pool, whatever, w but it standup company. But I have to have that same sort of intensity and energy. And if I dwindle, if I drop below a certain level, I can't rely on my learned experiences with stand up. I can't rely on the past. I have to constantly be maintaining a certain amount of current interest, writing new stuff. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:51:41       that's what I was going to say is, well, what's what I think the secret to your success is, and I always try to tell people this because people get very frustrated and discouraged by the process of accomplishment because there are so many plateaus and you're always always like a lot of people, well this didn't work out and and, and what what we in, I'll just say this to everybody because I've been pretty successful and I have people come up to me and they, you know when you do a show they want to take pictures and they, they, they look at you as a success in this business and you being one of my closest friends, you had a critique of my, my recent special on showtime, which I wasn't very happy with. But what was great about it is you said, Hey Brian, you could be a great, you could be way better than you are now. I shot a fucking show times special when people are like, Whoa, you shot a special, I'm, I'm at working on my second. But you said you're, you're putting a little too much English on the ball. Okay. Little too little too slick playing around and what that does, what an adequate,

Speaker 4:          00:52:34       no, it's a trick of course. Of course. I, I've done it. I look back at my old stuff where I did that. It's the grossest feeling of all time

Speaker 5:          00:52:40       because what, what did, what it means is that no matter where you are in your career, you've always got to be assessing. You've always gotta be taking yourself to, to task and kind of taking a look at yourself objectively and go on. I gotta, I gotta I gotta work a little harder.

Speaker 4:          00:52:53       I'm watching my last special that I edited. It's the best shit I've ever done and I can't even watch it. I was like, Oh, I look so stupid. Fucking talk too much. Even when I stumbled through like, uh, like one also I'll fuck up the, the, the, the one word, you know, one one, I'll have one little stumble in there and it's just like watching a puppy get hit with a hammer. The first time

Speaker 5:          00:53:16       I saw myself on camera with was a wrestler and I was 14 and I walked out onto the mat when I, and I used to think I was the baddest guy on the planet. I looked at video and I went, well, where's, who's the, who the fuck is the kid with rickets? Fuck, is that, it was me. I've never been more devastated. I was like, I'm that skinny in a single let, I'm never wrestling again. I'll go out in the Burka before I fucking go out in a single let that's, that's a fair, and that's a horrific, my, my buddy wrote a book, um, which I told you you should have them on your podcast. His name is hunter Mott's. He wrote a book called the straight a conspiracy speaks 10 languages fluently. This kid graduated from Harvard with a biochemistry degree. Okay. And I said, why did you write the book?

Speaker 5:          00:53:55       He said, well, I said, oh. I said, well, how do you learn 10 languages fluently? And, and he's fluent. And he said, oh, it's because I, it's because I, I know I can do it. And everybody who learns languages or math thinks they can't because they have an emotional context around it. That's all. And I don't know what does that mean? He said, I'm writing a book about it. I'll tell you about it later. I had him on my podcast. He wrote a book called the straight a conspiracy. And He, and, and if you look at all the math, all the science around learning and which he did, one of the things that they find for sure is that people have these myths about themselves. I'm not a math person. I am a math person. I'm artistic, I'm not artistic. I'm musical. I'm not musical.

Speaker 5:          00:54:31       If you actually look at the science that's being done about learning and why some people are very good at some things and others are not, I'm talking broad scope here. Um, what you find is that the emotional context with which they learned something, it has everything to do with whether or not they're going to excel at that. Everything. So in other words, whatever emotional state you approach, learning something, growing at something means everything. It's, it's what it's all about. If you are in a pleasant environment where somebody makes it fun for you, okay, you're going to learn it. Why are a lot of Asian people, so the stereotype goes like Chinese people good at math and a lot of Americans aren't. I'll tell you why. If you read Malcolm Gladwell's book, the outliers and my buddy's book straight at conspiracy, it has to do with a culture that says, well, yeah, this math problems really hard and I guess I'll, I'll be here for the next two and a half hours.

Speaker 5:          00:55:25       Americans are like, I'm not going to sit here for two and a half hours. I got shit to do that. This is fucking really hard. Guess what? Not a math person and then your parents go, yeah, he's not good at math. Isn't it fascinating? The culture that is the least inclined to do that hard work is the culture that has the best art. Well, we also have the best math and science and surprisingly because we, we have, we have immigrants and capture the competition's fierce and the possibilities are pretty intense. I also happen to believe that that's, that is the reason we're so good at art and things is because it is, we place emphasis on the individual. It's your individual expression is what you can benefit from it and we have freedom to do it. You can't be expressive. Imagine having your podcast in Russia to imagine having my podcast in American a few years. That's what's really a problem. What's really a problem is the more you get shit like this national defense authorization act, the more of these different laws are passed that slowly but

Speaker 4:          00:56:23       surely take away your right to say certain things. They just outlawed protests at military funerals. The government has, uh, recently reinstated propaganda. They're allowed now. They haven't been since the 1940s to actively use propaganda on the American people. That's legal now and all this shit is going on while the Internet is growing, while people's access to information is just flying out them. It's like this desperate last clawing attempt at a dying culture to hold on to power and it's disgusting. It's disgusting that anybody would ever allow the government to use propaganda. I mean Munis, lead, lie, and and, and distort the truth for the public in order to emphasize their point of that, you would give that power to the government is so beyond sick, but as long as you realize that that is always going to be the case and that you have to always be aware of that. Right. The problem is that's happening though. The problem is that it's a trend. It's happening and it takes a lot to stop a trend. It takes a lot to back it up.

Speaker 5:          00:57:30       How do you stop and you write to your representative? I mean, what happens after a while I started to feel like I'm not represented. Right. I start to feel like if I'm not a corporation with a lot of money to buy it, but to by lobbyists, no, you're not. I don't have a way of influencing my government. For example, New York Times wrote an Ra. Ra ran an article recently about, I travel a lot as to you and when you walk through the two boxes where you put your feet and you actually put your hands up, y'all not talking about the foam that goes around you. I'm talking about the two, the two boxes you walked. Well that's radiation and in New York Times wrote an article and it was about a week ago. If you guys want to look it up about the fact that they actually aren't too sure how much radiation you're getting. They think it might be one 10th of a chest x Ray. Some in some cases, more importantly, they don't maintain them as well. They had some crazy number of maintenance requests, mum, many of which were not met. You're, you're putting your trust into the Tsa. They're probably good people doing the best they can and in some ways they do a great job. But the fact that I didn't know that I was being blasted with radiation, no matter how small, not doing it, I don't do that. I have them pat me down. And

Speaker 4:          00:58:32       did anybody ever get creepy with you when you asked for a pat down was I was hoping they would, but they didn't the fuck. Not Creepy sexually. I mean, Graham Hancock, uh, who's, uh, a guy who I've had on the podcast before, he's from England, he came to America and he didn't trust the radiation of the machine and he said they violently like almost assaulted him. He said it was very rape. Like grab his cock like the

Speaker 5:          00:58:56       no, they were really polite to me actually. They went, all right, no problem.

Speaker 4:          00:58:59       I think it's, you know who you get, you know, we might get some guy that doesn't like English people, you know, dude has an accent. He's like, I'm not going to go through, they're impressed with the TSA and how professional a lot of them are. I'm actually impressed with how Curtis, you're such a fucking Fox News. Contrarion I would have known that you were gonna say that if we brought up the, what about Tsa cons? You know what actually statistically the Tsa, I like everybody. I have no like resolved by the way. Just for the record. Everybody. I finally all my rules in the show. I don't believe as an actor I should be talking about anything including politics, but I can't help it. I'm like anyways, in the actor, how could you say as an actor, as a comic or a comic, if you're a comic, you should be feel ridiculous idea that you should be able to talk about anything except religion or politics.

Speaker 4:          00:59:43       Well, the, that that alone is just like a cry or a call rather to a middling state of mind to a non communication. You know? It's like if you're not politically committed to some extent, then it's at your own peril. If everybody wants to be ignorant about what's going on in their world, in politics, then then good luck trying to change anything and more importantly, good luck being able to see what, what's happening. Most people don't have the fucking time. Man, that's a part of the problem. Most people have lives. They have jobs and children and all that other stuff that goes along with them. Hobbies, you have time to develop a philosophy. You don't have to worry about the minutia. Did you have time? My point is that what you were saying earlier is that they don't feel like they're being represented so they don't feel like their efforts put into it.

Speaker 4:          01:00:28       Have any great reward. You know, they don't, they feel like completely, there's a lot of people, I think a good percentage, more than half, I feel completely alienated from the system. And that's a conservative estimate. If you say that half the people in this country feel alienated from the system, that's a failing system, no matter how you look at it. And the problem is people don't feel rewarded for investing in a failing system. When a guy like Obama gets the Nobel Peace Prize and then since 30,000 more fucking troops to Afghanistan and everybody's like, Jesus Christ, man. Like what? What kind of system is this? Who, who would have, who would have said that? That's okay. Who would one of their sons to go? Who would one of their brother to go get the fuck Outta here? That's nonsense. That's craziness. But yet it's happening. So we don't feel represented. We feel too, I wonder if Obama himself feels, I want why it's like a, like a listless play thing.

Speaker 4:          01:01:20       I wonder, you know what I mean? Like somebody, I bet you his biggest complaint is the fact that he doesn't have any power at all. I bet you that he makes it. Well, he knows that if he makes one decision, he's going to a appease 50% of the people and piss off the other 50% I mean, it's gotta be a strange job if you just stop and think about who you are before he become president. If you take out all the nonsense, the tin foil hat stuff about the illuminati running things and you, let's just pretend for a brief moment that maybe elections are real okay. And maybe Obama is just a regular dude who became a senator, who's a regular dude who ran for president, who activated a big wellspring of hope and it's people and then they put him into office and then once he gets in there, then he has to deal with these international banks.

Speaker 4:          01:02:04       He has to deal with things like Halliburton. He has to deal with people like Dick Cheney, Rumsfeld, think about all the people that were in power before him. Think about all the people that he has to communicate with. Think of it all the shit that went down in that office. Think of it all the people that died all over the world because of the actions of the group of people he replaced and think about what that must feel like to step into those shoes. And then all of a sudden you realize you are at the helm of a murder machine. You are at the helm of a thing that is in every single part of the world. It's also a huge octopus that is not being run by one particular, no, it's being built by a bunch of different interests, but they're profiting like massive, massive amounts on war.

Speaker 5:          01:02:48       Deon and all those companies that have that make a lot of money off of what, what they, what Eisenhower called the industrial military industrial.

Speaker 4:          01:02:55       And so as a, as a president, do you feel like, you know when you get in there you just slowly tried to put on the brakes? I mean, how much control does a guy have? Cause it doesn't seem like much. I think we deviated much from Bush to Obama at all. And in fact they cracked down on secrecy issues and crack down on prosecuting people for leaking information.

Speaker 5:          01:03:15       And Obama was, was very, um, very much about the drone programs, special forces.

Speaker 4:          01:03:21       He made a joke about using the drones if someone tried to Dre to a date, his daughters, he made a joke in one of those, you know, they do as one of those functions where he does one liners. Obama got up there and he made a joke about if you were dating his daughters, he has one word for you. Drones. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:03:38       Well, uh, kinda funny, but not if, when you're the president,

Speaker 4:          01:03:41       that's not when thousands of civilians have been murdered by drones. Thousands of innocent civilians. I don't know what the number is now, but it was in the thousands. Someone sent me all the statistics on Twitter. Give killed a lot of bad guys.

Speaker 5:          01:03:56       But again, it was what we were talking about with farm factory farming. When you have people in Nevada and Florida who go to a room and they kill people who are a thousand miles away via, you know, camera and with these drones. I think about that. My joke was the war hero in 20 years is going to be the Chubby guy with huge thumb muscles. This smells like Doritos and we'd write, cause he's, he's a Gamer. He's hooked up on Alpha brain there. There is a, there is a psychological model when you're removing yourself from the actual, you know, when you're a marine, you're drawing a bead, you're shooting a guy and you know you're, you're running and you're and you just see the guy die and stuff. When you're in a room in your country and you go home after, after operating these drones and killing whatever it might be, maybe it's one person in the 25 whatever it is, or you drop a thousand pound bomb on a shoot, a Hellfire missile, whatever comes out of those things. That's kind of really, that's, that raises a lot of questions. It raises a lot of questions when we're this removed from the actual experience of killing

Speaker 4:          01:04:55       what we were talking about earlier. It's all connected. The sociopath does not have that feeling of connection and only feels pleasure when they win. And what is war but completely sociopathic behavior. And what is friendship other than none. So sociopathic behavior, the connection that you get with people, the being the most important thing we were talking about when we're doing this podcast that we've created an environment,

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       we've created a, uh, there's, it's not as simple as this is a show. It's a bunch of people tuning into the show and getting like a positive thing out of it and having conversations like this and these conversations take place in their head and they experience it. They learn from it. They, it gives them hope. It gives them a mindset that they can, uh, they can accomplish something with it gives them a fucking people. I've had come up to me and go, dude, since I've listen to your podcast, I've lost 70 pounds. I start drinking Kale shakes, I think come to me every fucking show. It's incredible. It's also important when you have a debate and we have a discussion like we do to to actually take a look at the, where to place, where to place the focus, for example, allowed. Well, I'm a, well the military, well the military, there are a lot of people in the military who are carrying out these who are doing these things that never agreed with the war in the first place.

Speaker 1:          01:06:07       I mean, we have a civilian government that controls the military, that makes these decisions for the military. The military just carries out orders. That's how our government works. And the military has a job to do. If you send them into a war zone, they're going to get the job done. Um, and a lot of guys, I mean, I know I w you know, I went to Afghanistan, but I know enough people in the armed forces, a lot of, a lot of men in the armed forces and women have an ideology that they believe in. It's this country. It's the things that they'll do when they come in and they're, they're loyal servants, they risked their fucking lives and they go do their job. And a lot of them get Maine, they lose their arms, they lose their friends and everything else. I think that when you start to look at how this war's gone over the past 11 years, and I'm talking about the Palestine in Iraq, you've gotta be, you gotta be very, very conscientious about not only how this really started, who were the, who were the architects, who was the intellectual force, who was the argument behind it?

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       How did this happen? How did this turn into a huge snowball? And the reason you should know about that is because your lives and other people's lives depend on it in the future. Yeah. We just get ourselves, we'll get ourselves into another situation. You know, my buddy, it's not weird though. That's what's really going on. I'm sorry. It's not, we're going to get ourselves into another situation. Somebody else's going to do it. Well, my buddy, my buddy, I think I put it on on red bands a thing, but my best squad, but my buddy who I interviewed who was a special forces guy who was a real, a real, I don't know what he does, but I know he's very much involved and he was the baddest guy I ever knew growing up and he said he, he was, he just said about the war effort.

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       He watched what's happening, had been in Iraq for I guess seven years and he said, Iraq is a country now. We've created a mini Saddam in this guy, Molokai. He is now, he's a Shiite. He is got police squads that report directly to him. So what we, we go into Iraq. There's this notion that while he's got the fourth largest army in the world, we've got to stop him from, you know, dropping a weapon and okayed his hands. There was the arguments and stuff. What we'd done in some ways, if you look at Iraq with the exception of Kurdistan and stuff, is that we really destroyed that country. A lot of people are dead and we've put into place somebody who is keeping his people or has a potential of keeping his in

Speaker 5:          01:08:15       the same kind of oppression technically as Saddam did. Now what is the objective? What are we doing? Was this worth it wasn't worth killing all those people. Was it worth all those soldiers didn't come back and many more who are wounded? That's the question and more importantly, what lessons can be learned? What do we have to learn from Iraq and Afghanistan? What do we have to learn so we don't get an arm ourselves into the situation again, sometimes wars, inevitable men. It is.

Speaker 4:          01:08:41       That was an inevitable one. That was one that we got tricked into. Okay, but then how do we not get tricked the next time we have the Internet now? I think we have a completely different sort of playing field than what existed back when Bush and Cheney dragged us into the Iraq war. I think the Internet has evolved far past where it is. That's why things like wikileaks are so terrifying to the powers that be, it's real hard to get away with shit on the Internet to others. So much countervailing information too. Like you get one argument and you get another, but that's just debate. I'm talking about straight information. Um, I think that the, the access to information is ultimately changing the world that we live in and it's happening so quickly. And these kinds of conversations really weren't commonplace when we were kids.

Speaker 4:          01:09:27       Yeah. Well we were 16 and 17. Our parents weren't having these kinds of conversations. They just weren't, it's a, it's a different world. We know more about how things work and because of that it makes it harder and harder to accomplish fuckery. Still going still going on right now. But ultimately it's got to die off in order for us to have, you know, uh, any sort of religious society, we're going to have to evolve past that and realize just as you and I realize as friends and as members of our community that it's not necessary and that that kind of a, an energy that you put out to control people. And to and into, to, to profit from other people's losses is totally non beneficial to you as well. You just because you're pulling it off under the guise of a corporation doesn't mean that you are immune to the negative rebound of that because you're not, and you want to call it Karma, you want to call it what goes around comes around, whatever you want to call it. It's real. Okay. I have experienced it. I am walking proof of it. My whole life is proof of it. I have been, I the, the negative things that I've ever done in my life, I have felt in great deep detail and rebounded as much as possible to turn that terrible feeling into positive energy. And that is why I've been a happy person my whole life. But do you think that's because,

Speaker 5:          01:10:53       cause I always wonder, I try to help people, a friend of mine who's going through a tough time now and, and I, and I realized that the, one of the reasons that he's going through a hard time as he's not in any way actually really confronted and asked himself what he wants.

Speaker 4:          01:11:07       Yeah. You can't, you can't get a guy to do that though. But, but don't you think that will be success? Is the fact that you've already, you've always been able to see and technicolor what you wanted and what you want it to be or, or is that what you know what it is? Um, uh, first of all it's just pressing forward. That's constant doubt that that constant need to write new shit to do different things to the constant need to be in motion. The constant need to be doing something, whether it's doing Jujitsu or playing pool or writing more jokes are getting onstage that forward momentum. That is a constant that, that, that, that is, that is the reason why I've done everything. And you can transfer it. It's like the meal multi Musashi quote. And once you understand the way broadly, you can see it in all things.

Speaker 4:          01:11:52       So like the idea that once you lock on to what it is to really focus and get good at something, then you can keep, but it's also that it's really satisfying to accomplish things. It's really satisfying to write things. It's really satisfying to do shows. I don't know even know why I did it, but I've always wanted to play the drums. So I've, I've been taking drums for a year now. It's actually changed not only my comedy but my sports like, like I pick up on shit really fast now because with the drums I'm having to do something. One thing with my foot, one thing with this thing with this and one this, so my brain is firing, it's firing. So it's changed the way I read. It's changed the way I do stand up. It's really wild. I'm I, it's a really good mental and I'm listening differently.

Speaker 4:          01:12:33       I'm never going to be in a band by the way. Right, but you just enjoying it. I'm just enjoying love that. I think that's very important to life and I think a lot of people, like there's, there's like a lot of people that have falsely rewarded being a lazy cunt and it'll like, you'd rather just sit in front of the TV, chill, wouldn't beers watch TV? Let me tell you something. This is the real reality of, of life. If you don't earn something, you won't appreciate it. It's why people win the lottery and they lose all their money within a year. When you earn something you appreciated it is, it is a golden, steadfast rule of life and if you're laying around on the couch watching TV and you haven't done anything to deserve that, getting drunk doesn't feel good. It doesn't feel good. It doesn't, you feel like a fucking loser.

Speaker 4:          01:13:19       But when I do something, like if I write and I blast out like three or four hours are really good shit and they're like, fuck yes, I feel good. I feel fired up. I can't wait to do a show. I can go watch TV and I can enjoy it. Yeah, I can go watch mountain men and I enjoy watching these fucking guys. Here's what I think is really like forks for me as I go, I sit down and I go like this. I go, what do I want to, what do I want to do and what am I going to regret not doing? When I, when I'm 90 I say to myself, I go, what do I really want to do? And I go and what do I want to do in three months or six months and stuff like that. And then I literally, I structure my day and I think you can do this no matter who you are, you structure your day. So you go, you wake up every morning and go, what action. Just one action, maybe two actions, whatever. What action can I take today just to get a little closer to that, that goal. I just want to just to get a little closer, whatever, whatever, whatever it is. You know, maybe it's 20 minutes of practicing your takedowns or it might be, I want to get my black belt in Jiu Jitsu. I want to be able to play drums in a band. I want to,

Speaker 1:          01:14:15       you know, whatever it might be. The only going to speak a language, you know, call me during my podcast. It's Brian Webb. Then

Speaker 4:          01:14:23       maybe it's called and told me what the shows down. Hey Boo, you live on the air.

Speaker 3:          01:14:33       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:14:34       His mikes out.

Speaker 3:          01:14:37       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:14:38       It's really quite well. He keeps backing up. That's what it is. Yeah. Sorry guys. Oh really? Yeah. You can't be talking back. They're all casual pitch. Okay. I gotta get in. Thanks Brian. This is technical information delivered via telephone. Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Red Band on the scene. Follow him. Red Ban on Twitter. All right buddy and me, Brian Calix at Brian. Count on Twitter. I respond to all my twitters by the way. What were we talking about? Very important probably. Um, but this, this idea that we were talking about before of of community of you know, of all influencing each other in a positive way that gets lost in big numbers. And the problem is we could have a great tribe of like 50 people and keep it together and have the most awesome utopia. As I've heard boulder described boulders like a really small mountain community, but it's so small.

Speaker 4:          01:15:28       It's like, it really almost is like a functional working utopia. But I think that we could do that. It's possible to do that as a country. We just have to get more people in tuned to thinking correctly. And most people are just never taught how to think. They're never taught that they can manage their consciousness. They've never taught, they've never been taught that the mind can go down that self-destructive, completely self destructive and also totally unnecessary and you have to learn. Like all the times I've blown my cool for nothing and still do. I mean I might be in my car retard and hit the Horn fucking pass money. It was just so pointless, so stupid. And that's near the airport and it's almost always a sign that I'm doing too much. It's always a sign of some sort of external stress. It's affecting, you know, whatever it is that, but when, when you can see that, if you can see that and if you can go in the the right direction, if we could fucking influence a giant group of people to go in the right direction, then you really can change something.

Speaker 4:          01:16:32       Well that really can change tools. But that starts, that starts with individuals really asking themselves, starts with saying with inspiration. Yeah. It doesn't only start with individuals, ask themselves what they want. Sometimes it starts with inspiration. Where you realize there's no, there's no difference between them and me. They were losers too. I was, I've been a lose or I have been a fucking failure in my life. Hardcore. Like when people, I've had people say like, here's your Obama on stage. I'm like, Oh my Christ that I bombed. I bombed so hard. I bombed so hard. No one who ever watched me that day would have ever thought that I could ever be funny. I had a girl send me a short film.

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       Um, her name is Diana, and she sent me a film, uh, and she wrote it. She wrote a, basically a movie, a short film about her experience with a guy on a date. And the guy was me. She never told me that. She sent it to me and I, and I, and all the lines that guy was making, saying lines. I had said to her, and let me tell you something, man. I called her up and I went, Diana, I go, I'm so sorry. I was such a fucking arrogant prick. I was such a Dick because I didn't even understand you are a woman. And I had a projected notion of what, what you were, what you thought and I thought I was so much smarter than you were and you were looking at me like I was a Guinea pig in a fucking maze. Like a, like a rat in a maze. Like literally like, look at this monkey talk to me like I'm an idiot. Yeah, exactly. And he's just hitting me with all these things and he's just a dick. Literally. I looked at it, I was just appalled. I was appalled at who I was and it's just cause I didn't know any better. I just didn't. I had preconceived notions of what women were preconceived notions of how they thought preconceived notions of what a man was

Speaker 4:          01:18:11       supposed to be. The all funds, by the time you get to your 20s and you know you're, you're having experiences with women, these are not the very first of all social experiences when you're involving people that are sexually attracted to each other are very complicated. They're very awkward. There's a plenty of room for misunderstanding. There's plenty of room for offending people, putting out bad vibes, being too forward being too well, you know, hey, there's, it's, it's a, it's a very strange sort of a situation way, so we're not good at navigating it, you know, and we, we, you know, when you're young, especially you just say the dumbest fucking shit and most of the time you fucking hate yourself after it's over and you don't, you don't, you didn't want to do that. It's just, it's like you being thrown in a major league baseball game and someone telling you to hit that ball, that fucking things flying at me.

Speaker 4:          01:18:58       That's exactly right. You're really not prepared for that extreme experience. No manual for life. I mean, well not only that, I mean, how much did your fucking parent, I don't know how much your parents taught you, but how much did your parents teach you about dating? Oh, nothing. I was just talking about that with my son. I was like, I didn't really, I wasn't really taught the women the complexity of the female psyche. I'm definitely going to have to have a talk on my son about that. But yeah, that's going to be that it's, it's so important to try to actually raise a kid that can understand what's, what's next on the horizon. Give them like a little heads up of like what, this is what I went through. So this is probably that that would have fucking help a lot. So when it comes to dating, parents didn't give me any dating advice.

Speaker 5:          01:19:41       Also because you have, you also given a very weird archetypal notion of what masculinity is too. Like that's also like being what, I didn't even know what a man, what a man to find was. It was difficult. I had an exam.

Speaker 4:          01:19:52       What's to everybody? It's different, you know what I mean? What did it a man is does. This is what I believe a man is a person who does what he wants and what makes him happy. As long as it's not hurting other people and we'll actually follows through and does what he wants as opposed to someone who, someone's bitch, if, let me tell you something. If you're a gang guy, okay. And you're not out there blowing guys because you're worried about what other people think. You're somebody bitch. Right? Whether you realize it or not. Yeah, you're the bitch of all the prejudice people that want to stop people from being gangs. And if you are a man, you'd go out there and suck some cock. That's, that's reality. That's true. Because that's what life is. What I like you, you probably don't, but it's my right to like what I like and being a man is going after what you like and if you want to fucking take the easy way out and take some, some job that you know you can do instead of pursue a career in writing books or pursue a career racing horses, whatever the fuck you're compelled to Pressfield and going provide the best example he said, you may have your degree in comparative literature, you man a phd in comparative literature and Teach Comparative Literature, but guess what?

Speaker 4:          01:20:53       You should have written a novel. So that's just a form of high tech procrastination, you know? So you're right. I mean, it's really a question of going for what you want. And you know, a real man can be a guy who fights in the cage or a guy who was a nurse in a fucking hospital, you know? Yes. Whatever it is you're doing whatever you're supposed to do, wherever you're supposed to place your energy, giving, helping and growing. Uh, that's, that's, that's what we need to teach kids. And that's, there's no, there's, there's no better or worse. If you're supposed to be a carpenter, that's what, if you really enjoy it. I have a buddy who's a carpenter back home and he's fucking loves it. He loves buildings, really loves the art of putting together a great room. He loves it when it's done. He loves that he can, he'll look in this room and it's all mapped out.

Speaker 4:          01:21:35       You're following the architect's plans, you know, laying down things. And next thing you know, three months later, whatever it is, look what the fucking awesome kitchen you guys just build. Totally Shit. Like he gets a deep feeling of satisfaction from that and he makes a good living. He's got a good company doing that, but that's it's because that's what he's passionate about. It's because he actually enjoys his work and it doesn't matter if it's that or if it's been in a fucking band or if it's, you know, being a stand up or whatever it is. If you don't follow that shit, that's when you'll, you'll, you're, you're fucking yourself, man. Our dear friend Sam Sheridan said, he goes, I was talking about how I want it. I was watching UFC every time I watched it. A little part of me dies because I want to be a fight or something or you don't.

Speaker 4:          01:22:13       I know, but that's what he said. He goes, Brian, he goes, Brian, you are supposed to, and I've always been supposed to be a standup comic. Dude, you found what you're supposed to do. Did you, you were not supposed to be a fighter or anything else. You weren't doing comedy. I remember you told me, you go, you're missing out on the best thing in the world. What are you, what are you doing? I got back into it because of you, but I also, I remember watching Dane Cook back in the day and I was like, that dude is crushing a room and I want, I got to get back into this because he wanted to crush. I just loved, I loved it. I was like, I'm watching him map so much. Just stop. I don't know cause I'm crazy. Well, you weren't doing real standup when I first met you.

Speaker 4:          01:22:48       When I first met, you couldn't get spots and I was like, fuck it. And I was trying to be an actor. We first started hanging out. You had this act that was like you had taken every alternative act that you saw and tried to duplicate it. And I remember talking to you about it going guys, and even you, man, what are you doing? You look you're, you're going up there. You're, you're doing what these fucking Weirdo judgmental like dorks want you to do, like you're doing what you think they're going to enjoy from you. So satisfying to me now, especially about the stuff I'm doing now is you're being yourself this weekend at the American comedy San Diego. Amazing Club, by the way, and it's filled with great comedy. If you're, if you're living in San Diego, San Diego finally has like a real comedy club and a in Chicago, August 23rd they have national headlines there every weekend.

Speaker 4:          01:23:32       Look like the comedy store in La Jolla is a great club, but you could get fucked there and they could send down one of those old school headliners from like the 1970 [inaudible] that has a written a joke in a hundred years when was work anywhere else other than the comedy store. They'll send those down to La Jolla on occasion. I don't know if they're still doing that, but back in the day you would look at the lineup and go, oh my God, no, that's the headliner. No, you almost wanted to like call the people and go, please just stay on, because that show would be so bad. It would, they would never want to go see standup comedy again. No, and it's true. As you get older and if you're trying to be a real, trying to do something, what happens? I think what's supposed to happen is you become a comic is you start stripping away all that other stuff and more and more of who you really are is kind of expressed.

Speaker 4:          01:24:14       That's what's so satisfying to me, you know? Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's weird, but you're learning how to talk on stage instead of, you were just like you were when I first met you, you were doing this fake thing, rabbits out of hats, and then you became just this like really silly guy. It was like really silly, but I was always weirded out by the fact that you were so silly. But then we would have these deep fucking intense conversations and I was like, why? Where's that on stage? And then I thought about it, I'm like, well, you know, that's a choice. That's a, an artistic thing. Like look at Hedberg one of my favorite comics ever. And you know, there's a message in that it was all silliness and there's nothing wrong with that. Like I'm a silly goose. There's a large part of me.

Speaker 4:          01:24:49       It's always I can't help it. And it's funny that you're so intense. Often it's like there's a real balance to that and it's a good quality that you have that it's missing in a lot of men. Would they somehow or another equate weakness with silly? You know, because I don't think, I think the biggest mistake a man can make his taking himself seriously. Don't take yourself too seriously, man. There's always somebody faster, stronger, funnier, better, smarter. It just, just do only what you can do and always don't be afraid to fucking take the pressure off yourself, man. Don't be afraid to kind of just make fun of yourself. There's nothing wrong with it. There's a lot of power in that you, yeah, you don't understand that when you try to not take the hits, that the, the rebounds doubled, tripled the effect because you're not learning.

Speaker 4:          01:25:31       You're not only are you not taking the hit, but you're not learning from the hit because every time you take the hint, it makes you better. You got to take the head emotionally. You got to take the hit psychologically, you got to take the hit with your ego. You got to fucking fail in life. It's an important ingredient to success. The other thing that I was, don't you agree? I hundred percent agree with that the a hundred percent and the other. The other thing that that the the, as you were talking, I was thinking about the other thing you get from it, which is when, when you take, when you allow yourself to be a little bit of a silly goose or you allow yourself to be vulnerable or whatever it is and make fun yourself, what will happen is it people around you feel safer and what they'll do is they won't be on their guard because a lot of times we come at a situation, if you come to a situation from a power angle or whatever, that person's guard will go up immediately and you won't see who they really are.

Speaker 4:          01:26:20       Well, let's think about this. How disappointing is it when you meet someone and you have like a level of adulation for them? You, you, you know, you're, they're famous. Your, your, your, your fan and they're a dick. The rebound is stunning. It's stunning and hurtful. I mean it's, it's incredible. Yeah. But on the other side, when you approach someone and they're like really normal and nice, what a warm feeling that is. Like because you're coming at them in an unfair way. It's like we had Bert Kreischer on the icehouse chronicles and he was talking about his experience with Gene Simmons. And apparently he did that show, the expo and gene Simmons was a fucking complete cunt to him. And Gene Simmons like told him not to talk. I said yeah, told them he wouldn't be interviewing him and he was gonna make this grill interview him. And he was a huge kiss fan before this.

Speaker 4:          01:27:07       So when this happened, it was completely devastating to Bert. Yeah. And having Burt relay this and then having all of us share our experiences. Like I was talking about, I met Robin Williams last week and, but he was like real normal, like really nice guy. But it was still, it was fucking Robin Williams, you know what I mean? Like he didn't have to be normal. And he didn't have to be a nice guy. It could have been weird because when you meet someone like that, there's a weird imbalance. If you're talking to Tom Cruise, I don't care how many gay jokes you have in the back of your head that you want, those will pop into your head when you meet him. You'll be like, Holy Shit, I hope you'll spend an hour and a half. I did a reading with him for three hours and I spent an hour and a half of them at a party and believe me,

Speaker 1:          01:27:42       I was like, I was like, oh, maybe he'll be my best friend by the way, and by the way, I'm a straight guy. I think he's straight actually shut your fucking mouth. Oh, I know is. I'm looking, looking at him going, he's a really good looking guy. I was like, you know what? He's Tom Cruise. I mean, weren't really, we're talking, we're having a good conversation. It's all a ruse wonder. Like he was like, Hey, I'll be your best friend you make out with me for 10 minutes. I'd be like, I got you make out with, I'd have to think about it because then I can be best friends with why I think I may go Tom Cruise 1000% as a straight man. You know why? Because I'd be able to tell you about it. Are you fucking kidding me? Are you kidding? Watch. Yeah. For the record, for the record, open mouth. I'd be like, Tom, come over here. By the way. He's Kinda, he's Kinda pretty. So yes, I would.

Speaker 4:          01:28:26       Would you enforce your, weighed on him a little bit and press him backwards just to make them a little bend to your will without question. But I'd also be looking. I did. You'd be

Speaker 1:          01:28:35       phone call and make you be the first of all. Come back. And I go, dude, I sit down for a second. I've got some time. I'm straight, man. I Bob slapped and I mean bubs slapped for 10 minutes with Tom Cruise and his hands were really get made that happen with John Travolta. We just have to put you in a proximity. Can't do it. He wouldn't do it with John is too gay. He's gay. Yeah. Shit, I'm not, I'm not gonna make it. And it's like what my agent sent me, uh, things violently to audition first. Queer's folk, you know, which was that show

Speaker 4:          01:29:01       on showtime. And, and the first thing was I have to be making out with this guy. I was like, listen, call, manage. And I go, look, I'm not a homophobe. I'm really not and I'm actually in favor of gay marriage and all that. I go, but I'm, you got to know who I am. I'm Brian Callan and I'm straight guy and it can think I'm waking up every fucking morning at 6:00 AM and going to set and making that with some dude. Uh, after, after getting rid of my coffee breath, you're out of your fucking mind and there's not enough money that I would do that with. Here's the problem with this is one of the reasons why I wouldn't be doing it. It's not that I'm not open minded, but I don't like watching gay guys kiss. So I don't want to do a movie where guys, kids kind of movie squeamish about it.

Speaker 4:          01:29:40       You wanted me to do. I never saw, I never saw Brokeback mountain. Actually I saw it, which was awesome. I had a great five and a bit about it. He's fucking hilarious. I laughed through so much to that movie. The child. We know why because I enjoyed it and people were, there was a lot, I had this conversation with someone who like, you know, like well you know, it's because of your narrow mighty point of view that you didn't enjoy it. I enjoyed the fuck out of it. I bet I enjoyed it more than you. Okay. Cause I enjoyed it as even if, yes, it is a beautiful love story and it is sad and oddly romantic. Yeah. It's still also hilarious. I enjoy both aspects of it. I'm not closed minded or homophobic, but I enjoyed the love thing that they had going on.

Speaker 4:          01:30:18       But I also enjoyed Caitlin like a fucking school child. Every time they were kissing each other. I remember you were like two men making out is in fact hilarious. It's hilarious. It's not, there's nothing wrong with it being funny. It's not like I'm telling you not to do it. But if you're telling me there should be less funny in the world, you can go fuck yourself. And if you're telling me that what you want to do, if I think it's funny, hurts you, I think you're a bitch. Okay? Because if you start making fun of having sex with girls, ah, I'm not going to hurt feelings, not gonna get hurt. Look what? You're a majority. There are minority. Get the fuck over it. If you like fucking guys, you should laugh your ass off when dudes talking about you fucking guys. Cause that's what you enjoy.

Speaker 4:          01:30:57       Humor is the greatest fucking equalizer. Speaking of, speaking of which, you'll kill me, but I have to go. No 10 minute podcasts, podcasts go fuck itself too. You know? But I got to do it because they're waiting for me and I gotta be there at seven. You're going in late, late. You're going to be late morning. They're going to kill me. There'll be fun. No they're not. I've kind of fun. I love it, man. Listen, we have to keep the throwing for a little while longer. 10 minutes to talk about you being an American comedy company in San Diego's we, yes, I'll be at the American comedy club comedy company. It's for American comedy company as soon as he goes. What's called, right? Or is it the American comedy club? You might, it's American comedy club in San Diego. Thursday, Friday, Saturday one Twitter, Chicago Improv. Everybody. August 23rd 24th now you're confusing the fuck out of people.

Speaker 4:          01:31:39       Do it. Don't you don't remember seeing more than one. Just one. Just one. It's American comedy company. Oh it is? Yes. American comedy. I can't wait since San Diego, California. So fucking awesome club. It's one of those like really low ceiling intimate clubs that, you know, like the comedy works in Denver. Okay. Like the old comedy. The comedy works in Denver. Oh yeah. It's good. As it gets. Me and Doug Benson and Brendan Walsh, we were in town in this way. And you got to at the paramount and a, one of the things we're saying, we're walking by the comedy works like there's no better club. There's never been a better club event. And then the comedy works in Denver. It's perfect. Size is the perfect height. Shamirs don't move. Nobody can move the chair on your foot. The chairs are locked in place. There's a table in between each chair.

Speaker 4:          01:32:26       Sit the fuck down. Here's the show. Everybody's packed in there. The wage staffs. Awesome. The shows are fantastic. You walked by the comedy works, you look and you see one headliner after another national name after national name and she's an individual. She's not like the Improv. She's not a part of a giant corporation when he is, the shit is great. I love that lady. Right? If you're listening Wendy, you're the shit. You are the best. Fucking tremendous. And she's got another one. I had such a good time. Well Denver is fucking awesome period. And the paramount was awesome too and thanks to everybody. I've always wondered, I've always wondered, this is gonna sound so weird, but I've always wondered like what? Like with a building like that with all that laughter over all those years, like a wonder and then you take something terrible like the torture chambers of like I will gray or something that the Saddam kept all his people and stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:33:14       I wonder what the composition of that, the the walls. I wonder if there's anything that permeates, I mean this hocus pocus bullshit, but I've always wondered if if in some ways the material like of the of the organic material, like the wood would be a different kind of composition then in a torture chamber or something is on there. All that positive energy versus all that negative energy. You know the weird thing message in the water, a documentary is that the Japanese game frogs all bullshit really killed me. It was all fucking horse shit. God Damn it. I looked into, I was like, oh, you guys were lying to me and that movie, the whole fucking liars who made that. I know that there's, there's places like the ice house is a perfect example that there's been so much laughter in that place that it feels good going in.

Speaker 4:          01:34:03       I don't know if that's my personal association though. And it very likely could if you led me into that place from the outside blindfolded and I thought I was in a bakery and you know it's all association cause my friend, how about this? My friends a surfer was a competitive surfer. Right. When when she hears waves for most of us, waves are like relaxing. Her heart starts beating really fast. She gets really nervous. Yeah, that totally makes sense. Waves she gets, she gets scared and competitive and she, she can't relax. She's like, she's in fight mode cause she knows that she's about to attack away. Well you know, when I was a kid for years I couldn't go to fights because I didn't like the way it felt. That's right. I got real nervous. I would like, I would think that I was supposed to fight next and I would, and that it was just a weird part of me.

Speaker 4:          01:34:45       Like I will try to enjoy it. But there was like, until I was like in my thirties until I had really resolved the fact that it was no longer going to compete. You know, I would get nervous first live event. It's the first I've ever been to where I was totally relaxed. Really. I would go to UFC. I, the reason I don't go to USC, I can only get tickets from you and by the way, congrats it. Donald Cerrone who came to my standards. It's exciting. That motherfucker so well. He's so awesome. Whoo. What a round that. That was 70 seconds of crazy. One of my favorite things, I was doing standup and I, they came to the comedy works in Denver and I could see Donald's Ronnie's hat going up and down laughing at my jokes and afterward he goes, dude, my fucking abs came in fucking ab workout.

Speaker 4:          01:35:24       Him and Nate Marquardt an underwear model to study the girls I was with like my friend's wife and my, my girl, they were like looking at, they were looking at Donald. They literally like, like my friend's wives. They were like, that guy. I just want to touch him. There was an inappropriate around him because he's a handsome fuck. Isn't that weird? When guys wives get creeper dudes like right in front of them. When you got an Alpha male like fucking dog dad. It's when you have such a disrespectful relationship that a lot of people engage in this like over relationship. Yeah. Well a lot of people have that weird own salt. You, you'll insult me and you know you go back and forth a little bit. It's not, you're not in each other's corners. You know, looking out for each other. You got a bad relationship and you're just, you haven't worked it out and you're not trying to, he just stuck in this little fucking ins and they're round, man, man, they'll grow up on you.

Speaker 4:          01:36:11       I will take pictures and squeeze. My hand was coming up to me. Go on. I want to talk to him and say hi to him. I want to meet him. I'm like, your husband is right there. She's like, look at his ass, his ass. They were like levered. They were all over. All those kicks that he throws that he is, that he is fucking ready. That was holy Shit. That was a crazy fight and it was right when I had just got done saying that he has to be very carefully, can't get overconfident because Melvin can fuck you up with one punch and then oh so explosive. Oh my God, I left Hook. Melvin landed too. That could, and Donald kept it together cause he got find out, you said when will you, when were you okay after that punch. And he goes, yeah, he was not okay.

Speaker 4:          01:36:49       And he's still through the kick. See that's how confident he is in his ground games. One of the things about Serone, I love that he'll fucking let those kicks fly man. Cause if you take him down, man, it's, chances are he's going to threaten you from the bottom. He doesn't get grounded pounded now. And he threatens dude's when triangle arm bars. He's not just long, he goes for it man. He attacks the attacks on the ground so he, he's not holding back. So he's willing to throw even after getting tagged light to that way still throws a head kick. But 55 is so I want to see him fight Jose Aldo. It's great as if to five we'll, although is most likely going to move to 55 eventually, he's still young. That's only 25 and he's having a hard time making weight, although he's had a less of a hard time of it lately because he cut back on the weightlifting [inaudible] weightlifting.

Speaker 4:          01:37:33       He was a bulking up in between, you know, uh, fights and putting on mass and then the cut was harder for 55 is just a division of killers. Well, so it's 45, man, it's already five shit. Every and every weight class is growing, you know, like 35 is growing now. There's this like, there's this Eric Perez Kid. Therefore this weekend there's like, it's constant. This, uh, there's so many fucking good fighters, man. It's the, the, the, the whole like division, like the whole UFC, like every single division is expanding and getting deeper and deeper and deeper. The heavyweight division is getting deeper and deeper and deeper. They're going to have Cain Velasquez vs junior dos Santos on New Year's Eve. Really? Didn't they? Fuck ass dude. It's going to be on the 29th and the 30th day going to have a rematch. You have to, Cain destroyed bigfoot. Cain just ran through big foot Silva.

Speaker 4:          01:38:22       Just cut them up the last of them on the ground. That's not, that's such a good, oh, I'm glad I'm not a fighter man. That's just every time you step in that octagon, you're going to war. This is what we talked about earlier. It's, it has to be what you really want to do and has to be what you're really driven to do. It has to be your calling and if it's not your calling, you better get the fuck out of there because there's a guy like junior dos Santos near the end of the ring and it is his calling. What Anderson Silva steps in that cage. He doesn't wish she was in a fucking Marajhi band, no Mariachi, whatever. He says, he's ready to fuck you up. That's what he's there for. That's what he does. He's not supposed to be doing anything else, you know, and the, the margin for error now is so small with these guys.

Speaker 4:          01:39:03       They're so good. Some of these guys, the level is insane and the levels increasing constantly between, um, when I was watching the speed difference between Serone and Gallard and the fights before was astronomical. They were both throwing hay makers, you know, and that is part of it is that they were throwing the kids, they knew each other very well. I can't believe God went down there and it was so, it's such a vicious thing. He was really bad. Well Donald hit him absolutely perfectly. He climbed them with the left Shin to the head. He likes that left high kick with the switch. He throws that so well to the head man. It's such a powerful shot. A lot of guys don't throw it that hard. So there's dude's that stand there and they, and they'll take one of those on the gloves, you know, they'll kind of like recognize that it's coming, but they'll still try to avoid it.

Speaker 4:          01:39:47       Instead try to try to move like you can't do it to Anderson. Like you try it. Like rich Franklin tried the high switch crack on. I understand innocent season coming knows what you're going to do. And just bans and slides off his shoulder and he looks right at me. Your tricks, he's the fucking matrix is incredible. But Serone he's got so much power in it and he's so, he's got so, so much dexterity with his legs. It just calling, it just come. It's almost like, it's shocking how quick it guests. They're so confident in this phone man. And he was very confident and in the right hand he laughed. It landed afterwards was just a bomb. It was just pinpoint. It was like boom. It was like flying at him. All his power directly on the jaw. And that was the knock next. Uh, Nate does.

Speaker 4:          01:40:27       Nate Diaz does. Oh boy. That's going to be incredible. I love, yeah. Well that was a tough fight, man, that a lot of people thought Frankie Edgar won that fight. Almost unanimously. The professionals on Twitter thought that he wanted that time at that. He's the toughest small guy in the world. Fred gaggers a motherfucker, dude, I, you know, look, I thought he won the fight afterwards by decision, but it was, it w I would have to honestly go back and watch it again and, and, and score it with my mouth shut to make an accurate assessment of whether or not my feelings after the fight or over or accurate. You know, I think I'm really careful about saying what I think when it's real close fight like that until I actually sit down and watch it as if I was scoring it. Because if you're watching it as a commentator, you're also involved in it.

Speaker 4:          01:41:10       You're trying to be entertaining, you know, I'm trying to like explain what's going on and I don't have to like in order to do that and do like a really effective calculation of whether or not one person, one or the other, especially when it's close because it was, the fight unquestionably was close. There's no doubt about it. It was a very close fight. No doubt about it. The people thought Henderson wanted agree with that. The people who've thought Edgar wanted agree with that. It was a tightly contested fight. So to really watch that and judge it, you got to really shut your fucking mouth and sitting there with a pad, another game, and you've got to mark things down. And if you had the best would be if the judges had access to the information that Goldie and I have access to, like we have access to all the takedown, like the end of the round [inaudible] thing that comes up fairly recently in the last few fights.

Speaker 4:          01:41:57       Who Screen? Who Does it? It's UFC staff. So the production staff, it's catching everything. They're counting strikes and there there's a whole like, you know, segment of the show where they'll go to effective strikes, take down attempts, submission attempts. So we get to look at hard numbers as well as like our gut feeling about things. Like there's sometimes a guy will land like little pitty pat shots in Atlanta, a bunch of them, but the other dude lands one haymaker. Well that haymaker is worth more than those pitty pat shots. So sometimes numbers don't necessarily mean, but it's good to have that information to add in addition to your calculations on how you feel about it. Just watching it. Right. So you need almost more than you watching it on your own. Because I'm not just watching it, I'm getting fed information as I'm watching it.

Speaker 4:          01:42:42       That's ideal for a judge. Not that it would really, you know, I just, not that it wouldn't help to clean house and just get people in and know what the fuck is going on in an actual fight. That certainly would be, but I also think they need access to information the way we have. They finally gave them monitors to get monitors now, which is very nice surprise. They finally gave it. Yeah. Not Everywhere, but we've done it in certain places. Emotion would strike very important. Very important as well as to have angles on shots. You know, there's sometimes it looks like a guy landed when really the guy fell, the guy slips. You know, there's, there's all sorts of weird jobs. No, it's not. It's very hard and it's not rewarded when they're good at it. No, it's the only critique when they suck at it.

Speaker 4:          01:43:22       You know, I'm, I'm, I swear to God man, when, when I have a weekend, like this weekend where we did the show at the paramount and we did the, the comedy works in Denver, uh, meet all these cool people and everything. It really does feel like this crazy fucking dream life, man. It's so fun. Everything is so fun. You've earned it and you've created, nobody earns this dude. Nobody deserves this. This is some crazy lucky shit. It ain't just that you earned it because it didn't even exist before. It's not like you say you earn being the commentator, but you know what I'm saying. Before it, before I was the commentator, the other people had done it. But I'm saying before, when I was a young man thinking about this as an aspiration, this job didn't even exist. You know, like that's just, I remember when you got it, that's like, Hey, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to do the UFC.

Speaker 4:          01:44:07       And I came down with you and I met tank Abbott back cheese. It's so fortunate though. It's ridiculous. Yeah. Jeff, that great guy, great guy, love that guy. Olympic gold medal. And it's so, it's so strange to have like that kind of a life, you know? It's so strange to have all these cool friends and to like how this dream weekend, I remember when you were all hanging around you and me and Joey Diaz and Brendan Walsh and Doug Benson, we were eating after the show, after the UFC. We were last making good wine, drinking good wine and eating sliders in buffalo wings and just killing it. All of us laughing at each other. I mean that's like, we're so fucking fortunate, man. That's what, that's what that was. So foreign message. They're like, we're so lucky we get to do what we do. We're so fortunate in every aspect in the friends that we have in our occupations and you know, it's, it's, it's completely amazing.

Speaker 4:          01:45:01       But to, to do what we did to get like this, this posse of comedians together for that show, like at the paramount that is really important. And it's one of the things that we were talking about before you got there. I was telling them like I was thanking them for coming and I was like, you guys, like there might be 2000 people out there for this show, but if you guys weren't with me, it wouldn't be half as fun because you really wouldn't even be 50% of have a fraternity. You can share it with. You know, I love watching Joey Diaz get off stage with a giant smile on his face. Just laughing his ass off. I five and so authentic and original. We had some really good talks and he's the best listener I've, I'd love. But I'll say I'm going to go anywhere at least 10 minutes to get out of the supposed to be there and have, they can suck it up because they're mine.

Speaker 4:          01:45:46       They're mine. But it's the 10 minute podcast. I guess that's not a good show. I know, but I gotta I gotta know it's actually, you know, wait, they're going to buy them. I go to go to 10 minute podcasts and listen to drunk Arnold that well Sasa does. If you don't laugh your ass off. To me, it's the best impression of all time. And it's the funniest thing I've ever done. It's a funny one because Arnold is like, I don't, I hardly do my own oppression in the morning. How many people do, Arnold is so fucking hilarious. We have some, I'm really proud of some of the things we did on that show. I mean, I like the idea. It's great idea. Great. 10 minutes. Do some fucking characters on there. Forget me. I did an ostrich expert, but that doesn't matter. Uh, it's, it's some of the funny shit. I got to go. It's an ostrich. Hi, my name is, uh, Ooh, she won't do the, and the ostrich. Uh, my, my, my specialty and the good question is, if an ostrich is a bird, why can he not?

Speaker 4:          01:46:40       And that's all I talk about. This is what we need to work with you. We need to get hit, not total Alondra with you together with your Brazilian Jujitsu character and make something happen because that rapist character is, there's two of the funniest moments in my life that I've experienced in my whole life. One of them is Joey Diaz on the Alex Jones show or Joe or they fucked up and told Joey Diaz that he didn't have to worry about swearing because this part is on the Internet and Joey Diaz has opened up a can of whoop ass on the he he it was, he was telling a story about going through the TSA with weed tucked under his balls and about how those fucking machines, they don't scan shit and you know this is your fucking tax dollars at work and the Alex Jones is going crazy. He goes check yourself before you wreck yourself.

Speaker 4:          01:47:26       Big Dixon. Yes it's bad for your help. Joel Diaz, Facebook, Twitter, stay black. And he and he leaves when he literally wrecked the room. I'm crying laughing and it's, and by the way, we got it all on video, it's all, you know, I got to see the people that say I'm exaggerating, it's all online. Joey Diaz and the Alex Jones show is a hundred versions of it on youtube cause it's so phenomenal to see this. There was that and there was you in the hotel room when we were high as fuck. And I don't even think, I think I just got the job of the UFC and we would all come out to the fight and it was, it's so fucking great guys event. I mean so barbaric and men to go to fucking jail. How'd you see that fight? Always shook. I was crazy. And afterwards we eat steaks and shit. It was just such a a boy party for you. And I actually went and looked at Randy couture and we're like, look at him, look at it and be fucking animal.

Speaker 4:          01:48:16       He had a swollen knee. I was like, Gee, you were upstairs. And we were barbecued. We were so high. And you know, we just have this group of really funny people hanging out together. So we're just making sure that lab and Brian goes into this explanation like a Jujitsu seminar and had a fuck guys basically doing hands on because I was training at [inaudible] says, and of course I have nothing but respect for hence all. Of course he was just the character, you know. And come on guys. Okay. Like that. You know, when I'd take a guy, they got a guy like that put them into the math like that, eh, there was like the way the, the all the parts of your speech or I don't know where it is, but any Bravo's video, but it was like a window like you, you had, it was like one of those things.

Speaker 4:          01:49:01       He put it on his video but he put it on there as a fortune cookie. You know what I'm talking about is I have been a calm, we have to find it, whatever. So he put it on there I think. Is that what's called the fortune cookie? Whatever the fuck it's called, when, um, when someone puts something on their DVD and you, you know, you go and find it. So he put on there like you had to press like a couple of different things for it to come up. It was one of those stupid things that people did before they realized that extra content you should let people want that people are watching. And so Eddie had that. He thought it would be really funny and I also think he was worried about it was so dirty like connecting it to his thing. I think he would do it now because like on a mastering the system you gotta be careful when you're building a brand or whatever and if you're interested in that, go to 10th Planet Jiu jitsu.com Cause Eddie's got this whole web series called mastering the system and a lot of that is with [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          01:49:49       Raja, who is this? I don't want to tell you the whole story because I don't want to give up the joke. What we'll do it but you got to get together with him and we'll do it. I'm coming back on a podcast teach guys how to get this. Guys, I want to thank you guys. Fuck yeah man.
