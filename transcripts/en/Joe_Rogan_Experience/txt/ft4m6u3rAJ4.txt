Speaker 1:          00:00:04       I get, I get heavy, you know, I'm going to talk about life and death. You talking about life around. That is what we're doing. We're living in. Some people were dying. That's life and death. We're all. What's really interesting is that we're all going to die. Yes. And, and that everybody pushes away and I guess that's normal to push away, you know, thoughts of your death, but the real enlightened, like the Buddhist Buddhism, eastern eastern and stuff, they say the way to get enlightened is to die if you can check this out, is to die before you die. Meaning lately kind of go into the fear and they claim that the fear is releasing ego, which what they mean by ego is like, like you have this beautiful studio and you have a career and a wife and a kid. Kids I guess. And, and it's like, it's like you can't be attached to it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       You have to die to that. Like in other words, you don't own your wife, you don't own anything really, because we're just, we're. The bottom line of it is, is we are temporary, yes and impermanent. And it doesn't mean you can't enjoy, you know, like you're in the prime of your life. Right? So why think about your fucking death, you know what I mean? But I think for guys like me, I'm a little older and like for some reason we're on, right? Yeah. For some reason I experienced panic attacks, um, and I had a full blown one coming up here while you're driving. Wow. I was driving. I now will feel like, okay, this is what it feels like is, um, I'm feeling kind of tired. I've been doing a lot. And that's not to brag. I, I've been, I've been in show business. What?

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       You're in show business. I'm in show business. You're doing a lot of work. I'm in show business, I'm married, I have two dogs, I have three cats. It's a, it's like to manage the dogs are, are, are, are intense, you know, because you, I love your dog. I've talked to have three. You have three? Yeah. Okay. But for me, uh, and this is, I think one of my, one of the, uh, you know why I'm a panic attack, suffer occasionally. His Dad, I get into these dogs like I, I think I'm a sign of someone who has panic attacks, is someone who cares too much about care of things instead of trusting that everything's gonna be alright. Like I to get up, I'm going to feed the dogs. The dogs will be okay. I'm always like doing stuff like, hey, my dog's name is Charlotte and Basil Charlotte.

Speaker 1:          00:03:12       Does she have something in the Charlotte or something in a right? And I blow it up a little, you know what I mean? Instead of chilling and going, oh, she'll be okay. Let me just, let me just, you know, wipe the. I'll see her like scratching at the aisle and it can set me off into this worry and I think that's kind of um, the symptom of panic attacks. Like I'm coming up here, so I get on the one on one. People who don't know the one on one. Well you should just kill yourself because the one on one is a main artery and you should know about it or what if they don't drive cars, thing. Other things to worry about. I think they're brilliant if they don't drive a. But anyway, it, it was packed. It was, you know, the Google maps was like accidents up ahead and I started to feel this kind of feeling trapped.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       Have you ever felt trapped on the highway where, uh, and, and for some reason I think because I'm overtired and I wanted to get here, this is first time I've done your podcast, I just started feeling an anxiety about, oh fuck, I'm going to be. And this is what happened. I mean, I'm doing it physically feeling I'm going to be late, I'm going to have the walls are closing in. Yes man, right? Yes. The real scary thing is the breath. Like, oh man. It's like I'm this, I'm doing it in the car. And by the way, the one thing I hate about La, I don't know about you, but like here we are in December 28th and it's hot. Yeah, it's pretty warm. It's like 75 degrees. 80. Is it 80 to 80 and the sun is blaring in, through by side window. And I'm feeling a little fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       There's nowhere. I just don't, where I can't get off, I can't, you know what I mean? It's, it's, um, so it's a buildup of anxiety instead of just going, you know, what, like your shirt, let that shit go. Let that shit go. I, I, I couldn't, I couldn't let it go. Like when I get entangled in it, when it reaches a tipping point. Right. You know, when, when the anxiety reaches a tipping point where, you know, I, I am like, Oh God, like, like here's the voice in my head that I have to always battle. It's like, Oh God, this isn't going to work out instead of, hey, you know, for some reason I have the. Oh God, okay. But you intellectualize it, right? Like, like now like we're talking about, but now now it's after it's over, you realize like, ah, I should just say, hey, let that shit go like you without any stake in the game. Right. You removed. If you were

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       giving yourself advice in that car, he'd be like to come on. I really think it's great. You're living in America. Here is few extra people on the road. Some of them bumped into each other. Let's just get through this. You know, you texted me. It's no problem. Come a little later. It's no big deal. Start a little later. It's casual. There's no, no reason to get anxious about that. Where I don't smoke pot too. Did I would understand more because people that eat edibles and then get on the one on one and get stuck in traffic and then what happens? Here's your whole world starts closing in on you. You started without the adipose. Yeah. It's the same kind of thing. It's A. I think one of the things that I've noticed a lot is a lot of people that have anxiety and a lot of people that they're generally, they're intelligent people and the problem is with intelligent people is that you're overwhelmed with possibilities.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       You're thinking about all the actual variables that are in play. Whereas dumb people just fucking stumble into walls where they're talking on their phone and you know, they're like texting and walking out into traffic. They're not thinking, you know, somehow they get things work out for them. It doesn't snow illusion. You're not living in their skin. If you were inside the nine volt battery brain, you'd be like, Oh God, this is fucking nothing to think about here. Like was it Jamie? Will you with me or is it with Tony when we're at the airport and there's this girl. I sat next to her just to listen to our conversation. I think it was Tony and she was just talking about amazing race and I wanted this team to win and I can't wait until this happens and when I get paid on Friday I'm going to buy this phone and then there's this is this food I really want to eat and it was just this droning.

Speaker 2:          00:07:39       I'm like, this might. You might as well be a robot that just sent here to consume. There's no like there was no. There was no curiosity or creativity. It was just consumption. It was just food and buy this and watch that and and drone on and on and on, and who knows if it's genetics, if it's nature or nurture or whatever it is. There's a lot of really dull folks out there and we're not supposed to do just a lot of really told folks, but the culture is also geared to consumption. I mean a lot of it is sure, isn't it? It's like it's like you turn on the fucking TV and that is the message center that our culture, that is our culture. It's a part of our culture, but our culture is pretty vast now. I would say that one, much more of our culture, the Internet much more than than mainstream media now and that's one of the reasons why they're grasping at straws, trying to stay relevant. What the mainstream media like television shows there. They're down record numbers like news is down record number to be about that. Yeah, I mean I think it the idea that these. It's great if someone is like, you know, New York Times, Time magazine, respected journalism, someone who you can go to when you really want to. What the fuck

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       is happening in Syria? I need to know, oh, I need to know from someone who's going to give me an objective informed opinion. That's, that's huge. And it's very critical, but once you get past that you're dealing a lot of the shows you're dealing with, whether it's CNN or Fox News, you're dealing with opinions and your opinion is just as valid as Shepard Smith's. Like why? Why is Shepard Smith? Because he has makeup on and he's wearing a tie and they have ready, set, go and they press the green light and what you're talking about is really interesting. How, how? Because it's just on TV because it's sanction sanction to sanction by the powers that be like, like it's really about ownership. Like, like I don't even know who owned CNN anymore. So was it Ted Turner? He probably still owns it. He's Hashtag Ball.

Speaker 3:          00:09:48       He was right? I think so. I mean he's like one of the biggest land owners in the United States. He has millions of acres. Yes, he owns buffalo. Got Restaurants were served buffalo. Unbelievable. Hashtag ball. Is that Montana? Think it's called Montana. Yeah, it's in Montana, right? You have them in Colorado. They might've been Montana as well. I think it's actually a chain. I don't know where they are, but it's supposed to be very good restaurant, but what my point was is that the structure at CNN says, well, we're going to talk about this, we're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about that. We're going to put it on TV and people watch the fuck. You know, you have to break it down to the essential is like there is a screen, it's being transmitted into your, into your home. It's been and it's, it's very much, it's very much with people not realizing it a complete fucking mind control thing or it really influences you and it takes a lot to kind of disconnect and, and for instance, I have said to myself, I am going to disconnect from the grid for a while.

Speaker 3:          00:10:57       You ever tried to do that? Like, I'm not going to go online. I'm not going to watch TV. Like, you know what I mean, but it's, it's really kind of very difficult. Might go somewhere. I go hunting. That's what I do. I go to the woods for like a week and I have no choice. Can't get cell phone signal. Can just, no Internet connection. Do you feel rejuvenated? Well, yeah, it feels good. It feels good to take breaks. You know, I, I enjoyed the Internet. I enjoy the information, but it's overwhelming and one of the reasons why it's overwhelming is we're not, we're not really accustomed to this experience. This is a very new experience for human beings. Like over the last, you know, 20 years we've options to a little bit more. Twenty four, I think 94 ish really came up. Ninety four is when I got online. Don't you sink and I really want to relate to this again, just like cut to the panic attack. I drove it up here. It's because this is, it's another form of, of the anxiety

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       that it's information overload. Overload. One hundred percent. Yeah. Because my brain, my brain, I think your brain is the same way. It's like my brain, I feel my brain just digging into shit like, oh, you know, like I'll read a paragraph on, I don't fucking know. Hunting and then you know, it'll mention something about guns and then I go to guns and then I go to gun control. Like go, I go and then I go to the scumbags who don't want gun control and then I go to a school shooting, like one thing leads to another on the internet, rabbit holes, rabbit holes to go down that rabbit hole. I was, I want to do more of this on stage, but like talking to an audience about, Hey, I've only done it once and it went over care. Okay. But it was like, hey, you ever get a, you ever go on facebook and you just start reading a fee.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       You just start reading your feed and you just get drawn into like people's random thoughts. You start connecting into their brains and you're like, oh, I get that. And then where you go wrong is there's 262 comments wound. You read the comments and you their feeds, you know, but after you fucking let's say 30 comments in. Yeah, something happens to your fucking center. Like your brain just Kinda is free forming it about. I forget what, what, what? Um, what I was. Oh, I was reading this was a, this was some threads. Somebody started this guy said, improv comedy. Improv is bullshit. It's halfassed. It's um, it's, you know, amateurish. It's like they're presenting a product that hasn't been chiseled and worked out. Whereas standup, he was, he was a proponent of Stanford and he said, stand up, you know, it's, it's chiseled and what people want is a finished product.

Speaker 1:          00:14:02       And I, you know, I, I kinda, I disagreed. I mean, I love different things at different things. So it's like some people enjoy jazz. Yes. That's what I love. Yeah. They, some people enjoy symphonies, some people like to go to see an orchestra. They want to say everything that's been perfectly tuned and, and just gotten to this point of perfection where they were great. Great too. It's all. Look, it's great to watch someone's finished set. Yeah. I loved watching your thing about how America is now a whore and we're driving with trump like you, you did that thing with up. But I do my bit and no, but, but here's the thing is that you get sucked in because the way the guy on the Internet, and this is what

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       happens on the Internet a lot, the way they guy who said Improv socks, that's how we framed it. This sucks, this is good. And then it's a thing that then your, then your ego gets involved. Like I think I even know I didn't engage in that one, which is really good. Here's the thing, he's right to him. For him. He's right. It's just, he phrased it wrong. If you said the what I like is standup because I'm like a polished product. I don't like Improv because it feels amateurish to me and people could say I disagree. I love Improv because it's wild. I like that feeling of being in the audience where someone yells out, you know, genre, World War Two films and you know, that they're, they're scrambling and they fucking try to pretend they're into the, in the, what's that called? The tunnels for trenches trenches.

Speaker 3:          00:15:43       I, yeah, I, I build trenches and I have mustard gas at home. It's grey. Poupon mustard gas, grey poupon, mustard gas. I think that, uh, there's nothing wrong with having opinions on things, but people don't like that. Your opinions are different than theirs and they get mad at you. Like some people get mad at you if you like a certain kind of music. It's crazy. But they'll get mad. Like, your tastes sucks. You're tasting music sucks. But here's the thing. What we're talking about is that that's what's going on a lot on the internet. Yeah, you suck, you suck, you suck, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong. Definitely wrong. And, and I think it's really reached a fuck in a heightened state because of the politics in the country. Like another words, it, it filters down to where the president stands up with the president insults people constantly.

Speaker 3:          00:16:34       That's all he does. That's what he's a divisive. You know what I mean? This is not new, but that's how he, he operates. He's very manipulative in the fact that he usually, he's very praising of some people, you know, like doing an amazing job. Beautiful job. The other day he was talking about these firefighters and he had all these firefighters behind him and he was talking about what a great job they're doing as firefighters and it's just like this weird speech and now going to go see each other on tv and like, you know, I don't think they get enough credit and so he'll, he'll like bestow. It's very interesting method course is going to bestow preys on the firefighters. You would say that right. But only if it's convenient for him. Like about John Mccain who was a fucking war hero. He was like, I like people that don't get captured like Jesus Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:17:21       Like he had like six deferments. Like, Yo, I had a hangnail, like I can't go to war. He had a gang of deferments and meanwhile he's saying something about John fucking mccain who a legitimate war hero who was captured and tortured by the Viet Cong and he had the balls to say, I like people that have been. I mean that's effecting the military at all. Didn't. No, but here's the question. Has He get away with that? Shit just does because this just who he is. It's like if you look, if you know someone's a scumbag, like then the scumbag behavior is like, wow, that's fucking, that's Mike. That's what he does. Right? But if Mike is a priest and it turns out and what Mike really likes doing is smoking crack and below and guys, you know, you find out, you're like, oh Jesus, Mike, I thought you were this other thing, but if Mike is Andy Dick and you found out how many dicks out there smoking crack and blowing guys like, oh andy, it's trump is Andy Dick.

Speaker 3:          00:18:19       He's who he is. He, that's his thing is you come after him, he comes after you. And we just sort of assumed that once he became president he would stop doing that and he would act hashtag presidential. He's not at all. No, he can't help himself making it all about himself. And it's interesting. Back to the Internet Shit. And what is going on? Uh, you know, just for instance, taking that example of Improv, stand up is the best, right? It is. The guy who wrote Improv sucks. The Guy, you know, the guy who started the thread, it's like, it's like what they're doing and what trump is doing. It's like shit is all about what I think and I know you're gonna come at me, but that's what I want. I want, you know, the attention. I mean, I really think it comes down to I want to fight.

Speaker 3:          00:19:17       I wanna fight, you know, I want an ego fight. I wanna fight and I want the attention. There's certainly a little bit of that, but I also think she wants repercussions for challenging him. He wants people to feel he wants to punish him. He wants people to feel very uncomfortable if they challenge him, I think that's a big part of his game. You know? And he wants everyone to know that he's going to come after you, like as the president, he's going to come after you. And if he does, all the trumpkins are gonna come after you too. Because if he comes after you, then all of these, these puppets, these people that follow him that literally are on there all day long, like you really have to realize that some of the people that are online that are tweeting for trump or treating about certain things, whether it's on there all day, by the way, I'll follow people just to see how crazy they are just to get it in my head like, oh, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:20:05       I see what you do. You do this all day. You, you, you start tweeting at 7:30 in the morning with your first cup of coffee. You're hurling insults and you do it til 1:00 in the morning and then you start all over again in the morning. How did they do that? Because their credit go insane. I find, I don't know about you, but if I spend an hour on that kind of rabbit hole with twitter or facebook at my limit, I think is about an hour before I. it. It just something says to me, I need to, I need to get out. I need to walk, I need to do, do something. I need to get away, you know what I think is happening in this, I've been thinking about this a lot over the last week. I think humanity is in the process of an overwhelming transformation that something like giving birth. I agree and I think that like if you ever watched someone give birth, like the crazy thing is how much, how much pain the women are in. Like when I watched my daughter come out of my wife, I was like, Whoa, that's a lot of work. Like it's fucking painful and it's crazy and they're talking about

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       blood in. It's just, it's not even the president at birth, it's like this. It's like, ah, but then boom. Did you film it most unbelievable love comes out of it. Yes I did. But the most unbelievable love comes out of it. And then it's like, oh my God, and the way you feel is incredible. And it's like, I think there's a, you got to go through hell to figure out how to, how to handle this better. And I think culturally we're going through a weird kind of hell in this kind of health. Avoidable look, you could just put that phone down and you can just go hiking, go with a good friend, bring your dog, go have a nice day. Sit Up there, you know, crack open a cold glass of water and look over at the landscape and go, man, it's fucking beautiful and it does something to you when you look at beautiful things, right? You can do that, but you might want to just check your twitter real quick. See if anybody respond to that real witty posts that you left there. Oh, they get any likes? Oh fuck you. I didn't say that. That's not what I meant. And then he and then he start the wheels start turning.

Speaker 3:          00:22:11       Exactly. You know, they did a study. I don't know if you're heard about this one, that just turning off the phone. Like if you have the phone in the room with you and you turn it off, you think, okay, the phone's turned off. I'm cool. What the scientists said it was a study. I'm not sure where the study was, but they said, no, no, no. You have to put the fucking phone out of into another room. They said something about someone's call you. What if you get a text or if someone sends you off, but what if there's a cool instagram posts that you'd miss? Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       Like everybody's worried about,

Speaker 3:          00:22:48       I think does all the chaos that's going on the world now. A really thing that we're in this unbelievably tumultuous time in human history at. We're not designed to have access to information 24 slash seven like we do. It's all about information. It's connection and information. Those two things, those two things are critical. It's all about information, but I think even more like insidious is the way the information is given. Like here you got our president just basically like a prick the way he fucking hates this year, but he takes pride in it, right? That's part of who he is. Said say it's regular guy. See what if you're a regular guy and you're a media figure, like a some fucking. Who's the guy from American idol was that guy's that mean Guy Simon, that guy like he's a dick. You know, everybody knows he's a Dick.

Speaker 3:          00:23:50       Like that's the brand that was trump's brande. You're fired. That was his brand. So it's reinforced with public acceptance. It was reinforced with the tension. It was reinforced with like, he knew that that is what got him the credit, that he is so gravely desired. And so then that allowed him to run for president. Right. He runs for president. Yeah. Coming off of a reality show, they canceled his fucking reality show while he was running for president. Remember I taught Schwartzenegger took it over? No, they canceled it because he was the pr because he was running for president. He was saying things about Mexicans. Then Swartz, nigger took it over, but his. They fired him, I should say and can't say, but they fired him. NBC fired him from the show because the things that he was saying about Mexicans and that's really where it all came from.

Speaker 3:          00:24:35       So he was a fucking literally an on TV reality star on a, on a shitty game show. And then from there it goes on to be president. So that style of car, he's not going to like have this moment of reflection. At seven years old we realized this has all been a terrible. Like I have this amazing responsibility. Now I'm in charge of the greatest nuclear. Yeah, you think you would, but why would he? Because he's just a person. I think we have these narratives in our head that these people become heroes. That a president is something different than a person. Yeah. Well I would just think to that if that. Yeah, I get who he is, but it's like God damn it. Don't you get also influenced and formed by that, by that way of the job. Like yes, you do have, and this is the scary point.

Speaker 3:          00:25:25       You do have a nuclear arsenal at your disposal. Edit his fucking dangerous because you know you're dealing with another fucking lunatic. You know what I mean? Crazy. Yeah. I mean they found each other. You know what I mean? I mean, it's kind of a love story. Yeah. Well, in a way there's an argument and this is the argument that a guy like trump is actually good in this situation because a guy who is too diplomatic and it would allow this guy to develop real long range nuclear capabilities that it'd be extremely dangerous and that with a guy who was harassing him and fucking with him like the way trump does, and then you allow the military to do something to stop this guy from developing these long range nuclear capabilities that this would be better than having some very wishy washy president who, uh, put, put severe restrictions in the military and didn't allow them to stop this guy. We would all like to think that the world is like we are here. We are here in the United States for the most part. Pretty safe. Not a bad place to be. You know, most neighborhoods, even in bad neighborhoods,

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       most of the time it's not that bad. Occasionally bad shit happens regularly. Bad Shit happens, but not like it happens in the Congo, you know, not like it happens in Syria right now. Not like Aleppo, not like all these other other parts of the world that are in constant turmoil. Libya, go to Libya right now. It's fucking Kate. It's a failed state. It's an isis hotbed, right? There's parts of the world that are just fucked and if you're not the kind of person that is willing to do something to protect the rest of the people from getting involved in the kind of chaos. It's in those parts of the world. That stuff can leak over. Bad people can come in to your neck of the woods and start treating where you live. Exactly how they treat Syria. Exactly how they treat the Congo. It's totally possible.

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       Absolutely. But I'm a believer that if this bad stuff, and it is what you're talking about, what you you mentioned is horrific stuff. Like if you go in, I mean Aleppo, if you've seen pictures of it, it's. It literally is a wasteland and now it has been a lot of palm doubt. Yeah. You know, and the suffering that those people have endured and the amount of refugees in the world has gone up and up and up to me. I don't think you can isolate that. I really don't. I, I think that has to come back to roost in some ways and it does. I mean, it's kind of random incidents of terrorism. In other words, what I'm saying is that we have to have more of a, like unified worldview light, like seriously have a compassion for him. I know this guy but, but for everybody, like, like, oh no, fuck, fuck, Syria, Libya, Iraq, you know, they're bad. No, because if the world is kind of a small place, especially with technology these days, you know, and if, if there are thousands and thousands of refugees because of bombings, you know, people, they seek revenge. They, they, they, they grow up and hate, they, they, they grow up of course. But what are you saying? I'm saying that I'm saying that that does affect us. Like you originally said, well we live in a nice place where it is kind of basically. Okay. And I say that I don't know how long that can exist without

Speaker 2:          00:29:29       all of the turmoil. What I'm saying is if you're living in the United States and you're living in a fairly peaceful place, you have to take into consideration that there are people out there like Kim Jong Aoun who do regularly killed their, who regularly kills people who are insubordinate, who regularly kills anyone who thinks, who would challenge him in any way, and then he has nuclear powers and he is going to do something and it's entirely possible that he could launch a missile. It's entire. He's so fucking crazy. It's entirely possible that he could do it in some sort of a suicide mission and then he could launch a nuclear strike on the United States in a suicide mission. If he gets the capabilities. Some people, it really depends entirely on how that's managed, but there are people that would manage that incorrectly and he could get to the point where he has those nuclear capabilities and he could launch and he could do something that has to be taken into consideration.

Speaker 2:          00:30:23       We've done it. We did it to Hiroshima, we did it to Nagasaki. We lose. We literally dropped indiscriminant bombs on entire cities, so that's unbelievable. Crazy and it just happened. Just happened on 100 years ago. Not even right. Isn't it interesting how, how most people don't have a sense of time and history. Eighty fucking years is nothing. It's nothing, nothing that's nothing, but the modern day person is like, you know what, a long time is 45 minutes ago on my twitter feed. Like that's 45 minutes ago that someone gives you a, an article, they send you an article but growth from 2013 just like, whoa, that's four years ago is nothing. I get caught up in that shit. Like, like, you know what I love watching documentaries is because it reminds me, holy fuck. Yes. A lot of the same shit went down in 1960. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:31:14       Sure. Like demonstrations, you know, Nixon was in power. We had Vietnam going on. You know what I mean? I think there's always been a problem with people feeling like they're represented and communication. Those, those two problems have always existed. It just exists today in a different way almost. We almost have too much communication. Well, that's what I mean, too much information. A little bit. Yeah, for sure. And I think you're definitely right that we have to think of the whole world as being a like one thing instead of walling things off and. But the problem is when you pull over, right? Yes. But you get a little scared. I mean sometimes fuck, but you have someone who's a military dictator like Kim John Loon. That's a totally different situation. Like he won't let the people live. He shoots them when they try to leave like this is.

Speaker 2:          00:32:02       This is a very, very bad thing to be seeing in 2017. That's entirely different than someone who is a Syrian refugee who those people are fleeing for their lives and obviously they're in incredibly hostile environments and situations, but there are substantial parts of the world that welcome those people and want those people to have an opportunity to get away from what they're experiencing. You know, there's a lot of people in this country that argue for bringing them over here and helping those people. So I think our compassion is still there, but people don't want to be unsafe themselves. You know, I think we, I think we will eventually these boundaries will become more and more preposterous. These lines in the ground that we've drawn where we've decide like this is, you know, we are Canada and we are against you America and you're connected to us by the same dirt like we were tribes and the tribes that were tribe earth.

Speaker 2:          00:32:54       Okay. You know, and I think once we realized that will be a lot better off, but then we're going to have to really understand the allocation of resources. Yes. Yes. Are you talking about also distribution of wealth, which is kind of another way to put allocation of resources? Well, I'm talking about fixing places where there's no hope. You know, I mean it's, you could say that it's allocation of wealth. Like one of the things you think about, like when like Halliburton got these no bid deals to go into Iraq and build these things and why can't someone get the same sort of contracts to go in and established established places like in the United States? Like established community centers in impoverished neighborhoods do the same thing to Guadalajara, go into Tiawana and try to like set it. Here's the answer. I think. I mean this is my trip, not trip, but like my bent is like, um, there is just like what you're talking about, community building, you know, going into places, setting up education centers, it, it doesn't seem to be a priority when it was not profitable.

Speaker 2:          00:34:09       Yes. Right. But war war is a huge profitable. Rebuilding is profitable. That's what I'm saying. Halliburton is rebuilding and rebuilding his problem. And what do you need to rebuild? You need to fucking knock it down first. Right? And that, that's weird, right? Because things are already knocked down, but rebuilding them is now profitable. What do you mean? Oh, parts of the world are already fucked. But going in them and in rebuilding, you know, going to impoverished parts of Ecuador and rebuilding that and try to, you know, make it so that these people have opportunities to advance their lives and take care of their families and there's no money in that. Why isn't their money of that? I don't know. What's weird that we know that everything is about where there's money, you know, and that like, look at how much the, that's the problem. Look at China, right?

Speaker 2:          00:35:01       Look at how much their, um, their, their, their way of life has improved since capitalism sort of been installed. Like the amount of people that are in poverty in China. I was just reading this like the, the staggering change since what's close to capitalism capitalism, but they have a lot more restrictions on what they're allowed to do and not do. You know, in China they still can't research tenement, square research it. What happened? Yeah. You can't find out about it. Yeah, that's crazy. That's crazy. And I feel like when you do that to people, if you say to people, look, you can't, you can't look into that. Isn't there immediately like, I don't trust you. Like you, like it's immediate. It's a dictatorship. You know? And that's, that's what, that's the crazy thing about Kim Jong wound. That's the crazy thing about China. Anytime you're in a situation where you have a dictatorship, you have a group or a person who's controlling the inflammation that gets distributed to the people and then the people who are under the thumb of this person, and then when this person says something, that thing is the law.

Speaker 2:          00:36:06       That is one of the scariest things about trump is that what essentially trump is doing is treating his word as law and saying that everyone else is fake news and they're all liars and everyone who poses him, they cannot have a reasonable opposition of him. Any, any opposition must be chastised. If he wasn't within our system, he'd be a fucking Dick. I mean, he is that personality. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, he's in this, this thing with the FBI, you know about this, right? Where they're investigating the unnatural where it's at. He's talking about fire read fucking Miller. Yeah. As he's talking about, I'm still not sure. I think he knows and the people around him know that, dude, you cannot do that because I think that will. I think you're going to fuck with the wrong people. They're like, you still could fuck with the world.

Speaker 2:          00:36:58       People within this country already fucked with the wrong people is fuck with the intelligence community. It means fuck with the CIA and the FBI and they're all like, Jesus Christ, this guy. But here's the thing. At the FDA for him, it's certainly not as dangerous. It wasn't the sixties. It's harder to kill a president today, but the FBI, it's just stopped a terrorist attack in San Francisco. This. Yes, you don't hear about it because the president hasn't talked about it in the news that talked about it a little more to happen. There was a planned isis terror attack at one of the peers in San Francisco and this guy who was a former soldier was planning it and reached out to isis and was trying to do in the US soldiers. You're a soldier. Look at that. Yeah. Well, you know, you get crazy on all sides, but that's what I mean about, you know, when there is bad conditions all over the world, it filters and that's one way, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:37:48       Yeah. But this is a guy who was an American citizen that wants to attack random American civilians. You know, this is a crazy person who was the person who have blown a fuse and was just going to do this for Isis and was doing it publicly on facebook was it was reaching out to these people. So he was. He had a blown fuse for sure. He didn't understand what he was doing or understand that obviously people are going to be paying attention to these fucking isis pages. Isn't it wild that people publicly put this shit out on facebook? It's wild, but it's not wild. I mean, there's a lot of doll mines out there. But anyway, the point is that the FBI thwarted this attack. President hasn't said a Goddamn word about it. He's praising these firefighters doing an amazing job mazing job. But he's not saying anything. I wonder if, because I wonder if it's because wants everybody

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       to think, hey look, there's no. There's no terrorists or activity going on and just want to praise the FBI. Well that's. That's fucked up. I think that's exactly what it is. I think he's against getting groceries. Getting investigated. Yeah, because he has a vendetta against the FBI. He's at war with the FBI. It's crazy. It's crazy. This is a crazy situation where someone have this mindset is running the country and some people love it. They love it mag. Uh, we're going to get things done. Look at the job list. Snus rate is down, unemployment is down. There's all this good stuff is happening. The stock market is hitting record high. It's hilarious about when they talk about the stock market. I'm hitting record highs first of all. I think it's a fact that 50 percent of America is in poverty. Five. Oh, you agree with that stat? I don't know. Is that real? Yeah. I mean you could look it up, but it's poverty. It's a certain level of income and I've forgotten what it means.

Speaker 3:          00:39:41       What is the number? Is it like I'm not $20,000 or. Yeah, it's around 30,000. Yeah, it's around there and I find out. I think also it. I think it also talks about benefits and that was just an article man at the Washington Post, dude. About how people in their seventies are having to take full time jobs because their pensions have been taking away. I'm in corporate America is taking away shit. Well Jamie was just talking about this yesterday about how uh, like companies are selling you the same product but now it has like a half an ounce less than it used to before and the boxes are slightly smaller and I just bought two boxes of cereal yesterday and they both say they're 12 ounces, one's 12 ounces and one's 12 point one ounces, but the boxes are not even close to the same size, same cereal to rights checks.

Speaker 3:          00:40:34       So it's the same shape. Cereal and everything. You told her that they're lying or do you think that they've figured out a way to get 12 ounces in a smaller box because you know how you would open up cereal and then there would be like a little air space and then you'd get to the package and then there's a little air that package. Cereal might be a bad example, but gatorade for example was a 20. It's 28 ounces now, used to be a 32 ounces for three years ago. A perfect example of like taking you pay more and get less. Well, they just this. It's just a fact. Infinite growth. That paradigm that corporations operate under where you constantly have to improve every quarter you have to make more money. You have an obligation to the same. It's crazy. It's like, how come you can't make. Listen if you make $100,000,000 in your corporation this year, why can't you make $100 million next year? And everybody's happy. Like, yeah. I mean isn't that the isn't? Yeah. Isn't that the textbook definition of greed? See this three different size cups appear to hold the same amount of soda,

Speaker 4:          00:41:35       might be a sponge and the bottom of one of them you can't really tell, but it just, like I said, this guy did this four or five times to sort of prove that there wasn't. This is a small medium and like super large sized cup and they all hold the same amount of liquid. Huh? Super Strange. This was explained to you yesterday that Bra, Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:41:57       See this a daily mail's super sketchy, but that's just where they sat in England. Yeah, the Daily Mail. Like they, they, they, they're super sketchy with staff. They're super sketchy. Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's definitely a problem with that. We have with the system that's in place in terms of like how corporations get treated as individuals, right? They're allowed to donate enormous sums of money now, and this is a fairly recent within the last decade, the way that the structure has changed and then there's also the diffusion of responsibility inside the corporation. If you work for a big evil corporation, but you're a good guy, you're ready pepitone, you're a good guy. You waived your neighbor, you know, you give money to charity, but meanwhile you're making toxic sludge that's killing people in the Philippines or wherever the fuck it is. You know, you know how it goes. Yeah, it is how it goes, and that's how it goes.

Speaker 3:          00:42:51       Also to justify this infinite growth idea. This corporation keeps growing and keeps growing, keeps growing. That's why trump is opening up these national monuments for drilling wells. That's really fucked. I knew an outdoors guy. Scary, scary shit. It's really scary shit. But Natalie is scary. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's an affront. It's like, no, no, I don't take away our fucking land because to me I get talking about, you know, circling back to the panic, I feel like, wow, these motherfuckers, these core corporate greed, let's call it. Right? And that's where patients and it's, it's endless. They're taking away our places where we get some serenity. Where were we fucking connect to nature, you know, like the, the lifeblood of it. You know what I mean? They want to me and I, to me, they're taking, they want everything fucked up about it. It's, it's, it is Americans land, right?

Speaker 3:          00:43:54       Is the public's land. And so if they're going to go to these areas and extract resources, why should they have those resources? Why? Why are we allowing them to take the oil out of these spots? Why are we allowing them to take the minerals out of these spots like these? These are, these are not there for your disposal. This is American land, this is the public's land. These corporations that want to come in and start drilling and mining in these areas, it's sanctioned, stealing and then, and then to like jump to an issue one step further. What the fuck? We're the only country who pulled out

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       of the climate accord right now. Are you with me that it isn't climate change is climate breakdown that's going on and, and, and anybody you've had scientists on if they talked, have you had an environmentalist on talking about this shit? Um, I mean just here in La this past summer. You live in the valley too? Yeah. I never experienced like d, it was 115 for 10 days and not 110 for like three days in a row. And then I was starting 2016 year one day. I remember telling my wife, hey honey, it's only one on one. They were beating me down to like, sweetie, it's kind of Nice. It's only 103 today. You know what I mean? But, but my point is, is that they're taking land to do more oil drilling, to do fucking fracking, do that kind of stuff. Where the fuck is that? Why aren't we going completely toward solar wind phase II?

Speaker 1:          00:45:37       That shit out, especially in California, if you fly over California, you see very few clouds and all the rooftops like these rooftops should all be solar panels. If they were, we would have almost no need for external power. It's sunny 24 slash seven here and and if it's not today, within five years or 10 years, as the technology improves, there would be a way to extract all of our needs from solar power. That's, that's what I'm saying we should do instead of fucking opening up laminate problem is like there's so much money in that oil and we still rely on it so heavily right now and they're not. They're not thinking about the future. They're thinking about right now. Right now we can get that the thing. Here's the thing, they're not thinking about the future dude not be a future. And I know that's really like, like I don't want to be like, you know, but scientists really well known scientists are saying, you know, these hurricanes are the beginning, you know, the massive ones we had that buried use.

Speaker 1:          00:46:38       Then you know that Barry, there were a couple that really fucked up and they're going to be the norm and also the constant heat out here in la. I mean, you know what really freaked me out for wildfires in December. Yeah. The big one that's still going on right now. They haven't even put it out in Ventura. Yeah. Jamie was saying yesterday, it's not totally contained, right? It's still 90 percent. It's like that fucking crazy. It's been going on for weeks at Thomas Fire. Gigantic fire. It's, I mean it's an enormous fire. Hundreds of thousands of acres and a terrifying. By the way, the firefighters out here, I cannot believe what they do animals, but you know, apparently they have a lot of prisoners that they make fight the fires for like a dollar an hour. Yeah. It's like part of the Gig that's fucked up. Yeah. You got to fake your own. You've got to just run into

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       that fire, get three. But I think a lot of them, like you have chicken shit, it's fucked up, but it's fucked up. My car can get a fucking dollar an hour for work. Like why is it okay to like that slavery is slavery. Like if their work, like I used to think that about license plates, like that was always the big thing. Like in, in Massachusetts that was always a joke that like every two years a new comedian would come up with the same show because it was so obvious is that a new Hampshire, the license plates say live free or die. And I'm like, uh, those plates are made by prisoners. And that was what was crazy. It was like, that was always the thing that was always the thing about license plates. They were made by prisoners, right. That was always the reference that we would talk about how you're going to go sent upstate and you gotta make license plates.

Speaker 3:          00:48:19       It was, that was what people did. But when you make those license plates, you're making like thirty cents a day or whatever the fuck you're making. Well again, that gets back to corporate greed. Like I was reading about that stuff like verizon, I don't know, there's so many big corporations using prison labor to make stuff for them and prisoners also get charged. They get charged, I don't know where the fuck they come up with the money, but they get charged all these shit. Like if you want to make calls, if you have to buy your own fucking uniforms, it's like, yeah, well they're being punished. I get, I get the idea behind it, but it isn't punishment. You have to be fucking confined space, you know? I guess now you have to work. Well the idea is that someone's profiting from it. That's where it gets super squirrely.

Speaker 3:          00:49:08       It's like, wait a minute, okay, I get the fact they're being punished, but who's making the money? Is the money going to the victims of these crimes? No. Okay. So there's one thing if you made a guy like say if a guy robbed your house, right? And then he goes to jail and then he makes a thirty cents an hour. The, the state should pay him. Like what a normal working wage would be like 25 bucks an hour, whatever it is for this job this guy is doing. And then you get all the rest. Absolutely dickheads working for you while he's in the pokey and he's making thirty cents an hour because he broke in your house. No, no. He's working for verizon. Yeah, that's what's weird. He's working for some company that's willing to pay for those services at an exorbitantly discounted rate. Yeah. Now it's not.

Speaker 3:          00:49:49       It's all not good man. And here's the thing. You can't keep an eye on all of it. He can't keep an eye on what's happening. And then the private prison structure and then we know what happened with Bernie Sanders. His wife is involved in what the college went under because of how is he legit? How many vacation homes is he happy. And then you look at Hillary Clinton. Wait a minute. Wait, hold on. Hold on. What's this? Clinton Foundation? How much money. She didn't know what she was opposed to gay marriage until 2030 years. You'll be overwhelmed. You'll be overwhelmed with all the different people and all the different scandals and all the different possibilities and you're in your car and you're on the one on one and you're freaking the fuck out. Eddie pepitone.

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       That's what it is, why you have to go into nature, you know, you have to go into nature, kind of disconnect a magnet.

Speaker 2:          00:50:38       The native American Indians knew how to do that. Yeah. They knew how to do it, but that's all they had. They didn't have cell phones. It's not like they made a choice, you know, it was interesting how you taking that shit away from them by saying that, no, I had sebastian younger, uh, on the podcast. He's an author, a brilliant guy, and one of the things that he was saying was that, um, during the revolutionary war, or I'm sorry, during the time of colonization where the Europeans are moving across America, some of them were kidnapped by these native American tribes. And then when they were rescued by the soldiers, they resisted. A lot of them wanted to stay the native Americans and some of them moved in with the tribes. Like some people, like voluntarily moved into tribe. What does that tell you? Well, this is what he said. No one did it the other way. The native Americans did not join the Western civilization. They, they didn't like the only force. Did they join the cities and move into these towns? They wanted to be with native Americans. Well, they wanted to live the natural way, the way they've been living forever. Their system is attuned to.

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       Yeah. Do you feel it? Because I originally started, started this off with talking about anxiety and and as we've been talking, I think the one of the biggest causes of anxiety is disconnection. Disconnection from mother earth disconnection, disconnection from the heart of life, like disconnection. I don't know man, but, but, but, but, but on, on top of that than what's fueling that disconnection is this incredible technology where you're bombarded with information about everything and you're trying to make some fucking sense of it and your brain overloads and then. And then the bigger picture almost is that there are people in power and there are people in power. I don't know if it's a conspiracy, but these people own everything they fucking own just about everything.

Speaker 2:          00:52:51       Owning more where we're talking about a bunch of different issues here. Then if you put in all these things together, trying to put them together, that what you're saying about people being disconnected and being overwhelmed by that, all that stuff to think about that's real because you're supposed to be thinking about your immediate area and what the threats are and your immediate environment and where your friends are. Where's the community? Where's their communities? I mean they. They talk about this community is breaking down like, like we have a comedy community. Don't you think that's a big thing like our community, like especially the comedy store. There's one of the cool things about the comedy store is we all go there and we see other and it's like very, very friendly and supportive. I think it's huge. Huge, so rare.

Speaker 1:          00:53:29       I mean I, I, I, I realized that dad is what we're talking about. Like you need you, you ever have a fucking thing where you're like flipping out about something and then you make one phone call or see one friend and the problem goes away. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:53:46       Especially if you, maybe you and a friend are in some sort of a disagreement and you thought that they thought this thing and they thought that you thought that thing and you get to talk and especially if you meet each other and your friends like, no, I thought this and you're like, ah, I thought you thought that. And they're like, ah, and then everybody's happy. So you were stressed out and freaked out and nervous and feeling weird about talking to that person. But then once you talk to them, everything's smoothed away. Yeah, yeah. That's, I don't know if people. I think when you're doing that online thing and you're spending your day online or even texting, like I have to text friends and that's, you know, but I see them. Those are weird. I have a few of those, a lot of east coast buddies still. I just texted them every couple of months we text back and forth.

Speaker 1:          00:54:32       Isn't to say it's like there's something missing. No, but if they call I won't answer the call. I look at that time for a conversation right now. Send me a text.

Speaker 2:          00:54:42       I mean, texts, I'll get back to you, but I'm in the middle of doing my ads here and I've got to fucking write this bit and I wrote a fucking go somewhere and I got to work out an hour and.

Speaker 1:          00:54:54       But um, yeah, but I, I think, you know, and, and we're all busy. I get that too. But it's like we, we, we have to find time for the kids

Speaker 2:          00:55:03       community. I mean, I'm find time for being a human, an actual human and are a huge part of being human is interacting with other humans. We need each other. The worst thing they can do to you in prison has put you in solitary. I think of that. The worst thing they can do, you're, you're locked up in a cement cage filled with murderers and rapists and criminals in the worst they can, they can do is to leave you alone. Yeah. Isn't, that is the big punishment is not like letting you go out and hang out with all the guys in the cafeteria. No. Yeah. Punishment is putting you in a room, taking away your clothes.

Speaker 1:          00:55:38       So. So just getting back to the technology, I think voyeurism is fucking killing people. We've become like this nation of lawyers, like just like what I was. I went to a little birthday party yesterday and a bar and it's not to brag and silver lake like bragging about silver lake, I don't like silver lake anyway. You don't. I don't think I do. I'm also, I'm also the guy who likes who makes immediate judgments places without really knowing them. I think that's a comic thing to do for sure. Absolute bullshit. Oranges suck or fuck what's wrong with overlay? No, but I do. I just want to talk about voyeurism and technology. So. So I was trying to do the thing. We were talking about fucking hanging with people around us in this bar. We're five fucking television screens and, and I'm the type of guy and again, it's my anxiety, like my tension in me.

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       I wanted to go and go, can you please. And this is how I would say it too, which is why I never get anything done. I go, would you please turn off the fucking televisions? By the way? They didn't even have a fight on, they didn't even have a good game on it because the games were over something and it was just showing random dumb shit. Like, I don't know, one was a reality show where people doing weird things, you know what I mean? And it's so loud and my vision was drawn to this shit constantly and it was like, no man, this is the problem. This is. It was right there instead. But if you own a bar and you want people to come in and spend a lot of money, you gotta give them something to stare at the problem. You can have acute community bar, like when them little pubs in England, you know, it's been around for a thousand.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       They don't have the TV's right. I doubt it. I don't know. I've never been to one, but I would assume if they're a thousand years old, they don't fucking stick giant flat screens everywhere. Right. But what about if we give it a shot where if I owned a bar in silver lake fucking someone said it would be funny if I just had one black and white and I'm just showing old Joe Louis fights on it. Like really small. Absolutely. Cool. Joe Louis versus. Who is the guy that he had these great fights with? Was it Max? Max Schmeling, yeah. Yeah. Maximum. Ellen was unfairly thought of as a Nazi. He was really just a German. You just a German guy who was a boxer who really didn't want to represent Hitler apparently, from what I've read. Yeah. It was a big rival of Louis where they had these incredible. He stopped Lewis and the first fight and then Louis destroyed him in the second fight.

Speaker 1:          00:58:30       And the big thing about him beating Louis was that he beat Louis and Louis was that he stopped Louis. Hmm. Uh, I think he. Did he think he did an in Louis? Hardly ever. I mean, did he lose one? Two fights was at he lose. He lost quite a few when he got older and his career lost to rocky Marciano by brutal knockout and um, but that was, he was quite a bit older. I think he was in his forties at the time, but I think um, when he had the rematch, I think he, I think Max schmeling might have killed him. And then when he had the rematch he destroyed Max schmeling. Here it is a loss by K. Oh yeah. Does it say what round 12 out of 36. Yeah. And then he came back. There was another guy, he came back and he was a giant hero when he knocked out smelling in the first round. Scroll up all the way. How many years later was that? Eight 38?

Speaker 3:          00:59:21       Yeah. So you remembered first round? Yeah. Oh, he smashed him. Yeah. I mean that was when Joe Lewis was Joe Lewis. I mean that was when he had really come into his own. And then he went on this incredible tear. They used to call it the bottom of the month club because he was just locked, knocking out anybody who's willing to get in there with him. Yeah, he, he thought some legit guys and billy conn found them a couple of times who was actually a light heavyweight buddy bear. Was that Max Baer's? It says disqualified. You see that 49 and one. I don't know what happened there. I wonder if that's a relation to Max Baer. Probably the 19 thirties. Must have been. He imagined going back to the thirties and forties. So look at this. He was the champ all the way up to Ezzard Charles in 1950. Think of that.

Speaker 3:          01:00:08       And he started in [inaudible] 36. So the fight with the first fight with Max Baer was 36 with Max schmeling rather was a 30. Hold on right there. He. Yeah. So he rematched them in 38. The first fight was in 36 and then he was all the way the fuck scroll all the way up to the top. By the time he lost he lost the Jersey. Joe Walcott a unanimous decision in 1950. That's incredible. That's 14 years later. Wow. Fucking crazy. No, his first loss was to Ezra. Charles, sorry. Yeah, he Kao Jersey. Joe Walcott, by the way, that you know, Yankee stadium was the venue for less Chicago Stadium and these were huge events. He won a bunch of fights after that. He lost the unanimous decision, scroll all the way up and then lost again to rocky Marciano. So you really only lost three times. It looks like a believable three big ones in the later stages of his career.

Speaker 3:          01:01:06       Unless he lost earlier. What's his overall record? It was 66 and three according to that. So three losses. So one max mayor, the brutal one to rocky Marciano, which ended his career. Did you see that Charles? The brutal one? Yeah. You want to watch it? I, I, I love, I love. I grew up watching boxing. Did Ya? Yeah. And it wasn't paperview it was ABC 59. Yeah, it was like, it was like network back then. There was something, it wasn't paper view and they were free tv and I really got into the sport like I was like, I would be like so psyched to see this shit. I'd be like, I would watch you remember a guy named Oscar Bona. Bona point of view. He was like a bro. He was just like this kind of wild brawler, but it was a big guy and he'd fight guys like, uh, I don't know if he changed his name yet. Cassius clay. Oh, what's this? This is jersey. This is a, as a Charles, right? Is that as a charles the loss, but that's not the one we want to see. Want to see the rocky Marciano one. This was the one where as a Charles the first guy to beat him and he beat him by unanimous decision, but we look, first of all, look how much smaller were back then,

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       like rocky Marciano when he won, the heavyweight title was 15 pounds lighter than me. Is that right? Yeah. Think of that. And I think he was only five, 10 and that might've been bullshit. You know, like people were a little sketchy about how tall they were back then. You know, try to find that rocky Marciano one this. Um, yeah. I mean he, I believe at the time, I think when he was the champ, he was 185 pounds, maybe one 90 and Seattle was known like, like Marcy Ghana was known for like just having unbelievable strength and his punches. Like she fucking is this. Yeah, that's what he was. He was like, this is this hitting. Yeah. This would think of an immigrant brock town brawl. Like he was from Massachusetts, Brockton mass. He looked small. Yeah. Yeah. He's 15 pounds lighter than me. Man. Louis Louis isn't even that big.

Speaker 2:          01:03:16       Louis is probably 200 pounds back then. That was a heavyweight back then. It's just a different world. People didn't have that kind of food. They didn't have enough to eat. They didn't have the nutrition knowledge. They didn't have steroids. They didn't have weight lifting. I mean they had weightlifting, but boxers really didn't engage in that is very rare. They thought it stiffened you up. They didn't understand that the stiffening you up is just as your, you know, getting sore and that you have to recover from that and that's how you get bigger and stronger. Like boxers today, if you look at like Anthony Joshua, who's the heavyweight champion, the world now as you look at him. Yeah, he's an English fellow. He's a tank. I mean he's a busy man. You look at Anthony, Joshua, he looks like like a superhero. Do they, do those guys have as much stamina as these guys do?

Speaker 2:          01:04:01       They do, yeah, because this conditioning methods that they have today are just so superior. They understand rest and recovery and they monitor your heart rate and you know they're, they're monitoring lactic acid build up and creatine in your blood and so the science is really, it's such a scientific. If they engage in that at, you know, some, some people still take it old school, but I just think they know more about what gets you in condition and high intensity conditioning drills. High Rocky Marciano had something that you can't teach people, which is just brutal, brutal power. He just had the ability to land these bone crushing shots and he also was insanely tough. You're dealing with a just a different time. Like I was having this conversation with my wife this morning. We were talking about old school. Keep that going on and see the end. It's brutal. We were talking about old school cartoons and about Pinocchio and they were so mean. There were so mean and even old school cartoons about Santa and Christmas elves. The ells are all shitty to each other. Like, what the fuck I fuck you guys work for pc thou they totally pct out. But back then in the 19 forties and fifties and these cartoons were originally made, the world was a hard place mat.

Speaker 1:          01:05:21       It was hard from World War Two was World War II just over or.

Speaker 2:          01:05:26       Yeah, well here's something that I didn't realize until recently. My friend Steve Rinella was actually talking about this on a podcast when we talk about factory farming and large scale agriculture when it comes to stuff. By the way, when we talk about that, the reason why that all got instituted, the reason why we have those programs set in place in America was because of famine because people were worried about what happened to the Europeans during World War Two, during World War One and World War Two. It's estimated that millions of people starve to death in the world and in the United States. After the war. They wanted to do something to make sure that that didn't happen over here and one of the things they did was they started instituting subsidies for farmers to make sure, look, you're not making enough money, but we're going to give you money just so that we have all this food on reserve so that everyone thinks about it as, oh, this is evil thing that the government has done to keep us fat and stupid, and no, it was originally put in place to prepare for the worst case scenario, but we're at war again and we're short on food.

Speaker 1:          01:06:26       I get it. I get the genesis of it, but, but now, now it sucks. It's horrible. Fucking horrible. The worst part is the animals. See, that's, that's my thing. I watch a fucking. I mean, um, I, I have gone to veganism and I grew up Italian and we ate everything. I mean, I love sauce and I mean, I just couldn't admit it. It's amazing that I have gone this way and I did it because my wife got me into it, a big animal rights activists and just watching some fucking slaughterhouse videos and seeing the fear. I mean to me animals and the most powerless because they don't have any choice in this shit, you know, human beings who have fucking horrible life since at least some fucking element of choice and freewill fucking animals are just, it's just like, especially factory farmed animals. Right? Dude, I mean they're just trapped. So yeah, I have been for, I have been for, I would say it took a while to like, not like slip I would say pretty solidly for three years, four years. Um, and how's, do you get your health monitor? Do you get your blood levels checked? My sugars are a little high because what happens for me and, and this could just be fucking willpower. I, I don't know, but. Oh, he just knocked down.

Speaker 2:          01:07:56       Oh, left hook dropped. And this is, you know, an older Joe. Louis. How old was Joe Lewis at the time of this young Jamie to say,

Speaker 1:          01:08:06       and rock and Marsianno. How old was Marsianno? He was in his prime, I think Marciano was 30 or something like he is a lot smaller than um.

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       Does it say no? No. He was older.

Speaker 2:          01:08:21       Yeah. Nineteen. Fifty one. He got knocked out by Marsianno. That's crazy. God, I love Bradick. I loved that Cinderella Story. You that Russell Crowe is fucking great, you know. But anyway, so you eat too much carbs. Yes I do. I do carbs and terrible for you, man. That'll do 10 more than anything. What about eggs? Fuck Dude. Vegan? Yeah. But why go vegan when eggs don't harm anything. If you get like, I have chickens if free range chicken. Yeah man, they, they, they just run around. You feed them, have a good old time, and then you eat their eggs like no one gets hurt. The eggs are not viable because there's no rooster. Right? So you're not taking away a life. This is just something that the, the chicken's almost like, you know, they're just ags now. They're only an embryo if it's on, if it's pregnant. So it has to get fucked by a rooster. If there's no rooster, they just lay eggs.

Speaker 5:          01:09:17       Oh

Speaker 2:          01:09:18       No. Funny that most people didn't know that. I didn't know that. I didn't know that until I got chickens. I, I kind of intellectualized it, but then I was, oh yeah, yeah. There's no rooster. How could they? Of course, it's not like the chickens can lay eggs and those eggs can become new chickens. No, that only happens if a rooster gets in the hen house. So I guess I guess the answer to that, I guess the answer to that would be the way they housed the fucking chickens to make. We don't have to get them that way. You can get free range. I mean, there's, there's places that you can get legitimate gentlemen free. You might actually even visit the farms, you know, there's a guy that we had on the podcast. What does that gentleman's name that runs polyface farms? Joel Salatin, Joel Saltz. Oh, I've heard of that name.

Speaker 2:          01:10:00       He's a real. You main? Yes. And He, you've heard of him. I think it was in a movie called forks over knives. Maybe. I Dunno. Maybe that movie is very deceptive that that movie is filled with a lot of bullshit that works overnight. Yes, yes, yes. That's it. Vegan propaganda movie. And they're the same guys that did the most recent one, which is, uh, what the health widely torn apart by actual scientists to understand human nutrition. Oh yeah, yes. Yeah. Real problems like meat does not cause diabetes. There's zero evidence that does when diabetes is caused by sugar and by complex carbohydrates, or excuse me, by refined carbohydrates, this not processed all diabetes, right. Obviously there's genetic diet. What about the connection between meat and heart disease use? Here's a connection. When you say people who eat meat are more likely to have heart attacks, right?

Speaker 2:          01:10:51       You're not saying what they eat the meat with. Are they eating a piece of grass fed steak or the eating of Shitty cheeseburger that's on a bond that's filled with sugar, with fries and that they have a syrupy soda with it. Just talk about this. I've had Dr Rhonda Patrick was on this recently and what she said, the zero is a direct correlation between consumption of saturated fats along with refined sugar. When you have refined sugar and saturated fats, it produces a lot of bad cholesterol and this is one of the things that's been proven clinically to lead to heart attacks clinically to lead to strokes and hardening of the arteries and yeah, it's the big thing is sugar. The big thing is sugar and carbohydrates. Those are the big things. And carbs turn into sugar. Yes, but I, I very little carbs. Very little. Very little.

Speaker 2:          01:11:42       They'll crave them, huh? No. Once you get out of it, see, a lot of is your gut health. A lot of it is what's going on inside your stomach. Like what? What your stomach is used to eating. If you feed your stomach sugar and processed, refined carbohydrates all the time, that's what you've got in your gut. I mean, that's the kind of gut flora your. You're cultivating and it's gonna. That's what leaks. Delete leads to leaky gut, leads to inflammation, you know? I mean, I want to pick on you, but you're a little overweight. No, no, no, no. And this is a lot of innovative problem with carbs. Yeah. And my trip has been. My trip has been that, um, about the animal rights. You know what I mean? Like, like I don't, I fucking hate the way they are. That's fine, but end, it's good.

Speaker 2:          01:12:29       But you can do better for yourself. I mean, you can live, you can live an ethical, humane life with no animal products other than like free range eggs and be okay and just cut all the dairy out, cut all the things that you are. But I'm just what I'm saying to anybody even listening to this. You can, you can have eggs and you can get plenty of it from A. There's a, there's a lot of plant based protein that's like very rich and powerful for you and excellent for you. Hemp based protein is really good. Spirulina is fantastic for you. There's a lot of really good sources of nutrients, but you got to really pay attention to what you're putting in your body. If you just eat vegan pizza and vegan cookies all the time, you're going to get. Well, I know it's going to fight it out. Right? You're right. And I do find myself craving like, and maybe that's because I put it in, you know the fucking. Oh yeah, it's gonna be before I came here I had a fucking, you know, blueberry Bagel. Whoa, that's great. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:13:27       You feel good when they're going in. They really do. You what? I don't think that's what gave you the panic attack. No, no, not specifically, but I. But I think, you know, if you're feeling kind of shitty and general, you're more susceptible to think you're right. For sure. Yeah. If you could just cut out carbs. It's harder on a Vegan diet, but it's positive. Right? But you got to get a good book on it. You got to find out like there's, there's really good vegan health books that can show you how to eat in the right way to go that way at all. Or you reject it. Well, it's not that I reject it for me. Um, I, I eat wild game almost exclusively. The wild animals that I hunt. Yeah. So I hunt the wild animals and if I an elk, I get hundreds of pounds of meat and I eat that all year.

Speaker 2:          01:14:14       I have commercial freezers in the back. I'll show you after the show. I keep meat here. I have meat at home. I give me to my friends. And so my meat that I get is a wild animal that was going to get eaten by a wolf. Like if I, if I didn't get it, I mean this isn't a factory farmed prisoner that gets to slaughter. Um, this year I got an elk in Utah, a shot in Utah, and I also shot one in California in a place called to hone ranch is this 270,000 acre ranch in the middle of the country or middle of the state rather. Right. But I'm getting it that way. To me it feels. When I, before I started hunting, I had decided I was either going to be a Vegan or I was going to be a hunter. I'm like, I'm going to figure it out.

Speaker 2:          01:14:54       What I'm going to do. I didn't want to eat. You don't want to take part in that. When you, when you killed the elk, right? When you shoot it, do you have like, like what's the feeling there? That must be intense. It's very intense. There's a moment, there's definitely a moment of loss. Will you feel like, you know, this animal is, is gone now, you know, and, but there's also a moment of reverence and awe, but you got to do it sustainably. Like when I do it, I'm doing it in places that have extremely healthy populations. You get an animal that's past its breeding prime, right? You get an animal that's seven, eight, nine years old where they really don't have much time left you. That's what you target. Like people think when you target a trophy animal, you again barry, you're very specific about you know, what you're doing very specific and I'm also specific about making a difficult, which is why I do it with a bow and arrow.

Speaker 2:          01:15:47       I don't, you know, I mean I've hunted animals with rifles and I don't think there's anything wrong with it, but for me I feel like if I really want to make this a more even arrangement and make it more difficult and make it more ethical, I use a bow and arrow. Yeah. But there is that high. Like you know, you, you've killed it and then you feel a sense of loss. There is a sense of loss. It's c, that's what we've run across a bunch of. This is one of the things that once you get into the natural world and really started understanding what's going on out there, you realize like this is this. No one gets out of this ride alive with this. This like the ALC that I killed hae had holes all over his body, all over his body when we were taking them apart.

Speaker 2:          01:16:30       Holes everywhere from other elk stabbing him. Oh, that's what you look up there. All that shit, those, those elk antlers, those real, that's real. That's the one that I shot in September, that those things are designed to kill other elk. They slash each other. They clash and smash those horns together and it's all to fight over breeding. And the most powerful ones with the biggest antlers are the ones that get to breed. And one of the best ways to ensure the health of this, this, uh, this group of animals is once this animal has reached its breeding prime, that's the one you take out. You take out the herd bull. It allows the younger bowls to have an opportunity to breed. You can spray genetic wisdom to see the big dog. Yeah. You see the herd, they call him the herd. Bull had you learned that?

Speaker 2:          01:17:18       I got obsessed about five and a half years ago and got crazy with it. Food and. Yeah. Yeah, well I got obsessed before actually one hunting, but I went hunting in 2012 was the first time I went and then once I did, once I did that and I was like, okay, this is what I'm doing now. Like this makes sense. This is. And it's difficult. So it's a pursuit. So my food now isn't just food that I got. Now. There's this like this intense connection with that food. Nobody's got a fucking connection with their food. People don't. But the weird thing is everyone did until about 100 years ago. That's what really crazy. This is so new. So new. Yeah. You got a 19, 17. Everybody had probably seen an animal get killed on a farm on farms. I mean everybody was. You were around it.

Speaker 2:          01:18:06       It was a normal thing. You go with 18 slash 17, you couldn't avoid it. You go to a marketplace, you'd go to a farmer, you go to. I mean everybody and then also there was no pesticides. The genetic manipulation of the food was nonexistent. It was, it was everything was as it is in a natural state or in a, in a cultivated state where you know you're splicing things and doing normal things that people do gone like, like my favorite target topic, haven't we got just the wrong way? Well, we've definitely gone away, you know, but that way that we've gone in in the negative ways is terrible. But in the positive ways of things like golden rice, that's allowed thousands if not millions of people to not starve to death because it's rice that was infused with protein. There's a bunch of different things that we've done to ensure the shelf life of foods.

Speaker 2:          01:18:56       So get the food to the hungry people because these foods can last longer. Like tomatoes, they look kind of fucked up now because they're hard and you know that these also can stay on the shelves for a lot longer. Like, and this goes back to what we're talking about, like post World War II, people were terrified of scarcity. There were terrified of famine and they were terrified of the idea of going back to war again and not having a stockpile of food and resources. So this is it all. It's all bad now. It's all bad when you go down the food aisle and most of this shit has sugar in it and simple refined carbohydrates and it's killing people and giving people just organic markets are mostly. Yeah. I try to get organic farmers markets to farmers. I liked the feeling I got was growing the tomatoes. Yeah. You walk it fucking supermarkets and the bright lights all the fucking. It feels like you've walked into that corporate death, you know, and they call sugar white death, right? Yeah, it is. I mean, it's, you're not supposed to have a sweet tooth too. I have a lot of things to work on. It's so fun. You know, I get overwhelmed by that shit. I get like, God

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       damn it. You know, and, and check this out. I've, I've been working out with a trainer for the last year and a half, three times a week with like this guy a lot. Yeah. But you know, I'm such an idiot that I work with them and I'm like, well, I'm okay, I'm good. Now I can have this shit. You know what I mean? It's insane what I do like my little reward. I've, I've liked that child. I'm a child who is lights when the lights are so funny. I got to fucking change that other part of you. And you know, it's so funny because we're having this conversation and what happens to me is I'll be driving ongoing. Well, that's fucking it. This is my state of state of mind. I'll go, that's fucking it. You know, this is. Yeah, a fucking Rogan. You know, he just hammered home.

Speaker 1:          01:20:59       What I already know about, you know, it's, it's got it. The sugar's got to go. The process. CARBS got to go. Then you said cupcake. The fucking rationalizations and justifications of really style. It's fucking new year. Yeah. It's almost Christmas. It's almost thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is another 360 days. Yeah. It's normal that I'm on a shoot in, in June, in January. Uh, and I'm like, ah, they don't have any good food here. I gotta have something, you know what I mean? It is. I'll have a cookie. Yeah, it's a bitch. You gotta write it down. Write down what you want to do. Write down what you're allowed to eat. Someone else. So a couple of the people told me the write down thing helps writing down, writing down things helps with everything I wrote down on that because you now you have to, you have an obligation. It's like one of the things that uh, uh, Thompson, Bert Kreischer and Arusha fear and I did sober October.

Speaker 1:          01:21:58       Oh yeah. You went through all that. No booze, no pod. You liked that? It was educational. I think it's important to do. I think it's good to do. I think I liked pot. I'm a big fan and I like the occasional drink. I like a glass of wine with dinner. I like that. But it's also good to abstain. Just having an addictive personality. I do, but I don't. I do, but I don't let it. I, I, you will it? Yeah. I keep that bitch in check, but I can let it go crazy if I wanted to quit pot because I felt interesting, like I just would love to smoke all the time and I'd be like, well, this movie, I'd be like, this movie's going to be great on it. Fucking Joe. Yeah, it's. Hi Tanya. Tonya. It's kind of like, like to me what pot did it was like this got to make like cvs and I'm going to cvs and if I smoke it's going to be a fun fucking trip because Weirdos at CV, especially in silver lake, but you know what I mean. So, so. But what happened was that I felt like I wasn't

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       doing my creative work. Like what happened was the weed was taking me totally. Again, I'm a child like taking me totally into this. I just want to pleasure myself the whole day and I couldn't buckle down and do work with. That's a real problem with comics that a lot of us struggle with. Having the kind of discipline that's required to get work done. You know? It's like you're really funny, but you don't produce any new stuff because you're impulsive because you're kind of silly. I think writing things down helps a lot. Having rules that was going to say about this sober October thing. I knew that I couldn't do any of this thing and I knew that I had to do 15, 90 minute yoga sessions in this month. We had a rule and we were also accountable to each other, so we all knew that we had to get this done.

Speaker 2:          01:23:55       Community. Yeah. Community and, and you know, talking shit to each other on text messages all the time, you know, like we were constantly fucking with each other and having a good time. I mean, it was really fun. It was really fun, but it was also very educational. But knowing that I have these requirements, so I give myself requirements. I write down things every day, every month, every week, every week or every. Occasionally it's daily. If, uh, this is like a big list of Shit I have to do, but like I have to write five days a week. I have to write for one hour, five days a week. You have to. That's where the stuff comes from and if I write more hours, great. That's great. But at least five hours a week. What if I miss a day? If something happens the next day I require two hours. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:24:38       So you know around to a plan. You have two other ones. Do that with food and you do it with. Yeah. See that's what I do also for food. I do intermittent fasting. This is my rule where I only eat for 10 hours a day. So for 14 hours a day I don't eat at all. So whatever that cutoff is. So say if I eat my last meal, my last bite, I don't eat until 10:00 in the morning the next day period. So if I get up at seven, that means for three hours I'm not eating shit. I'll work out. I'll maybe have some coffee. Yeah, I do a lot of workouts with no food. That's cool to do. I always think, oh, I'm going to get low blood sugar in paths out. No, that's bullshit, Huh? Yeah, you'd be fine. It'll be fine. It's just harder.

Speaker 2:          01:25:20       It's just you don't feel good while you're doing it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if you're used to doing it, you can't have coffee. Yeah. Coffee. Yes. That helps suppress your appetite and it gives you a little, a little pick me up. Yeah. It's a psychological boost, you know, like, have a nice cup of coffee, then I'll go hit the gym. Yeah. But I definitely feel better if I have something to eat first. You know, it's amazing how I resist structure. Of course. You're a funny man. Uh, this is, this is a reoccurring theme with so many funny friends. It is crazy impulsive, funny, but you're also the guy where if there's a group of people sitting around and they're all a bunch of fucking suits and they're all boring people, I'm going to gravitate immediately to you because you and I are going to talk real.

Speaker 2:          01:26:02       We're going to be silly and you're going to say some fucked up shit that I'm going to laugh at and we're going to be slapping each other on the back and how that's what you do. Men. But you have to, you gotta manage this Portland with me. I swear to God, you know, I'm so anti corporate. Um, um, so kind of an anti anti government. I don't know what this anti authoritarian streak, you know, it might've been from my dad who was the Sicilian motherfucker, right. I any kind of course construction. Right. But stop and think about this. You're talking in a microphone that was made by a corporation you got here, I texted you on your phone, which was made by slave labor in China. You got here and your car, which was probably constructed overseas, right? Yeah. Honda. Yeah. See, this is we need corporations because you and I are not going to build fucking planes.

Speaker 2:          01:26:57       Okay. Boeing is required to make sure those planes get done correctly. I just want them to do it in a way that's a gala tyrion and not fucking over people and you know, but it's just like, it's really convenient to put that Che Guevara tee shirt on and fuck that guy guy. Fuck Society Man. I mean it's, it's so tempting. And in your inclinations are all correct. Your heart is in the right place, you're your instincts are all good. He's like you. You don't want people to get fucked over and you rightly realized that a lot of this materialism and this fucking corporate bullshit is pointless. If, like you said at the beginning of this podcast, we're all going to die and we need to face that and stopped just collecting shit and instead work on having a great experience in the moment because this moment that you have right now, this is all you'll ever have, is the moment you can plan to make that moment better in the future with more discipline and more structure and more happiness and and even more like scheduling community events and scheduling things.

Speaker 2:          01:28:04       You think you know military. It's hilarious that I don't know any military. I know a lot. Yeah, no law. Is the discipline good for the gigantic. Huge. My friend Jocko, he wrote Jocko Willink, wrote a book called discipline equals freedom. See, that's what I need to fucking go toward. Do you need to follow Jocko? Every morning at 4:30 in the morning, he posts a picture of his watch as he gets up to work out, which is named Jocko willink. I'll, uh, I'll send you his instagram, send to this, but he's a, he's a, like a bonafide savage navy seal and the guys God damn animal and every morning at 4:30 he works out and then he goes and watches the sun, come up on the beach and that is his reward. That's his reward. So he gives himself that. It's all this stuff done that he has to do during the day.

Speaker 2:          01:28:51       See the aftermath. Like he'll post pictures of like his go to is actual page and see all the photos of his watch for 30 2:00 AM there is up and you know, his heart in the right place to, oh, he's a good guy, great guy, great guy. And he spends a lot of his time right now I'm doing these corporate seminars and uh, you know, like explaining to people the importance of leadership and discipline and that, you know, is this how you get things done is say you feel better. This is how you relieve yourself of your demons, your tension and his concept of discipline equals freedom really resonates because if you have the discipline to get things done, then you feel like I don't feel good unless I've accomplished this shit I need to do, but when I have accomplished should I need to do, then I like to kick back on the couch and watch a boxing match or a television show that I enjoy.

Speaker 2:          01:29:45       I can enjoy it where I don't have anxiety, I have fucking anxiety if I don't get things done. I think that's, you know, it's funny because I started the podcast talking about anxiety ed and I'm thinking it's all about community and disconnection and for me it may be this just a more kind kinda days I have instead of fucking going, okay, I'm going to do this, this and this to give me a little structure that would probably alleviate a bunch of a bunch of it. But community is important too. We fucking need each other. You know, it's one of the, like we were talking about the comedy store and I wish everybody had something like the comedy store, you know, I used to have a pool hall lot I used to go to that was like that where I would be everywhere I would be.

Speaker 2:          01:30:29       I'd be like, ah, I can't wait to get back to executive billiards and hang out with all my friends. And it was like this freak show where it was all these Weirdos was ambler, white plains, New York. Oh, okay. And all these Weirdos and gamblers and strange little outcasts of society and lifelong bachelors who were in their seventies and we'd all get together and laugh and hang out until fucking 4:00 in the morning and then go get something to eat and a comic. But this was like a home base and I think the comedy store and a lot of ways. Delis. Hey, let's wrap this bitch up. It's 2:00 already. Okay. How quick was that? Just went by. It was great. Eddie. I had a good time, man. Often I had a great time and and I think I'm going to change my life. Change Eddie pepitone, goddammit, and follow Eddie on twitter and on instagram as well.
