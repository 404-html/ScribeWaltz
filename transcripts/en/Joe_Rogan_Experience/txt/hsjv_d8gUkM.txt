Speaker 1:          00:00:05       The joe rogan experience. Now this shit ain't working. I don't have my headphones on blasted. You ever look for your head, your sunglasses, and you realize they're on your fucking face? Yeah. Yes. My sunglasses. And they're right there in your fucking head. Yeah, that's, that's when you know you should quit weed, right? Is that the moment? And he didn't take it. Take some time off.

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       Shit. I've been doing that since I was a kid, man.

Speaker 1:          00:00:30       The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by several things, several things. And we believe in number one is the fleshlight. I believe it. You know why? Because I've used it. I believe in it because you're Gunna masturbates stop fucking playing games. Listen, you know you're going to masturbate. You'll know you're going to masturbate. Just get that over with. You don't want to be counting on one person to take care of your biological needs. Okay? Because then you become a slave to that one person. That's very dangerous. You have to be able to take care of it yourself because life would be chaos if we couldn't reach our decks. If our Dick Scher and some weird spot in our back and we had to get a chick to touch it. There was no way he could do it yourself. You'd be doomed, man. Just so you, you would have the balance of power would shift terribly against you. It's the perfect cotton. That sense in that sense, the fleshlight is an empowerment tool. It allows you to extract biological matter and remove some confusion in your consciousness and some distractions in your everyday life because all you're thinking about is I got a park, some of this fucking sperm somewhere. You know it's building up inside your balls like a bunch of wild steroid eat and troops ready to fucking fly out and go to war. That's what they're like, man, that's what your loads are like. They're like a little savages amped up refugees.

Speaker 2:          00:01:54       It's committing suicide, jumping off trees face first to the rocks and a thick load today, like really thick, like uncomfortable. That's not good. Yeah. What's that mean is that you've got a clock, you got a clog, a little thing down there. You got to stick with Qtip in there and clean it out. It was like a goober. Goober. Anyway, click on the link it Joe rogan.net and enter in the code name Rogan and you will get 15% often number one sex toy for men and then you could shoot your loads in it. That's right at a discount. I've said this before and they need to Mrs. Clause one bad. Yeah. They should have totally come up with a woman like snow on it and shit. Yeah, little little white white hair. Oh, why not? I think she was a virgin and that's my mom's name. Right? You shouldn't be the one person to fuck marry, kill badge. If they could go back in time and eventually they'll get to that point. If you find like someone's like, you know right now found like two ton

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       Commons body and then they put like, we should talk about this one not doing a commercial. That's why the commercials are so good. Dude. They're totally organic. Let's just get him out of the way. We are also brought to you by on it.com makers of Alpha Breen and new mood, which I'd take both of them on a regular basis and the fucking awesome. I support this not just because I'm making money from it and because I, if I wasn't making money from it, I would still tell you to look into nootropics. It's there. It's a fascinating field of science really. And it's all about chemicals and, and, and um, vitamins that enhance cognitive function. And I think they work differently on different people. But for me, I get a nice, like good, clear feeling out of taking these things and I don't believe it's a placebo.

Speaker 3:          00:03:46       Um, you know, there's, there's, there's evidence that it helps Alzheimer's patients when you give them like certain nootropics that I can actually can slow the onset of Alzheimer's. Most importantly though, if you don't like this stuff, you get a hundred percent money back guarantee. Just say it sucked. If you don't have to return it, she'd say it sucked and you get your money back. It's really that simple. And if you like it but you think it's too expensive. My, what I say to you is please go buy the shit in bulk. Go and save yourself some money, steal the ingredient list off the website and just duplicate it. I really do. I hope you do that and I hope you enjoy it and I hope you look into the just the subject of nootropics. I'm neither educated enough nor do I have enough time to go into depth enough and have it actually be interesting in a podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:04:32       You know, I would maybe like to have some like scientist on explain brain chemistry to, you know I, but I couldn't do it obviously. So the best I can say is go Google it and look up nootropics and there's a bunch of different kinds and there's a bunch of different formulations that other people offer as well. And a lot of them are really good. I've tried power drive, I think that stuff's really good. There's a bunch of different companies out there that sell similar stuff and not saying buy my stuff, but if you want to buy my stuff you can buy it. And go to [inaudible] dot com if you've got to Joe rogan.net, click on the link for Alpha brain and during the code name rogue and you get 10% off that. Okay. Or not whatever, Bro. Okay, Jesus. Merry Christmas. Take me hit that shit. Bitch. Duncan trussell's in the house. Ladies and gentlemen,

Speaker 4:          00:05:17       Joe Rogan podcast all day. I think

Speaker 3:          00:05:24       that was one of the best commercials. Whoever did. Duncan flowed seamlessly how it has to be, man. I can't just always say the exact same thing. Fucks. It's too uncomfortable. I feel like a big phony. I was talking to Stan hope about that once, man. He said the worst thing is when like he like he goes to the UK and went to the UK and he saw the same people were in the same seat both nights that are like really loud and they sat in the same seat and then the second night they sat in the same seat, but he's going to do like most of the same material, you know? I mean you only have so much fucking material. And

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       the art of stand up comedy is to relay each piece of material as if it's really happening in your head right now. But when someone just saw you the night before say the exact same shit, you know, and he's like, oh, it makes you feel like such a fucking phony. Hate it. When someone knows your shit. It's flattering. It's flattering. They're just trying to flatter you. They're trying to make you feel like we're super fans are coming to see you two nights in a row. I do like, I mean, if they are super fans though, I would like, you know, if Bill Hicks was in town in Boston, I saw him two nights in a row, I saw the same set twice in a row. I wanted to, I like watching that because you get to see the nuances and the way they do it differently. It's cool.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       But for a lot of people they don't want to see that, you know? But I was, uh, you know, you're an open like comic, you know, an amateur and you know, a total comedy nerd. And know the opportunity to see like a craftsman. I saw Richard Jenny a couple of nights in a row too. I saw a couple of different guys a few nights in a row. Like I went to see them. I saw don my rare a couple of nights in a row. You I wanted to see their, their act over and over again. I wanted to see how they did it and it's interesting man, when you see people's different reactions in different crowds are like, wow, why didn't that one work? Man, this is crazy. Like this is weird. Told you one of my favorite moments in comedy is watching Bill Hicks bomb. He bombed with the confidence and flare of a man who was crushing. Like it never bothered him.

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       Like there's a lot of people who say it never bothered them, but you can see this like fear or detachment in their eyes is panic. Look, he never got it. He never got to the panic look. He would bomb and as he was bombing he would talk through the bombing and he was doing this bit where he went on after this other guy. And this, the other guy that went up is a very nice guy, but he's really hacky and he had like a bunch of like, you know, cartoons, smoking pot jokes, where do I get daffy duck smoking. Oh, you know, another guy who was one of those guys, but he was a nice guy. You know. My point is he was killing this audience was monkeys, they were apes. It was one of those dumb audiences and every now and then to get them, you know, in Boston you have some really educated people and then you have a lot of troll people to fucking cool.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       Yeah, yeah. You've got a lot of those. Well they did not like Hicks. It all, he came on like super confident and like real, like slow and deliberate with his, uh, the way he was putting his set out there, you know, and like real, like you just, you know, like you own the room, you know, and just would start doing as material and they didn't like it, man. And they were leaving in droves and he had this bit where Satan fucks John Davidson in the ass and he would like rotate people. It'd be John Davidson, it would be Oprah. And then he shits out Geraldo Rivera, he's on the, on the toilet shitting, and he's making this shit noise for like, man, like two minutes, which is a long time to just sit there and he's making this and he looks up and people are just leaving in giant groups.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       It's fucking great. It's fucking terrible. Fucking terrible. Not Funny at all. After that last guy, and then they're leaving and Hicks looks up and I swear to God he wasn't even phase. He goes, yeah, it's generally clears the room and just to me and my friends, I think Fitzsimmons might've been there for that one, um, to being my friends and 50 people. It was fucking hilarious. The bits were hilarious. It was a, it was like so interesting. It was, it wasn't, I'll be honest, it was not the funniest material than I'd ever seen in my life. It wasn't the funniest delivery, but it was certainly the most thoughtful, without a doubt. It was a totally different kind of laughter I was experiencing. I was experiencing experiencing a laughter and the Lego fuck, he just nailed it too. It wasn't just the laughter, it was like, wow, that's an awesome point to just shove into a joke, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:09:55       You know what I mean? So it wasn't like he was the funniest guy. Like he, you know, if you compare it to him to like the guys that I knew growing up, like Steve Sweeney, Steve Sweeney used to fucking Corolla. I mean crushed the point where you would be terrified to go on after him to follow a guy like Steve Sweeney in Boston when he's on full tilt, when he goes up there just rabid and full of energy, you're fucking doomed, man. He's just too good. And it was a hex wasn't like that. It was a totally different kind of funny, you know, it was, it was it's own little thing, man. And it influenced a lot of people to sort of branch often in, into a more thoughtful direction, you know? Yeah, it's really cool when you see somebody who's got the balls to just say exactly what they're thinking on stage with zero pandering.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       Yeah, that's not, that's not going to be that. That can't be that kind of crushing comedy. It's a different thing all together. It's still super funny. But you know, my thing is, dude, I like the sandwich at it. I like to shove it in between shit that just has no points at all. Just ridiculous. And just the stuff that I think is funny and it's usually, she's like gay jokes. It's usually for whatever reason, it's usually someone inadvertently sucking your dick or be someone is sucking a dick for a reward. My sense of humor is so fucking juvenile, man. I'm so childish. And I actually thought like, man, maybe I got a problem. Like why am I such a child with like stuff that I think is silly and funny? You know? Like maybe there's something wrong with that. And then I went to see Jim Norton and uh, Jim Norton was in Austin and he had more Dick Jokes than me. And I said to him afterwards, I go, dude, I was starting to think maybe I have too many jokes about Dixon my ass until him what to see you. I saw an hour's worth of Dick Jokes and I fucking thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm like, thank you. That made me feel good. Cause as a a person who was an audience member, I saw it from an audience member's perspective like, oh, it's just a big crazy silly ride. And you go like, it's not like, you know you can't have so many jokes about dicks. And also

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       if you think it's funny, then you kind of have a, an obligation to do it. As a comic. Can you think something's funny? You should talk about it on stage, but because if you think something's funny or like, oh no, that's not high brow enough, I'm not going to do that. And that's another form of pandering. That's not it at all. It's exactly, if you have a joke about shitting your pants, you're supposed to tell that joke. Yeah. It's not supposed to be out to, oh you're doing straddle logical material. If you think it's funny. That's the thing. If you're just doing it to get it shock out of people and you're doing at a lazy, that's a whole different story. Ari Shapiro has been doing some bit that's been killing about, he was in Australia and he got diarrhea. It's a totally true story and it's fucking killing for him.

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       You know? For someone to say that you're not supposed to do that. It's funny. It's really funny and it happened. It's a real story, you know, to for you to say that there's something wrong with this. For you to say that there's any kind of rule. It's like telling an artist where you know you can't paint. That's light green. Yeah. If you come over someone's house, like you have to really know that person before you talk about shitting herself. Yeah. It's a weird thing. Unless they're a dog. When you're on stage, it's one thing, right? You're supposed to be exposing everything to anybody anyway, but if you were, you know, you don't know someone and they start talking to you about shitting all of themselves. You come over here, I need to talk to you about it. I'm cool with it. You know, if like you're a good dude, like you seem like just an open dude and you're like, how's the cheeseburgers there?

Speaker 2:          00:13:17       I was like, well, they're pretty good but lives in the last time I had, I'm to be honest with you, I shut all over myself. I couldn't even make it to the bathroom. I would start laughing like, oh shit. And you think that's what it is. I would have a normal conversation with you. I wouldn't be like, excuse me, to Judith Segall, shit on yourself. How dare you sir. Speak to me like such a scoundrel. Who all you, how dare you? Where do you get this confidence to come to me? Isn't that funny? When you realize that you're actually offending someone, you realize that like this really is in some way. Something I'm saying is having an effect on you that's like causing you to shut down. Listen folks, I know you've been programmed to think that you're the asshole when you're swearing and someone reacts like that, but no, no, they're the asshole.

Speaker 2:          00:14:02       That's dumb. It's 2000 and fucking 11 if you're really offended. If someone talks to you about shitting their pants, then you're the dummy. You're the problem. It's not the guy who shit his pants. That guy's telling you a funny story. Okay? You're just some weird stuck up person. It doesn't want to hear that. Like if I don't think something's funny and it's got a logical, I'm not going to get offended. I'm just going to, it's not funny. It's not going to bother me. It's like whatever you're talking about shitting herself, fine. I don't really, it's not, it's, it doesn't bother me. It, some people, they've never heard that stuff before. Comedians, we, we've been horrifying each other for eons. You've horrified me in so many different ways. You feel you're really, really good at, um,

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       taking a story that already kind of know, for example, grizzly man, the guy getting eaten by the bear. So like you'll give me really high and then start talking about like, yeah, like what, what was the Gwas grizzly man, his name was Timothy Treadwell. Timothy Treadwell. And you start describing him getting eaten by a bear in this like precise, microscopic way where you're like every moment you're describing the bones crunching and his femur snapping and like you're just really good at taking it. Like to the next level to yeah, wait to become a werewolf. Cause at first you start talking about it, you know when you're high, you're high, you're like, well fuck, you're seeing it's so clear. I'm like, I'm not going to let I know what he's doing. He's a, he's going to take this into the deep water in a second. I'm not going to let it freak me out.

Speaker 5:          00:15:37       And I still remember the Treadwell story and sure enough, I'm like, Jesus God, this is horrible. Poured Timothy Treadwell. I could just see his bones turning into jelly and his eyeballs bulging out. Is he screaming for the bear to stop attacking him? But it won't. Anyway, you're very good at that. So after you've been hanging out with people who can professionally tell stories in the most detailed way, then it's really hard to get around anyone who's going to say anything that offends you. And also the Internet by the way, is also like what's going to, I've seen every, I've seen everything.

Speaker 1:          00:16:13       My favorite picture in the Internet. This is a strong same statement. Yeah, and it's true. My favorite picture is there as a kid and he's standing in front of the goats, see butthole and the guy's spreading his ass hole open and it just says welcome to the Internet. Yeah. The kid is looking at that and I'm like, yeah, that's it. Exactly. Yeah. You can't get, you can't get upset by things anymore.

Speaker 5:          00:16:35       It's kind of retro and quaint when you are, when you come upon someone who actually can get offended, when you realize, oh my God, you can still get offended. How have you maintained that? That's amazing. This I, you mean I really have the power to disturb you in a real way. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       Like you don't realize though, you're not under the glove all day at work. A lot of people are under the iron glove all day at work. They're just stuck in an office where they're there. All their behavior was restricted. Most of them even have to dress funny. They have to wear like weird things around their neck to signify that they mean business. Yeah. Right. And you're, you're walking around in some office where everybody's stifled and you're all forced together today all day to do shit you don't want to do all day long. You know, it's, it's, that's not good. So people are like buttoned down because of that. Whereas you can do your smoking pot and playing world of Warcraft, you know, trying to write some jokes, you know, and, and then we're going to go on the road and we'll go to Chicago. We'll do the Chicago Theater January 27th with Joey Diaz. Yeah. But you know what I'm saying? Like that's your, your world, right? You're not, you don't have like a shit job that you, you know, get up to every morning. Right. That's true. That that's, yeah. So yeah, I understand people are buttoned down and they've got conditioned and some, it's too hard to just go away plus free you all the time and you're at work all and you're just like, why

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       can't, why can we fucking talk? Yeah. This is crazy. This job sucks. This is ridiculous. We've got to find another way to make money. Or like those fucking email forwards it. Those people saying, do you know, hit those email forwards and it's like the worst joke of all time. What are the chicken side of the rabbit? And he shut the fuck up. You know? My mom was brutal. My mom was brutal with those. I had to stop her. I said I was really nice about it. I was like, does this, there was this not that funny to me. And by the way, I don't want your friends sending me any crazy emails, so don't, let's not link it all together. Doesn't even know how blind carbon copy. She just copies it copies here. She hasn't sent me one in a long time though. But the ones she did, I would still just look back and I'm like, oh Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:18:30       But what about those also when you get on those patriotic mailers, oh, those are brutal. I've had a bunch of those country. I once knew that this is a story about a country. Yeah. And then just make things up. Yeah. The, the thousands of terrorist acts. So we prevented, how about total was, could have wiped out humanity 17 times over. But we're out there doing the dirty work. They were stopped. Yeah. There's a jog living in Georgia. It always tries to find like so cinnamon oh party. There's a dog living in whose master didn't come. Oh, stories are great. Well, you know what, it would be beautiful if that really was the case. Could you imagine if you really had 100% faith in the u s military and you knew that there was a bad guys and we're the good guy and it's clean, black and white. There's no doubt about it. We only do the right thing. Always. We avoid war whenever possible and we would never engage in warfare profit like, but that's what people like to think that like, they like to think that that's what we are.

Speaker 5:          00:19:26       Well, it would like if, if every 50 years, uh, Scorpions climbed out of the volcanoes of the earth and they were like poisonous and deadly and they shot lasers out of their eyes and they could like burn you alive and you met someone who's like, I've made the decision to go down and fight the scorpions. I'm going to fight him, I'm going to give my life to fight these scorpions. You would be like, you are fucking hero hero. That's a real, here are amazing. You're going to go fight the laser shooting scorpions. It's incredible. Now it's so muddied. It's like wow. You know, they don't even know a lot of them. They don't even know what they're doing now. Like, well, we're going to Afghanistan because um, oh, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:20:11       we're going down there cause uh, you know, Obama's not going to veto this fucking, this new bill, the one that passed through the house pass through the Senate and the Congress, apparently they, they, oh, okay. Didn't know Obama was not going to be totally turns the United States into a battle. Indefinite detention. Yeah. Indefinite detention for United States civilians. Yeah. It doesn't have to, you don't have to. Yeah. You don't have to go to trial. Did you see the thing,

Speaker 5:          00:20:33       I was on Reddit with Mccain, I ran Paul as Mccain point blank. Does this mean that you can arrest a United States citizen and detain them? And definitely, I just tweeted it, but, and Mccain is like, you know, pretty straight forward. It's like if someone is a threat to the security of the United States, we should be able to arrest them and detain them because apparently like a lot of the people that they didn't detain indefinitely and they let out according to Mccain ended up killing some troops.

Speaker 1:          00:21:03       Yeah. So I like what they're saying. What they're saying is, listen, this is some fucking dirty warfare and we need some extra power, but we're not going to abuse it. But the problem is you can't get that extra power because everybody abuses power once they get it. There was just the, otherwise they would already be an accounting for all the fucking money that's missing. That would already be there would already be someone, some repercussions for all the lies that were told that led us to believe there was weapons of mass destruction. Just straight up lies. We think about what you can get in trouble for. You know what, what you, what you know what you were thinking about like how crazy insider trading is. You can get arrested if you have information that will, you know a stock's going to go bad. Think about that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       But then think about the fact that someone somewhere lied about weapons of mass destructions. They, they made up some sort of a story or they fabricated some, some evidence and it became the real reason why people supported the idea going there and yet it didn't exist. So if we know that and that's not chased down. Yeah, you don't chase that down. There's, there's no, there's no like big news followup and documentaries about it. How they chase that down and found out how it happened. Locked everybody up and cleaned out all the people that they were in business with. No, it's just somehow or another, it kind of gets swept under the rug that a war was started on. Bullshit. Yeah. They've allowed somehow another hypnotize people to the point where people have allowed a war to be created on bullshit. A country that had absolutely no connection.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       Then we could see like a straight connection to Iraq. What the fuck is that? Yeah, it makes no sense. Oh, we gotta go over there and get him. He's got weapons of mass destruction. Okay. Listen, we were going to go to war with the people that killed us, but we can't figure out who the fuck they are. Cause apparently don't matter. They're nomadic terrorists that have actually been living in America training. Let a flow. Okay. Okay. Since we get the, they're all dead. Since we can't get them, let's go get some people that look like them. Right. Let's go get some people in another country. Not even from a small country. It's like, it's like Canada does something fucked up and people go attack Mexico. It's that fucked up. It's that silly. Oh, then that's what it's like. It's like if Canada attack somebody and then they decided to attack Mexico and retaliation. No, that's

Speaker 5:          00:23:16       what I want. I walk my dog and I walk my dog past this House with these two ferocious dogs behind a fence. I've got little Chihuahua. And so that you, Allah loves coming in, standing in front of this fence and barking because what happens is the two dogs come charging down towards my Chihuahua and barking at my dog. And one of them is so mad at my Chihuahua that it starts biting the other one on it's ass. And it's the funniest thing you've ever seen. It's just taking it out on the closest thing that it can bite, you know, so, so it's like also, isn't this known as, um, isn't it kind of like what happened in Afghanistan? Isn't that called Bull Baiting? Isn't that what it is? It's like a sun sometimes. This is what really creeps me out is I think that, uh, the, um, the people that were fighting in Afghanistan and the war that we picked with people, uh, I think they're really good at fucking war.

Speaker 5:          00:24:09       You know, Afghanistan is called the graveyard of empires. And I think that the people that were up against aren't just as stupid as a lot of people would like to paint them. You know, they can't fucking, they can't even read. They're just hungry, starving. People who can't even read, they don't know what they're doing. I think they kind of do know what they're doing. I think that they, I mean, a bin Ladin said, all we have to do is like make it seem like we're going to attack and look at how much money the United States spends. They were just like, oh, we have to work. They turned on a fucking money faucet. They basically like, well look at what they did. Look at if look at what al Qaeda did. We now have a, a country where our military can arrest us if we're considered a threat to the security of the United States.

Speaker 5:          00:24:52       So that, you know, cause I mean a journalism mean anything journalists could that mean like a Wiki leaks guy? Couldn't Malcolm X if we can. Malcolm X had gotten arrested and detained indefinitely. Just don't you think that he would get arrested that lower? Sure. If he was in America fucking ever than being assassinated though he hasn't been assassinated yet. But if, if they could arrest him or assassinated what they've done with that guy, you know, he's in a sort of a similar situation where he has to report to a police station like every year is to check in and he's not allowed to go anywhere. And as his trial is like still, he hasn't been, they want to send them off to, where was it? Norway, Norwegian who was charged with now Sweden, Sweden, sexual misconduct. Whatever he did is just some weird moment where is in bed with a girl apparently she's saying, yeah, stuck his dick in her without a condom and yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:25:40       Well it seems like we are, sometimes it feels like we're on the precipice where they're going to stop even putting up this act that they're debating and deciding and using courtrooms. The, see that's the problem with indefinite detention because it's like, let's imagine that I think [inaudible] I don't know. Let's imagine, I think the Alex Jones is a threat to the security of the United States because of the things that he's been saying or weakening the government. Right? So let's imagine that the government, the federal government decides to Alex Jones is a real threat. And so they, uh, they decided to arrest them. They've got to put them on trial. They've got to prove that he's a real threat. Was he like manufacturing fucking explosives? Was he planning on doing something to a federal building? There will be a trial and in the trial they could use evidence to show if he was really a real threat, play his tapes, show what he was up to.

Speaker 5:          00:26:28       Now the military can just arrest him. It's not even arrest cause they're, they're not putting them on trial. They get to tell anybody they were arrested and they just come and get you and they put you away indefinitely because somebody thought you were a threat to this curity of United States that chills me, dude, that is so fucked up. And if you think that's just going to be used for, I don't know, whoever it is, these invisible people that I'm not even sure who they are that are lurking in New York or wherever they're at. You're crazy. If you think that's going to happen, fucking turn on. Uh, um, uh, some Waco footage, you know, watch those fucking ATF agents torching that Koresh compound. If you think that they're just going to fucking use this law for the worst and most extreme cases, no fucking way, man, they are going to use it. They're going to use it any way that they want to use it for drug dealers. They're going to use it, use it for whatever they want to use it for. They're going to use it for anybody, man. I mean we're, we could be doing this fucking podcast. It's not a female.

Speaker 1:          00:27:27       Can't think of what you saw that cop at Uc Davis due to those kids that were on their knees because he thought he could, cause the law was on his side. They weren't moving. He told them to comply. They did not. So he thought it was okay to spray chemicals in children's faces. Yup. And that guy is representative of human nature. He's representative of abusive power. It's very simple. It's, it's no logic. Abuse of power. Yeah. I get someone has made your life a little more difficult. They made your job a little harder because now you have to look out for, you know, all these kids and they're all this place where they, you don't want him to be, but guess what? Fuck face. You're not allowed to spray him in the face with fucking chemicals. That's assault. You're assaulting kids and you're think you're allowed to do that because of something written on a piece of paper.

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       Fuck you. Stupid. That's dumb. You think that that's, that's morally reprehensible. Just innately it's in your mind. You know, that's a negative thing in your mind. Do you know that a peaceful protest with students, with children who have this idealistic view of the world and you're going to squash it while you're wearing a bulletproof vest and spray them in the face with fucking chemicals. They want a peaceful protest, which is supposedly guaranteed us. We're supposed to have the right to assemble. We're supposed to be able to get together, even if it is private property, you know, would that is where the issue takes place. Well, where the fuck out should they be?

Speaker 5:          00:28:53       Well, no. Yeah, you, you're supposed to be able to do that and you're supposed to be able to do a lot of them

Speaker 1:          00:28:57       and the community should embrace it and the fucking school should have a dialogue with them. They're supposed to be ironing everything out. You're not supposed to just, you know, new spray people in the face with fucking chemicals. But because that guy could, because he wasn't just some guy who didn't like what the kids were saying, you know, like if you and I went down there, you don't like these fucking kids are spoiled. I'm going to fuck it. Spray him in the face with tear gas, Yo Dude, they would lock me in jail. They would tackle me, throw me to the ground because I don't have the authority to assault them. But this guy has the authority to solve that to somehow or another, it's become his job. That is exactly what's going to happen with this bill. That is exactly what's going to happen with this. This amount of power. You can't just give it to be people and hope they're going to be good. This should be the fucking

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       law. You can't do it. You can't ever do it. You want a way to stop terrorist threats? Let's get the fuck out of their countries. How about that? How about that? That's a good start, but you stop occupying these fucking countries that don't really need us. We they don't. No one needs us in Afghanistan. I want all everybody's relatives come back fucking home. Those people that are sending you over, they're not looking out for your best interest. That's ridiculous. That's right. This is a time old story. It's a timeless tale. It's been told back and forth. The last edition was Vietnam, but apparently nobody fucking learned from it. Apparently. Everybody just still thinks that someone's looking out for you at the top, despite all the evidence to the contrary, someone's looking out for you, man.

Speaker 5:          00:30:23       Yeah. Well, and also there's the, you know, it's set up in a way that for many people they feel like it's one of their only options is to join the military. They feel like they, it's like a, they feel like it's going to pay for their college and it's, um, the, a lot of, you know, I get to it the fucking, uh, or the UFC, there'll be a marines there. You've seen those, right. And, and we do them for the troops. We do, we do shows for the troops. Yeah. But, and we have troops that are flown in and we get them tickets. No, no, no. That's cool. I'm talking about outside. The recruiters were there like recording. Yeah, they're recruiting people. I don't mean that. It's awesome that fucking at the fights, the fights where they're recruiting people and you're all juiced up with testosterone up to seeing a Florida fucking be tricked into that.

Speaker 5:          00:31:08       That's not fair. That's like a whorehouse that's open right in front of Australia. Yeah. We, you're like, Whoa, what are you doing here man? The one, I signed it fruit, they were doing a pull up contest is what it was. So they having pullup contest and so they're getting guys there. It's like, go do a fuck at the hundred pullups look and they're doing a hundred bullets. And I'm like, man, you could be a marine. You're really tough. You could be a marine. And so they use, recruiters will come on college campuses and you know, it's uh, the, the United States military uses, um, many, uh, of the same things that cults do to indoctrinate the people into it. Uh, you know, cult, uh, change your identity. They changed your name cults. We'll shave your head. They'll make you wear certain clothes. They make you refer to people in a very specific way.

Speaker 5:          00:31:53       They make you use a very specific language in cults. People will tend to say the same thing over and over again. That's just based on whatever the leaders said. So a lot of the, uh, the indoctrination is very similar to when Colt's come out to campuses and stuff. It's a very similar thing. And what they do is they, um, they get people to join up who haven't actually considered the reality of what they're going to be doing. Some of them really do want to like fucking blast goddamn machine guns in the desert cause it's fucking fun. There's a great book by Sebastian younger called war. Uh, and it's fucking awesome if you read that book. No. Oh my God. It's so good though. Refresh my memory. He decided to write a book about, it's this deadly valley, Afghanistan and it, and so he decided to write his name.

Speaker 5:          00:32:42       Sebastian Junger. I don't know if it's younger, a younger, he's written other things before the renewal. Yes. Yup. That's right. I don't know what else though, but I, this is, I just kept hearing about this book, so I was just trying to remember what I remembered about it. I can, he's like, he lived with these fucking troops out there. He's bad ass. He's like a really tough dude who like, goes deep into the shit and like, um, and uh, he's a journal. He's a war turn on the CNN guy. He, is he the guy that has like the accent? I don't know. Look at Australian accent. Is that the guy? I don't think he has an Australian accent, but I could be wrong. I only saw one interview with them. I don't remember. I'm going to want to keep interrupting you. I'm trying to remember this summer camp.

Speaker 5:          00:33:18       Sorry. So his, what he did with his book, which is remarkable and beautiful, is he managed to write the book with no moral or ethical slant to it. You know, he's not saying like war is bad or you shouldn't go to war. You should go to war. War is good. It's just describing the experience of war is purely as he can. Exactly what it's like to get hit by a roadside bomb or exactly what it's like to like be in the middle of a firefight and how they've studied adrenaline levels when you get into firefights. Okay. No, I'm, I'm remembering. I'm going looking at the pictures of them online. Yeah. I saw him on a CNN interview, CNN or c span. They also did a documentary about it too, about this group of people. He's bad ass fucking marines out in the middle of it.

Speaker 5:          00:34:05       Like in the deadliest fucking valley. It's called the Korengal valley is what it's called. Those guys, those embedded reporter guys are fucking crazy. Fucking crazy man. But what a nutty job. Huh? They want to go where the action is. Yeah man. But the, the, the, the experience of war for a young guy who he says there's no drug like it. He says that there's nothing that you will, that will get you as high is being in a city life or death situation where you're defending your, the people around you, who you are like connected to. There really are your brothers. You're like surrounded or you're with these people. See for for the troops, that's what their war is there. War is protecting their dear friends from getting killed and, and that's how they're taught. They're taught, these are your brothers. You will give up your life for your brothers.

Speaker 5:          00:34:52       That's what they're taught. And, and so you develop these intense bonds for the people around you that are formed from massive burst of adrenaline. You know, cause like when adrenaline, when your body is experiencing super dangerous situations, all the senses turn on. It's, I think it's an evolutionary trait designed to like teach you so that you learn how to survive. Like you know, way back when, if you're getting attacked by a tiger, you would re you, you know how you remember everything in a dangerous situation. Everything becomes crystal clear. You see everything, everything's kind of in slow motion and then afterwards you totally remember it with this vividness that you don't remember other things. This is where a post traumatic stress disorder, shock disorder, post traumatic stress disorder comes from is that people are getting really intense situations in war. They get these fucking memories burnt into their brains like tattoos.

Speaker 5:          00:35:43       They can't forget it. Then their mind keeps going back to it. Like when your memory wanders and you think back to a moment, it's kind of dulled and the colors are dim and you don't remember their memories go back to it 100% so it's like they're their, their heart start racing and it fucks up your life because this thing has been burned into your mind. So in these situations you're experiencing life at its super high voltage and you're experiencing with a group of people and you form bonds with these people that you don't have with normal, with normal people in life. You inform these intense bonds. Maybe it's like the kind of bonds you form when you're with your wife and she's giving birth or something. When you're in sharing those moments with people, it's like that. So I think the there, you know, these affects are studied by the people whose job it is to make the troops efficient and they use these really intense conditioning techniques and stuff that a lot of these people aren't prepared for it.

Speaker 5:          00:36:37       They don't know what they're getting into. They don't know that they're getting into more than just defending their country. They're getting into a well studied system of brainwashing and conditioning that transforms them from, you know, normal American citizens and the people who are willing to die for whatever their commander says, you can't question what your commander says. You can't question whoever the superior officer is about doing this or that you have to do it or couldn't work if that wasn't the case. If like each individual person got to decide, oh, I don't think I'm going to, I don't think I'm going to shoot that fucking grenade, man, I don't want to do that. I don't think I, you know what the place down there, all the people are with the guns that want to kill me. I'm probably not going to go there today. It's amazing how easy it is to sell the idea that you're supposed to go kill someone because some people that are in office, even though you know that everyone in office is essentially corrupted the, but because those people were in off of, they tell you, you're allowed to kill these people.

Speaker 5:          00:37:34       Not only, uh, are you allowed to kill people, but when you come back they'll be happy to see you. Yeah, sure. It's like in any other time, if you find out that other guy killed somebody, like, look, you know, this fucking guy, man, he's a good dude. But he went to jail for manslaughter. He beat some guy to death in front of a nightclub and he's kind of fucked up with Jill for 10 years. You, you like, I don't want to be around that guy. They're going to kill somebody. But if you are around a war hero, so different feelings, different feelings for them too. You know, I mean, some guys have have issues over it, but I've met guys that don't, I know some really smart guys that went overseas and they're happy that they did what they did. 58 confirmed kills dude. I know some snipers. Yeah, I know one dude very well. There was a slight bro. Well, I mean, you gotta be a weird thing, man. To be looked at someone from a distance and make them disappear from Earth. Blend from a distance. You know, it's, that's what it is. I mean, that's what being a sniper is. You're not there to fucking good when the target content playing pinball, you're there to pack people off if they want

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       to kill, operate people's heads. Yeah, you're, you explode their brain. Yeah. You, you're a widow maker. You're out there fucking making kids grow up, grow up without their debt. You're out there fucking making it so that like, uh, for the rest of their lives, there's going to be sentimental moments where a guy looks at a grainy picture of the person whose face you just turned to jelly and bone fragments for the rest of their life. They're going to be looking at this picture of being like, man, I wonder what my dad was like. I bet he was pretty fucking cool. Oh, guess what? You're not going to know his fucking head looks like a goddamn blast. A tomato that fell off a car, his head splattered everywhere. That's it. And a professional did that. Who got trained in a fucking camp designed to teach people to do that and the most precise way possible.

Speaker 2:          00:39:22       It's crazy, man. It's amazing when you break it down like that. When you look at it for what the actual physical act of it is, instead of looking at it as a patriotic American supports everything that we do overseas and you know, put a fucking flag on your window. It says, God bless our troops. You know, instead of just looking at it analytically, not even like casting a blame just described as describing it. You just just describe it. It becomes insanity. It becomes a point where people were angry at you and they will say, you're talking shit about the American soldiers and the U s army. Well, you actually not even, you don't even have to. All you have to do is just describe what's happening. You don't have to talk any shit when you describe what's happening. The reality of the details is so horrific that people will interrupt you with excuses.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       Sure. Interrupt you. All you have to do is say what's happened, not even cast blame. Just describe it accurately. What you're doing there. See as you're walking through the laser in the museum that makes the fucking doors shut in front of the diamond. You know, it's like people have these trip wires in their brains where the moment you start talking about just the stuff we've been talking about now it's, you're hitting a fucking icon. You're hitting some conditioning that's been intentionally put there. Um, that's been intentionally put there because if it's not there, then you know, uh, the country can't function as an empire. I mean, it's got, you've got to have, if you're going to run an empire, the population has got to have deep and intense admiration for the military force because if they don't, then the military force isn't going to function because the military forces made up of the population.

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       But it becomes, at a certain point, Tom, you have to wonder, when does the military force realize these guys that are paying you absolute shit money and the guys that we have to do foundations for it, we have to do a benefits for, you know, to, for a traumatic brain injuries. You know, like people have to have help and contribute. That should, to me, when I found out that they need money for traumatic brain injuries for hospitals to deal with these guys, when they come back overseas with these horrible injuries, the first thing I thought is, man, how is that possible? They let that become an issue. How much would that cost in comparison to how much fucking money they're making over there? How much would it cost and who's making money? How about the fucking people that are making the,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       all the equipment he'll sell on the caliber and the people that make the air conditioning machines, there's, they're spending billions of dollars on air conditioning over there. You know, giant tents that they're fucking air conditioning. There's a lot of my, you're telling me they don't have any money to spend on traumatic brain injury. We shouldn't. They like invest in the best medicine possible with a smart scientists. How much would that cost? Would that be cost prohibitive? If that's cost prohibitive, then that the means of fucking war should be cost prohibitive. You shouldn't be investing in a war that you can't take care of your fucking soldiers after it's over. What the fuck is that? That's like, that's like driving across the country with just enough money for gas and no money for fights.

Speaker 5:          00:42:11       The most fucked up thing ever man. It's like, and, and that's the, that is the, the real sickening thing about it is whenever you run into people who are soldiers, like, like that guy, there was a coolest fucking guy at the, her Moses show he did man. He like said he listened to your podcast and like he was like in a special forces guy and he was fucking cool man. And every time I run into those people, they're cool and an authentic way or you know, you could be good friends with these people. You could trust these people

Speaker 1:          00:42:38       there. You have to have a tremendous character to get through the special forces, the green berets. You don't say what you will about someone, you know, being a, you know, a soldier who's a, you know, a puppet of a giant corporation, whatever, to be like a special forces soldier, you need to be a bad motherfucker. Period. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:42:55       Do you man, and those people are like some of our, there's some of our best people. Yeah. You're really, really are. There's some of our best fucking people. So to send them off to bullshit wars where they're getting fucking liquified instead of using them for real purpose, for something, for like really building the country up and really do like for in the inevitable event where some shit is going to happen and we're going to need them for real thing, you know, to send them to waste them for these fucking politicians who are, who are the real pop of the corporations to fucking send these heroes off to get their faces blown off in some country that they don't need to be. Man, that is beyond evil. That's some Rep Tilian vampiric weird shit man.

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       It is. It is. Yeah, it is. It's, it's if, you know, if they were eating people instead of just killing them, if every person that died, they ate, we would be horrified. Right, because everybody just dies. Yeah. Somehow or another, it doesn't seem like the kitten killed by monsters. No, they are. They're being killed by psychological monsters. They've been killed by people who are willing to kill people in order to profit. And it's really that simple and it doesn't seem like it should be possible in 2011 but that's the business that they're in. The guy who works at the fucking butcher shop, the guy who works at the slaughterhouse. Okay. Do you think that guy at a certain point in time, don't you think he gets used to killing cows? The fuck, yeah, he does. It's his job. But if you had to go there today and the like, you just were alone with the cow and all this machinery and then there was like a fucking manual, the told you exactly how you pull the cow into this and lead them into this spot and then send the piston through his fucking brain and then hook them up and then got him.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       You'd be so freaked out at the whole process because you're not used to it because it's not, it's not a normal yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:44:38       Part of your life. Yeah. Meanwhile, yeah, so these people are just used to it there. They just make sense to them and yeah, it's a normal part of their lives and normal part of their life, man. It's in it. It's like when you hear about the friends of Bush that got all those deals and Afghanistan, all the contractors and Shitty I to like the and how much they charge for a workout there that they charge, like saying money, money for this stuff and you realize, oh, this is just a, you know, the act of war. It's just a way to test out some new technology and to, uh, get, get a lot of people, some work and make a lot of people really writ,

Speaker 1:          00:45:12       yeah, incredibly rich. And the idea that everybody, you know, people say there's no way that people would go to war just for money. And I'm like, there's no way they wouldn't, there's no way they wouldn't if they had to sacrifice a few thousand people here or there to make untold trillions amount of dollars.

Speaker 5:          00:45:29       That is what it is too. Yeah. Yeah. That's funny. Cause if it was like, let's say there was just a group of like robed a demonic magicians that lived in some giant black tower and they're like, okay, we need 5,000 of your strongest and brave as men. We're going to sacrifice them at the top of the tower and from their blood, we will reap great energy. You'd be like, fuck here. That's the evilest thing ever. But if they're like, we got to send our troops over there to defend and fight for our country, suddenly you're like, oh yeah, totally. Makes Sense. Go ahead and do that. They're going to fight for your freedom. We're pigs, man. Listen to fucking, I was the Ozzy Osborne. He sums it up perfectly in that sock. Yeah. Why the war machine keeps turning. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       It is a war machine. And that's something that, you know, people have warned us about from the beginning of time. You know, there's, you know, people that are in charge, they're like everything. They're going to eventually get drunk with power and they're going to lead you in some terrible direction at all. Corruption evolves. And if it's not checked, it gets stronger and stronger and all you have to do is just go back to the Kennedy assassination. Go back to Lyndon Johnson, go back to Richard Nixon and Watergate and they're, oh, crux. Yeah. They've always been crooks and no one got caught a few along the way. Nixon, a few guys got popped for a little bit of this and a little bit of that, but for the most part, everybody got away with everything. The people who drafted up the Northwoods document, they didn't go to jail. Whoever the fuck shot Kennedy. Ooh, it was Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Yeah, sure he did. Sure he did. Yeah. All those people that heard bullets coming from behind them, they're just crazy. Yeah. They're just silly people. That was fucking probably like five or six dudes with guns. They think they've got to rely on one guy. And do you think that one guy really, really was on his own? Just a lone nut?

Speaker 5:          00:47:20       Yeah, we shut the fuck up. Which is why when you see John Mccain or pretty much directly telling Paul the yes with this bill, if someone is a threat to the security of the United States, you know John Mccain, this is from the person who fucking chose Sarah Pailin as his vice president. So that's how fucked up this man is. When you hear him saying, yeah, we can indefinitely arrest United States citizens who are a threat to the security of this country. You have to ask, well, what is John Mccain's definition of security? I know what mine is. What's John Mccain's definition of the security of this country? Because I think it's wildly different from my idea and your idea and for most people's idea of the security of the country. I think for John Mccain, the security of the country means that the corporations are able to function without getting disturbed by people who have the gall or audacity to say that, uh, the way that wealth is distributed right now is unfair and is fucking up. Uh, uh, is, is basically eating away in eroding the foundations of what this country is supposed to be about. I think fucking McCain would very much like to take those people and put them in some indefinite detainment. Um, if he could, and eventually, maybe it won't be Mccain. Maybe it won't be this year. Maybe when this bill passes, it'll be 15 years before it happens. But eventually people just start disappearing. People will vanish in the middle of the night.

Speaker 3:          00:48:54       Did you hear about this fucking ridiculous thing that Newt Gingrich said? Gary Johnson outed a Newt Gingrich about, uh, being a, a pot smoker and the fact that he, uh, was pushing for some thing that would make marijuana distribution after a certain amount, like a, with a certain volume would make it a law. You would be able to be put to death, essentially, you'd be eligible for the death penalty. This newt Gingrich, the guy who had missed it, he had smoked pot. He's talking about like pot dealers at wow. Gary Johnson outdid them on this.

Speaker 5:          00:49:31       Right. So yeah, so new. So right. And those are made. There are many people right now we're in control of this country. Who, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:49:37       Oh, how crazy is that? It's evil. Or imagine that someone's saying that you are a guy who sells pot because he sells a lot of it. What? He sells one joint. Wow. One joint. No death penalty. Okay. I've saw a million joints. Death penalty off with is, hey, you know why? Why? Because you're giving more people the same shit. That doesn't even make any sense. I've never understood that. The idea of like a volume issue makes the crime worse. Like give your cell on a couple of joints to your friends. It's like a little slap on the wrist. But if you're selling a hundred thousand pounds in the back of a semi, yeah, you're going to, you're going to get locked up for the rest of your life. Take it a little further back. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:50:11       You're talking about a fucking farmer. You're going to execute a farmer. It's agriculture. Malaria, shit grows out of the ground. You, you want to, you're going to execute a fucking guy who like, who is a horticulture? Is there a botanist? You're just gonna. You're going to kill somebody. You grew a plant. It's not like he was whipping up poison. You know what, that's, that's the weird thing. You could probably whip up 500 gallons of cyanide and distribute that around and you couldn't get the death penalty for that is deadly. Is that as pure deadly cyanide. But if you're growing enough fucking marijuana, uh, Newt Gingrich thinks that he can. He wants to execute you. He wants to kill you.

Speaker 1:          00:50:46       Speaker of the house. Newt Gingrich introduced in 1997 the drug importer death penalty act of 1996 a builder of acquired a sentence of death for certain importations of significant quantities of controlled substances. It would have applied to anyone convicted more than one, so carrying a hundred doses or about two ounces of marijuana across the board, or two ounces of marijuana across the border. 100 doses. That would be the death penalty. You'd be eligible for death. Yeah. What a monkey. What an old limp Dick Monkey. Just you old dumb fuck you. You ancient thinking shithead. You fucking rule maker. You write it down and everyone knocks the hammer and then it makes it right. Your fucking system is obviously bullshit. All of it's bullshit. So your laws are bullshit. All your rules are bullshit. All this posse comitatus, comitatus, whatever it is. That's bullshit too. It's just we just decide, people write things down on paper and we decide what is right and what wrong and then we know we're not agreeing to this.

Speaker 1:          00:51:54       We didn't even get to vote any of this. There's the idea that they can just impose this on you is nothing short of imperialism. It's nothing short of people telling other people what they can't do. Telling other people that they're not, they don't. They're not as special as them, that they're not worth as much as them did. They don't have any rights that they don't have any authority and that these people who write the things down on people on paper rather all of a sudden have the authority over the mass of other humans that don't. They're special. They override and now they're telling us that the override, because they have weapons because they're going to allow the military to actually enter into civilian areas and stop uprisings, so you're going to have tanks can stop Operation Wall Street. Literally what happened in Tiananmen Square that horrified every American when we saw those kids get run over by tanks and killed, it was terrifying that their government is so fucking ugh against them, that their government is so cool and so evil that he, they been willing to run over their citizens, run over the people whose hard work literally funded the empire, funded these tanks.

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       Every person chipped in a certain amount, but because he's people defy, because these people protest, they're going to run over him with tanks and crushed him on television in front of everybody.

Speaker 5:          00:53:14       That's right. And, and, and that's, that's the type of person that Newt Gingrich's

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       and that can come, that can come from this, from this action. And that's why people don't understand like why you getting so outraged about this? Why is this like this is crazy. This is like a movie. This is like Batman. Okay, we're, we're in Batman right now and you know, the, the evil people are slowly getting their grips on our, on our government. There's some guy with a fucking mask on and he's working for all the bad guys and he's pretending to be a senator and Batman has to figure this guy out and he has to get to him. And right now that guy looks like Barack Obama. Barack Obama was like, he's got a mask on, he's like some fucking lizard guy underneath all this and he's just a really good actor and he's got everybody convinced that everything's Cool and David Eick is right, man. They're all fucking reptilians.

Speaker 5:          00:54:00       He's kind of like him, man. It's so ridiculous. It almost like that would fit right into the plot if you found out Obama really was a reptilian. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:08       Would it like fit right in the plot of you found out that new Gingrich really was some evil reptilian that wanted to take over the reptile farm. You know, he doesn't like to leave this young reptiles runs things.

Speaker 5:          00:54:18       I would run these humans correctly, you know? Well you can, you know, before you get to there, fuck. Before you get to the reptilian part, you can just kind of look at what they really are and what they really are. Here's one thing you know about Newt Gingrich. Newt Gingrich is a murderer. He wants to kill people. Newt Gingrich feels comfortable killing people. You know that. And you also know that Newt Gingrich, uh, makes would make money off of that. Newt Gingrich makes money off of, would make money off of killing people. The people who support war make money off of killing people. They literally transform human beings into money. They kill human beings. And that turns into money and money's energy. So what that means is they're vampires. That's what they really are. They're vampires. They or they convert human energy through destruction into cash, and then they use that cash to make their lives better. Just like vampires sync their things in the people suck the blood to stay alive. It's the same thing. It's vampiric gets a vampiric form of existence. And um, it's really fucking terrifying when you realize that it's 100%

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       true. They're not only, is it 100% true? It doesn't seem to be any way to get them out other than them dying and young people taking their place, young people who grew up with the Internet. Yeah. Well it seems like a certain amount of the way the system is. It's like they've sort of just accepted it, you know, and everyone's accepted that it's just fuck

Speaker 5:          00:55:47       wash, but you, and you have to think, I don't think that they're unaware of the fact of where they're, where they're fallible. I think they know where they're fallible. They can't correct it. I think that they may be, they know what they're doing in a really intense way because they've had infinite amounts of money to study human psychology and to understand how to control populations. And they got it down to a science man. There's a great fucking documentary on the BBC called the century of the self. Have you seen that? No. Edward Bernays is this Guy Bernays who was like Freud's cousin. And, um, it's all about the ways that they started studying, how to manipulate, uh, the perception of populations for the sake of corporations. So for example, cigarette companies approached Bernays and they're like, listen, women don't want to smoke right now cause they think it's too masculine.

Speaker 5:          00:56:37       What do you, what do you think we can do to make it so that women want to smoke? And so Bernays said, well, you need to make women feel like it's a form of activism. Are there like pushing against uh, a male dominated culture? It's like make it part of the woman women's rights movement. So what they did is they got a bunch of these girls to march during the Macy date, Macy's Day parade. And at one point they told all the press that they're going to do this. At one point the women lifted up their dresses and like pulled cigarettes out of their gardens or whatever and started smoking in front of all these reporters who were snapping pictures. And so their reporters put that in all these newspapers, women's women want the right to smoke. Now all of a sudden what Bernays did or what the cigarette companies did is they tied into the DNA of the women's rights movement smoking.

Speaker 5:          00:57:24       So now smoking becomes a empowerment and empowerment and a sign of feminism. And all of a sudden women started smoking and it totally fucking worked. So yeah, totally work. So, so it's like, so stuff like Cree now's a long time ago, man. So he has a long time ago. So they started studying, you know, they started studying. It's just like, imagine like somebody who herd sheep or imagine somebody who is in charge of any kind of animal, a beekeeper for example, or anyone who's in charge of controlling animals. They're experts. They know how to like, they know how to do, like Turkey hunters are the same way. They're not in Turkey cause, and just the perfect way to make a Turkey appear and to blast it. So I think that people put a lot of money into studying human perception. The way people work. And I think maybe they, the what, what we think the amount of control that we think we wheeled his ma, it's an illusion.

Speaker 5:          00:58:16       I don't know when I see those fucking black Friday videos, you know when you see the black Friday videos of thousands of people stampeding through a Walmart banging down the door of a fucking Walmart like zombies. If you ever seen that video, when you see that, it's really, to me it's like man, I mean maybe you and me and a few other people have these ideas, but in general as a herd it seems like they've gotten people so doped up and dumbed down that uh, I don't know that they're making too many mistakes. I think they make mistakes here and there. I think they fuck up.

Speaker 1:          00:58:52       I think there's a lot of shit that's going on that is just coincidental and is more of a, a symptom of the, the way we've sort of developed as a society than a grand plan. And it's more of them filling in the gaps that were available, taking, taking advantage of a lot of situations that are available. I don't think that it's one gigantic group with a fucking finger on all the marionette handles autonomy.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       I think it's worse than that. I think it's, you know, the term gets stalled. You ever heard that term? Yes. So I think it's the good stock. I think it's like the, somehow the, the super consciousness that has emerged from this group of people collaborating his car, there's like a, it's, it's become its own thing. It's become an organizing force that's organizing towards the negative and towards the vampiric and not organizing towards the positive. Did you listen to the, you, you didn't listen to Bruce Lipton? I didn't. It was really interesting. He was on the podcast yesterday and one of the things he was talking about was the importance of creating a community, like a good community of, of people. You feed off their energy and those people that you're around and you feed off their energy, you know, if they're positive, you'll, you'll actually feel better.

Speaker 2:          01:00:04       You'll have a more positive light. And it totally makes sense. Totally. Oh yeah. That's, it's, it's the most important. That's one of the reasons that people, um, advise, uh, spending time and Ostrom's they're spending time around people who are meditating because you, um, from being around people who are working on, and also it's the same with martial arts. Do you want it, if you're around people who are fighters and you see the different forms and styles that they're using, that's going to, you're going to evolve just from being around them and seeing what they're doing. So techniques. Yeah. I said, yeah, it w you know, it's like you, when you learn techniques of thinking too. Yeah. That's one things that people always comment on this podcast. People, oh, I get emails and tweets and Facebook to zone where people are always talking about how, you know, they don't know anybody that thinks the way they think.

Speaker 2:          01:00:48       They don't have anybody that has the interest they or who looks at things in the just the raw, honest, black and white view that you see. And here's my perceptions and it's not flavored by what's politically correct and it's not flavored by, you know, what's, uh, what's thought to be a acceptable behavior. It's what I really think and I want to know if you think the same thing and when when you do that people, it resonates with people. They don't know anybody else who's doing that. All right. Well, um, so yeah, so, so right. So in that same way that like this podcast has, because of the incredible connection it's given me with like Shitload to fucking people, uh, my evolution sped up because I'm constantly getting like amazing videos, book recommendations, basic things from Blake's, Twitter lists, all the crazy stories. So it's certainly altered me and I and it for the positive.

Speaker 2:          01:01:40       Now imagine 100% of many of me as well, you know, as I've been a part of it, you know, as like doing the podcast, being a part of it, it's completely enhanced my, my perception of things and people have cleared up, uh, things that I didn't understand before. People have sent me alternative points of view that also should be considered. Like there's so many interesting bits of information they keep coming at you from all these different forums. Right. It's great. It's creating a feedback loop. What I was getting at is that this what these people have put together with the people involved in the military industrial complex and put together is a very high level evil version of that. That's it man. But they have a high level evil version of thinking where everyone is thinking

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       along the same way. And you have to make sacrifices and you got to crack some eggs to make an Omelette. And all of this thinking is put into like a, a mindset. And that mindset is enforced into the troops, beaten into their head, supported through the ranks, applied to corporations

Speaker 5:          01:02:38       and, and many of them. And it's really like when you consider that many of the people at the top of the, uh, power structures are fundamental is Christians. It's hilarious. Now imagine this, imagine that they weren't fundamentalist Christians. Imagine they were just, you know, cultists and they believed in a dark God. They worshiped at dark art and this dark God was a child sacrifice or, and, uh, sacrificed its own son at one point, spelled the blood of its own son, um, out of some sense of obligation or power. And that they were praying and worshiping daily to a dark God who was planning revenge on the majority of the human race and was right now at this very moment, planning and getting ready to destroy the planet with plagues and different and horsemen and trumpets and weird like crazy fucking, uh, angels that were going to fly down and kill and poison the largest of the earth.

Speaker 5:          01:03:31       And they're worshiping this guy daily. They go to church and worship a god that wants to destroy the planet every fucking day. They pray to this God, oh Lord, give me the courage to lead today so that I may be prepared for when you were a turn and destroy the planet. That's who they fucking pray to, man. That's God. They pray to God. They pray to a God that wants to wipe us out. Throw us in hell, kill the fucking homosexuals, destroy the majority of the planet. So all that's left is a few John Mccain's style honkies where their feet a river of blood waving up at Gabriel are worshiping God. Like I'm walking down the streets of gold waving American flags. That's the freaks. Who are, a lot of them are running this fucking country, man, that ain't good. That's not good. That's bad. I don't want anyone having access to a nuclear arsenal that worships at God. That's planning on, it's some random time blasting the planet I'm living on and wiping out the majority of the people because he's pissed about what they did do is fucking Hippie kid 22,000 years ago. Like, come on man, forget about it. I'm, I wasn't alive back then. I can't help it. They fucking threw your kid up on a cross. I had nothing to do with it. Why are you coming back to kill their descendants? You weirdo. You us the fucking break. You're God traveled back in time and pluck them off the fucking cross, man.

Speaker 1:          01:04:55       Yeah, and this need controlling this whole game, doesn't he? How can you just give it come down and give us better directions? He just gives you this game and you just fuck this game up and you're supposed to read some old manual and how to play the game and it's interpreted through three different languages and it was just a, a spoken word thing for a thousand years before that. So who knows how much of it's fucking valid and this is how you playing game and you're fucking up along

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       the way and everybody is telling you, you keep fucking up and he's going to come and he's going to take you away. He's going to take you away and I'm going to put you in a dark, dark place forever. But this is thoughts and they have these ideas, these urges, and they seem to be natural. You better stop Presto's fuck. I want to fuck all the time. Don't do it. Go to house. This guy's an asshole. I want to kill him. You can't do it. You can't kill him. And that's the most amazing thing that these same people, all of a sudden you're allowed to kill him if some sanction group says, absolutely you can do. You can even say you're doing it for God. May God bless you all. Wow. God, God is blessing us to go Jackson. People we don't know

Speaker 5:          01:05:55       their God, their God. I called their God loon, loon, and it's this weird fucking creature. It reminds me of an HP Lovecraft demon spirit. If you change the name of their guy or their guy doesn't have a name, that's the name, it's a name was God. It's like out of fucking cone. And it's a nameless. It's an invisible, nameless God. Yeah. And they worshiped the invisible, nameless God, and, and, and part of worshiping the invisible nameless God is a sending kids off to war and fucking letting the kids kill people. And another part of worshiping the invisible nameless God is making it to gay people can't get married. The invisible nameless one. You know what he hates Joe? What he fucking hates but sex. Damn. Why did you make it feel so good? One with no name. He curses the gays. The one with no name. He doesn't like bud sex. He's like really upsetting the end of the little Richard Song.

Speaker 3:          01:06:47       Tutti frutti used to be Tutti. Frutti good booty.

Speaker 5:          01:06:50       No, it didn't to the fruit it, that's why I, that's why little Richard is his, his booties. He's eternally damned by this fucking Luma. Tutti Frutti good booty evil man. He's an evil man. Did you see that damn cartoon I made by the way? No. Jesus heals a gay, no, I like read did like a, I took an old Christian cartoon of Jesus healing a leper and just replace the words with him. Healing a homicide. She'll hold it up. Hold it up. Who isn't? I didn't like four hours. So it ain't looking at professional fucking going to be known enough to give me a thank you to be now.

Speaker 3:          01:07:23       Sorry. Don't you know I have to qualify it first. You're so humble. No, I will when I have to be. This is not a, hey, we should talk about that sketch that you did. That's like the I got you. I'm going to get you sucker. Oh yeah, please. Let's clear that's clear that because uh, I know for a fact that Dunkin did not remember that thing when he made that sketch. And I also know because I didn't remember that sketch and that, what are you talking about? Dunkin made a video with Natasha, a hilarious video. What's it called? Uh, it's called falling apart. Falling. You're Padam teeth and the idea of the video, there's, there's a scene where the girl starts taking off fake parts and there's a scene in, I'm going to get you sucka. Where is it? The same thing happened where he's alone with this girl Keenan. Ivory Wayans is alone with his check and she starts taking off all those parts. I completely forgot about that. Even though I'm a big fan of Keenan Ivory Wayans and know I saw that movie,

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       I completely forgot about it and I know the Dunkin did not know about it because when he, first of all, I know Dunkin, he would never do something like that. You're one of the most, you have some of them. The most clear artistic integrity out of almost anybody that I've ever met. It's you're, you're 100% legit and what you do to the point where you wouldn't even do the Pauly shore reality show. That's true. He walked away from a money job on a television show where he was going to be on a reality show cause he [inaudible] thing. I would like to say there was no money. It was a, it wasn't like I was walking away from. It would have benefited the pop, but have benefited you. I thought, Oh, I thought you get paid for it. You wouldn't get oh no money at all.

Speaker 2:          01:08:54       I don't think that's legal. I don't even think that's legal to put you on television. I think they have to give you, they have to give you like some after a minimum. That's what I thought. Because there was a documentary, technically they weren't going to pay. It's a documentary, but it was all scripted. Everything he did with script, how is my feeling? They was all scripted. That was my feeling. But they all, they do that with all these reality shows when they create it, things for them to do well I think, I think in the dilemmas in the long run, maybe someone could have contested it or something, but really if it, if it, if there had been money I would've still walked away, could have been a good show and he could have been a good show if it wasn't what it was was a Pauly shore showcase if could have been, was like a real realistic viewpoint of all these dudes who are doing standup are out there scratching that real intense creative environment.

Speaker 2:          01:09:41       That was that comedy store man. There was, there was some, you know when we were around back then, the comedy store with you and me and Dheas and Ari and you know, there's a lot of good guys. They're, it's fucking great right now. I mean like, and believe you, it's fucking really good there right now. The crowds are, it's packed. It's got a really cool vibe. But like, but that, that fucking poly thing, man, it was like, there was a lot of reasons that I walked away from that and at one of the biggest ones, um, aside from the fact that I did not want, I desperately didn't want to be in it was that I had gotten trapped at that job as the talent coordinator. I've been doing that job for a long time and I needed a way out and it was just a perfect exit mechanism for me.

Speaker 2:          01:10:23       And it was, that show is like, I'm so happy that that show happened because it got me the fuck out of there, man. You can get stuck at a desk, man. Yeah, you can get stuck at a job. But the, as far as the way his brother movie stuff goes, so let me, let me just explain it. Um, the, the scenes are very similar, but Dunkin sort of has a completely different point to it. But look, the idea of someone having something fake, I mean, how many movies have been when a guy grabs a girl's hair and it's a wig and she's bald with like four or five straggly hairs has been like a bunch of those sex naked gun. Yeah. It means it's just one of those, it's like a comedy device. It's almost like a spit take that someone's got a fake leg or fake arm. But both videos, the in every way in ones and yours took it to the end most degree, which is by the way, what you naturally do when you make something funny you, you always

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       in, the more you beat on it, the funnier it gets. And it's essentially the same joke. What, what? Um, so where that idea came from that I did and I have seen, I'm going to get you Sucka and I did not remember that scene. And if I had I never would have done it. That's a scary thing, right? When a an ideas in your head and it comes down, you're like, God damn it. That was too easy. Well, no. See, here's the thing, what that idea came from was from watching Natasha take her earrings off and I was watching her take her earrings off and then I started thinking about like how like when you're dating someone you're like try like when you're in a relationship with someone and used or you start dating somebody and you know, part of it is you begin to like disassemble their personality.

Speaker 5:          01:11:56       You know, the more you get to know someone, when you've been with someone for a very long time, you're in a relationship or you're married, you get to know the deepest part of them, you end up getting to know very, very deep parts of them that are hidden by the hidden, by their personalities and things that they don't ever display in public or maybe they don't even know about. You get to know the deepest levels, man, when you're, when you've been having sex with someone for a long time and you know, like the deepest level of a person and you've been living with someone. So anyway, I was thinking like, man, it's so weird how that's what it's all about. It's basically just like plucking away the different pieces of someone until all they are is, is this primal spark that you're fucking, so that was the idea. That's where it came from. And you know, you think of when you look at it, Natasha taking over earrings. Yeah. That was pretty high.

Speaker 5:          01:12:48       But, but so, so, um, so, uh, anyway, that's it. That's where the idea came from. We had to pitch it. We pitched it to Adam TV. They never, we've pitched it to Adam TV. They didn't know about the, uh, they didn't mention the weigh ins thing. Uh, we made the fucking thing and then immediately a few people posted links to the Wayans brothers and it's like God fucking damn it as it really, really similar. Cause I, I saw the movie but I barely remember it. I think that it's, uh, it's the, it's the exact same, it's the exact same device, which is, uh, disassembling a woman, but the endings totally different. And the point of the things totally different. But to me what was really surprising and intense about it was that some people like really use that against me. And like kind of like a really angry fucking way on Twitter and youtube.

Speaker 5:          01:13:40       Have you been at like, I didn't even know this APP. I got some like shitty messages from people, but it's like if I'm going to steal, right? If I'm going to steal, I'm going to steal something. I'm going to steal a sketch. I'm going to steal fucking something. You know what? I'm not going to steal it from, I'm not going to steal it from a fucking Wayne's movie. You know, like it's so obscure. It's probably easier to hide. I'm going to get you. Sucka is one of the most popular. You have to, you have to consider it. It is possible that your might have it in your head and that you forgot. Oh well,

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       sure, of course. But that shit happens to me, all that man. But here's the thing. A lot of a lot of jokes are a form of math. It's like an equation. If you take up some mess, it's an equation. And if you break that equation down, it has natural logical connections in that equation. And a lot of comedic minds are going to, if you give them a premise, they're going to come up with a parallel thing. Unfortunately though, you saw that other one first. Yes. Factors. It could have been juiced in my brain, but I still though there it is like a, Wayne's has got a transvestite, I think it's a transvestite. She appears hot at first and he takes her apart and she's not hot as I recall from it. He flees and that's it. You know what I mean? It's like it is the same court.

Speaker 2:          01:14:57       It's not the same thing. It's like I'm fucking making, I'm making, you can't really defend it though because it is exactly the same joke. You know what I'm saying? Like if someone was, someone stole the joke from you but then just twisted it into that and I know he didn't steal it. That would be no, there'd be no, you know there's like, there's like no excuse. You can't say, well I did it differently. Of course you thought of it under me and I fucking do it. It's there on the Internet. There's nothing I do about it. And like you're not even Mexican. My name is nay know man. I did some, you know what I'm saying though? It's like it's like it parallel thinking is just, it's unavoidable what it is. You got to go, Oh shit, I didn't, whoops. Listen to me. I'm going to steal your fucking sketches from now on.

Speaker 2:          01:15:44       I've made the decision and said that someone will cut that. Edit that part. I don't unleash the hackers Joe. They're going to cut out that part. You just fucked up. Really fucked up. Yeah. You said something you should never say. Why? Say Rude mean things and pretend that's a, that's a tired form of common. It can be fucking funny dude. The soup. I did the soup this morning. That show's funny, dude. I did not know. They had a bunch of really funny sketches where they were making fun of the chicks are high. We're real housewives. I was stone cold sober. They were making fun of real housewives of Beverly Hills. Like one of the crazy chicks is kind of cracked out and the show this one of the writers as how hilarious version of this check. Like I had to, I just guessed by seeing it. It was hard to hear because it was really loud in there, but I asked her like right away, I was like, that's like girlfriend real house while she's like, yeah, and I high fived her.

Speaker 2:          01:16:36       It was like really funny shit man. That Joel Mchale Dude, he's fucking funny. He's got a great delivery and the writers are really funny, man. They had some funny shit on Kim Kardashians and dude, I watched this one show, this access morning show where this guy, they were goofing on it. It's on tonight's episode. You have to watch this because you can't believe this is real. This guy is reading from his blackberry and he's talking about his help, his Mexican help. We gave them a chance to serve the other day, you know, we've never served before and here you go, here's your shot. Oh my God, dude, it's so gross.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       And then he reads the guys text in broken English. Oh me leg shaking all day. Ah, reads it in like a Mexican accent. Ah Dude. It's like you watch it and go my God, someone pull that guy aside and give him a mushroom trip. Yeah. Someone give that dude a mushroom trip and a mirror and sit them in a room and tell him to think about as the life of fuck man. Yeah. It's pretty disturbing. This as it's so clueless. Again here I'm doing it. It's just so clueless. It's like so weird that you don't, you don't think that people are gonna find that really gross. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:17:43       It really makes me believe in the idea that like there's like two species happening right now. Like humans are differentiating and like some humans are jumping away from the uh, what, what most humans are. I think some people are splitting away cause like for me to be in a mind state where I thought like that or I acted like that or I read someone's texting and, and, and like some stereotypical Mexican accent to humiliate them. If I was for me to be new one, thank you. Assuming I would have to, I think I'd have to have a head injury and it imagine if I started doing that, you'd be authentically worried about, you'd think I'd had a breakdown or this is how this person lives every day of their fucking life. So it's like, what is that? Who, what kind? What kind of being is that?

Speaker 5:          01:18:27       Is that, that's a human, I know it's a human, but it's not the same kind of human I am. That's a different kind of human that's a full of shit human. That's a full of shit human. That's a, I don't know what it is. How old is it? How old is that thing? How old is that guy? He's in his thirties so this is a guy in his thirties he's managed to get to his thirties and he still like that nothing's knocked him off the path. He's never, you know, when you see someone like that, you know a few things. You know that he's never smoked pot probably. It's probably definitely never taken acid. Never eaten mushrooms, probably has never heard really good music.

Speaker 1:          01:19:00       And he's like, he's like one of those salamanders. It never really goes to the transformation because the water never reaches a certain alkaline level. Yeah. That's what he is, man. You know, you ever hear those? There's certain, there's certain animals that never met a morphosis. Yeah, the word metamorphosize. There are certain animals that if the conditions are incorrect or if there's pollution in the environment, all kinds of different factors have to be taken into account. Otherwise they won't make the connection.

Speaker 5:          01:19:24       He's like a puppy that's eyes didn't open, her ears didn't open. You know, it's, it's eyes stayed fucking shut.

Speaker 1:          01:19:29       It's a fucking, it's just silly hippie argument that everybody needs psychedelics better. You know, it's not everybody. I'm not saying everybody needs them, but God damn, a lot of people could use them. A lot of this if they would just study, um, and they would just distribute them through experts. Imagine what this world would be like if we had centers where you could go as a young man to have a psychedelic experience and get a broader view of the universe. And someone takes you in and they do blood work on you and make sure you're healthy. And then they sit you down and you watch documentaries and you take a class and when you graduate from the class and the class is all about pharmacology and the way that different things interact with your body and when the, when you're done with this class, you feel educated and you feel like you can make your own decision whether or not you want to try this and if you do want to try it then they have a ceremony and every kid goes in there and you all with proper meditation techniques, proper education as to what the, the history of the use of these substances is and the history and the anecdotal evidence that it may have been responsible for the actual birth of religion.

Speaker 1:          01:20:33       That this might be what religion is all about. It might be psychedelic experience. If we could have that, we can have communities where we did that well. You'd have a big giant football field fill of people that are doing mushrooms and are putting out positive energy and are there and are balanced healthy people that want to unite together as a species and want to embrace each other. And help each other and no one ever get greedy, but let's all work together and do this together. And you could have a football field filled with people doing this. A stadium filled with people doing this. Yeah. That would fix the world. And it sounds ridiculous. It sounds like you're saying mushrooms would fix the world. What would do it better? What? What could possibly have that effect? Education education doesn't necessarily get through. Your subconscious education doesn't necessarily get through your programming side.

Speaker 1:          01:21:20       Education doesn't necessarily get through anything in your life. That's, that's really ingrained as a behavior pattern. It doesn't always, you can tell people all day like Brian that cigarettes caused cancer and this silly, goofy [inaudible] cigarettes probably more than mushrooms. No, no, it wouldn't. Mushrooms would do it better than anything. Sex is just in is no enlightenment involved in that, Brian. It's silly. The psychedelic experience itself is important. You need to be humbled. It's not just everybody fuck everybody and feel good about it. Yeah. We've talked about this before when Duncan was design in like, you know, that might be good for like five out of 10 people and the other five, they're so terrified they're not going to ever leave the house again. This is not necessarily the case because if it was done correctly through some sort of a shamanically center where they actually evaluated people and, and, and, you know, and taught them and educated them, he'd probably be able to weed out the people were fucked up and the Pr, I'd be like, dude, reality itself is a little fucking slippery for you. Maybe you should not be doing this. Maybe we should look into like Ritalin for you. Maybe we should, you know what I'm saying? I mean, sure, I'm a lot of people or 100% anti, uh, antidepressants. They're like, fuck that dude. You're ruining your brain chemistry. Fuck that dude. Don't let them change your brain. I know several people where it's literally changed their life for the better and save their life. Maybe even, I know several people, so I would never say that. I would never say that. Well, man, no know. No

Speaker 5:          01:22:42       fucking, I mean the thing is there's no rules. It's like you. This is the main rule is it's this is your incarnation and you get to do what you want with it. The idea is to like as much as you can expand and your, your levels of happiness in your awareness so that you can feel connected and, and good in this existence and there are a lot of tools to do that. Some of the tools take a long fucking time do and I think like when Mckenna was talking about mushrooms being the most obvious tool to transform the, to create like a huge wide scale transformation on the planet, he recognized that there's not a lot of time. That's what he was thinking. It's not like we've got a ton of fucking time to create like meditation temples or to spread good information or to spread some new religion.

Speaker 5:          01:23:24       There's no time for that shit. You would if you really wanted to transform these weird people who worship invisible, homophobic child sacrificing God's. If you wanted to transform people who feel comfortable dropping bombs on other people, then the quickest way to do it would be to give them a substance that allowed them to connect to each other end of the earth and to develop an instantaneous form of empathy unlike anything else. And then when they came back to, it'd be much more difficult to think about, to perceive what they're, they're weird, invisible God in the same way.

Speaker 1:          01:23:57       It's almost like we're moving in a direction in a terrible direction because we don't have the proper ingredients. So because we don't have the proper ingredients, we can't feel what we're doing. And it's almost like we have a numb arm probing into the darkness that that numb arm is scratching the fuck out of reality. And we don't know because we just can't feel it. But if we could just feel it, if we could add this other ingredient into the mixture that his life, well then, okay, now all your pieces are in order and now you can see and feel what you're doing. Because the big problem with human beings when it comes to pollution, when it comes to destroying the atmosphere, when it comes to the idea of, you know what, what these nuclear disasters, we're not feeling it. We don't feel it. We don't feel the damage that we're doing. We don't feel the garbage patch in the ocean. You don't feel anything when you throw, when you, when you take a water bottle and then you toss it in the garbage can, you did your job. I'm done. I'm done. I have no connection with this anymore. And then we don't feel when it goes into the ocean and becomes a fucking patch that's floating, that's as big as Texas. We don't feel that. And that, that is a lack of a connection. That's a missing thing. That's an animal that doesn't have all of its ingredients.

Speaker 5:          01:25:07       Well, it's fucking blind. Yeah. That's what it is. It's blind and everyone's stumbling around blind and there their focus is, uh, on material gain and their focuses on shit that can, if it does make you happy, it's a form. Very transient, temporary happiness. That's you for a lot of people. It's usually followed by like depression and stress. Like people who buy shit, they can't afford getting the debt to the banks and become slaves. And so yeah, man, people are, um, people have lost the initial original connection with the spirit of the earth. You know, if you think about like Iowasca and the people and um, drinking it in the jungle and community with the mind of nature and then getting direction from the tribe, from the mind,

Speaker 1:          01:25:49       and for people to think this is hippie bullshit. When scientists first came to the Amazon and discovered Iowasca, they tried to call it telepathy dean. That's what they were going to try to talk to do. They were going to name it as, because the fact that they were able to have these telepathic

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       experiences with each other and they all communicated about having shared visions and shared hallucinations. So they were going to call it telepathy in, but it was already the chemical and it was already named harming or the, the, you know, whatever the, the substance was. And so they had to, they had a stick with the name harming but we'll, we'll see this substance. I think uh, for these people has been a form of spiritual compass. It points in the right direction. It reminded sets you straight. It's a, it's a like a tuning fork for your soul. But it's amazing that talking about this, how did this happen? Talking about, this is ridiculous. Talking about this as absolutely silly. I feel nervous when we start talking about mushrooms can change the world. Cause I'm like who the fuck you know, w what does this idiot saying? You know, what can I bounce this?

Speaker 2:          01:26:48       Is he saying he, while you're compelled, meanwhile you're compelled to say, listen, I know it sounds stupid. I know I'm a goofy look. Fuck I know him. The fear factor guy, I know who the hell am I am barely got through high school. I went to three years of college where I halfway paid attention. But I'm saying that we might be overlooking one of the biggest tools that human beings have ever had for evolving and developing, and that might be why the fucking train is off the tracks and into the woods. It might be that the animal isn't balanced and it might be that the animal literally developed eating all this stuff. The animal might have become consciousness and aware from being a savage eating all this stuff. It might be, you know, we might have a symbiotic relationship on this earth with certain plants that we've made illegal.

Speaker 2:          01:27:38       We might need them in order to be aware of our potential, the potential harm that we can do, the potential good that we can do. You have positivity. There's no mind about it. The value of positivity is so important when you're on a substance that is where all bad trips come from. All bad trips come from some negativity. Whether it's a paranoia, whether it's a fear, whether it's a bad memory that you have that you're trying to avoid, shitty behavior that haunts you, that you can't correct whatever the fuck it is that triggers the bad trip. It's always a negative thing. Well, what what it is, is it's what's happening is that when you're, when you're taking a psychedelic, you're being given a glimpse at yourself from a distance that maybe you can't have an obtained and you, like meditation will give you that distance.

Speaker 2:          01:28:22       It gives you a form of intense mindfulness. And so all of a sudden you're able to see, um, the, I think the root of whatever pattern your life is becoming. The root as a feeling. And that feeling for a lot of people can be a negative feeling. And so that's when people say, you know, I don't like smoking pot, man, cause I, it makes me get introspective. I get paranoid and nervous. It's like no pot is not making you paranoid. Pot is showing you the paranoia that exists deep within you that's causing you to act fucking weird and causing your, our relationships to be a little more adult than they need to be. And causing your actions to be a little muted because you're afraid of the reaction that people are going to have. Do you? Cause you're a,

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       you're still stuck in survival. You want to survive so bad that you're scared and you've covered that up with all the different, whatever clothes you've decided you're going to wear in this incarnation and your tattoos or whatever you've learned. But deep within that, behind all that for a lot of people is uh, something that you could easily turn negative energy. But I think it's, uh, it's fear, it's fear and that and psychedelic show you that. And so the way to trip and he centers that you're talking about and if they're really, the centers were there, then when someone started experiencing, uh, a difficult trip, then these people would, instead of getting them away from that, they in the best way possible, try to turn the person to like, what is that fear? Is that fear real? Cause the joy of a psychedelic is when you have the balls to go into the darkness and all of a sudden you realize that darkness was a complete illusion.

Speaker 5:          01:29:55       All the darkness and negativity and Spooky Shit and guilt and fear and crappy thought was inside you and all the bad things you thought you've done and all the things that you feel terrible about. Secretly you realize that's nothing. It's an illusion. The universe loves you. You're completely embraced by the entire universe. You're an incremental part of the functioning of the cosmos and you're an incredible, wonderful, perfect fucking thing. And when you get a glimpse of that, it's the greatest feeling ever because you're healed. Cause that's what true healing is, man. True healing is realizing you were never sick in the first place. True healings. Realizing you were just, you just had some fucking, uh, yeah, a little bit of dust on the windshield, man. I think you brush it off, you know, that's, uh, and that's, and that's what psychedelics do for you. And you know, what else does that for you?

Speaker 5:          01:30:38       Really good therapy, but really good therapy costs a lot of money and it takes a long fucking time. You have to be open to it, open to change and smart. And you have to have the ability to recognize your own faults. Some people just have this weird shield between them and reality where they've become successful because they never admit guilt and they just press forward and they rationalize every single thing they do when just press forward. And that becomes a mindset just as much as you know what we're talking about. Yeah. That becomes just how work is done, you know? And that's how military his work, that's the only way they work. You have to fall into a mindset. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's how, I mean, that's the thing. We've, we're all, we've all fallen into a mindset and a lot of the fundamentalist Christians, they've fallen into these rituals and patterns, but they don't have a real connection anymore.

Speaker 5:          01:31:23       So they're faking it or they're actually just like taking cues from like really charismatic lunatics. Wouldn't it be awesome if the military really was our bravest and boldest who wanted to protect us and who are led by the, the most moral and intelligent people on the planet. These really, truly were heroes. And in case some shit goes down, they're never puppets. They're only heroes. There's no doubt whatsoever that they're only doing the right thing when that'd be beautiful. Yeah. They'd be like celebrities when that'd be beautiful. You know, they should be, they re most of them really want to be heroes. You know, most of the really want to protect.

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       It's the people that are putting them there was, are the problems. The people that are pointing you in that goes, those are the bad guys. Go get them. I'll be over here with a pencil to write down how many a kill. And if you do a good job, I give you a shiny piece of metal and I stick it to your fucking chest. Ah, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:32:17       It's so fucking sad, man. It's so sad and disturbing and it's like, it's, it's so easy to get caught up in, in that, you know, it's so easy to get caught up in the macro, uh, of, of the, of the darkness that's in the world. But man, I think that the trick is to like only spend a little time on that and spend more time fucking working on a real basic things in your life that you can do right now to like, um, to make things a little better. Like tickets. A lot of people will focus on Kim trails when they need to be focusing on stopping smoking. Like I had a person describe Kim trails to me, smoking a fucking Marlboro light talking about, man, they're fucking drop in this shit on us. That's sickening. US making us stupid. It's like, dude, you know, you're inhaling, you're inhaling cancerous smoke, uh, created by fucking corporation that's making money.

Speaker 5:          01:33:13       It's making money off of healing. Healing cares about some fucking Kim trails, brother, you got to stop smoking. You like, that's probably way worse it many more people are dying from cigarette smoke. They're dying from chem trails. Yeah, that's so silly. So those are the steps. But people, it's a really simple thing to do. You get caught up in the macro instead of being like, you know what? Here's the thing you can try instead of worrying about Kim trails, why don't you fucking get a good recipe book of like raw recipe book trading raw for a few days and see if that makes you feel better. Cut Out some fucking, uh, cut out eating processed food for a few days, not forever, just for a few days. And the issue is

Speaker 1:          01:33:48       a lot of them are really misinformed and they really do believe that there's this constant aerial bombardment. But one of the reasons why they believe it is because they have done some chemical spraying on people and they've done it against people's will. It's a fact. Sure. You know, it's not, it's, I don't believe it's happening every day. I think a lot of what people are seeing is called con trails. It's a natural thing that happens when jet engines encounter moisture in the atmosphere. It was explained to me by a pilot.

Speaker 5:          01:34:12       Yeah. But let's go fight the chem trail pilots when we've got a clear head because we haven't been eating shitty food and, uh, and when we feel like fit because we've been exercising, that's when we can start waging the real, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:34:24       Oh wait, my point is, my Pi is the reason why they believe that there's chem trails is because there have been chem trails. They're really happened. The government has experimented. I have no doubt. I don't think they're doing it all the time, but it has happened. Sure. There's not only hasn't had, hasn't happened, but in certain states, I'm like, God was at Georgia. I forget what state it is. Um, anyway, the point is that it's, it's literally like written into insurance laws. Like there's, there's things about, you know, like chemicals spraying that like a, you know, you, you insure against, I believe I'm, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm speaking out of, uh, out of hand right here because I don't know the exact details of it. It seems a little blurry in my mind right now while I'm trying to pull it up. But I remember whatever it was, this little piece of legislation, whether it was a all you know, something about insurance or not, whatever it was, it was written down.

Speaker 1:          01:35:13       It was essentially saying that there will be weather controlled experiments there. They will do something to alter the weather. And we know that in Abu Dhabi they made it rain 50 times last year. Wow. So they essentially made it rain once a week with a plane flying over. I think it's aluminum oxide and bury him or something. I forget what it is that they, they spray into the air, but they spray it and somehow or another, it makes these clouds form and it makes, it makes rainfall in the desert in Abu Dhabi. Man, it's amazing. I mean, it's incredible. So if we know that they're doing that well they gave people so he didn't lose learn how to do it over there is my point. They probably practiced some shit here and they, they, you know, and they probably been doing it here in, in small doses for a long time, you know.

Speaker 5:          01:35:58       Well. Yeah, I mean like I eat pretty much anything that I've found out about the government doing. I wouldn't be that surprised, like know no matter you say syphilis, you're talking about the Tuskegee. Yeah, they fucking blasted Vicki. What is the exact details of that? They expected. A bunch of books asked me.

Speaker 1:          01:36:15       I think what I was was they told some that they're being treated and they weren't being treated with any medication. They lied to them to see the degenerative effects of the disease.

Speaker 5:          01:36:23       Dude, on this century of the self thing there, there's uh, there were interviewing the fucking main psychologists for the CIA during the 60s and the 70s and he's just talking about all the shit they did with LSD experiments where they like white people's paths away. They would blast you on as it and give you a lecture shock therapy to try to fucking or raise your personality. Like they've done all kinds of crazy shit and they probably are continuing to do crazy shit. And there was a really good chance that when you're driving through any public space, you're being bombarded with subliminal messages and all the billboards that you're seeing that are turning you into a mat, into a, into a fucking rabid consumer that only wants to eat and drink and a, it doesn't ever want to think about anything more than getting a raise and getting drunk at night.

Speaker 5:          01:37:06       And it may be that this is all intentional, but what I'm saying is if you worry about that too much, then you're not going to do your dishes and you're going to have roaches in your fucking apartment and then you're going to start feeling depressed and then you get really caught deep in the trap to, to the first thing you have to do is like come to your senses. That's the first thing. And the easiest way to come to your senses is to like stop taking the fucking stop putting the pills in your mouth. You know, like movies about mental asylums. Inevitably the hero will always start putting the pillows under his bed and have that little line of pills under his bed. And all of a sudden he's come to his senses again and he can plan his escape. But until you fucking stop taking the pills, you can't plan your escape. So it's like, okay, yeah, maybe there's some fucked up shit happening in the world, but you got to stop smoking. Maybe there's some fucked up shit happening in the world, but you should run a few times

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       a week. Maybe there's fucked up shit happening in the world, but you need to take a shower, brush your teeth, floss good so that you're get clean and healthy. And then when you have more of a clear head, then you can start making real moves and really analyzing what may be happening. But until then you're all foggy and fucked up. When you see Michael Moore, don't you want to go, dude? Yeah, forget about the government. Yes, take care of yourself. So you got to deal with a fucking tear at tyranny and yourself. You've got to deal with the fucking demonic senators and congressmen inside of you that keeps telling you to eat a fucking cheeseburger and a bag of Doritos before you go to bed. Stop those fucking people first veto there bills that are coming from inside your heart. Is that a self hate thing?

Speaker 2:          01:38:36       Is that an, I don't care about my own safety thing. It's just like I'm obsessed with my goals. I'm obsessed with my interest. I don't care about my own personal safety to the point where I'm just going to over feed myself. Yeah, well rational thinking, just completely given to impulse. It's a fuck. What did, I mean? I think what it is is it's like a, a row. It's a literal Rut. It's like you've been going in this circle for so long that you can't get out. You're like a truck. His wheels are stuck in the mud. So you just stuck in this endless pattern. That's what we do. Humans get stuck in patterns, you know? And so the idea is to get knocked. You gotta knock yourself out of that pattern somehow. And the quickest way to do that is with a psychedelic. If you don't want to take a psychedelic than just seriously start.

Speaker 2:          01:39:16       I know that sounds super hippy. Start fucking juicing. Drink healthy, eat healthy, just eat healthy. I don't care why you eat, eat fucking healthy, fighting mixed juice. Three days. Vitamix. Vitamix is way better. Yeah. I just, I got this fucking a, it's the best way to force yourself to eat a ton of vegetables. Do you just drink it? You know, you think about like how much I eat. I have a one big cucumber, like six stalks of celery, five big giant leaps of Kale and a big chunk of ginger and a pair and I just blast all that shit. There's no way I'm going to sit and eat all that ginger. I love Ginger and as you can throw in there, that's good man. Fucking Jalapeno. It's so fucking good. I've had marked drop and Jalapenos in the blender with almost everything I made. I made a fucking chocolate Mousse the other day and my calendar and I threw a Jalapeno in there.

Speaker 2:          01:40:10       Delicious. Kind of like spicy chocolate. Why? You can put in fucking anything. You can put it in like you can put anyway dude, you need to show in the food. You can do anything with the Jalapeno Jalapeno, my asshole today. Chop. What does a slap chop. You could be as flat and the slap chop. I gladly do it. You'd be like Dunkin, the Jalapeno guy. You could have a book. I'm dunking Jalapeno guy showing you [inaudible] please. Crazy. I put it in my baby out the Jalapenos inside toothpaste kills bacteria that he's enlisted marine can't get to and this is like an ancient way that the Mayans used to clean their teeth. They cheat on Habanero peppers. I love it. I love

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       imagine if that's true. If it's like you'd kills all the poison. Why Jalapeno? Well that's isn't that one of the things that Japanese people like to use Wasabi with Sushi because was Sabi apparently has an effect on any, any sort of bacteria that you might, yeah, I mean it's fucking blowtorch. Hardcore snort Wasabi. Good luck. I always fuck that up to you man. I always like a giant bite it to love it. I love Wasabi. I ate up a whole fucking jar of Habanero salsa last night. I had chips in this big jar of like from the moment I ate the first bite, I was like, God damn, that shit is hot. I couldn't stop. I was sweating. You never get fire shits or anything. Oh yeah, go. All right. I know I'm going to kill myself. Take it to, I'd do a fucking, I get in a horse stance. Why don't you just think of that as a member of the movie come through when the flaming pots in front of them and one sign as a dragon and the other side is a tiger and he picks up the pot with his form.

Speaker 3:          01:41:53       I don't think it's a coincidence that I have a tiger on one arm and a fucking dragon on the other and I was a fan of the Kung Fu show. Okay, well, well how about that? I'm going to get you sucker. I stole that. I stole that without even thinking about it. I'm just saying, man, I'm admitted. I stole my toe like my tattoos from Kung Fu, but I think that's what the motivation was. Oh Hey, confidence. Motivation. You hit Kong theory. There's some Kung Fu guys mad at me. He said that the guard is actually called baby monkey. It's called baby monkey. It's hilarious. It's really fun. When do you find that? Because I that Eddie Eddie, we'll send it to me. Eddie Bravo sent it to me. It's a fucking hilarious. You want to play it all right play. I'll tell you what, what part it, cause I tweeted it.

Speaker 3:          01:42:47       What part? The guy starts talking shit about me but it's, he's one of those dudes and this is, this is truth. Listen, there's a lot of people that got upset at me because I said things about Kung Fu and there's a lot of people, cause I said come food is kind of bullshit and a lot of it is just like a bunch of people practicing things. Like if I come at you like this, what would happen? I would move to the side and it would attack this way. It is, it's, it's, it's like a one step, you know, in taekwondo we still have the things called one steps. And what it is is, you know, you would throw a kick and the other guy would counter and when it was his to him imprint into your mind what to do once you start sparring and then eventually you start sparring.

Speaker 3:          01:43:23       But when you start sparring, that's when techniques really get weeded out. And that's when you understand what is the most effective use of energy and force, what techniques work the best, what techniques are really truly applicable, and what techniques are really kind of frivolous and a waste of time. There's better alternatives will come. Food never did that. They didn't have all the sparring, they didn't, he didn't know how Kung Fu didn't like go and enter into an ultimate fighting championship where it was public and everybody figured it out and it was spread out through the Internet. So there's the debate amongst all the minds of different martial artists, whether they're kickboxers are wrestlers. There is a genuine consensus when it comes to mixed martial arts. And that genuine consensus is, here's the school there, here's the group of effective techniques. This is what actually works.

Speaker 3:          01:44:05       Yes, you can. We'll kick someone in the face. Absolutely. It's difficult to pull off, but you can, we'll kick some of the face. Can you monkey fist them on the nose? You can, but that's not the best way to do it. The best way to do is the Jab and then one two jab, right? Monkey fist. Apparently there isn't a monkey first. Apparently I made it up. He apparently it's leopard fist. The guy told me liquid fish is no monkeyfy sure right days, no monkey face lab fs. But that's his style of Kung Fu. Because this dude, this dudes were also, we're angry at me. We're talking, man, I hit you in the face with a monkey paw. You're going to be upset. You know, so I'm like, you know, so there's a monkey park then it must be, it must be real. So he in his and his style of martial arts, it's real.

Speaker 3:          01:44:45       But in this one Kung Fu guy, it's a leopard Paul. And that's the only technique that works. I'm not saying that you, you shit won't work and it's definitely better than knowing nothing at all. But as far as he is the best thing to practice, no, there might be some good benefit to it, but if you want to look at the real true evolution of martial arts, what it, what is martial arts with a martial art is, is uh, an art where you figure out what is the best way to attack and disable a trained killer. That's what you want to be good at. You want to be good at beating trained killers. You don't want to be good at beating people don't know what they're doing because that's what a lot of people are doing. A lot of martial arts are, it's, it's your drug developing techniques.

Speaker 3:          01:45:24       They really will never work. If you're fighting against Anderson Silva, you're going to get them off. There is no best one. The best one is all the effective techniques of all the martial arts. It's tech take downs from wrestling and judo kicking from karate and Moy Tai Jiu Jitsu, submissions from judo and Jujitsu. You know, there's all these different things. Leg locks from Samba, all of these, and you don't have to have, there's no correct combination of what to use. Some guys only use a few of the components, but they have a very unusual physicality or they're very good at one of these aspects of the point where, especially like a stand up fighter, like a guy like Anderson Silva, that's his number one specialty stand up and he's so good at it. Every fight start standing up. So he has an advantage at the beginning of every fight. He has an advantage and if you can get to that spot, you don't have to be like the best wrestler.

Speaker 3:          01:46:09       Like Anderson's not taking people down. I mean, I'm sure he could if you wanted to, but you very rarely see him taking people down. He just blasts everybody, you know? So if you can get really good at certain aspects of it, you know, there is no exact formula what to do. But as far as techniques, there's a general consensus of techniques that work. You know the basic kicks, front kicks and round kicks. There's the crazy ones. Act Kicks, wheel kicks, there's all this stuff works, but you know what doesn't work? What doesn't work is like crane techniques. When you're standing. I mean it will work, but it's better to box. It's better to curl your knuckles up and blast them in the face. It's better to kick them, you know, and the kick them correctly the best. You got to go to a certain, I'll tell you when to go. I think it's two minutes and four seconds.

Speaker 4:          01:46:52       Joe Rogan. Yeah, well MMA countable you. Monkey non-fan, Marco Locke, nonsense martial arts. There's no monkey monkey, but I understand Joel type is saying, oh come cool. If not, then you're fucked man. The funny thing is Joe used the word monkey to lamb and marketing come home. He's really don't know. No one used the monkey technique more than the MMA. This lake where epic, this would call baby monkey showing the garden done. You will feed baby monkey whack, whack, whack a leg while my nine month waistline and up back be 5% of the time. And that is exactly what MMA, you think the baby monkeys, 65% of the time inside that cage. Now who is the monkey here? I have no problem of the work monkey. You as low as eight is a good cat like mine. Monkeys painting Ahmad monthly spending on MMA fighter are strong and tough, but don't be confused just because they do full contact then they might be real martial artist. Do you think gangster do full contact fighting and they must be all wheel martial artist? Absolutely not. Okay. Hold on. I simply, teenage street fighter.

Speaker 3:          01:48:54       I think we might be getting trolled. That feels like a troll as I'm watching this under the influence of the sacred plant might disguise obviously reading off of something. Yeah, he's reading off to the side. I'm listening to it. I'm like this guy. It doesn't sound like it makes sense. And then when he hits that Armbar God dude, he does that so slow. That's a guy who's not a grappler at all. He was on a grappler. That guy doesn't know what he's doing. One of the things was called monkey baby monkey. Big Monkey. Awesome. Well that might be a technique we very well might be, but it also might be a troll was totally like a trail. That's why he mentioned my name cause he knows I'm stupid and I bite. Yeah, I just went right after it and he wanted, he got me the fuck you and Sam trip, baby monkey. Good work man. I could get that for a licensed play. Baby Monkey, big monkey. A lap at Winco with a wound with this technique is called baby monkey. It's brilliant. Whoever

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       did that. Congratulations. You did a good job. Well done. If it is real, Sarah, please come to 10th planet, 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu in Los Angeles and I love to try out your baby monkey. See if I could pass your baby monkey. I went to kiss your baby monkeys. I Bet I can pass your baby monkey. I'm just saying right now. I mean I'm no, I'm no killer. I'm know Marcella Garcia, but I watched your role and I'm pretty sure I could pass your baby monkey. That's all I'm saying. Challenge your baby monkey on me and then I'm going to get side control. I Bet I'm going to get side control. Yeah. And this is hot. I don't give a fuck bro. I don't give a fuck dude. I'm going to want to try that wack ass baby monkey. I mean, I'll show him what's up. 10 plants, Jujitsu Bitch.

Speaker 2:          01:50:21       And you know the other thing that music, like if there in that video, Joe, here's my thing, it's funny, but if he's, if he's serious. Yeah. If he's serious, it's offensive to me because you know, if he's serious, I don't think yes, but if he is serious, it's offensive to all martial arts because that guy doesn't know what he's doing. The way he's hitting that arm bar. I'm like, Jesus Christ. Or now he's hitting an armbar though. The one thing though is he's hitting it like our Kung Fu guy because that's what the Kung Fu guys, that's what I have a problem with. The Kung Fu guys react. They do techniques, they practice techniques as if the other person isn't going to react like the grab you and pull you like this and attack the liver from this position. You know, and they have all this nonsense like, well, how do you know the guys still gonna be there?

Speaker 2:          01:50:59       I know you have a game plan, but it seems to me like you're, this is like you're getting way ahead of yourself. You're stupid dude. Can I ask you a martial arts question? Sure. This happened a very long time ago. I used to work at a summer camp and um, they would have like a martial artists come every, uh, every term till like demonstrate martial arts to the kids. And he was just some guy from like some local Dojo or something. And so he would get a kid and he, his fucking head man, he didn't like had it, he'd been shot like five times in the head. He'd been, he'd been in Vietnam, he was really intense fucking guy and shot in the head, really heat something. He took something to that, his head at it like shrapnel, my head strap. So yeah, shot and had, probably not.

Speaker 2:          01:51:40       So he, um, he bring a kid down and he do this thing where he held the kid's wrist and he'd slap him in the neck, knocked the kid out, and then like they'd get the kid to stand back up again. And it was something I've always liked from time to time. Wonder, like, what the fuck was that? Is that real? Well, how hard did he hit the kid? I just like a slap, you know? It was like, it didn't sound really hard. No. Then it's bullshit. So the kid was just like, what is that hypnosis? Why? It's a lot of, is the power of suggestion. A lot of people, a lot of people do, and this is a very uncomfortable subject. I think a lot of people have very weak brains. Just like some dudes have little dicks. You know, you ever seen a guy in a movie and like it has a little duck. You laugh. It's so small. You laugh. There's, there's people, little brains to their, they have a little Dick. That's what it is. Their brain just sucks. That sucks. Yeah. And that's why when you go to see, didn't you go with me to the, the Boston comedy connection? Didn't you see the r rated hypnotists with me now already went on stage. Now I didn't see that and see that. Damn, I wish I thought it was you. Brian was at you. Were you there when the r rated hypnotist? No, Muslim and Joey, but the book.

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       But you know when you watch an r rated hitmen to show rest in peace. Mr. Frank Santos, who was the guy that I'm discussing in a longtime friend, um, very hilarious already hypnotists, but he would go onstage and he bring people and they would sit down and with the, the smallest amount of work, I mean close rise. Concentrate on what I'm saying. I'm not a concert and my breath, I'm going to three, two, one. When I hit one, you're going to think you're with Madonna, Madonna, like his backward McDonald's hot McDonna's underneath you and she's naked and you're going to have you, we, we inside a Madonna on account of one on three, two, one. Where are you John? Oh, you see this guy who is just a normal person? It was just 1520 seconds ago. He was just sitting there with his eyes closed and now this, this guy really thinks he's fucking Madonna.

Speaker 1:          01:53:35       Like wash the guy, come in his pants. I watched a guy come in his pants. Frank Santos told him to come and his pants and he's like, oh, you're not going to be able to hold her. You gonna come. Oh, and the guy goes, ugh. The guy came in his fucking pants. He was embarrassed. He was, it wasn't an act. He wasn't an actor. He wasn't, there's no way an actor could be that good. I mean, it was this, it was the, the, the look of confusion on his face when frank cleared him up and sent him out of it and went back to his friends, have to be at scratch act or to come to make friends with him and do you came your fucking pants. Everybody was going nuts. He went back to sit with his group. He didn't believe what had happened. He was like, no, I knew what I was doing.

Speaker 1:          01:54:15       I wouldn't do it. He was the fuck you did dude. Like the, they go into this trance. I don't know how it works. It doesn't work on me. This work I do. It's like an old magic trick where like that dude was a really a paid actor. That's part of what that kind of hypnotism is. I mean, there's different kinds of hypnotism is there's hypnotism where you can sit down and someone can put you in a very relaxed state where you are, uh, cleared of all your distractions and cleared of all your connections to the world. And they talk you through this. They talk you into a mindset where you're open to suggestion and where you're open to objectivity. There's a, that's a type of, of hypnotism and it's a legitimate type of hypnotism and it does get you to a certain state, but you're conscious of what's going on the whole time.

Speaker 1:          01:55:01       He's not getting you to suck his dick. He's not telling you there's an elephant in the room. It's going to cut your head off. You know, he's not freaking you out with bullshit and nonsense and trickery. He's just kind of guiding your thought pattern. But there's also a type of hypnosis that doesn't work on everybody, but it does work on dummies and that dummy hypnosis. You, if you're a guy like Frank Santos, you can get people to think they're having sex with Madonna in a stage on a stage in front of 300 strangers. You really can do it. I've seen it. I don't understand it, but I don't understand people that are allergic to peanuts either. I don't, I don't think the human body is, it's not uniform. There's, there's some people that have a weird glitch. It's like, you know, some, some cell phones you can fucking hack into them, you know, so when somebody else's cell

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       phone, but see, here's the thing. So if Frank Santos can make a man and Boston blast in his pants from four seconds of mild hypnosis, think what the fucking CIA can do to you if they've been studying this shit for like 15 or 20 years.

Speaker 3:          01:56:01       No. Let's see. The sacrifices they've made to in the, in the, you know, the name of progress when it comes to Lsd, they dosed a whole fucking village in France, including women and children. They dose their bread. You know about that story? Nope. The freedom of Information Act, it was, it was revealed like, I don't know shit, I want to say 2009 but I don't remember when the exact date it was revealed, but the CIA did a fucking LSD experiment in a small French town and dose the entire town. Here, I'll look it up. CIA dosed French town acid. Yeah. Dude, they didn't give a fuck here at the CIA dosed entire village with LSD. Yup. Incredible story. Back in the 50s and entire French village suddenly went mad. It was not as prevalent. The previously thought due to an Erg got fungus contamination of the village bake his bread, says investigative journalists, HP Aberly, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Instead, it was part of a CIA secret mind control experiment with LSD. In other words, the CIA put a French village on acid to study them.

Speaker 5:          01:57:04       Wow. Wow. And by the way, they're responsible for the fucking unit monomer. Do you ever watch that documentary that yeah. Yeah. He was a part of the fucking LSD experiments and Harvard. Yeah. G W W what a shocker.

Speaker 3:          01:57:16       You think there's a coincidence in that the one guy gets so crazy that he decides to make enough money as a mathematics professor to fund his attack on all the technology of the world and the way he's going to do this, to send bombs through the mail at people that are creating things.

Speaker 5:          01:57:30       Well, see, that's the thing. That's why you have to begin to ask yourself which components of my belief system or if things that I've arrived to naturally from my observation of nature and which parts of them are placed in to me by a system designed to turn people into consumers. And I think that more often or not, uh, a greater percentage of your personality then you would like his is not you at all. It's a tapestry that's been cleverly woven by a system designed to make people feel totally normal, spending the majority of their lives driving in a commute and working in a shit job and being tired all the time. First of all,

Speaker 3:          01:58:12       let me just say that apparently this is a, this theory of the French town as a also questioned. Some people don't agree with it. Some people don't think it's true.

Speaker 5:          01:58:20       Well they were dosing fucking ah, they, they, they deal some soldiers, soldiers and they were dosing horrors were dropping it into their John's drinks. That was a rolling stone article, but yeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible] what the fuck was it called? How's operation? Midnight Climax. That's what it's called. The CIA ran a brothel. Oh.

Speaker 3:          01:58:37       In San Francisco. In New York. And they, uh, they dose the Johns because they find any willing participants and their LSD studies. Cause unfortunately the gay people like Pepsi bottles full of Shit and blew their fucking brains out. You know, they weren't sure the dosage. You know, when I first started fucking around with us, she wanted to know what would happen. Yeah. The shots, the whiskey Sun. God do a shot of whiskey and you actually do want a shot of acid. You know what Mckenna described molecularly? He said, LSD has the power of an aunt that could disassemble the entire statue of Liberty in 30 minutes. He was, that's molecularly, that's what it's like. That's how strong acid is the past.

Speaker 3:          01:59:17       But imagine you like getting in in a town and you don't know you're having it. So a lot of people that don't know, that's the number one theory of the Salem witch trials. The Salem witch trials has to do with the first thing that they were saying about as previously thought it was a, an Erg got fungus contamination of the village, Baker's bread. Apparently what happens is when you have a crop of, um, like wheat or whatever the fuck it is, any, any kind of grain and um, you, it freezes if they have a frost and then it, when it thaws out apparently is susceptible to certain funguses. Like it fucks up the plant and the plant gets contaminated sometimes by certain funguses and forgot when it contaminated the, you know, when they, they've, they've like done core samples of this, this point in time, you know, whenever, you know, the 1600 whenever the Salem witch trials were and they found like these late frosts that they think could have attributed to ergo infection and then they found evidence of Ergo.

Speaker 3:          02:00:11       So they're pretty sure that when all these people went mad and crazy and they started burning women, you know, it's just like they just, they just went, they were whacked out on, on their bread and they thought that someone was poisoning them. It really did think it was which class, which makes much more sense than, you know, like it was just a religious thing. It was just, which is possible. I mean, we, we've seen horrible things done in the name of religion, but when, as a whole group of them and it's all in one area and all those other pieces are in place, there's a fucking psychedelic compound that makes you lose your marbles and it's in your bread. Of course. That's what happened. I mean, it only makes sense. Why is this? Why is this one area think it's bewitched? Yeah, because they were right. There was, there was this fucking chemical bewitching. You know, they just blamed it on the wrong people. They didn't blame it on the bread. Well, how would they know? How will they know? Yeah, so these crazy ass, I'll start that. These, these women were witches. You know, they'd look at, I'm all paranoid just talking about just the one. She's doing this to me. You know, really mean. He's seeing giant mice attacking him with, you know, invisible swords. You know, you've seen all kinds of crazy shit everywhere he goes. It's really, yeah. Strange

Speaker 2:          02:01:12       to think that books have been written about how to torture witches. There's a book. Have you ever heard of the Malleus Melissa Kerem? Jesus? No. Look that up. The Hammer, what is it called? It's called, it's called them, I believe the Malleus. [inaudible]. It's called the hammer of the witches. Look. That shit appetite, Karen. Yeah, I think it's Melissa. Karen. I'm probably butchering the name, but if you put that in, you should find it. And if that hasn't worked, put in Dude fucking in and it's amazing. I knew spelled the shit out of it and it's still the found, it's the way to spell correctly folks is the Malleus, m a l l E. U. S. Is that an l? L l. L. E. U. S. Uh, and Melika carried them Mel if a carrier Kerem Melvin Kerem [inaudible] is m, a, l e, F, I, C, a, r, u, m. And just get an approximation and then Google and just finds it for you. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:02:03       of the witches. That's incredible. It's a book that was written during the inquisition. Oh my God. It's available on Amazon. God love the Internet. I'm going to order that. Watch this. Watch this while we're doing the podcast. Boom. Bitches ordered that shit son. 1996. I'm on dope was up. I just bought an awesome book after the witch trials though. It, it, they, they still were eating the same bread though. Wouldn't they still be crazy? You know, like if that was true, no, because it didn't last for very long. It's only for one season. So you know, for one season or whatever season that this happens where they get this green and this grant is infected with the Ergo. That's the season where everyone's jacked and fucked up. But Mckinnon's theory was, was I think more that it wasn't that these people are freaking out. This isn't mcallister was a mainstream, uh, like I guess it was archeologists is that call archaeology when you only go back a couple hundred years.

Speaker 2:          02:03:02       History that can be archived. I don't know. I think there's a difference between historians and archaeologists. I'd love to know, but I, there, I've read Mckenna talking about how, um, the getting rid of the witches, it was part of the, uh, transformation from the into male dominated culture and that that was the burning of the witches was a representation of this shift from what does he has a great name for it. Dominator culture or something. What does he call it? The shift from the, uh, the, uh, he was, uh, from maternal society to Terminal Matriarchal Mushroom Society Mushrooms. She's a patriarchy that where the way that you taught people is through like, like the God of that society teaches people by beating the shit out of them and punishing them forever. It's not the way that I'm a mother is supposed to be. And so the witch trials where the shift from a one form of nature based religion into a new form of, of religion where people started worshiping the invisible like free chromophobe make that possible.

Speaker 2:          02:04:06       But the other finding I think was after it was like, I think it was even after Mckenna was dead, Mckenna, I believe.in 2001 I think this was, I think they discovered this little later. So it's kind of clear evidence. I think it's just combinations because there were, it could be that too. Then back then who were practicing. It could be that would have never killed the witches if it was like a, a balanced society, they will just go, oh, you're fucking, which I'll know you're not. Oh my God. I was on acid or something, you know, they wouldn't like get together with pitchforks and fucking torches. Maybe

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       it could be they were already pissed off at checks and then when they got on the acid or the Irgun rather they'd be like, well this is a fucking, this is a perfect time to kill all these bitches. You know, it could be that this is the last straw when you know, it's a weird thing man, when you know, the whole idea of happiness and pleasure is a lot of it revolves around people wanting to be around you. And a lot of it revolves around the opposite sex wanting to be around you. And for most of us, you know, look, the reality is most of us are not that attractive. You know, there's not that many people that are really, really attracted to you. And for a lot of people, their life is a constant series of rejections and especially from women guys, they're dumpy.

Speaker 1:          02:05:18       They have no self esteem and they'd get a couple of drinks in them. And who you think maybe I'll get a flow could good. Some of the nurse he like say something awful and knowing, you know, like really it's just like a lack of confidence. Like people would say that they're a Dickhead, but really a lot of it is like a preemptive attack because you think eventually this person is going to destroy your soul because that's your experience with relationships. That's your experience with interacting with women. Every time you've attempted to interact with women, they've let you know that your pulsive Ooh, no thank you. It'll get away. And that programming just enters into this guy's definition of what a woman is, of what you know who you want. You're the person who brings the bad feelings. You're the person who brings, it's horrible, horrible.

Speaker 1:          02:06:04       Sure. So you get a few drinks and have low spots where you're pissed and you're fucking, all of a sudden you're like using tricks from the game to try to say shitty things to girls, to like dis Dell that discombobulate them in somehow, like trick them into fucking you instead of just getting them to have sex with you because they like you because you're a good person. You're fucking cool. Well, I don't think people can realize that in part of the reason why people can't realize that as because people are selfish. You know, I have a friend and I who will remain nameless, but we had a conversation where he was, uh, he was getting dumped and he was super upset about it and he didn't know how to deal with it. And he was asking me for advice and I said, do you love this girl?

Speaker 1:          02:06:42       And he said, yes. And I said, well, if you love her, you should want her to be happy. And if her being happy means her being with another man or another person, you should respect that and you should love her still. I go, this is just a human being and people break up and I don't hate everyone. I used to date, in fact with time, I love all of them. Even the ones that I didn't get along with men, when I look back on every single girl that I ever dated, I swear to God, I only will allow the positive thing. I have some negative stories that are really funny and I tell them, but in my mind when I'm thinking about that person, I only think about them when I loved them. I only think about them. What are, no matter what went wrong, you know, no matter what, you know what, what horrible thing was said, you know, that made the whole thing fall apart.

Speaker 1:          02:07:26       I re I refuse to define them by that and I instead define them by their potential, by what, what they meant to me when they're at their best. But it's really fucking hard to teach people that, man, it's really hard to over and over again realize when you fall face first into the face, first into the fucking dirt that you thinking is incorrect and that it's not empowering and you're not helping yourself or anyone else. And in fact, you're devaluing yourself into this person's eyes because you become desperate and you have no personal sovereign, Ted's right. A man that can't be with a woman without a woman, when a woman doesn't want to be with a man is a repulsive thing. You know, we've all seen it, man. It was an episode of fear factor. We had this week where this, there was this poor guy and his wife didn't want to have nothing to do with them anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:08:07       They divorced and she was fucking, you know, just live in her life. And they were still connected because they had a kid together and she would just mock him openly and publicly and she had no desire to fuck him again and she was kind of just ready to ready to make fun of them. And it hurts. It hurts washing it, man. It hurts your fucking soul. It cuts into you, you see it, and you'd go to this poor fuck. He doesn't even know. He's just trapped in this horrible pattern. And this person has become a drug dispenser, a negative Downer drug is person, gives them a depressing drug every time they see them. It's crazy. It's amazing. It's called, yeah, the bonds of Maya. That's it. That's my name for it. Or you get entangled in the illusory aspect of the universe and you don't even realize it and then you're just fucking in pain.

Speaker 1:          02:08:48       But you're the reason you're in pain. It's so sad, but it's real and it's like it's, it's a plague and, and, but it's, it's also kind of cool man. That was kinds of prisons thought prisons are the best presidents to get into because you have the key. You say it out, get out of it though. But one of the things is you can't be selfish because if you are a selfish, always want that person to be with you. You know, and this is what I was saying to my friend. I was like, dude, she does not want to be with you. You'll have to accept that. You have to accept that this is a human being. And if you love this human being, you should want this human being to be happy. And your definition of love is his only. He only loved this human being.

Speaker 1:          02:09:25       If the human being provides you with the sex drug provides you with the sex chemical, you can't just accept the fact that she wants to sex drug from someone different. Her jeans are compelled to fuck someone different than you. And whether it's become because you have personality shortcomings or physical shortcomings. It's not her responsibility. Her responsibility is to go towards what she enjoys and what she's attracted to, but we are so selfish that no one ever thinks that way, but also, man, aside from like letting someone have a happy life and not trying to manipulate or control them into being stuck with you. The other thing is it's so much better for you to be with someone who really likes you. Kia. My God, the guys who want to like change a chick, you know, you grow to love me, my God, dude, some savage is going to come along and fuck her in a laundromat.

Speaker 1:          02:10:15       Okay, that's going to happen. You can't. You can't. Everyone needs to be extremely attracted to each other. Everyone needs to be extremely well. There's just in track attracted to each other's minds, which is personality, whether it's physical, whatever it is, they're there. There has to be a real, because if there's not, if you don't have one of two things is happening, either you're not putting that out enough. You're not a dynamic enough human. Both with your consciousness or with your objectivity or with your love or with your affection or with your, your, your generosity. You're not putting out enough working. And if you're not putting down out enough people don't want to give it back to you. So this, this beautiful, attractive, healthy, vibrant, generous, loving person won't be attracted to you because you don't want to enhance them. You want to draw and take away from them.

Speaker 1:          02:11:01       And so you rely on wounded animals and it's just one more wounded animal after another wounded animal. And that's all you ever get because that's all you're attracting. You're attracting wounded animals. Cause those are the only ones that are stupid enough to fucking fall into your web. That's true, man. And also a lot of those systems that pickup systems are designed to trap wounded animals. She's like, exactly. Yeah. So it's like really just praying the vulnerable and it's only because the, the, the value of sexuality, it's such a, it's a value. It's very important. Like you need it. Like it will make you feel better, you know, it will, it's your medicine. You got to go, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:11:37       Yeah, but you know there, there's get it on like Marvin Gaye Song. I'm your medicine. Open up and let me in. It is a fucking drug man dough and you're so great. I can't wait for you to operate. Boom, boom. Get up. Let's make love tonight. Wake up cause you do it right. The guy was a bad mother fucker. Dude, he's such a bad motherfucker. His Dad shot him.

Speaker 1:          02:12:00       His Dad couldn't deal with the sun. Just massively eclipsing him in every possible way as a human, as Dow. Just a regular guy who is Marvin Gaye, Marvin Gaye's, a motherfucking Dick, sling and superstar with a voice that came from angels. Okay, and who are you? Oh, you're the guy who fucked his mom. Get in line, bitch, you're just a normal dude. You Ain't nothing special compared to Marvin motherfucking Gaye. You're a regular guy and you may have son that's a mother fucker. You made a psalm that his songs, they play them without them words in elevators and people sing along to the music. His fucking songs are so good that when you're in an elevator and a Muzak version of let's get it on, comes on, you can hear him saying,

Speaker 2:          02:12:45       let's get it all. You can hear it. You can hear it. He's a bad motherfucker, dude. He and printed the consciousness and this guy couldn't deal with it. So he shot his own son, didn't want to play the game. So he picked up the board and he threw it away. Yeah. Goodwin couldn't win a game, unplugged it and plugged the fucking x bucks, shooting your own kid. God, I don't care what he did. You, you fuck someone fucked up. It has to be you to, unless your kid is a murderer and unless your kids coming at you with a fucking sword and trying to, he's, you know he's on PCP. Yeah. Okay, I get it. You got to do what you gotta do. He and he shouldn't. You know, he's a threat to the playground. Kid makes you, you're automatically a fucking idiot, right? Oh my God. Yeah. Something happened, which is why it's fucking weird. The story of Jesus. It's like you're going to send your fucking kid down to a planet is savage

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       fucking you don't understand. He died for our sins. Oh, that, oh no.

Speaker 3:          02:13:38       Somehow or another we could still sin, but we get forgiven if we tell him, if we embrace him, you get forgiven. You're allowed to still sin. You could totally fuck up, but at the end you have to like really realize and, and really embrace Jesus as your God show. What are you saying to do that? Once you do it, it's not a crazy leg escape clause. It's like, you know, some corporations don't have to pay any taxes at all and they can just fuck everybody over and make trillions and trillions of dollars. Anyone? What kind of loophole was that? That's ridiculous. Well, they just have to pay the right politicians and this loophole, the death loophole is you can just fucking rape and pillage your whole life. But if you find Christianity at the end, like general butt naked from Liberia, you know that story? There's Shane Smith. Yeah, us on the podcast guys directly responsible for the death of thousands of people, thousands of people.

Speaker 3:          02:14:21       And he killed babies and ate their hearts. Yeah. Eight they're still beating hearts. Okay. And he's a Christian and because he's a Christian, they didn't even prosecuted. Praise God. How amazing these guys, God, God, so beautiful. God is going to put him in heaven, but not like a regular person who's born in the jungle of Brazil and is good his whole life and only does good for his tribe and his family and you know, and has great respect for the earth. That guys go straight to hell on earth. That confer a Spec for the earth. I don't want expect the origination Douche bag. It's going right to the fucking oven,

Speaker 5:          02:14:53       dude. Dude, do you know about dispensations? Do you know what dispenser? I believe they're called dispensations. Do you know about this? I may be saying that word wrong, but it used to be able to buy from the Catholic church for whom the ships used to be able to do that. Yeah, you could buy, say like, you could save your salary, you could buy like no matter what, you're going to have it. Like I gave you this much money. Yeah. So I'm set like, here's like, you know, whatever, to 200,000 bucks, I'm cool. Right? No matter what I do for the rest of my life, I'm still going to have, and like, yeah, you're fine. You, you gave enough money. Now you're fine. That's hilarious. It's amazing. That's the cat. That's brilliant. Like the Catholic Church. You know how funny that is to like come up with a trick like that when you start realizing like, wait a minute, I can just write down on paper.

Speaker 5:          02:15:33       The people are going on an imaginary place forever and they'll give me thousands and thousands of dollars in gold and diamonds. That's incredible. It's incredible. Like talking seriously about like the tooth fairy, like if we were having a conversation about the tooth fairy people were willing to die for the tooth fairy. Yeah. They're willing to kill you for degrading that tooth. Fairies are real and it ruined their lives. They're, they're willing to, they're willing to, um, not use birth control. They're willing to not wear condoms and fucking bring kids into the world that they didn't even want to have for that tooth fairy. They're willing to do a lot of crazy shit for that tooth fairy. And then there's a wide spectrum of crazy and it varies from town to town. Church called the church call it. And I think that there's like a re, you know, there's something that's an actual, you know, I think there, there really is a, I don't know what you call it, but I do think there's like a super consciousness. You can tune into that. We'll give you some direction and the directions usually don't be an asshole. Well, why? I was saying that

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       the morality of the universe would tell you that you're not allowed to spray pepper spray in the face of kneeling children. The morality of the university say these are peaceful people. You have no right to do anything to harm them. They have a legitimate gripe and concern. Whether they're handling, they have the correct way is debatable, but you, you know the, the morality of the universe, the true knowledge of what is right and wrong. It's like instinctively, instantly you realize that's an evil task. And if that was your little girl, that's your 18 year old girl. Idealistic first day and you know, first year in college and this asshole is spraying her in the face with pepper spray, you'd want to beat his brain flat. You'd want to beat him to death. If that was, if I saw that guy spray my baby in the face, I would not be able to help myself.

Speaker 1:          02:17:15       It wouldn't, if there was cars in the way, if there was a cops in the way, I would have tried physically to get my hands on it. I would have to really stop myself. It would be like, uh, like a murderous animal like rampage. You would, you would, you would feel it from the bottom of your DNA that you would have to stop this person from doing that. We want this guy's doing it because somebody wrote some shit down on a piece of paper that's a detachment man. That's a detachment from the f the things that you do and the impact those things have. And you could say followed by the word of the law and you could say, well, those full can hoop is weren't them. We would never have a problem. And while all these things are correct, that's not the real issue.

Speaker 1:          02:17:54       The real issue is there's a detachment from the things we do and the effect those things have and that attachment, that detachment is due to a lack of sensitivity, which I think can be attributed to several things and a lot of it is contributed to awareness and our focus on awareness, whether it's through yoga, whether it's through meditation, whether it's to isolation tanks, whether it's through psychedelics, what is through long walks, where you sit by yourself in the alone in the park and you do an audit of your day and an audit of your true honest thoughts and try to be a fucking real with yourself man. And don't bullshit yourself so you can sleep better at night and think that you're doing the right thing every time. And all you would have to do is imply though, apply those ideas to life and everyone would be fine.

Speaker 1:          02:18:37       Everyone would be fun, could no one would ever start unjust wars. They would realize you can profit anyway. There's always going to be assholes out there. You can profit on fucking tanks and you can profit on jets. We need those. Yeah, we do need those. But we don't need that many and we don't need them everywhere. We don't need a a military presence in over a hundred different fucking countries. We've gotten completely out of hand those people making jets and making bombs, making guns. I'm a, I'm a hundred percent pro gun. I have guns and I think that you should be allowed to have gone pro hunting. And I'm, I'm pro trapping. Um, I'm, I'm pro all that Shit, man. I, I believe in the Second Amendment fully, strongly support. You're right. But I think, I just think we're at a stage right now where people are starting to realize that the stuff that's written down on paper is not necessarily serving the human beings that it's supposed to represent.

Speaker 1:          02:19:26       And we just, because it's written down on paper and because of bunch of people say it's written down on paper, we are supposed to abide by it. We're supposed to deal with it. We're supposed to allow that cop to spray the chemical and the kid's face and not get beaten up and immediately thrown in jail. Like he should be. Like your instincts would be if any civilian did it. And that's our real issue. Our real issue is we're, we're, we are operating under an archaic society using the wrong map. Yes. We're using an old shitty map that worked at different kinds of terrain. The terrain has changed now we need, we need to new maps. People have got to come up with new maps. You don't just get the fucking luxury of using an ancient, whether it all map, whatever the fuck the map is, whether the map is your Bible or whether the map is, um, the current version of the constitution with all the amendments or whether the map, whatever it is, it's time to start making new maps based on the fact that we're now all connected.

Speaker 1:          02:20:16       When you see things like this new bill that's passed, it turns American into a battleground and empowers the military to come in and, and, and, and arrest civilians who are being disorderly and arrest anyone who is a threat and detain them. Anyone who they deem a thread. That is the, all the evidence that you need to know that it's over. That is the monsters clawing at the fucking, at the head. The, the, the, the gravestone is it pulls them underground as the earth sucks them into its core. The monsters are clawing as they're dragged down. They are trying as hard as possible to gain ground. And one way they're going to do it is completely violate the bill of rights. Where they're going to do it is to make the constitution and valid. And that's what they're doing. And they're doing it under the guise of patriotism and protection.

Speaker 1:          02:21:01       And you're like protection from what you fucks. But see, that's why. That's why they're there. What, what has to happen is people need to start, um, continuing to take like the action they're taking with occupy Wall Street. But we need a fucking super genius or a group of super geniuses are a collective of people to come up with a new map for how this shit should be working. You know what? I'm starting to think, well, this is what I'm starting to think is going to happen. I used to think that there's going to be some sort of violent upheaval. There's going to be real problems. I think that there's going to be people on the occupied side that are far too intelligent to be ignored and that eventually they're going to figure out some vulnerabilities to the system and then they're going to have some power, and once they have some power, then people are going to talk and then they're going to have to work something out and change some laws and changed some rules because until there's some sort of a threat from the other side, you know, it doesn't have to be a violent threat.

Speaker 1:          02:21:54       It could simply be some fucking computer geniuses who know how to rework everything, not a shutting down the fucking Internet who knew how to make things and valid in, in an own functional. It could be people who know how to manipulate, you know, money through through the Internet. Who the fuck knows, I mean it's going to be deemed a terrorist act, whatever it is, you know, anything. I mean that's really what by by the, by the Patriot Act, you know, anything you're doing to attack the government now is like a terrorist act. Yeah, right. I bet me even suggesting that someone may try to do this makes you under suspicion. You extrapolating and looking

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       at history and you look into human behavior and you're looking at this situation and knowing that it's going to escalate. What, what could happen. I think someone's gonna figure out a way to have some power, the occupiers, but saying that by saying that it's almost like I'm cheerleading, I could become an enemy by saying that. Which is amazing. You've, I'd say you're a little, this was Orwell Orwellian. It really is. I mean it's, it's amazing that life is now more fucked up than fix fucking people come at, you know like the people who like are looking under their car because they are tight. They got a flat tire and like, Hey, what's that fucking box there? And they pull the box out from under their car and it's still kind of magnetic bug. Some people stuck on their car in the middle of the night tracking, then they come and collect it.

Speaker 2:          02:23:06       You know, like that guy who popped it at school. And how about this carrier Iq? Should Brian, you just send me an update on this carrier Iq. What was the update again? When they say that the FBI will not release any records on this carrier? Iq Shit. Yeah, they won't comment on it. I mean like the, the, the, the guys that from the company or there, you know, talking saying that they've never given it their information to the FBI, but the FBI will not comment whatsoever. And the refuse a freedom of information act requests. Yeah. Right. Because it's an ongoing investigation. That's what they're saying. Don't have to have fucking power. There's so much power, so much power. And you know, the best way to abuse power is to say that we're doing it for your own good. We're doing it for your own good. You trust us.

Speaker 2:          02:23:46       Listen, we need this power in order to, to get the bad people. We know you're a good person. Trust us. We just need this little provision. What's a terrorist? Exactly. Oh, some guy who sells 20 joints. Newt Gingrich is a 200 joints. Oh 200 doses. He's a terrorist and he should be put to death. Someone who grows plants or the fuck's that want to run our world. Man. Really? That's what we need. That Ron Paul Guy, even though he doesn't believe in evolution, I've heard some, the problem with, I mean I don't, I talked about this in the lavender hour about Ron Paul and we got some people riding in there like shit that I didn't investigate fully. I, like I said, I like what didn't you invest it as issues? Something about a Hollywood, get rid of the highway systems or something. Like he doesn't want to support like, um, he wants to go back to buggies.

Speaker 2:          02:24:29       No, it's not bad. In fact of Huggies horse running. He wants to go back to know it's some kind of thing. There was a few things that were um, a little, uh, the, I didn't know that because I really love the guy and doesn't need to be more specific. I meant to go and invest. And it's something that you don't remember. No, I remember they said Ron Paul, we get somehow get rid of the interstate system. Ron Paul interstate system. I couldn't find it. You couldn't? I don't, I don't think so. Just, and then also the evolution thing came from the commerce clause. Is that it? I don't, I don't know. That's something different I think, but I love him right now. I still like him, so I don't know. I'm sure there's some weird shit about him. I guess if he doesn't believe in evolution, that is fucked up, man. That's maybe you've had a religious experience. Maybe ate some bad bread one day. Trip the fuck out. It's got an insight to people who believe the earth is 5,000 years old or that some of the funniest fucking people ask. There's a,

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       there's a big move for Ron Paul right now. Man. He's moving with this occupy Wall Street thing. Ron Paul is fucking exploding. Ron Paul is neck and neck with Newt Gingrich right now in the Iowa poll. That is unprecedented people, people, they're not expecting this. Did you hear all these other guys are falling apart? That's the crazy thing about these dummy republicans. All of them slowly but surely are showing that they're morons. First it was Herman. Cain is fucked. Everyone. And then it's Rick Perry who can't remember anything and then it's, you know, it's fucking Mitt Romney. He's got way too much money. Rick Perry, Shit, fucking Internet video about celebrate craisins but, but you know, we know the gays want to get buried. Yeah, we can put gays in the military. K's in the military. We celebrate Christmas. Meanwhile, he's wearing the same jacket from Brokeback mountain. He's wearing the same jacket that heath ledger war in Brokeback mountain.

Speaker 1:          02:26:15       You almost wonder if his stylist has a sense of humor, you know? I mean, how brilliant would that be if they're like, well, we got to make you look like a good old boy. I mean, you're just like George Bush again. You're reincarnate. Lot of people love George Bush. He was a good man. It's good president. We want to get you dressing like a rancher. Which a ranch. Okay, we'll, we'll dress him like a rancher. Rancher. Rancher. Gas Line. Well, you know, we know ranchers like, Oh, you know American strong. Okay. Yeah. Like Heath Ledger. Yeah. Give him the fucking same jacket, but come on man. What are the odds? Who the fuck has a tan jacket with a brown, a dark brown color? Get the fuck Outta here. He's winking at you and somebody who's waking someone. Someone behind the scenes. That's a one on 99% are and then don't like it.

Speaker 1:          02:27:01       Don't like it. It's a whistle blower. Yeah, man, there's that. There's definitely like little clues out there. He's Desperado and what it is now, it's like one of those shows where it's about to get canceled. So they bring in a black character. We need a nutty neighbor and he's a rapper, you know, or you know, whatever. They're just panicking right now. This is a death spiral, but they're all like, all of them seem like they should be on Jerry Springer. They don't seem like they should be running for president. I seem like just freaks and, well Newt Gingrich's clown, guilty of ethics violations and you know he was accused of over 40 different ethics violations and serves divorce papers to his wife dying of cancer.
