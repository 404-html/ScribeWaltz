Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, a lot of people believe it's a controlled demolition. I don't think necessarily she is saying that it is or it isn't and I certainly am not. I don't know. I don't understand that. You know what I believe more. It was a controlled demolition. Yes. But with it by us. Yes. You know? Yeah. I mean I think that's always been the case of the. The argument, they don't think it was done by the terrorists. They think see building the tear. What? No. What if the terrorists. Oh, they did a controlled demolition. Yeah. It wasn't like if somehow they had. Because terrace probably could easily. I think that would probably be before hijacking planes and flying them into buildings before that would be putting a bomb into building. Yes, but it's not that easy. See, like when will you see what happened in Oklahoma City that was multiple bombs?

Speaker 1:          00:47          You know, in Oklahoma City they actually, there was all these reports of the FBI removing bombs from the building like that didn't explode. And if you talk to these guys that are demolition experts, they say there's no way. That was a fertilizer bomb. There's no fucking way. They said that. If you look at the amount of damage that did and look at where the blast radius is from the way it blows out, it doesn't blow. They're not designed to. You're saying this building because we've all seen the loose change where you watch the lights go off around the building one floor by one. It's like, yeah, but see they don't see. They don't know what that means though. That also could be. If the ceiling is coming in and slamming into the floor, all the windows would do that. They don't know that that's explosions. If it really was collapsing like that.

Speaker 1:          01:35          See no one's ever seen a building collapsed like that. So when they say that those are blips and those are squibs, I don't like that because then you're. You're saying you know for sure what that is and I'm saying the fuck you do. I don't know. Even though there's just because someone has to know. I'm not saying it was as. I'm not saying it was an inside job. It just seems odd ergonomically that you would design a building that if impacted at a certain point the entire thing would demolish. Like what structurally? What purpose does that serve? Well, the. Yeah, the weird. Well, it could just be in competence. That's possible. If you look at humans, that's our most likely option, right? I mean when did they make the world trade center so fucking long ass time ago to get so cocky to build a building that's 100 God damn stories high.

Speaker 1:          02:16          And how long did they think that was gonna stay up there for you know, what if it started falling apart in a rotting, what it was, it was just so just a wonky piece of shit by the time I got hit by those planes. That's totally true. I mean fucking thing was oldest shit. That thing was around as black and white television. Jessica Lange, King Kong. I mean. Yeah, but what's retrofitting the cheapest goddamn floor and the cheapest guy. A bitter, you know that to do that. How many floors was treated with bombs maybe? Well, that's the crazy idea. What we're, what we're saying about a building seven or or the other building that terrorists could have done it. I mean I guess they could have, but how the fuck are they going to get in there and put all those explosives in? It's like dynamite up a time. Those red sticks of dynamite. One tying up your ass. You're working the fucking thing. Five years everyday. Fucking putting it into this closet. So funny. Back then they didn't have security department sticks. You're walking down the hallway and you just smell shit. Open this door. What's in this smells like shit and it says shitty dynamite sticks.

Speaker 1:          03:20          It's like a fucking log house built with shit dynamite sticks and little hairs. A Cat pee mattress.
