Speaker 1:          00:00:00       You're saying how, how promotions work? Yeah. Here we go. Four, three, two, one. So Tom pop and I are sitting here. USA. Do you, did you see the fight on Saturday night? And he said, the guy that got knocked down, mental health, mental health guy, the guy got up for everyone with mental health. But you said no, I didn't see the fight. Like I only saw. I only saw that. How narratives work. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like in this day and age especially, there's way too much information out there, right? Like there's no way you could see every television show or watch every sporting event or, or no, every scandal. So when something happens, like the blurb, the, the little summary that I have absorbed, my, my one buddy watched it on instagram, he posted a thing and it was very heartfelt that he got up for all the people with mental health.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       And uh, I read that and I feel like I experienced the whole thing. But, you know, it's funny, I don't know if he won or lost. I know he got to draw, draw, draw. Okay. And uh, I don't have a firm opinion on whether or not the draw was justified because I only watched it once. I thought I thought that Tyson fewer one most of the rounds except the two that he got knocked down in tysons. The anti mental health guy. No, he's the white guy who, he's the white guy that got knocked down and Deontay wilder. He's. Is he strange in that? He has like the most freaky punching power I think I've ever seen ever. That's what I heard too. Big Guy. I mean for a heavyweight. He's 212 pounds. He looks pretty big though. He's Jack. He shredded. He has no fat on them whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       Back is where all the power is. And that's where I was. His muscle is like, you see his back. It's just fucking, just a bundle of snakes. But I saw the clip. He knocked him out and then backed up and dance. Iceland got up. Yeah. That guy. Fuck that guy. Wilder punches so hard. And that was in the twelfth and final round. That was a fight where he was mostly losing. He was mostly getting boxed up. It was mostly getting out boxed, but then he would land and he landed real hard and like, what was it, like the eighth or the ninth, something like that, something like that. He dropped him, but that wasn't a big knockdown. He knocked him down, but he got up pretty quick and he was. He was okay, but in the twelfth he fucking blasted him. He hit him with a right hand and then as he was falling, he hit him with a left hook on the chin as he was going down, like any laid flat on his back with his arms down.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       He looked unconscious. Yeah, he really did. And then he rose like Lazarus and he looked pretty sharp when he got on his feet, one of the rest of the round, he wanted to rest around the stung him. He stunned. Deontay wilder. It was crazy because of the mental health kids. Yes. He was doing it for the mental health people. You think that's really what he was thinking when you're getting up off the canvas? I'm doing it for the kid. I would never doubt him. Yeah, he. He really does. He's, he's in a very unusual guy and he donated his entire purse to charity. It like $8 dollars. Really? Yeah. Yeah. He donated all of it to charity. Holy Cow. That's great. These are fucking really unusual guy. He was. He's been in here. He was in the podcast when he was gearing up for the fight, so I should call them the super nice mental health guy. He's a very nice guy. Very nice guy. Big giant six, nine,

Speaker 2:          00:03:17       sixth. So he was sitting here. You feel like he's shoes? A giant,

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       super sweetheart. Friendly Guy. Geez. You're really well spoken. He's got that heavy travelers accent. He's a traveler. Had He made money before? Oh yeah. He's a world champion, so he's like, he was a world champion bank and almost killed himself in a Ferrari, almost committed suicide and he was headed towards a bridge. He was going gonna fucking either slamming into the bridge or drive off the bridge. That was his. Yeah, he was going 60 miles an hour, like headed towards the bridge and you change his mind. That's what he looked like before he started his comeback. Yeah, he was 300 pounds, 300 plus, right. How much they say it was safe for 85, but yeah, something crazy because he's saying 300 kilograms. So that's like, what is it? Close to 400 pounds. Oh my God. He's. So he was champion and he fell off and became that Chubby.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       Well, what happened was he beat Vladimir Klitschko who was a long time heavyweight champion. I mean flooded Makoto was there, remember champ forever. And he out boxed him like soundly outboxed him and beat him and then was like now what? And went into a depression and start drinking hard, partying, hard. A lot of cocaine and just fucked his life up just as he achieved what he wanted to achieve. I mean he's calling it mental health, you know, because of depression and all those things. But part of me wants to say that a lot of that is. I mean, I don't know, obviously I've never been inside of his head, but when you're doing that much coke and drinking that much, that is got to be a major factor in why you feel like shit. And then the let down of this incredible achievement becoming the heavyweight champion of the world, beating this guy who hadn't been beat in a long time, many, many, many years, and then you know, just partying too hard and then getting into a horrible funk and deciding to come back.

Speaker 2:          00:05:14       So is that part of it where you know, you know, that you have that. There are those personalities and there's genetics involved and he gets you into the drugs, but then the drugs start going to work on your brain and then it becomes something different. It becomes no longer your own consciousness that's working. It's this sponge that just absorbs all of these toxins and who knows what's misfiring, what's happening at that point. We say that as we drink wine. Cheers. Happy holidays. Thank you for heroin in the holidays. Whatever little fucking meth. I was going to bring you some wine today. This was nice you to open this. This is good stuff. Whatever this is. I don't know Jack Shit about one. I learned a great method for Thanksgiving wine. What's the. I went to this place in la. It's called a 2020 wine. It's like this.

Speaker 2:          00:06:04       It looks like right here. This is the last dark. It's on the, on the four. Oh five. And you just walk in and just wine. This huge room racks and stuff. It's so elegant. It's just like this great place to be. It's cool. It's like temperature wise, it's like it's great and it's intimidating because they have, you know, I don't know that much about wine I want to, but. And I realized this was my strategy and it worked out perfectly. I went to the guy who works there and I said, look, I have 12 people coming over for thanksgiving. Show me a $20 bottle of wine or less that I can buy a bunch of for my friends that's going to blow everyone away. And he lit up like a Christmas tree. It's like, this is what he wants to do. It's like, yeah, there's 200 bottles, dollar bottles of wine. We know what that is. I'm going to come with me and there it is. And he took me into the back and he found these. He's like, this one's from Spain, $18. No one knows it exists. The best wine I've had all year, another one and this Italian Barolo that nobody knows about it, and look at this, it's only $12 a bottle because nobody knows we have an extra cases. It became like his. Of course, that's what a wine guy wants to do. Turn you on.

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       Is the wine thing that a name is just as important as how good it is? Sure, yeah. Like when people, you know, an opus one or a famous or like, we all know that because that's like the Mercedes of wines. Cigars are like that as well. I know more about to go. I don't know much about cigars, but I know more about cigars that I know about wine and like everybody wants a Cuban cute Cohiba oh, wants something that's

Speaker 2:          00:07:46       hard to get. Yeah. But this was. I was like, Oh, this is how you should do it. Find a good wine shop and go to the guy who's waiting to be asked that question and he so excited to show you what he learned and he works in a wine shop. So he's not spending $500 for a bottle either.

Speaker 1:          00:08:01       Me and my shit. My Buddy Mark Telegraph and I were in Florida. We're eating this very nice time restaurant with a bunch of people from the UFC. We just said, let's get a nice bottle of wine. You're have a nice bottle of wine. I'm like, I've had good bottles of wine, but this place had like bought bottles wine from the seventies. Right. So I said, all right, let's go fucking crazy. I bought a bottle of wine from 1974. Oh my God, this is better. This is better. This one's better. It was like, it was weird. I guess if you're a real connoisseur, like part of it is like Roberto Duran was the champ when this will bottled stuff and stuff about. It was in the third grade, something Mrs Mcmillan. It was like, it felt like it had less alcohol. And I think that's, uh, one of the things that maybe happens, the flavor sorts starts to morph and change. It just felt less

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       potent, almost more watered down. It wasn't that good. I enjoyed it, but I didn't love it. Right. And that, you know, and you probably paid a lot for. It was like a thousand dollars. I'm not joking. Yeah, I think it was a thousand dollar bottle of wine. I'm telling you, this Thanksgiving we had it. It was $18 bottles of wine. It's probably way bigger. Heads off. Yeah, probably way better. So great. They're there, you know, I try and learn about them and there are certain wines they say like there's certain Brunellos that like those should age and those you can go like 20 years and you know, they'll get even better at 30 and then there's other wines at that same amount of time. They'll go sour and they'll get funky. So it's so hard to tell. Yeah. APP that I have, I've never fucking opened at. Once I had downloaded it. It's like Vino Vino, we almost went down with that write on the board. Oh, it's got a power ballad. Nice. Because that was headed towards the board team. Same. He's not even drinking. I don't fuck with laptops in front of me anymore. I've learned my lesson. I was doing a show on Saturday. My friend had a laptop, she had a glass of water and a salad on the keyboard. I'm like, what are you having a gun in your baby's head?

Speaker 3:          00:10:10       Rest your head on the gun separated now, but this was, this was such a great way to do it. I mean there's so you can focus in on one kind of wine and really kind of learn it and that's a lot like that would be a lot of studying to learn all of wine and like go into a fancy restaurant and be like, I'm just going to pick from you. Can, you know? It's one of those things where you have to. You really have to talk to someone who's putting the time. Yes, totally. That's, yeah, my keys. Here's something that I know a lot about pool cues,

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       right? I know a lot about pool, so if you come to me and you say, Hey, I'm thinking about buying this pool cue, what do you think of? Okay, well here's what you need to know. Like that's a. that's a very expensive pool cue and it's expensive because it's a collector's item because the guy who makes it as dead. However, in terms of like how it plays, it does not play any better than a pool cue that crossed one small fraction of what that costs and then I could turn you onto a bunch of custom pool cue makers that make a really good cue for a fraction of what you would pay for that cue and I'm telling you like you would play with this queue and be happy with it for the rest of your life, but it will cost you $500 as opposed to there's cues that are $15,000, $20,000 and up. It's a really ornate and beautiful

Speaker 3:          00:11:27       and this is a lifetime. Your adult lifetime of learning about this. Oh Man, I've been immersed.

Speaker 1:          00:11:31       I started playing pool in 1990, 91. 90, 91. That's when I probably bought my first pool cue.

Speaker 3:          00:11:39       What's a good. What's a good pool cue for bumper pool? My neighbors, my neighbors had a bumper pool table when I was a kid. It was bad ass. It's pretty stupid. So stupid and dumb game. The

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       older brother Mark, he was the dominant one because he was able to jump over the bumpers and get on the other side. Cheating. Cheating. Yeah. The jumping is a very controversial thing in the world of pool. You're not allowed to jump. Well, you can butt attack jumping and then there's bar table jumping. Right? Like when you play with people on a bar, they think they're jumping in the pool cue, but what they're doing is they're scooping under the cue ball with their tip, like they go under it and it sort of makes the cue ball pop up in the air. It's really like. Yeah, Ms Dot cueings. What? It's like the way you're supposed to jump a ball has shoot down on it and make it hop over. Let's imagine, have you seen this before? Yeah, that's an expense. That's a Mcdermott. Um, it's called the excalibur or some shit like that.

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       That's a pool cue. Shit is, but it isn't. It's foolish. It looks like a sickle that the grim reaper comes to do away with. Well, this was a cute that was made a long time ago. It was made back in the fucking nineties or something, but that's not the most expensive pool cue in the world. Does that whole thing? The q says it sold for $150. That's not the most expensive shoe in the world. No, no. The most expensive cue in the world is Gina. Gina Q is actually right here in north Hollywood. That's, they call it the most expensive in the world. It's that whole thing. The Queue. That's nonsense. That's not to stand in a queue seat. It's a acute, that whole, all the blades and everything like that. What would you do with nonsense? It's nonsense. I'm telling you. It's nonsense. It's nonsense. It's like having a car and you decided to glue diamonds on it. It's fucking stupid with calling the wall.

Speaker 4:          00:13:26       Fuck up. That cue weighs nine and a half pounds. You know what a real cute ways. A very heavy q, very heavy is 21 ounces. Like if you play with it, like you find out that a pro plays with 20 miles could be like, wow, that's rarely a guy will play with it. Twenty four rounds Cuban. You're like, wow, that guy's crazy. What was that thing? Thing is nine and a half pounds a piece of shit. It's like the. The women that get the gigantic hippity hops for boobs getting bigger than that. When you're like triples the boobs. That's just not a real pool. Cute. What's the one in North Hollywood? Well, he makes. His name is Ernie Cortez and he makes all sorts. I have one of his cues that's earning right there. Makes. I mean he wasn't married to share. No, that's Sonny Bono. You're an asshole.

Speaker 4:          00:14:19       I got in this podcast now I'm. Ernie is A. I mean he's like a real innovator in the world of pool cues. He makes beautiful, beautiful. That is beautiful. But he had one that he made that was filled with. Like I thought, I don't want to say what the material was by believing the handle. The handle was made out of solid ivory and I'm thinking it had a gold and all sorts of other shit in it, but it went for half a million dollars. It's worth a half million dollars, but I think the deal is that he won't sell it. He's very wealth. Whereas really well that offer. Making sure. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       Yeah. His, his pool cues like in Japan and also all throughout Asia. They're, they're really revered, like he sell his stuff anywhere. His accuser very expensive on the aftermarket too. It makes them all by hand. Like that kind of thing. Well, he designs them all and then he uses a computer controlled machines. They're called CNC machines to put everything together and piece it so that everything's perfect. Wow. Yeah. But they're all like his designs and that like three d printing. No, no. It's, um, it's what it is, is like you have a design and you put it into this computer and you put the spa, I don't know, on 100 percent of the process, but you put your specifications like how wide you want in lays to be and they make them exactly the same size and the points fit exactly the same way. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       Yeah. It's all super complicated stuff. But the point is like if you were a guy who wanted to buy a pool cue and you just, you know, went to a website, right? You're, you're lost. You're lost. Like me trying to buy one shot. Yeah. The fuck I'm looking at. Right, exactly. Yeah. It's weird. Yeah. This is good. Wine though is good. This is a scissors to big news. I didn't know you spoke French to do we, we see fit. Paris is going crazy right now given having these crazy riots know what's up. Every time I think about visiting Paris, there's some new shit that goes down over there. I know. It's kind of feels like a little like a, like a jewel box is about to explode. All good man. It's not good. Is it workers? What kind of riot? Well, the weird thing is everyone is riding is wearing those reflective vests, like see that?

Speaker 1:          00:16:37       Yeah. They're wearing these yellow reflective vests and lightened things on fire and smashing store. So like who is Gucci? And these protestors have been going to scroll back up. So we got silent, says 17 pictures. Oh, it's terrible. And it keeps getting worse. It keeps getting worse. I mean it started November 17th when French driver supporting yellow vests led a demonstration apparently has to do with oil prices rising. Rising fuel prices 280,000 people. Four people have died, hundreds have been injured, thousands of dollars with the property has been damaged. The protest started November 17th. French driver sporting yellow vest led a demonstration of 20,000 people across the country to push back against the rising taxes on gas and diesel. A French President Emmanuel, I love a nice microphone as part of his many economic reforms and announced the gas taxes early this year to minimize Francis reliance on fossil fuels. That's a fucking shitty way she handle, you know, reliance on fossil fuels. You do the opposite. You cunt face, you don't charge people money. You know, you don't charge people extra money and make it more expensive than they'll use it unless you give them subsidies for electric cars. You stupid prick. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       Once you understand the American way, you piece of shit. I love talking about things. I know nothing about. What does it say? Scroll back to where it was a the price of fuel. That's it. Thirty cents a gallon. They went crazy. Thirty cents a gallon trying to kill people. Gas already costs about $7 per gallon. What? Fuck that. So it's just going to break people's backs and they drive you to. The Bush was leaving office and they jacked the fucking price of gas. Way Up Dude. But there's people that were panicking. Yeah. September 11th. There's like lines everywhere because we thought, Ryan, I just empty the price. Didn't I don't think the price rattling you went up. Some places were charge like 25 bucks a gallon they should go to jail. But that's, that's kind of insane that people used to have riots like that when, when we would spike and people couldn't eat this, they like, oh my God, that's a shitty little car.

Speaker 4:          00:18:51       Anyway, I probably wanted to lie that empire finally. He's not even part of the protests. He's just talking to me about this. Somebody was telling me about this. I was at a little kids. Pardon me. I was talking to one of the dads and he was telling me about this, uh, thing that happened, this, I think it was in northern California. It was a fire, fucking might not have been. Northern California was a fire. And um, initially they thought it was just a fire, but then the CEO and his vice president, we're both of their houses caught fire. So then they thought it was like an attack on both people and then they realized no, it was a murder and one of the guys killed the guy and his family and then lit his house on fire and then went back to his house and lit his own house on fire to make it look like they were going after.

Speaker 4:          00:19:46       Both of them and he's the only one that survived. Yeah. Whoops. This happened in New Jersey, a guy in New Jersey. Maybe that was. It got murdered. His whole family. His own family. Yeah. And then lit the house on fire. Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm getting fucked up version of the story. I get drunk. A kid parties to. Oh, it's the only way to go by family massacred disguises a massive fire in New Jersey. Yeah, that's it. This is the story. So make that a little larger police. It says, uh, there was more of a brotherly bond between Paul and Keith. Yeah, that's right. Part of New Jersey on vacation together and settled about 11 miles from each other in the suburbs of New Jersey. But two days before thanksgiving, a horrific chain of events would forever tear them apart. Oh, his brother. Yeah. That's what it is. So I'm just getting a really fucked up version of the story. Paul, how do you say that name? Kenario. Kenny. Kenny. Kenny. Kenny. Kenny. Arrow became brothers killing his youngest brother, his sister in law and their children. Oh, this is

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       what's fucked up. Like what? What? How does a guy go from never killing anybody to killing a wife and daughter? So he killed his brother and his brother's whole family. Oh my God. I thought he killed his own. Then he said his own home on fire with his wife and daughter inside. Tried to make it look as if the whole family have been targeted. His family got out of the home safely. Can you imagine the panic? Like what the fuck just murdered these people. You don't scroll, Scroll, go back, go back. You light your own house on fire and you're like, can you imagine like while your lighting your house on fire thinking like the intensity of this is gonna work. I'm going to get out of this, this, this is where the plan goes and Poof, it's really fun. How does a person kill?

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       I mean, I understand you're mad at a guy and you fucking hate each other. Fuck you. Fuck you. And you start fighting and then you wind up killing each other. How do you kill his wife and daughters? How do you do that? What? What switch goes on? Like is he just trying to. Yeah, because he's just walking around. We'll go back up. It says it's killed. His sister in law had said he's accused accused of killing his younger brother, his sister in law and their children. Like how many children? Like who he killed kids? Yes. So this is a guy who's never murdered anybody just walking around. Colts Neck Township, New Jersey. Yeah. He's a businessman. Probably never done anything really major in his life. Probably like, was it a, uh, like a business meeting like two days before with some guy. What the fuck man? Just living his life, talking about the giants.

Speaker 1:          00:22:21       Like what the fuck? What is that? His wife and his two daughters. Oh, several twists in the case of that he then allegedly said his own home on fire with his wife and his daughters inside. Did you not hear me say that? I thought you were talking about his, his brother's family? No. No. He killed his brother and his family. Set the house on fire on fire. Then lit his own house on fire to make it look like he was being targeted. I knew that, but I didn't know his. He had kids in his wife and his daughters were inside. Oh my God. To try to make it look as if his whole is being targeted. His brother and him. Oh my God. His family got out of the home safely. Wow. Fucking unbelievable. Think about his kids right now. We're like, what did that?

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       What? What? Jesus Christ he. Oh my God. What am I just killed before sunrise? Scroll up there. Somewhere between midnight and 5:00 AM, Paul. Kenny Arrow was walking around his brothers. One point $5,000,000 colts, neck home, armed with a knife, and a gun has been in front of the white man's deadly confrontation. Unfolded. Paul fired multiple shots. Striking Keith fucking when you got mad at me for not following the story clearly. Did you feel like you could kill me? No, not yet. I need more. Need more than Jesus Christ. He walked inside, found his wife's, found Keith's wife Jennifer. He shot and stabbed her and then stabbed their children. Jesse. Eleven and Sophia eight. What the hell? Then he took some documents instead of fire in the basement. What were they doing? Like the fucking stabbed an eight year old dude, an eight year old girl in her sleep. How to how to fuck to someone it would say in her sleep. Well, it was 5:00 AM. Doesn't matter man. He's. There's gunshots in the house. The kids had gotten up. Oh my God, good Lord. What a monster. A monster. What was this guy like the month before? Like what the hell is that normal looking house shit. That is the normalist looking normal house ever.

Speaker 2:          00:24:32       Do you believe that there isn't always a presence of good and evil in the world like that. It's not just evil deeds. What this guy did was evil, but do you believe that there is a real presence of evil? That it's like a thing that takes over people or takes over. You know what I mean? Like, like, like, like good and evil. Is that more than just people's actions or is it like a force of nature? Is there a good force of nature and an evil force of nature that is constantly using people and using things as as a catalyst or as a

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       okay instrument. Let's break this down. I don't think nature's the right way to approach it because I don't think there's good or evil in nature. I think nature nature is actually far more moral than humans are because nature is just about survival. Predators and prey and they kill things and eat things, but when animals in nature kill, like with the called surplus killings were wolves will kill like 18 elk and not not eat them. They're just. They're just going on their instincts. These things are there to be killed and they can get them because they can't run away. Maybe it's fixed now or something like that, so they just can't help it. They just tear them apart because their instincts are drive them to kill because that's how they survive. That's other family survives. They're killing and eating these elk and this is just what they do and even if they kill a bunch of them where they can't eat them, their instinct is to kill because that's how they survive.

Speaker 1:          00:26:05       It's natural. It's normal with humans will. It's very different because with humans there's consequences, right? And there's law and there's other humans finding out. So there's deception and then there's, there's selfishness and there's the fear of getting caught and then there's your own your own survival instincts in terms of like, you don't want to get locked up in jail. You don't want to get caught for something. So I think if I had a guess that this guy didn't think he was going to kill this guy's wife and family probably didn't even think he was going to kill this guy. They probably got into a heated argument and they, they're stupid and he, you know, he's a Guinea. He's, that's my people. They do stupid. Your people to Ganny era. They do stupid shit. You know, they're, they're fiery people. And those, those fiery people. I swore off Italian girls when I was 21 Italian girl.

Speaker 1:          00:26:59       Take a swing at me when I was 21, I was like, that's it for me. I'm done. I'm like, I'm not hitting one back to fucking cookie sum some look at some men and some women are fucking crazy and I, I believe in epigenetics and I see our wacky. My fucking own kids are. What's epogen genetics? Epigenetics. Willis. Let's Google it. So I don't bust up the, uh, the actual definition, but essentially it's a bill. The way I'm using it is that there's certain traits that are not just environmental traits, they're inherited traits and that you hear it, we'll pull it up. Right? The study, the changes in organisms caused by the modification of gene expression rather than the alteration of the genetic code itself. This better was better words in that there's better a better definition than that. The study of heritable changes in gene expression. There you go. Active versus inactive genes that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. A change in the phenotype without a change in the Geno type, which in turn affects how cells read the jeans a great. Now I know less about it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:06       I think there's traits, and this is, this is a very, um, this is a very controversial yet I'm very, a fascinating field of study because what they're doing is they're, they're finding out that children that are twins that are separated by, you know, when they're babies, they go into different foster homes and they're raised by different families, have incredibly, remarkably similar characteristics. Lives, loves and desires, like what they're interested in, incredibly simple and they're suspecting that a lot of the, like you, we are a combination of nature and nurture. I think that's safe to say and I think that there you certainly a lot of things happen to kids when they're young that shaped their life, whether it's physical or sexual abuse, whether it's exposure to violence or whether it's positive things like love and encouragement and inspiration, but there's certain information I think that's transferred from the parent to the child while the child is in the womb and when, during, during the conception of the child. I think there's traits that come from the father and traits that come from the mother. Biological, biologically. And I think this is undeniable across species. And I think this is why dogs like my dog has no fucking idea who his parents are. He doesn't give a shit. He's like, he's not looking for. Is that on 23 dot? Exactly. I grabbed that leash and he's like, we run into there and his.

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       What are you doing, Jay Movie? Watched it yet? The three identical strangers. No, I haven't, but it's about this exact thing, right? Yeah. Um, did you watch it? I've started to like watch the trailers and stuff, but it was a good waiter to come on Netflix. It's on Netflix. Yeah. Your dog's not like wonder what my dad's doing now. Why did he leave me? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:06       Awesome. Hopes gathering in the woods. No, but he's got certain instincts, like you lifts up his leg to Piss on things, smells things like the end. And he chases squirrels. Like there's, there's things that are in. He's a retriever, right? He's a golden retriever. So he brings things back. I mean if I had pit bulls before and they'll bring things back, you got to teach them. They don't want to bring things back and they definitely don't want to let go, but they want to do is play tug of war with shit like. But he lets things go and it's natural for him. That soft mouth. Yes. I have a black lab. Does the same thing. They hold things gently because they're used to retrieving ducks and animal and pheasants that people shoot. That's what they were raised for. Yeah. So he brings things back. Like when I get him up in the morning, right? He stays in this little room and when I get up in the morning at seven to take my kids to school and all that stuff, when I open up the door he whines like crazy. He gets crazy, wags his tail. So. But the first thing he does is pick up a toy. He picks up stuff to him when it comes to me with a stuffed animal in his mouth. Like this

Speaker 3:          00:31:04       is not something that we taught him, but this is something. And Golden retrievers all around the world doing the same exact thing. Yep. All around the world. All around the same exact thing. There's certain traits. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       and I believe that Italians, my, my people, my people. I'm not saying this about. Yeah. And Yours too. I'm mostly Italian. They're savage folk. This is just a fact, man. Just a fact. There's, there's a streak, a streak. It goes back to the Romans. That's what I really, absolutely 100 percent believe that. Um, I think there are certain civilizations that have a longer history of being civilized and, and less violence. And I think when you are, were you dealing with folks that have in a real history of violence in their culture and that this translates generation to generation and transfers down to the children. And I think this guy is part of that. I mean it's like there's not, it's not a coincidence that the Italian mob, so ruthlessly brutal. What did the Russian mob. So yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:32:07       sleep brutal. Excuse me, know for sure. There's definitely that part of it. And then there's the other part of it that, like you said, there's a, there's the nurture part of it. Who knows what was going on in this guy's life that you know. Okay, so here we have two Italian brothers, right? Yeah. Raised the same way. Italian hot streak. All those things together. One brother decided to burn the house down and slow to the family. The other, an Italian guy didn't have that in his to do list,

Speaker 1:          00:32:35       but not necessarily because I don't know if they planned it out or if he did just because.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       I mean he had a knife on him and a gun. Maybe there's one of those crazy asshole that brought a knife and a gun everywhere. Who the fuck knows? But they were in business together and you know, people in business together and it's not. They get crazy and they get real resentful and you know, they think one person's not doing their fair share. One person fucks up a deal or one person costing them money. And now who knows? But how the fuck did he kill each other? So there's no. I have a baby man. How do you stab an eight year old daughter? Well, you take it in your hand. Yeah, I have no idea. But the Italians also like wine, more wine, please soon as drunk give you one of these zero percent alcohol Heineken's. He's supposed to be the most delicious. I've never had it. And we'll try one of these. I supposed to be the most delicious, nonalcoholic beer. Not recommended. They said that if you want to try, I'll try nonalcoholic beer. That doesn't suck. Get this a Heineken zero. Zero. So Heineken's zero. Zero. It's supposed to be the shit.

Speaker 5:          00:33:41       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          00:33:42       Tastes like Heineken does. There's literally no difference. Pretty damn good for nonalcoholic beer. Doesn't have that weird. I'm lying to myself. Funk to it. Yeah. It doesn't have that a weird after taste. If I was a junkie, I would not want to try great opiate. Free heroin. It tastes just like. It just seems like it'd be a smart move, but alcoholics will drink nonalcoholic beer. Walk into a liquor store by this non alcoholic guy. But you literally at the gate of Hell and the, the, the fucking demons are reached and you're like, no, no, no, no. Thank you. Zero zero. Let me just test myself or clean or cool with taking cbd. Like is that a good question? Well, the marijuana thing is different because I think for the vast majority of human beings, obviously there's a lot of biological diversity, but for the vast majority of human beings, I do not think that marijuana is physically addictive.

Speaker 4:          00:34:47       I think it's entirely possible that for some people it is, but I think for the vast majority of people it is not physically addictive. It's more psychologically addictive. So I think it's a different thing. So if they're taking cbd, what they're. I mean it depends on how they're taking. If they're rolling up a CBD joint, CBD, which is a little extra, do they do that for sure, but doesn't some cbd have a little bit of thc to go with that? Some of it. Well, this shed has the tiniest amount of alcohol, his alcohol free, but I think it's like what are the calories? Zero, zero point zero, four alcohol free beer with natural flavoring. Do you know a Heineken's one of the few beers that you can drink if you are a celiac? It does not. Have wheat, it's not a wheat based beer, so if you're gluten you can drink heineken, eh, maybe not if you're Celiac, but definitely if you're gluten free, that's not bad.

Speaker 4:          00:35:44       Yeah, I like it. That's not bad at all. It's not bad, but calories of standard. Half the calories of a standard beer. So those other calories, just pure alcohol I guess. Yeah, right. I wonder if there's like a, you know, um, there's one episode of the Opiod, Anthony Show. I remember this. Oh my God, I forgot about this. We gave this gal who she had this. Uh, I think it was her name was stocker patty. I think that was. I remember we gave this crazy. You know how radio shows have these regulars that always come to the studio? Yeah, yeah. Well they gave this one gal, I'm a breath strip, like a standard listerine breast trip and this was back in the day when I used to get pot breath strips that would, they would fuck you up so hard. I remember I gave a half a one to Thompson girl and we flew to Florida do gigs together and by the time we landed it's like, dude, I want to tell you something I almost didn't make.

Speaker 4:          00:36:45       It was almost telling these people to turn this flight around. Started freaking out half of a breast job. We'll put you in an alternative dimension. It was so strong, so we gave this gal a regular breast trip. There's a video of it online. It's like an hour long. They don't vet had no. I had no wheat and no red. Gave her this breath strip and then he proceeded to like to talk to her and she was talking about hi. She was and she's so funny. She couldn't go anywhere, but we all knew that she was sober. She was. When you're a person who's like a whack pack or from this high, there's something is an issue that's not being resolved. Yes. That makes it hard to listen to frankly is not a widow and actualized human being. That would be the table. This is not an actualized human being.

Speaker 4:          00:37:40       Someone who's got their shit together though, they're reading self help books and fucking getting up at five and doing yoga. No, no, no. It just trying to get through the day. They're barely getting through. I found this thing that makes them. That they cling to. Yeah. Those characteristics are fascinating to me because you see, you find them in other things. Would you be those characteristics of these people that find something to belong to and then they become a thing. They become a part of that thing. You would find those people at pool halls. You'll find those people at martial arts places. You find those people that hang out at comedy clubs. It's like they're a little off, but they find a thing. Yeah. That becomes the thing that they do all the time. Even if they're not like the comedian, they'll hang out at the comedy so we know those folks for sure, and I don't. I totally get it. I mean, that's community. Yes, like just wanting to belong somewhere. We all want that thing. Just that's where I go and I know those faces

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       and they know me and maybe I'm not totally a part of it, but I can go to the pool hall and yes, feel like I went, I was wanted

Speaker 1:          00:38:44       close. The pool hall was a perfect place for that because it was a hangout like a lot of people weren't playing, so if you had like three or four tables going there, so three or four tables would be like a six or eight people playing pool, but there might also be five or six people just hanging out. Maybe playing cards, maybe be just buying coffee and maybe ordering a sandwich or something like that and just sitting there eating.

Speaker 2:          00:39:08       It's important. I was reading a whole article about that by David Brooks the other day and he was saying that that's economically we're richer than we've ever been as a country and even in the last couple of years, like poor people, like everyone's standard of living has gone up. Which I wasn't really clear on. I thought that only the rich people were doing. We're were getting Richard, but everybody was kind of being lifted up, but we're unhappier than ever before and the life expectancy is lower than ever before and we're killing ourselves at rates that are higher than ever before, and he was saying that it's that lack of community that we don't go to church anymore. We don't belong to those things that gave us meaning everyday in our town and used to go to church and you'd go to the pool hall. You go to that, you need that sense of belonging and work is a big part of it and people now are in this gig economy and they're working uber, they're working seamless, they're doing different things. They're isolated, they're by themselves and I'm working with other people and it's. He really believes that it's that lack of community and that lack of institutions is why we're very, very unhappy as a, as a country right now.

Speaker 1:          00:40:20       It makes sense to me. It makes sense to me as a person who's a part of a vital community. As a comedian. I was talking to Jeff Ross was here the other day with Dave attell and one of the things that he said that really struck with me, he said, I almost feel like I'm a comedian more than I'm an American. Am I going to comedian first? American second? I was like, yeah, you, if you were at the airport and you know, you run into Dave attell or whoever it is, like, it's like there's a light upon them. It comes down from heaven. Exactly. Hey,

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       just embrace them. That's why I always, I would always get suspicious of comics who didn't embrace me. Like as soon as you home, like I was like, there's something weird with it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       Yeah. Something like horror comics that don't have any comic friends. Yeah. It's very weird. Fucking real strange and they're always super selfish.

Speaker 2:          00:41:11       Okay. It's, yeah. I can't even figure out exactly what it is, but I'm just like, I know that's not one of the good ones.

Speaker 1:          00:41:17       Yeah. Especially if someone's like a successful comedian that's really weird. Like you have the opportunity to hang out with some of the most fun people in the world. You're a peer of theirs and you give them a pass. It's like family. It's like, no. Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:41:28       I did this gig in, in Colorado once and just by chance it was like this corporate thing. And there was another comic on the bill who I won't mention. And I was like, oh, that's cool. We're in the middle of like nowhere. And at least there's another comedian here. He did his set split. Didn't talk to me just like there was no. I was like, I was like, your dog, like, Hey, let's play. Let's just split. I was like, all right, that guy's weird that guys, there's something and I am. It's true.

Speaker 1:          00:41:58       It's common now than it was back in the day. And this was another thing that I talked about with the, with jeff and Dave as we were talking about comradery, that there's, um, there's less competition now than there ever was before. Because before there was only a limited number of tonight's show slots. There was a limited number of sitcoms it could be on. And that's what everybody wanted. Everybody wanted their own Sitcom. Everybody wants to be on the tonight show. And there are very few of those very few and everybody was competing for these very limited slots and there's very few hbo specials there was, was not, there wasn't a lot and there was a lot of us and so it led to a lot of like jealousy, a lot of clawing and scratching. You can see thanks to many things. Thanks to the Internet, thanks to youtube initially then podcasts and then Netflix. It seems like the world is our oyster. There's so much you have to do is put out good content.

Speaker 2:          00:42:49       Totally. And you could have your own audience and he could have his own audience. She could have hers and all exist without having to poach each other's audiences. Yeah. And

Speaker 1:          00:42:59       Leno. I promote. Look in the beginning of. If you're listening to this on youtube, it's not on it because it's something that I do in the beginning of the audio version of it, but I. I'm always talking about people's specials that are out like the now the bumping mic special. Would Dave and Jeff Ross is out now. They're not paying me to say that Netflix is not the me to say that the special with the Christina [inaudible] special, they're not paying me to say that I'm saying that because these people are all my friends and I want them to prosper when everybody knew I want them to. I think they're great and I want everybody to know that this is great stuff and if you. If you're a fan of comedy, I want to help you find. It's like I want to be that guy in the wine store going, hey, you want to see an $18 bottle of wine? They'll knock your digging in the dirt. It's Joey.

Speaker 2:          00:43:45       Nobody knows about, but you're going to love it. Well, more people know about joey now than ever before. Enough. Not Enough. Yeah. No, I know he's the best ever. I've never. I've never seen anybody that makes me laugh harder. I don't know if I. If I enjoy him as much as I want, as much as I enjoy how much you enjoy him, it really is such a great thing. Just watching you guys when he's going off and you're laughing at him, it's just, it's like I could watch that all day. I feel so thankful. He's so real. He's such A. I mean, he's just one of those.

Speaker 1:          00:44:20       So real. Especially if I have a buzz. I got about a couple of drinks. Smoke a little weed. Now Watch Joey. I'm so thankful. I'm so thankful. There's a guy like that out there. In my opinion, he's leader of the charge because he's the most reckless and wild and and even more so now. Now that he did that, Netflix special, all my God. Go, go see him. People. He is a fucking monster right now. He's like, he's peaking. He's better than he was before and he was the best before.

Speaker 2:          00:44:48       No, it's such a great thing. Like when you go to any club and then you come in and you just see whatever random people are there. You know, my wife was a comedian before we had kids and the first thing she wants to ask, she asked when I come back as who? Who was there? Who did you say? And it's like, oh, he's so Steve Byrne, I saw the whatever, and she's like, oh, she wants, because she doesn't, she's not part of the community like she is, but she doesn't get the visit. So it's like she misses that sense and we're very lucky to have that as grown men to be able to like walk into this very fun community that you're a part of. It gives you, meaning, it gives you a sense of, of belonging. And that's what a lot of people don't have nowadays. It's very, uh, according to David Brooks, that's the reason for everybody's malaise, I think.

Speaker 1:          00:45:35       Let me something too though. I think it's weird living in places where you don't know your neighbors. That's fucking weird. I mean, yeah, Norton was telling me that he lives in this big apartment building in New York City and I think he, I mean, it's got to be hundreds of people living in that building, these huge, huge building. Yeah, no worries. No anybody. We're here. It says no, it doesn't know anybody. He says he tried to say hi to his neighbor. They looked at him like he's a fucking murderer. Nobody's friendly to anybody. So weird. They're like, you're too loud. Stop making noise. That's what everybody does to people. Bang on the door, banging on the floor, banging in the room. Conflict.

Speaker 2:          00:46:11       Yeah. It's a weird thing and it's weird, you know, my, my youngest wants to go to church and how old? 13. And because friends what does, maybe she has more of a, she's more of a sensitivity and like she knows there's something other than there's something spiritual going on. Mushrooms, I think that might've been what kicked the whole thing on. And uh, and she's just, she's searching a little bit and she wants that. She likes being able to sit someplace in a and we go and it's not like when I was a kid, like when I was a kid and we were Catholic, the place was packed. Like you couldn't find parking. It's like, it was like, it was a big deal that my father would be like, we're going early, come on, get out of the house. We got to get a spot. I'm not walking from the back.

Speaker 2:          00:47:03       And it was like a big thing. Now it's like you kind of roll up, it's half full and there's nobody there and it's, you know, of course the Catholic Church has a lot of problems and. But every but every. What do you mean by problem? But all these religions have had a little, a little kerfuffle. Have a lot like the Catholic church. No, the Catholic church is the worst. It's the worst. But the. I know, but don't let me get sides. But the, the thing is we know so much now and we're able to see that all these institutions are flawed, that there's problems with all of them. We used to be, people used to think, my grandmother just thought churches the best and this is the best one. They didn't ask questions. Now we know everything and we know that all these institutions are flawed. And I think we're making the mistake that you can't be a part of a political party. You can't be a part of a community. You can't be a part of the thing if it's not perfect, but that's not a way to live. You gotta kind of be a little ignorant if you're going to show up, you got to kind of not be ignorant, but allow things to be flood

Speaker 1:          00:48:03       or start a new one, go on. I mean the the right way to address the issues of a flawed institution and not just accept them, but to try to create a new institution that doesn't have as many flaws. I mean that's what we. That's not what we did, but our founding fathers did. When they established the United States of America, the idea was to establish a place where you have an experiment in self government and that's never existed before in the world and this is what the United States represents to the rest of the world outside of us. I mean this is what we, again, I keep saying we, it's not we, but with the people that established the United States did was they broke the mold as to how a world superpower or a country. It wasn't a super power that exists, but how a country could exist and then that country.

Speaker 1:          00:48:53       I mean, I don't think it's a coincidence that Adam just a couple hundred years that country emerged the greatest superpower of the world's ever known. I think that freedom allows unprecedented activity in terms of innovation, in terms of creativity and not being suppressed and not being in total fear for your life, for any form of descent. So any, and this is. This goes back to not just religion but any sort of any group, any, any, any group that's in control of any sort of a situation. As soon as you suppress all the other people, you limit their ability to contribute and this is what is existed all throughout Europe and would existed all throughout Asia, all throughout the rest of the world. Yeah. When the United States came along and then when the United States came along, all the sudden you have this unprecedented development and growth and this one place where people are allowed to be free.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       Where we support free expression. We we support free religious freedom of religion and we separate church and state and this is one of the reasons why these things are so important. So when you get like religious fundamentalists Wackos that say this country was founded on Christian values, that doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you're a peaceful Muslim, if you're a peaceful Buddhist, if you're a peaceful mormon, whatever the fuck it is, we should all embrace each other. We should allow each other 100 percent freedom. And as soon as someone starts restricting that freedom and restricting people's ability to express themselves, you run into real problems because then you don't let these things play out in their order. You don't let ideas play out where people get to examine those ideas and change. Like look, if you look at some of the more suppressive areas of the Middle East, the real problem is that these people live not just as many real problems, but one of the real problems is these people live in fear. So there's no real freedom of expression. And there's also this real desire for conformity is real desire to establish that you are a part of the group that is one of the good ones that's going to abide by the rules and you are going to show everyone else that you were a part of this group, whether it means throwing gay people off buildings or throwing rocks at women's shelters, all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       I was just gonna say like your life actually depends on you conforming. Yes. I was with my friend the other day who's gay and he was saying that he just stopped the chest one. Just come on, come on, shout it out. And it really, how close is close? Comes over your house. So close. Whoa. I didn't realize he can't go to half of the planet as an open gay man. Oh yeah. He can't go to Russia. He can't go to all of the Middle East. There's parts of age like they will kill you if you're gay in those areas. Yeah, I mean talk about. I mean, what's going to make a city flourish then gay people coming in with bold ideas and let's go. I mean, I saw them change parts of New York like it was nobody's business.

Speaker 1:          00:51:52       Well, and also I think that like the, the. What's great about gay folks is when gay folks are embraced and they're allowed to be themselves, oh my God, I can express that, and then you get to see that, like there's a. there's such a giant spectrum of the way people behave and think and the things that they love, and if you don't allow people to express their position on that spectrum, then you don't even know it exists. Then you create all sorts of deviance because you're forcing them into some unnatural pattern, which is one of the things that I think about the Catholic church. I think part of the problem is that these people are suppressed sexually, like incredibly suppressed, not just suppressed in terms of their, whether they're homosexual or heterosexual, but there's no sex. You're not allowed to have any sex, right?

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       Yeah. So how's it going to come out? It's fucking insane. It's insane

Speaker 1:          00:52:40       denial of the fact that you need to drink water

Speaker 2:          00:52:43       and it's so upsetting because I'm really kind of searching a little bit because I was raised Catholic and I did like going to have what she has. I did like going and sitting in the Pew on Sunday was different from the other days and I asked, I got to hear people talk about being nice to each other and I got to see the people from my town who you saw running around, but now they're just sitting there quietly and praying. There was goodness to it and they went out and fed the homeless. There was good stuff that came from it and she wants that. I get that. And now you're sitting in an institution though the, you know, the backstory of what's going on. It's, you know, how do you sit there? How do you sit there said

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       to her last night, maybe we should just go to yoga, satisfy your spiritual side with wacky to men. I know. Look, I go to a Bikram Yoga, I go to hot yoga, hot yoga, and that guy, I don't think he's allowed to come in this country. No, he's not. The guy who made big room now know that guy not think he's best case. He. He got a little rapey.

Speaker 1:          00:53:52       Well, he definitely got a little. He took advantage of his privilege, his position, our. Well, yeah, I guess you could say power, but the reverence that people had towards him, they felt like he was a guru and so he would get these girls alone and he would make them suck tank or whatever, but I think per seat, now this, I'm getting this very dangerous waters, but I was having a conversation with a woman who is a. she's actually an instructor and she said, listen, that guy is definitely creepy, but let me tell you something. A lot of those girls not only knew what he was about, but they wanted to be with him. They want him to be with him because of his power and because he represented something special to them and then when he just shot a load in their mouth and kicked him to the curb, then they became angry and decided they were molested.

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       They went into it willingly. I do not know if she's accurate or inaccurate. I was not there and I'm not a woman, but I do know that people have like a. I remember women throwing, throwing themselves, but making it very clear that they were. They had deep admiration for my martial arts instructor when I was, when I was a young kid and I was a practicing taekwondo. I remember these women. They were so in awe of my martial arts instructor because he represented a master of something that they were deeply enamored by it and I think that's also what happens with these yoga people.

Speaker 3:          00:55:28       Yeah, it's seductive. It's seductive, and also with something like that, it's very physical and mental and spiritual. It's sexual, sexual like it is. Look, I don't. I've never had any sex with anybody in my class, but I'm telling you when everybody's in there sweating and, and almost naked, I'm wearing these little fucking shorts and the girls were wearing these little shorts and, and the teacher goes around and she like calls you out. It's like, oh, she likes me. Yes, I can undo

Speaker 1:          00:55:57       Stan. How some of those people get intimate with each other after this is all over because they're, they're so close to being naked

Speaker 3:          00:56:04       wedding together and your friend is right. Uh, in that, there were some women I'm sure who wanted to be with him, but he's not dismissing any rap shit either, but it's his responsibility because he has the power and knows what he's wielding like in a workplace kind of thing. It's up to you to be the one who puts the brakes on it. That's where it gets interesting.

Speaker 4:          00:56:25       He does not seem to think that he does have any responsibility at all for the people that are working for him teaching these classes. And like he was, he did this hbo documentary. It was fucking, they did this hbo interview about him. It was so ridiculous. This is the big guy. Yeah. Yeah. He goes, the other women that will pay $1,000,000 for one drop of my sperm. He says this tv, you can find the video. So he's fully aware. He's fucking crazy. He's fully aware of his crazy. Yeah, he was. He was dismissing the idea that he would ever sexually assault anyone. He's like, why would I do that when these women that will pay $1,000,000 for one drop of my. Well, it wasn't. Why wasn't? Yeah, it wasn't brought. Bryant Gumbel wasn't there. I think they're discussing it. We're discussing this comment. You go on to see the guy because he looks like a.

Speaker 4:          00:57:24       because he said the comment to a woman and she was like this. She was like, what in the fuck did you say hbo shows various crammer breaks down million dollars. Sperm Interview Interview Shit that you said. There's some shit that you say where people go, wait, what the fuck? Holy Shit. Yeah. There's some things that are calling it that you would call beyond the Pale. Well, I love. I love just seeing pictures. You hear these stories, then you see him, he's like, you're like grandpa. He's like, oh, loose skin, and he's balding and. But that's the thing. It's like when you're in a power of a powerful position like that, he's very spiritual and people will pay $1,000,000. What does it say from being circumspect? A real sport? Uh, the 70 year old went off on a rant claiming 500 women a day wanted to sleep with him for, have committed suicide over his charms, and people would pay $1,000,000 for a drop of his sperm. CNL Irish. If you lived in that world, I would just shoot loads every day and then retire. If you, if you just drank eight. A lot of zinc. Zinc and like what makes loads? Oysters. Celery. Yeah. Is that Vegan nonsense propaganda pieces adds to the pop. Who tells you that? The salary people. That's like some fucking salary lobby. No, it's true. Salary does. How do you know? I read, I read something. Porn people, right? Salary. Salary was Jamie got here. Oh, here it is. The most beautiful, famous, rich women in the world. If have to sleep with women and have to

Speaker 6:          00:59:21       sleep, you know, by thousand garden every day she tells in women a day one to sleep with, you commit suicide. Four of them. You're saying that for different women, for different ornament each killed themselves because you wouldn't have sex one time. Why I am doing it. Women People's been $1,000,000 for one drop of my sperm million dollar in day. Every drop. That idiot or dumb to believe those trash to women or the trash. Yeah. I begged him pump trash and give them life.

Speaker 4:          01:00:01       Oh my God. Seventy years old. He looks pretty good for a 70 year old selling all that loads. Oh my God. I don't last very long. I gotta to get it dry up real quick. Yeah, they get gross. Do you know man? Oh Man. Yeah. So that spiritual thing like that, but that's. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the problem with it is you're still an animal, right? So the animal. It's like we were talking about before with the wolves gone, these surplus kills and they kill all these elk and they don't eat them again. Wyoming. There was a recent issue, there was 18 elk that were killed by wolves in these surplus killings is a real tragic. Yeah. These walls can't help themselves. It's just their instincts. So his instincts as a man, he has instincts to procreate, right? His instincts to respond to women that are sexually attracted to him, and he teaches these classes in front of hundreds and thousands of people and everybody loves and adores him.

Speaker 4:          01:01:01       Soon he fucked up twisted brain. Everything that he said there made sense. My favorite part of it was that woman, Andrea, when she, when she clarified. So you're saying, you're saying that for women have committed to it like, I want this motherfucker has to be clear on this nonsense. I like how she's there is. She doesn't even change her expressions. She's just like. So you're saying? Yeah. I mean, look at that girl right now. He's standing on top of a woman's hips as she's bent over backwards. That girl is like, he wants me. He standing over me. I've taken a lot of yoga classes. Nobody ever stood on my hips. Now, hey bro, but I do like it when you're doing yoga and they come over and they like push your legs down and you're like, yeah, well it's a little depressing. Oh Shit. I just spilled assistant. I spelled wine. Leave it there bro. Let it sink in. That's good for the, the Patina. I'm learning those, those terms, the Patina. So there. So when you're in the church, the Church of Yoga, home or real and you're abusing your power, that's a different animal because you're dealing abusing with children. It's a totally different animal and then we've taken six year olds and abusing them. It's a different animal. You know what I mean? Like it's like there's levels to this shit, right? Like the guy killing his brother is horrific to me. The guy killing his

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       brother's wife, more horrific guy killing his brother's wife and then kids. Impossible. Demonic. It's like what you were saying earlier, like do you believe in good or evil? I don't know if I believe in it, but if it did exist, it exists in the minds of men exist in that time,

Speaker 3:          01:02:36       you know, it's a no or. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:02:38       but you know what I, I had this bit that I did on my last special and it was about men's rights groups and I was trying to figure out a way to say this and make it be funny, but it's so true that I said men commit. Most of the murderer men commit. Most of the rape men cause all the war. This is, these are facts like the most horrific things in our life, our war, murder, rape, those are the most horrific things in all of life means death pales in comparison and I think men steal more than women too, but that that's the evil. This is. If there was a demon and the demon came down to earth and there's only three things that it could get you to do, it would get you to rape, murder and caused war. Right? So if a demon was real demon would be men.

Speaker 1:          01:03:24       I get, I, I said this as a joke that I get feminists, like in the special. I was like, I get it. If I was a feminist, I'd be one too. I'm like, I can't be one as a man because they're not real, because like male feminists, like they're just tricksters. They're just like, show me a male feminist that can pick up heavy things and run really fast. You don't exist this, you have a limited parameter where you're allowed to be a male feminist, but yeah, but I get it, but when I look at the actions of men, if you're an objective person, you take yourself out of the human race and you look at all, all human beings and you look at the horror that meant not that women haven't done awful shit and falsely accused people and killed their kids and women have done all those things. Sure. Some women, some. But the vast majority of horrors I've been

Speaker 3:          01:04:12       had been committed by men. Yeah, I know. I know. It's a very primitive, uh, a way to look at the world that there's good and evil and it exists in these certain ways. That's good. That's all good. All right. But hit it. That Toki crazy. I'm worried that I won't be funnier after I do this. Let's see me pick up the slack.

Speaker 1:          01:04:33       Did you like Elon Musk? You're a Goddamn parent. Pioneer.

Speaker 7:          01:04:37       Jamie's going to go deeper.

Speaker 3:          01:04:40       Jamie's going for three, I think is that Jamie has hip problem. If you, uh, if you see a video of the floor, she hits the wrong button. Like biggie smalls over there in a cloud of. What's amazed. Amazing to me is that this is now a 100 percent legal here. It's still not federally. Right? Well, that's what was funny about the Eland thing when Elan smoked it here. It was like, it's totally legal. It's totally okay. But in everyone's minds they're still like, no, it's not. Yeah. Well they need to let it go. And this is why. No, I didn't

Speaker 1:          01:05:14       need to let it go. We're on your side. You know, I'm, I'm on, I'm on like the, the, the good people of government, law enforcement, fire department, military, the good people. If I'm on your side, man. Yeah. And I'm a stoner. I'm on your side. I'm on your side a thousand million percent.

Speaker 2:          01:05:31       And making it legal actually helps all that because now you don't have to go out and fight these phony war is against it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       It doesn't just do that. It makes people more compassionate and it makes people look. It's like everything else you can abuse beating off. You know, I remember when I was a million dollars a drop $1,000,000 for one drop of my sperm. You know, if you're a person that gets obsessed with masturbation, like you could ruin your life. Yeah. There's people that are legitimate porn addictions where they watch porn eight, 10 hours a day and they can't stop. Right. This is like everything. Yeah. I think you can ruin yourself with sugar. You can ruin yourself with food. You can ruin yourself with, with laziness. You can. You can get into a habit where you just can't get up. Yeah. You know, you can get into a comfort zone. We just want to take baths. All right. People do shit like. Yeah. No, I know. Exactly. Yeah. There's. Did Roseanne say she did that after all of her bullshit went down, she has gotten the bath all the time. Drank wine. Was that this is their safe space. I apologize, I wasn't

Speaker 2:          01:06:35       so um, so anyway, I know it's a very basic way. I mean we've been talking about good and evil since the time of the men were able and women were able to, you know, write and philosophize and. But it, I don't know, it just seems to me lately like I've see it feels to me like evil and good is actually a force that we're struggling with and I know there's, I know like some people would say that's kind of a primitive way of thinking, but I do kind of feel like, uh, it actually is a very real, tangible thing. And that.

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       What makes you think this, your personal feelings? Is it based on like your intuition? Like what is it?

Speaker 2:          01:07:22       I, yeah, it's intuition. It's like a vibe. It's like a, it's just like a maybe because I'm showing up at church and kind of like searching a little bit. Myself and I, I am very much about good people doing good things and I've just been kind of conscious of it, but then there's always like these, this rise of evil that comes up like all of a sudden white supremacists are. These riots are these horrible things against people in different parts of the world and it's. It seems like it's an ongoing struggle

Speaker 1:          01:07:54       look almost like why hasn't caught up yet to the way you look at the world where a lot of people look at the world. A lot of people look at the world like, like if Tom Papa, if you were in charge, and if you had to push all the buttons, that would sort of decide how people behaved. If that was a possible thing. Of course you'd have one of the first thing you do is eliminate all the violence and all the horrors of the world. Yeah. And if.

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       And then also, I'm sorry to cut you off, but you also see the. All those hires are done by these men and stuff. Who when you sit in like kind of analyze them and they've been the victims of a lot of things and there's like genetic victimization and social and it's like, so where's that coming from? Why are these, this kid that could have been okay ends up in this life of crime and ended up murdering somebody and where's that coming from? Is this just a genetic mutation or is there like a force of good and evil?

Speaker 1:          01:08:46       I think we're still. We're still dealing with the echoes of the past. That's what I really firmly believe and I think also the way maybe you and I are having this conversation the way a lot of people are having these conversations today just like us, but basically the same sort of rational people sitting around with no agenda going, why does this exist? Why does all the horrors of life? Why? Why is all this injustice? Why is that there? Yeah. I think this is it. We haven't been here that long. I just really think that that's real and I think we need to absorb that much better. Our time spent in modern civilization versus the time of life on earth is a joke. The time on life, on earth and in relationship to the time of the universe is a joke. Right? The numbers are insane.

Speaker 1:          01:09:34       I can't understand that. We literally were monkeys just a couple of weeks ago. Right. But the bit that I have my act about the United States being founded in 1776, that's three people go behind her. That's three people go really is. Yeah. That's nothing. So three people go. People were these creatures that had to make fire to stay warm. They didn't have electricity. They didn't have engines. Yeah, they. They made boats at a trees and they use the wind to drift across the ocean while staring at the stars with the fucking gigantic harp looking thing. Right. What was the thing? A sextant? Yeah. That thing that they use to figure out where the other ones are. She had a trust that these motherfuckers had mapped out the universe. Well, that was. You could make it across the ocean and a lot of people died of scurvy along the way.

Speaker 1:          01:10:25       Like fuck man, that's crazy. Not long ago, so God damned recent. Yeah. When I was listening to Dan Carlin's hardcore history, one of the best podcasts ever to be, I don't know if you're so good, but he has this thing on the mon goals called the wrath of the cons and what freaked me out is not just how crazy that world was back then and what unbelievable damage and destruction the Mongols created and how they just conquered empires just moved across the world, killed millions and millions of people, but it was really fucked up was I think Google does to make sure I'm not wrong. I think that was only like 1200 BC. I don't think that was that long ago. Right? Yeah. It's really recent. That's really recent. I think Gingiss Kahn died in the $1,200, if I remember correctly. 100 add add. Oh, well did I say BC? I actually met a day.

Speaker 1:          01:11:23       I said BC, but it really did mean a dj in the more recent 800 years. I'm a little stone. Folks are a lot more recent, but that 1200, well, 1200, so c would still be still be pretty fucking recent, but 1,280, which is what I meant to say. Right. So recent. That's just not that long ago. We're starting to make wine and sour. Does it go the other way? Other way? Seven Ninety two 70 to 792 years ago a guy killed 50 million people during his lifetime with his actions. Right. They changed the carbon footprint of the world. I mean they, I mean they, they. So then you're saying it's, you're saying it's more surprising that we're doing this kind of stuff and that we have electric cars and medicine and all this other kind of like it's more surprising that we're doing that than it is that people are running around killing each other.

Speaker 1:          01:12:18       Well, Nazi Germany, that was 19 forties. It's crazy. That's maybe crazier than anything. You know, if you and Carla and has some great stuff on that too, in the history of World War One and World War Two, but if you're, you're, you're watching a documentary on that and you watch those people move around. Especially that one that you showed me, Jamie, that's been digitally remastered when you see it in color, is that Ken? Is it Ken Burns it to that? Yeah, I think so. They digitally remastered some footage from World War One and you get to watch these people move around, like in real time you realized like, Oh, these are just people. They're just just like you. I know and this is 100 years ago, years ago were involved in this crazy ass war and then a few years later involved another crazy ass war. Yeah. So why can't we figure it out? Dude, I'm telling you.

Speaker 1:          01:13:06       Will is present. I don't know. I think. I think it used to be the only way that people got by, I think killing each other and I think from going from small groups of people which like in these small groups of people, they would have interpersonal conflicts. They would have fights with members in the tribe, but they would sort it out and there would probably be some sort of rule that they would all try to live by, but then they would get invaded by people that didn't have anything and we'll look for your stuff and they came over the top of the hill and they killed and they raped and they. They stole women and they just did that for a long ass time. Man. They did that for a long ass time. This was the history of the steps like that. Dan Carlin maps out in this wrath of the con thing makes you go, Jesus, Chris, imagine being born. Just imagine how crazy that meant. Being a baby. It seeing arrows flying around and people call it open to people were lighting people on fire and launching them onto roofs with catapults. This is the footage for world war one, so

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       look how they digitally remastered it and Peter Jackson movie, I believe, or a documentary. That's the craziest thing. When you look at history and you think that, well that was. Then it's like, no, they're just us. Just happened to be there. Really no different than you and me, dude, we haven't been here this long. We haven't been here this long. This is the thing like people that looked like this, that awaring like uniforms and that are, you know, have like decent stuff, nice wheels to their wagons. That's real recent man. No, I know it's recent as fuck. And there's been a bunch of different ways that people have done it, you know, but even if you go back to Egypt, so it isn't the act of like, okay, so we know like that guy who lit his house on fire, we know that is a just instinctually we know and have known during even all this history, we've known that that is evil like, right.

Speaker 4:          01:15:05       You know what I mean? Like it's insanely selfish. It's not like we went from having to like eat each other and that we're trying to get our act together. You know what I mean? There is a, we all know that. That is such a evil, evil thing. I think it exists. I think we have to fight it. Well, it's, it is evil, but it's ego that's causing that, right? That guy didn't want to go to jail. It didn't want to shoot himself, didn't want to kill himself and didn't want to go to jail. So he decided he was gonna kill a bunch of people to make up a story. He, he had a plot and this plot was to save himself, you know, and that's when people get trapped in a situation where they're allowed to make decisions and they're allowed to, if not allowed to, but if they choose to make decisions and those decisions are horrific and then they have to somehow or another justify those decisions because they never look at their own behavior.

Speaker 4:          01:15:57       They always judge other people. This is a pattern that people fall into when they're always looking for other people to always be wrong. Right. And they never grow. And so like a guy like that, if you so psychotic that he could kill somebody and then he has this decision to make this decision is to kill the wife and the kids still like he's just always got to be right. You know what I'm saying? Like he's always, he's got it, he's trying to cover his tracks, he's trying to lie, always like this is the type of person that could do something like that. Again, this is a horrific pattern of thought and it might have been triggered by the murder itself, so it's just a chemical flip in his brain that says, now I can kill people. Like he hasn't done it as whole life and he's just going into the subway and getting a sandwich with all the stuff on it and just be like watching the Monday night football and then the next week he's like, something flips in his brain is like, no, now I can kill. I don't think it's the people that I know and love. I think in a fit of rage, in a fit of rage if does something horrific. And then I think he's one of those people that tries to justify his actions. So it just tries to figure out a way where he can justify it. They're going to be in hell anyway because the guy's dead. You know, they, they'd probably

Speaker 3:          01:17:11       been thinking that deep. He could. You think we're crazy? Man, they come up with justification, but we came from, like we said before, this is an Italian dude like us, but he could've also, we don't know if he's medicated. Do we know that that's a brain chemistry. We don't know what he was doing, you know what I mean? He could have been on something which, uh, you know, makes people do horrific things. Do you think, do you believe in Karma?

Speaker 1:          01:17:37       I think for sure that when you put energy out there, it affects things around you in terms of the way people interact with you and that in turn affects the way they will interact with other people as well. And I think there's, there's, there's a certain amount,

Speaker 3:          01:17:53       there's an energy you put out, it's, you could call it that, but that makes it sound like you've got a crystal in your pocket, right? Not really. Energy. Real energy is a real thing. There's a real right. If I was, if I was a murderer and came and sat in here, there'd be a different vibe than what you're feeling from me. Yeah, for sure. You know what I mean? For sure. Yeah. A chronic masturbator well, it's also people that are off and then struggling with the fact that they've done something awful. Right. There's like an energy to that. It's like constantly being on edge energy. Yeah. Every crime and punishment. That's still CFC. I'd never read that. Oh, you should read it. It's so he kills someone in the East carrying the guilt. Latest description of the Gulf. Just carrying that thing. Now that guy is going to admit and energy, but you don't think there's Karma just for like you do something bad and something bad will happen.

Speaker 1:          01:18:50       I think a genuinely believe, and this is no crystals in my pocket, I genuinely believe that if you do something that you know to be awful, that that has an equal effect coming back at you, like whatever bad that you've put out in terms of like doing something evil to a person, the way you feel personally about yourself, you will take an equal blow. I really believe that. And where does that come from? I think comes from your own introspective thinking. I think. And worse, you know, you might even feel worse than that per. You'd say something rude to a person just because you're tired and then you realize you said some rude, annoying, right. Why did I do that? I didn't mean. And then they could be like Tom Papa's not really. Not. I just am so tired, you know? And you'd just asked me something stupid. I'm sorry. It's like, it's hard to turn that around. Yeah. So you might hate yourself more than they even get mad at you.

Speaker 3:          01:19:50       So Karma is really, you're dealing with the energy. It's not the universe saying now something bad's going to happen to you. You're kind of creating it with your own actions and your own stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:20:00       I think it's real dangerous when we pretend that we have any sort of real understanding of the patterns, all the events that take place in the world. So when you start to say like someone, something happened to someone because of Karma. That's okay. The problem with saying that is what about babies? What about babies with leukemia? Were they bad babies? What happened? Why did they get cancer? Why they die young? Why did they die in car accidents? Why? That doesn't make any sense. They've never done anything bad there,

Speaker 2:          01:20:31       but that's where you could say that bad shit happens to us all, but can you create more bad shit

Speaker 1:          01:20:39       possible co two and it's also entirely possible that you're creating more bad shit but feeling bad about yourself because you've done bad shit so you create more of this negative energy that you carry around with you. I think that's entirely possible too. But I think that we also have this weird need to define things, you know, and I think that we're looking to this thing that we're calling Karma and we're saying that this is like, this is definite correlation between action and reaction and between the good you put out there and the good that comes back and my take is that I think there's definitely something going on, but I don't think we should define it yet because I don't think we really know. And I think as soon as we box it up and say it's this thing and this is the absolute reaction that the world has. When you put good out there, good comes back. Good people die all the time, folks. Good people die.

Speaker 2:          01:21:32       I think there's. I think there is an energy. Yeah, and you know, we know it from the work that we do. I think it's both. When you stand on stage, there's an energy in that room that transference between you and the people that are out there and you're playing with it and it's a real thing. It's a very real thing. It's like hypnosis, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is. And and then they can. They can reverse hip, hypnotize you. They could bring this other energy the other way so that there is this energy of all of us out there and running around. It's not that far to think then there couldn't be good energy and there's bad energy and there's an. Is that ultimately good and evil? Maybe it is all generated from human beings. Maybe if you educated everyone and they could all be kind and try and come at it that way we could actually feel that there was more good, but that's just more good coming from people I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:22:25       Well, if you want to get really spacey with this really, really spacey, it's the holidays you go, okay, well what? What exactly are people doing? That's what you do here. What are people doing? What are they doing? Like, what's our purpose to be being here? Look at us from an outside perspective, like pretend you're not a person. You're looking at all the people like what are they doing? They're moving really fast. They're spending most of their time doing things they don't want to do and they're buying stuff bustling around because they're throwing all this money at stuff. The stuff keeps getting better, so every year the stuff keeps getting more complex and more capable and more high tech and more space age. This is bananas, man. I to watch her and call me fucking Dick Tracy man, right? Yeah, and that as people keep going on and on and on and on with this stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:23:12       This is where we need some sort of energy behind this innovation and a lot of the energy is conflict. Conflict and resolution. Conflict and resolution. Conflict and victory, victory and defeat and the defeat makes your work harder and and there's all these interacting forces that are constantly moving together. I'm with you, ended this. A lot of it is expressed. The success of this little game has expressed in material possessions. The success in this game is expressed in Hamptons mansions and private jets and bentleys and Pam. I'm winning this fucking crazy game. OPS and there's a lot of value and winning the crazy game who stopped so we let these people acquire all this stuff and you've got all these diamonds and fuck yeah, this is. This is forcing more stuff to be made better and more innovation, which will eventually, and this is where it gets spacious of all waiting for this part.

Speaker 1:          01:24:13       This is going to be what people become. People are going to become some sort of symbiotic organism. Something that's tied into electronics and that it's happening now. It's happening slowly and we're making it with stuff and as we keep making stuff, it's eventually going to get to a part that was the thing you would like to do more than anything is have enhanced your experience on earth. Right. I want to be able to take pictures. Yes. Yes. I want to be able to email people. Yes, yes. Yeah, but I also want to. I want it to make my experience on earth better. Well then we're going to have to integrate with your circuitry, Tom, papa, and then live forever. Maybe. Maybe that's what the organisms are trying to do. We're trying to get rid of the monkey that wants to start the wars all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:24:56       Right. It's enlightenment that towards the end of our goofy ass system, evil living there would be a great science fiction movie, but if this is the future and they probably were already made it, but if only some people went on board with a new enlightenment that you get from these headsets. Like remember the dude from Star Trek, the blind guy from sesame street. Remember he was used to be on sesame street, right? Yeah, that he was the uh, Lavar Burton Rainbow Boulevard. Yeah. Reading Rainbow, Lavar, Burton, Barbara, yeah. Yeah. We all have those things on it. There's only like 10 of them for what if no one bought into most people bought into it and those things completely cure you of any evil. It just moving along. I think that uh, I don't know. I mean there was, maybe there is no purpose to us being here, but you got that shit for pep boys. That's a filter. That's a really good, cool air filter at the top of the muscle, isn't it? Come on. That's a 69 chevy. Yeah. You bought,

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       you bought that at the auto parts store and put it in your dose. Yoda Corola dope old ones, man. When they fucking unscrew the chrome hubcap filter down. I always liked a good wing man and people don't remember man. These people today, you don't remember what gas smells like. Oh Man. You could fix your own car. You could open it up and with a screwdriver and a high school education, fix your automobile. I was never smart enough or knowledgeable enough to fix my own car, but I could do little things. I can change my oil. Changed to a lot of things with old. Exactly. Did the brakes once I did the brakes, hit the brakes. That's a bold move. What if you're wrong? I was poor. I didn't have money. I've just been buying brake pads. Was a lot cheaper than having some guidance. Did you put it up on a Jack?

Speaker 3:          01:26:53       How'd you put it up on a jack and a cinderblock that held it underneath and yeah, it was nice. It was a light little car. Little pads. Put them in. I probably had to get it fixed after that, but. But yeah, you could fix stuff. There was like a time when you could actually. And you felt good about it, but. But yeah, if you had to choose between one of those fucking rickety ship boxes, that's like a rhinoceros on roller skates versus your Tesla. Yeah. No, there's no way things can go. Fuck. No, and I wouldn't put. I wouldn't put my kids in one of those that we're driving around in those death traps. Do like no steering. No airbags. Hydroplane at the drop of a hat. Exactly. Just spinning around. So engine heavy. Remember it was a big ass engine's in the front. They didn't know what I'm asking.

Speaker 3:          01:27:45       Would just slide all over the place. It was so easy to slide your car back then. It was totally beat with your friends. Just like spinning out and they figured out how to balance them. That's like, that's the big deal. Like if you take a tesla or anything, you buy a fucking camry. Okay. That camera handles better than a 69 Camaro. Fuck it. I wouldn't like to see what the death rates are better a on the roads now with like new cars. It's got to be. It's probably much better. I mean they're. They're much safer, but they're also much faster too. Yeah, but you don't have to drive very fast for it to be fatal. I didn't know how to make stuff. Everything was glass just filled with gasoline. That and fucking sparks and fumes. Fumes were everywhere. Driving be getting high from the fumes, right? I remember when I was working, uh, for a fireplace company in the summer in New Jersey and it was in a truck and we're in this truck and traffic of the New Jersey turnpike right by Newark airport and just the fumes from everything from the city, from a car. And it was just arinze in the humidity of New Jersey. I was like, if I get cancer, this is gonna be the day that it, that it hit me. And it makes people crazy. It's like, it's like

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       throwing alcohol and fire. So freedom that dust all day. So disgusting. Pull up a video of the sound of the exhaust of a 1969 Camaro. There is something to somethings the smell of gas is a good smell slot. Just that man, if that sound, there's a sound. Oh, how about this one? Even better. Nineteen Sixty Chevelle, 1970 Chevelle. Ss

Speaker 5:          01:29:38       America doesn't evil about that sound. That is a drive. One of those mother fuckers around was very cool. I mean, the bumper cars is preposterous as they are

Speaker 4:          01:29:58       present a lot of ways. What's great about America? Yeah, the excess. Exactly. Not giving a shit. It's just so outrageous. Let's go. Let's have a good time. Fucking giant metal explosion contained in the front of the hood. That's all it is. A giant ass

Speaker 5:          01:30:16       explosion box. Look at this. Who? That's the 69. Sixty nine. Oh my God. This guy gloriousness. You see heaven on earth, right?

Speaker 4:          01:30:40       Oh, 19. Sixty nine Chevelle. Look how pretty that car is, man. If this guy is across the street from me and I'm looking at with my coffee out of my window and he comes pulling out with that because Saturday morning, you know what I'm saying? What? This guy's an asshole. Do you hear her be with his new car?

Speaker 5:          01:30:55       Do you know what? There are midlife. You say that

Speaker 4:          01:30:57       you say that, but I guarantee you if you were next door and he just walked over and looked at it, it would catch you in its bell would cross the street. It's just rack it. Jesus Christ. Why is your car after be so loud? Yeah, but if you're right next to it, you're like, wow, 1969 and you'll start walking around. It's pretty bad, so it's beautiful. It's not. You can't make a car like that today because it's not even remotely aerodynamic. Hammock. Fuel efficient. It's not safe. There's a pitiful man. They nailed it. They hit the sweet spot in art and engineering. That is the one part of the American experience. Recklessness. That's what drives everything that there is that element of balls to the wall. Let's see what happens. Let's discover and you could get good things out of it. Right? But imagine this, imagine something that's far inferior to the modern alternative but makes you feel in a way the modern alternative isn't capable. Feeling

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       like if you see in 1969, like done up Mustang Gt. What? What? What was the like the big one that year one. Was it a mock one? What the fuck was the 1970? Was it a boss? That's what it was. [inaudible]. Sixty nine was like a boss and then earlier than that they made those eleanor cars for that gone in 60 seconds. I think those were 19, 67, so really not there. That body style, like if you looked at one of those next to a 2018 mustang, the 2018 mustangs look fucking great. They look great. That's it right there. That's a mock one. Yeah, that's it. Oh, that's right. It's John Rice dude. There's a company that's making these now too. They're called classic recreation's and they're making these brand new versions of that car they take. They take 19, 69 mustangs and they rebuild them, but they give him like real break, so they stopped good modern suspension. They make it so you can drive it around. That's what I'm interested in. That. That makes sense.

Speaker 3:          01:33:06       That makes a lot of sense because they're just pretty mustang bad ass tires, but that's when you at

Speaker 1:          01:33:13       that. How beautiful is that? It doesn't look like anything that you can buy that's modern. Like there's nothing remotely close. No. That's like vinyl. They just right there. They just nailed it. Whatever the fuck they did

Speaker 3:          01:33:27       all these years later, we're like, God damn it. They nailed it. Right. But they nailed it for, you know, certain, a lunkhead from New Jersey that doesn't do that for you. Yeah, it does. But I don't know. I don't know if you don't know if young people would like that. I don't know. They're like to start arresting them. If they don't like young boys don't look down Mustang and say good God credible. If they don't do that then they should probably go to jail somewhere that is pretty hot. That's incredibly good looking. But it's stupid. But it's also stupid. Wow. So sir, it's just metal right in your chest cavity. No, no airbag. You need to do more push of last just in your face. It's probably a little bit of that. No, I know a chunk in a car accident and drive carefully and it's a wonderful thing to behold.

Speaker 3:          01:34:23       Yeah. My buddy had his bad mustang when we were in high school, but if you saw something like that but it had airbags, he'd be cool with it then. Yeah. No, I'm cool with it. Anyway, I'm just busting Paul's, but I think it's a look at that little orange thing in the middle that looks closer to what? I had. A 76 Toyota Corolla. Call that up. Call up in 1976 Toyota Corolla with a with a a racing stripes along the side. Look at that bad boy. Look at that orange one in the second row. That was it. I had a 1984 Honda accord.

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       80 four Honda accord with stuttering spark. That's the 79. You need the 76. Those are cool little cars though. That's. I could fix that car at those. That's what I was doing the brakes on.

Speaker 1:          01:35:11       Yeah, it looks like one of those. Something like that. It was white. Nice little shitty carbon legend. Oh, it's just like this. Oh know what man? Here's the thing. Those fucking cars drive forever. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, they are. It's amazing how reliable Honda's are.

Speaker 2:          01:35:30       Oh yeah, they're so insane. Toyota Toyota's. Oh my God. Just go forever. Just having that crummy car. It was a good thing. But. So you think back to your, uh, your point of view of the, what are these people doing here? So they're building. I liked where you were going, making stuff for what, what'd, because everything's electronically based and is this all instinct is or is it being steered by something? We just finding our way in the dark and this is what's coming out or is there some plan? Well, that's a heavy question.

Speaker 1:          01:36:04       It's really hard to know if there was a plan. Yeah, I get, I get why some would be suspicious that there would be, but if you just see the whole nature right, with the starting off of the tribal behavior and the invasions of the others and the wars that have taken place sort of nonstop, right? Yeah. You get this hyper competitive team oriented thing broken into countries. Well, I think that with that and this like constant competition in this constant and then inside your country, this constant competition economically and everybody just striving to achieve and do better and get crazier and bigger. And this is all leading to us just continuing to buy stuff like everybody that is involved in this as buying the newest iphone or the newest macbook, the newest, this news.xbox. Fucking. How many x boxes have been now for? Let's just say four.

Speaker 1:          01:36:57       Four. Yeah. Yeah. Going to keep going, keep going. They're going to go xbox five. They're going to. They're going to keep going. It's what everybody does. They want better shit. You Want Vr? We want. I will not hyper realistic Vr. I want vr with no gear. I want you to be able to give me a pill and that pill releases a bunch of nanobots that go through my circulatory system and find my, my brain and juice it up. But some artificial memory. I mean that's what I want. And I share them out later. Like buck shots and right clink. Yeah, kidney stones. You Shit it out. Like buckshot like little babies coming out in your poop. This is mean. Look,

Speaker 2:          01:37:32       beings always try to find safety, right? That's what they want more than anything. They don't want to get killed. They want to. They want to be safe and exist, eat whatever, but they just want to be. They want that safety, so maybe our safety is going to come when we're out of the woods were out of the wild where out of the 20th century and we're just these insular things that never have to go out and about and forever and

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       just be [inaudible] could be. Maybe that's what all this push of technology is, is aiming towards. Yeah. It could be right. Just to protect ourselves in these little cocoons and and be. Yeah. I mean if the ultimate threats always violence and war, right. That's the ultimate threat to the organism and the organism can commit violence and war against each other, which is why we make doors and gates and stuff to keep those things at bay. Yup. Yeah, but it's the most fascinating things that people don't address. Like what would, what would cause a person to snap? There's no real concrete, no concrete answer. What do you think is the difference between, and I'm asking this honestly killing when you're hunting and killing a human being. I think it would be a giant difference terms of where you fell. Yeah. How could you articulate it though? I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:38:53       I've never killed a human being, but I would, I would imagine that it would be, um, I mean it would have to be some horrific situation where you're battling for your life, which people do that. It does happen, you know, we were all aware of it. The worst possible scenario we would all like to think that everybody that we meet that's of sound mind should be our brothers and sisters. I mean we should all get along whether you agree or disagree about certain political issues or certain social issues, like we should be able to talk through that as a community. But like always hold at the top that we're all in this together and if I think that's possible, I think that's possible and I think we could still satisfy this fucked up desire that we have to constantly compete. We can temper that with what I think is the most important thing is finding something that you're passionate at because I think you and I are really, really lucky that we found stand up and through stand up.

Speaker 1:          01:39:54       We found this thing that we're passionate at and we have a good time and we have fun. Some people don't have that, so like if I. If you were offered a job as a stockbroker and this is a guaranteed job, you have a guaranteed contract for the next 20 years, you're going to make five times as much as you make doing stand up. You can't do standup anymore. He would never take that. You'd be like, wow. So even though you're a guy who does well, you're not a business person. You're a guy following your passion and it's allowed you to live a nice life, but that doesn't. It's not the same as a lot of people with a lot of people are doing is just chasing the money so the, the passion doesn't exist and they can manufacture that passion. When it comes to like some desire to see their, their team kick ass because their companies, number one, it could be, could be really that they are into succeeding in the business world and that's their passion.

Speaker 1:          01:40:46       They liked a lot of people that like that, but it's not the same as a guy like David Cho who's like a professional artist who's making. He's. He just follows his passion. He does what he wants. There's a different kind of achievement. There's a feeling that he has the way he interfaces with what he does for a living that's different than what a lot of people do. So I would imagine that artists would probably be less inclined to go crazy and spend all their money on stuff and buy things that make them look better or make them feel better about the fact that they work because they're not trying to fill a hole that. Right. But if you're just, you have a job for a company that you don't really give a fuck about. You don't really give a fuck about styrofoam coolers. You know, you really don't give a fuck about fucking, you know, those rubber bands that people buy when they have causes. You don't give a fuck about this company, right? You're just a fucking guy who does it. Your Business and you're there at, okay, well, well, you know, we can give them to you for 1796 if we can work this through Bob. We're talking about a thousand bucks. Want to be there? Like, I want to be fishing. The guy wants to be doing something else. Yeah, you don't. You, you're insanely fortunate that you don't have that in your life. No,

Speaker 2:          01:41:54       but I think, I don't think those people look. A lot of people have jobs that they're not into, but the reason we're lucky is that our job is our passion. A lot of people have the job that they're maybe not into, but they love this other stuff that they do. They love being with their family and keep teaching soccer or they love skiing or whatever. Their passion is something else. It like. We're lucky that our passion is our work to combine those things. That is a very, very unique thing.

Speaker 1:          01:42:24       It's the most insanely lucky thing ever, but I think that for people that are like hyper competitive, that don't find a thing that they really love, then it really, for many of them becomes about pursuing the best stuff. Yeah, and you. This is what fuels so many people for like these status symbols or like if you have an iphone eight, if a kid sees you with an iphone eight and they got an iphone 10 period, you weird. They can basically do the exact same thing. Has a fucking killer camera. Iphone eight, you know, with the battery's pretty similar to our tiny amy, but for status seeking people, it's very important that you have the latest stuff. Like you can't be walking around with, like David tells the other day with an iphone to burst out laughing immediately. He got on. Twitter is hilarious. You know, there's nothing about a tell.

Speaker 1:          01:43:19       It is a searching for status. None. No. He's like, I was saying that. He's like a monk you that way. He is. Yeah, you're right. He's smart. He's very smart, brilliant guy. He knows. He knows what's healthy for them and what's not. So other than the cigarettes. Yeah. He put all his other stuff. He stopped drinking and didn't know. He cleaned himself up really well and the cigarettes and the only vice. He has cigarettes and coffee. He was saying that's his vice. He's a. he's a poet amongst us. Like he's. He's somebody that he's special. He really. And he's a really good

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       guy. Yeah. Now he's so kind. He's so kind of just being around his orbit. I love New York. I love the two of them together. Yeah. No, it's really. It's so funny. I never would have seen that coming when I was, when we were all young in New York. I know, right. I never would have saw those two. Yeah, right. Doing it. I don't know what. Not for any real reason, but it just never saw them intersecting. I never would've saw any of us doing something like that. Yeah. You doing live shows together. Great idea. It is a great idea. Like some of those shows. You see those pictures for the comedy cellar? Yeah, like 1:00 in the morning. Like Dave Chappelle's onstage with Chris Rock and fucking around, you know, there's always like three guys on stage. That's crazy. I know. Never, I never understand that either. But being around it's hell.

Speaker 3:          01:44:38       Like watching him all through the years. He would always surprise you like when someone's father died or something, have a towel. Was always front and center, like helping out, giving people money. Like there's this kindness to them gentlemen. Con Guy. Yeah. And another force of good real force of good. And a guy who uh, like comics should really appreciate, like if you're a fan of the art form, like David tells really someone to appreciate it because was always creative. It's, it's like it's never do she always skanks for the memories as one of my all time favorite. That shit is hilarious. That is so funny. Is a hilarious cd man. I think he did that in Denver, you know? Yeah. He did that at the comedy works. Oh yeah. Wendy's put. Oh, very cool. Yeah, that's very cool. Yeah. That fucking in Denver, that CDs brilliant.

Speaker 3:          01:45:31       Yeah. He's amazing. He's so good. Yeah. I mean to answer what you're saying. Yeah, your face here and it's so silly. I think that was when he was doing insomnia too, right? Yeah. That was the partying days. Yeah. He says he's just such a smart guy. Like he just decided one point, hey, this is fucking me up. No more drinking to no more drinking, no more show. You're not going to do this thing. That's attracting negativity to my shows and setting me up as a guy. It's going. Drank himself into oblivion. Know he was smart. He pulled the uh, pull the cord. Yeah, those, those. You're, you're the party guy. You're the life of the party guy. It's hard to sit back down. Yeah. What the fuck? What's Zen game? Or it talked to Ron White. He's, he's doing it with us and Ron White on white.

Speaker 3:          01:46:24       Stop faking. I'll tell you exactly what Ron White's doing. He's riding a fucking boat. Riding into the rock is. He doesn't give a fuck and he's doing it with a Tequila company. Cheers. Happy holidays. Cheers. My friend, I set up my train under my tree. Knew what does it numero won is that is a Tequila company. I just said I set my train up under my tree and you still chose onto Keelan. Did you have photos or videos of this train on your tree? I think I didn't put anything on the instagram. Probably wouldn't be real if it wasn't. It's hard stuff in your life. My kids are getting older. There's like 16 and 13 and they were at school and I'm setting up the village under the tree and the train tracks and all the people like shopping around the village and that was doing it on my own because they don't have time to really do it and I was like, this is how people become the guy in the neighborhood is like bringing your children around. Look at my train set because your family leaves and you're like, are there any children around? They want to look at my train set. I could totally see myself doing that at some point. Totally. Well there's those dudes that they go wall close encounters of the third kind make that giant one in the middle of the living room.

Speaker 3:          01:47:44       You're funny reference. Yeah, because they had the plywood number, horse, like the extra in the middle of his house. His wife divorced him. Yeah. That guy. Yeah. You make a train around that. It's not that far from that. I can't remember his name. Richard Dreyfus course. Jesus Christ. Richard Dreyfus. A great movie. Well, Daca, he's been great in so many things. Always. The unassuming guy. Jaws. Yeah, man, he was. He was Spielberg's alter ego. Really be so good. Yeah. He's so good in everything. He looks so young. There was man, man. Oh Man. What a fucking movie this was because I wanted to believe so bad. Oh yeah. I so wanted to believe they got me. Hey, did you talk about that Berg? Did you talk about that alien craft that came into her? What happened to our galaxy? It did very well with the Hawaiian name. Oh, so it's over. You didn't hear about that one. The one that looks like a joint. Yeah, because we're a big piece of poop that a big duty copter. It's just a weird rock. I think now they said that, uh, some like legit people said that it changed speed and went in different directions. People, legit people. Scientists. Oh, them guys said that it was a, it could be something. Could be. What does Neil Degrassi say about it? He's not talking right now.

Speaker 3:          01:49:15       I'm a little bit of a kerfuffle. Kerfuffle. What's his gym? Harvard scientists say aliens. Makes Bizarre. Interstellar object. Yeah. I saw that. And then I saw someone refuting scientists. Harvard. No one wants to believe more than me, bro. Come on Joe. It's real. Well, if I was going to mask my spaceship to fly through the galaxy, I would definitely make it look like a big rock. Big Asteroid. Right? Why wouldn't you driving through space? May. Maybe what they were like, look, if we just make this thing

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       drive by them and don't change speeds, they'll have no idea. Just destroyed. There'll be psyched that we missed them. Okay. Good call. Good call. Someone just hits the gas. I'm tired. I don't want to fucking taking too long. You got the fucking cops are behind. Is Dave Shit. Goddammit. Dave. You're not supposed to. Just take all told you 65. Fuck, let's start throwing this weed out the window. Why would it be so hard to believe a space rock traveling through space? That would be the move, right? I mean, if they're so advanced they can travel through galaxies. They can make this shit look like anything they want it to. Why wouldn't you doll it up? Radiation pressure. The only thing celebrating floors would be. Well, there's no air and space, right? So it wouldn't be aerodynamics. What would it be? Momentum.

Speaker 2:          01:50:38       No, go down a little bit. I think it answers your question. If radiation pressure is the accelerating forest, then own moma represents a new class of thin interstellar material. Whoa. It has a different thing that it's using for energy. But as to what may have produced this previously unseen material, it could have emerged naturally from the debris of the planet forming disc in a distant solar system going through yet an unknown process. They've got a whole nother way to make. We went from Toyota Corollas to this thing.

Speaker 1:          01:51:12       Imagine if that's what we find. The only thing though, that's what it does. The, um, the, like a rock a rock is not smooth, but it doesn't necessarily need this where I'm stupid. This is one of many places where I'm stupid, but it doesn't necessarily need to be aerodynamic. Right, because it's not going through air. The vacuum of space. Right? Exactly. So I'm not wrong there. It could actually look like a rock. It comes. The only issue would be getting it into space. Right? The aerodynamics. Assuming that you shooting it from a planet with an atmosphere. Again, gravity not be talking about this way too stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:51:47       If you shot, if you're launching it from Earth into space, right? Yeah. What if you had it encased in like this outer area? Sort of like the space shuttle is, but then once you get to a place you could jettison the outside of it just like they get rid of those booster rockets, they just fall into the bucket, integrate land on people, whether fishing. That has to happen. Right. Getting killed by a booster rocket flat space that you in the face. I didn't integrate, but then they could do that. They could release the shell and then they would just have the rock and the rock would move through space and it didn't matter what shape it was because it's in the vacuum

Speaker 2:          01:52:27       or just get it up into orbit, orbit the space station. Go and build it in pieces and then launch it for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:52:34       Do you remember when that commander, Chris Hadfield gentleman was on the podcast and he was talking about some kind of magnet that they have that collects subatomic

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       out there in the galaxy and that we only know five percent of what the universe is made out of. Oh my God. Talking about things like dark matter and he was five percent. It's the guys scientists space, a real legit astronaut coming back from six months in space or whatever the fuck he was there for and telling us this. Really, wow what we've talked about that like you can hang with those guys for a little while and then you're like, I don't understand what's happening now. It's also the. I mean, it's amazing what we do know, amazing that they can send a guy to space and have them fly around the ISS or. Yeah, I mean we'll talk about what you were saying about why are we here and what are we doing like we haven't developed yet. Something that you can go the speed of light we haven't, but if we do then the whole universe is open to us.

Speaker 4:          01:53:36       Maybe that's what it is. Maybe the struggle of developing all this stuff is to get to a scientific level where we can really go. I don't think they think the speed of light is even good enough. Really? Yeah. I think, dammit, that was my goal. I think that like if you wanted to have options available as to what planet you're gonna colonize, you gotta have to. Who knows what? If you land on a planet, what did he land on a planet and it's like, Hey, it's 74 degrees out guys. Guys, it's all oxygen and nitrogen. It's just like earth. Come on out here. Come on out here. But it's only been like that for 10 years and then cycle is really fucked up like 30 years from now. It's going to be a nice age. It will be for all the people have moved there and they're going to freeze to death is going to be no food at all.

Speaker 4:          01:54:21       Planet doesn't give a fuck. Like that's all our science led us to that I don't even know if we can predict. Here's my question. Can they accurately predict the atmosphere and the conditions and what the temperature would be if a planet is from a son, like did they have a calculation where they say, oh this sun is this amount of big and this planet is this far away. So it's definitely going to stay within a certain temperature range for the entire time that the planet. Did they know that like within like a death range? I think they must. Death range is 40 degrees bro. Yeah. You get to 140. That's a wrap. Yeah. You're done. Yeah. So like $100. One hundred 40. Everyone's dead, right? You live in a sauna, you're going to run out of water. I just don't think we're going to make it.

Speaker 4:          01:55:06       We're not, we're definitely not figuring it out because we're saying this amount of big, we're not even helping. We're confusing the pro, but seriously think about that just as a concept. Like maybe that is it. Maybe it's baby all this like you keep thinking, you know, you talked a lot about all the robots and the things that are moving us forward, but why? But why? But why? And I had the cocoon theory before, but maybe that's not it. Maybe it's so we can really go. Yeah. I've had the cocoon theory for quite a while where I think that we are like some sort of an electronic caterpillar that's building some cocoon

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       and then a butterfly is going to emerge because when, when as a collective like will all be part of this. I mean just the innovation and the computers and the Ai and our integration with them that eventually it's just going to get smarter and crazier and weirder. I mean it's only a matter of time before they make something that resembles a person. It sounds to a insular. No, it sounds too insular that it would just be for us to stay here on earth. The universe is so vast that there may. I think it's more likely that we're going to go out of this. That's a very good idea. This is the sense. It's kind of a sewer. Oh, but is it though? It's amazing. Well, it's beautiful. There's parts that. Come on, man. We have a lovely life. You ever been to Utah to skip or you look at the stars or look at the beautiful, beautiful clouds in the sky on a day like today.

Speaker 1:          01:56:38       Oh my lovely. You go outside. This clouds float around, just gives you a just right amount of sun. A little bit of contrast is the best. Lovely. Like why would, how could you say this is a sewer? Because so many parts that are disgusting. There's so many parts, not, not, not so many parts because we still have this evil, this other stuff that's clog at each other and knocking each other and it's still filled with. Right, but a murder. Not right here. Not right here. It's only in certain spots. So this is the other thing that we tend to do because we have 7 billion people on the planet and cameras on all of them. Yeah. And everybody's got a camera and we're exchanging these stories. You're catching stories from an an unimaginable number of humans. Right? And so even if we're looking at just our country, there's so many people just to La.

Speaker 1:          01:57:30       So many people. It's $20, million people. It's insane. What's really amazing that's really amazing is not just how far human beings have come over the last hundred, 200, 300 years. But what's really amazing is if you just look at the actual numbers of times that people interact with each other, how few of them are violent. Yeah. Especially in a place like America in 2018. I think about that on the freeway. All so many people because it just. You're right. And they're all pretty much acting in an orderly fashion to preserve themselves and others. Yeah. Yeah. You ever, every now and then you have someone that's just crazy, just violates all the rules. Just weaving in traffic drive at 150 miles an hour in a residential community. Maybe it's just a mutation. Maybe that's just a mutation, you know, I think it is. I think it is in the same way those things exists in like a biological system, right?

Speaker 1:          01:58:25       You can get these little diseases, a little bugs. It's little things that are off, you know, and then you have an immune system. The battles, the bugs. Yeah. Like when you see stuff about chimpanzees are and there's like everyone's getting along trying to do their thing, their struggles, but then there's a real mutation. Like there's someone that, there's one that kills the rest of them and won't be part of the thing, you know, that's what we have. We have these kind of like renegade mutations run by evil swipe. We should all go back to what's interesting is done in large groups, right? And all of us together, like the way we interact with each other is generally nonviolent. Whoever these large groups will decide by whatever, you know, whoever's in charge to attack other large groups. And this is where the big death comes from, right?

Speaker 1:          01:59:16       This is where the real toll comes from in war. Right? So, but if you looked at the actual communities of people from one side or the other, like the groups themselves together, how much are they really in conflict with those other people? Probably not nearly as much as the people that are in charge would want them to be, which. Right. Which is that. It's almost like the mutation is in charge because you take two groups that are at war and you put them together. They're just hanging out drinking beer together. We're all the same age. There was probably have a great time together. They're leaders. Talk them into leaders or the mutation. That's when things get scary. Whether it's the Hitler leader or you know, North Korea do whatever the Russians do, dating places. They're talking people into invading places.

Speaker 1:          02:00:03       That's some slip. Every justification. Yeah. No, that's where the world gets very strange. And I think it's interesting that those people in those groups, you know, all come from all over the world or all over the country list all these different place in, they're brought together. Right? But look how we've progressed. There's fewer of those kinds of conflicts now than ever before. Right. But you and I, and I think a lot of other people would like it to be zero amount, right? Yeah. But Donald, I don't know if that's ever gonna happen, man. That's a weird thing to say because you would, would like everybody to be in a good place in this world, but you'll, I almost wonder if like many things, it's just like this push of good things happening in band things positive and negative, and that this battle between the two of them is what creates all this momentum and all this movement.

Speaker 1:          02:00:48       That's the good and evil. We're back to the good and evil. So maybe we should go back to church. Look, the priests did some weird stuff, but maybe we. It's good people in there more than evil people. Well, the problem is with that church in particular, they're still shielding the people that have done terrible things. Yeah. Yeah. There's just no denying that there's. If you look at the facts, if you look at everything that's come out, there's no denying that. That's super unfortunate because I think the vast majority of the people that are involved in the religion that aren't the people that are pedophiles, I think they're very good people that probably think about it the same way. Maybe your daughter would like to think about it, that some place where people can get together and they exchange affection and comradery and uh, and this acceptance of something higher than them that holds them to a certain standard and wants to be good people. And that's for everybody.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       Good for everybody. But if it wasn't for all that kid fucking oh, that kid fucking just ruined all that. It just. Yeah, it really is. It's such a sad, sad thing. Google this, because I've said this many times and I've never bothered looking at it up there. The reason why we can get another bottle that if you want to get fucked up the holidays. Okay, so holidays, um, shit, lot of sediment in that. What were we just talking about? Good and evil and the priests and the why they're ruining your own use to go get that video. Look. Something up. You haven't looked before. Reason why. Oh, that's it. Thank you. Thought that was gone forever. I voted the reason why they forced priest to be celibate because what I had heard. Oh, was it? This is not no scholarly work of my own. I don't remember even reading the article.

Speaker 3:          02:02:35       I think somebody told it to me that priests were banging too many chips. Bravo. He might've said it in that way. Too many chicks, man. They made a mess out of it. Which I think. I don't think that was it. What do you think it is? I think it was property. I think that when priests, priests owned property and if they were married and he died, she would keep the property. If there was no woman involved and he owned the property and he couldn't be with a woman and he swore that he was just with Jesus when he died, the property went to the church. Yeah. Yeah. That's, you know, which is not much of. I mean, that's crazy. It's wow. That whole other part of Catholicism is the other thing that bumps me all the time. When you go to the Vatican, it's like, wow, this is beautiful, but what were they?

Speaker 3:          02:03:26       Get all this art. Where'd they get all these bills? The pillaging of fuck of religions where the shit stolen from a time where people are starving in the streets. I know this is how powerful religion is. This is how powerful this pull is to search for good and to be a part of something is in light of those things that you see the wealth. It's like going into like a pirate ship and seeing all the shit that they got and then knowing what they do with these children, both those things are. You should just say, fuck this. I'm not going to be. I'm not going to be a part of this at all, but the, the, the other part of it is so strong that you actually will kind of say, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I'm still going to go to mass on Sunday. I think, you know, what that means is you think that even if a priest is bad, that the religion is still good. You know, the, the, the, the idea is that this is like a bad guy who lost his way. That's sort of human beings that are flawed. Got a lot of them are drunk two men who read my grandma's. Oh, my grandma's eulogy. No, her name was Josephine. He kept calling her Geraldine. No,

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       they had to correct them. It's Josephine, like he was. He was saying all these great things about her. He didn't know who he was and he had those Jim Blossoms. Oh, Jamie brought it into the bottle of wine. Oh, Mike savage, savage, Jamie, Jamie. But, uh, the, I think, you know, you take a guy and you put them in that position where he can't have a companion. Like you're not allowed to have a love. He can't have a wife or a husband or whatever. You can't have that. You're not allowable thing fighting nature. There was a kid that I went to high school with that, uh, became a priest. We all knew. We all knew like it was. It was like a thing you knew like, oh, this is why it's going to be a priest. We get it. Right. Well, that's what a lot of people say.

Speaker 1:          02:05:18       It's like that the church, the other side of the church doesn't create pedophiles that like the institution attracts them because they know they'll be safe there. Well, it's possible, but it's also possible that so many of them that are active in the church, and I don't know what this guy's story was, I barely knew him, but that he could have been molested. I mean is not. It's not a small number of kids that were molested to very large, large, and you would never mean who the fuck understands what that would be like to be a young boy to have that happen to you and then get groomed and indoctrinated into being a part of this thing that does that other young boys in the future. So your whole reality, which has to be with some of them are, and they're all doing this under the blanket of this thing called the church.

Speaker 1:          02:06:03       Then when the church finds out about it, the church moves people to all these different various places and they, they get these new victims and this happens over and over and over again. You know, this was one of the things that they were saying about benedict about. I'm the one who before. Cool. Yeah. He had actively done that. He adapted. He was stolen people. Yeah. It was a part of that. So bad, so bad, and it's such a shame. It was married Catholic priests there. Perhaps 120 in the US already. Here's how well it was this a new thing. The other article I found that there's about 200. Wow. As of 1980, there was a rule change or an adoption of a rule change that allowed it. Why does it say, does it say eastern only? Is that what it's saying? Was something in the story of the video that was going to just kind of pause it there. Why is he eastern Catholic like East Coast, east coast, west coast? Not, but Mexicans are not by the Catholic homes. Bullshit. Brooklyn married in the house. Huh? One hundred and 20 Catholic priest married in the United States. Wow. That would be great to policy change by Pope John Paul the second in 1980, which offered a path for married Episcopal priest to continue their ministry after converting to Catholicism. Oh, so you have to be a priest already. Episcopalian, and then you're allowed to have a wife and kids if you're Episcopalian,

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       right? Yeah, for sure. A convert to Catholicism right there. Like Cat Catholicism is the only one that doesn't allow them to have sex. Right? Yeah. It's the only one with this littered with kid fucking right. I mean, coming up, cut the shit we were at, we are actually at mass and he was talking about there was one thing from the gospel that was talking about being married, being with a woman, and then he finishes his answer. Cheers. Happy holiday. He finishes the, uh, he finishes the, a sermon and then the reading, then he goes into a sermon all about being with a woman and this is a man that doesn't come close to that. This is a man that has no experience. It would be so much better for the church if he wasn't married man with children. And then he could really talk about being in a family like, who are you?

Speaker 3:          02:08:27       You know, nothing about what we're dealing with on a daily basis. Yeah. I never went to the Catholic Church when I was an adult, but I would be curious to be there to be a husband and wife sitting there in this fucking church. Listen to this dude who is supposed to be celibate drone on about how you should live your life and what kind of relationship you should have already pitched. You're dressed like a fucking jeanie did advice to giant scarf on like a wizard son as his posture is. What are you doing? What's that thing on your shoulders for white dress like that on silk. You have underwear on. It's really weird that we let people dress like that because yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:09:06       like if you didn't. If he just stood up there and had to be held accountable. If the volume of his words were all he had, like if you just made all priests and I mean all preached across all religions. If they all had to stand on a flat regular stage with nothing behind them and they had a dress like a, like a regular person like you're addressing right now and no point. He had no pointy hat. No, no fucking giant insane artwork behind you too. Confusing up pedestal. All that stuff fucks people up. You go there and you see the like you've been around, right? Yeah. St Peter's Basilica. See that? Yeah. When you go in there, I mean you almost can't believe that your eyes are working. Correct? Right, exactly. You're almost like, this can't be something that someone actually made. Yeah. This is insane. With no machines, just their hands and thousands of people like that that if you're in that thing, you're going to be so humbled and so they're going to get away with a lot more shit than if you were in some weird conference room.

Speaker 3:          02:10:13       Tiny little, little bullshit ass cups of coffee. You know how you get a coffee machine and they have little tiny bullshit ass cops, White Styrofoam Cups, a handle on it. The paper handle, the folds out and you're dressing Joseph a bank once in the handle. It not that bad because they have to be a certain size to have a handle. It's the that are. They're little

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       white ones. A little white styrofoam ones. Those are bullshit. Yeah, but they were putting the plastic, the little triangle, and nobody's going to buy your fucking connection during that place. You have to. You have to sell it. You're not. They're not just going to buy it. If I allowed to dress like a wizard and you stand up and I'm a golden podium with a giant, huge sculpture of Jesus nailed to a cross behind you and there's organ music playing, you know that's it's. That's your act. That's a good act. That's an act that's going to look at that. You know what, man, they should make that shit illegal the same way they made advertising booze illegal, but you know what? Look at how pretty that is though. It's gorgeous. So pretty. Wouldn't be a better Christmas mass or some bunch of belly dancers up there and do this plan. Bongo drums and people passing around joint. Just a big ole cannabis infused loving when that'd be better than this bullshit. Well, these are all just grown adults and we can get all those grown adults just passing out. We'd singing songs together. Well, what was it in New York was at the limelight? It wasn't church that turned into a club.

Speaker 4:          02:11:48       People in the church singing together with that. Come on, man. That's possible too. But you know what? Those people that are in those pews that looked like a thousand people, right? That's a big crowd. Those people that are sitting there, they are kind of high. They're checking their watch right now and go, when does enough of this guy drone? And he's glad as sees fucking drunk. Yeah. Where they go asking this for money again. Those gin blossoms all over the face. He looks like WC fields. Fucking guys just getting drunk. Shit. Put Shit in the basket. Now they're coming out twice with the basket. Screw this guy here. You stop it. God is going to hear you kind of going for his doctor's appointment tonight. What if God's can I hear you? But as the value of them having a place to go on that Sunday, even though they hate it.

Speaker 4:          02:12:36       Important. The limelight is a gym. Now you have the limelight. Was a fishbone at the line. Hold on. So the limelight does the dance club? Yes. Is now a fitness. It was a church. I can't tell what it was a market too. It was a church. It was a rock club, so it doesn't last. They started selling shit and sell that shit. Imagine that. It's your house, Tom. Papa. It's that would inspire you to get your party rolling. Live in a church. It's the gym now. Do. I would work out and that church all day. That would be my spot. Even if I had a gym at my house, I would definitely go to that gym just to feel the juice. Like I tell people, I say I tell people all the time, she always like, I like working out like at my studio, but I like going to places too because when you go to a place like there's a certain amount of juice, you know you're in a new spot.

Speaker 4:          02:13:28       People around you that you don't know. Yeah, you're right. We're out and it's also as a comic, I think social interaction is one of the least respected ingredients to our weird sort of a stew of things that come together and make a bit. You got to fill the well with, with those experiences. Yeah. You got to talk to people. It's like reading or just being out in the world. It's important. Yeah, it's, it, it just all like all those things, like reading is one thing you needed to, but I think like interacting with people, it's just too goddamn gigantic. So important.

Speaker 2:          02:14:00       I do this. I am the, I do a monologue each week. I'm out in America on live from here, which is the new prairie home companion. And Are you allowed to say that? Yeah. Yeah, it's the new. It's the new prairie home. Did anybody else call you that or did you decide to call yourself that? What? The new prairie home companion it is that it was prairie home. So you're actually doing this thing. When I first got hired, it was prairie hall and then they changed it when garrison keillor got in trouble. You got an unannounced called live from here. He had a couple. I was confused. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And uh, and uh, I do a monologue each. We call the out and America long. Have you been doing this about a year? And don't tell me a, it's an NPR. I figured you would know. I figured all things considered gross.

Speaker 2:          02:14:46       I follow all the shit you do. A, I didn't know how you follow the Shit I do and I'm like, yeah, it's weird, but my point is I do this model called out in America and it's me, it's me, it's me glasses shining a light on all the good people in America. Right? And I do it every week on NPR. Wear that suit like you own it, but the reason I bring it up is not to plug it, but to say it made me when I'm out on the road talking to people, I would get in the car and throw my, my headphones on. I wouldn't talk to people on flights. I didn't talk to the person driving. Stay in my room, do my shit as a comic, just go and you kind of. You're isolated and because I have to write this monologue each week, I need inspiration. I really want to shine a light on the good people out in the country. I started talking to everyone. I don't take my headphones out. I talked to the driver, I talked to the people next to me if they want to talk, and it is talking about filling the well for your comedic, you know, toolbox. It's the greatest thing in the world. There's billions of people. They all are unique. They all have a story to tell. It's foolish. Let's be as a comedian, not to talk to these. Be Harsh here, but not all

Speaker 4:          02:16:00       have a story to tell. Some of them, they might have a story to tell, but you don't want to hear it. Well, some are bad, some are disgusting. Fucking story has a story. Got a deal that you're going to get a lot of stories. They're going to be coming your way. They do though. I mean honestly, even like the biggest slug, you'll find.

Speaker 2:          02:16:20       You talked to them about their family, about their childhood, about where they're growing, grew up with. There is a story there.

Speaker 4:          02:16:26       Here's his way to look at it. You take the biggest loser that ever existed on planet earth and if you discovered him on Mars, it's the biggest store in human history. Holy Cow. This true. Some guy wearing a doggy mass jerking off with a bathrobe on on Mars. It would be like the most important thing that's ever happened. It's on the CNN fuck out. They'd be like, this can't be real closer. I show you I'm real old man with donkey ass beaten off. Right? But if you found an old man with a donkey mask beaten off in Venice, I'm still impressed. I'm still shocked. Like if I said Tom Papa, get your life savings. Do you say yes or no? There is currently a man with a donkey mask on wearing a bathrobe jerking off in Venice. Yeah. You might. You might want to lean. Yes, you might.

Speaker 4:          02:17:28       If they're bringing it to you, I'd be super suspicious. They'll be like, that's your question. Favorite. Not An underdog on that. My question. My question is, do you think that it ever happened? Oh yes. Everything you can think of is that confident that someone has jerked off with a donkey mask on 100 percent. Like a hotel bathrobe. Especially in Venice. It's all about masks. In Venice, I'm 100 percent confident that I can say historically, yes. Everything you can think of as having a speech, not Venice, Italy. Right. Venice beach. Right, right, right, right. No Venice. Oh, Venice, Italy with all the bright. With all the Catholic stuff. Yeah. And Post the water. Get nine people panic. Um, can I ask you guys a question? Sure. Uh, backed away at the beginning of the podcast when I was talking about wine and trying to learn about it and stuff. The one thing I don't know about wine is when I do drink it. I never feel that drunk. And we've had a bottle and a half now. Do I seem drunk? Yeah, you seem pretty fucked up. Don't tell me anything you don't want to tell me.

Speaker 4:          02:18:32       Do I seem that different from before? I mean you were also fucked up too, but. No, you seem fun. Yeah. Yeah. Because I always get home and I'm like, I have to say I was kept my shit together pretty good. And then I wake up the next morning, I'm like, Nah, I was, I shouldn't have done that. Well, sometimes you'll hear yourself like on a podcast if you get really lit. Like when we did that, a sober October podcast, I saw one of the clips realized that truck. We were words. I saw the clip. I was like, oh my God. We were blasted. We're in orbit. Oh really? Oh, I was listening to myself talk. You're so hammered. It's so stupid because I want to be like a gentleman that can drink and alcohol and be like, sir, if that is your goal, you have achieved it. Cheers. Cheers. Happy holidays. He was certainly a. because you don't seem and you did more than I did.

Speaker 4:          02:19:20       And you see them exactly the same as when we started. Um, I think you're projecting. There was one point when after you smoked a lot, you were going to need. That's what I did more than you. I can tell it was a bit of a body high. Well, that weight is strong as fuck. I think there's benefit to it. I don't think there's like, I don't think you should do everything all the time, but I think there's benefit. I don't think you should exercise all the time either. I'll tell you this. When I was flying back from New York yesterday and knew he had this when I was on the flight, I was thinking it would be so nice to bring a bottle of wine, just chill with the guys and this. That would be so happy. And now that we're in that moment. Yes. So happy.

Speaker 4:          02:19:59       So happy. It's a good place. I'm worried about Jamie's hips, Jamie's hips, so bugging, you know that. So the soul right actually helped a lot. Really slant on it and breathe in and yeah. You know, I have not used that yet. I bought two of them. I bought one for the House and one for the gym, but that it's a, it's called a so right for your so ass muscle. So you lay on it and have it like massage your inner gut area and works well. Apparently that's like a muscle that gets knotted up on people and I had, I definitely got it get knotted up on me when I was a. I was running a little too often, was running like four or five days a week. It was starting to not up. That's it. It's like a foam roller, but like if you could have an elbow on that phone and you lay on it on your back, but a couple of different spots too.

Speaker 4:          02:20:51       They have like a spot in your shoulders in the front. But yeah. I don't know. Whatever. My pelvis area. Yeah, that looks nice but it helped. Right? You feel good? That looks good. Yeah, you got to. It's weird. The human bodies all manipulatable malleable. That's why yoga is so good. Oh yeah. Stretching in general like all that shit. So good. But it's just so weird how like deep tissue massage and all that stuff works and how your body's like pliable stuff loose. It's weird. Some things up and someone is really good at it. If you get a Gao and knows how to use them. Elbows and you needed a man fuck you up. Uhm, I started running with my dog, with my lab. Yeah. And uh, but I run on the road and the sidewalk is um. Do you feel like, uh, I feel so guilty sometimes that it's got a little paws out just running on the road.

Speaker 4:          02:21:42       I'm like, is it hot? You worried about like the hurt. I know it's the hardness of it. Which streets? Maybe. I never thought. It doesn't seem unhappy. She seems like she's having a blast, but. Well it's definitely not as good as running the dirt. Right? No, I mean probably for us either. No, it's definitely not. Yeah, it's definitely not. It's weird. You know, there's not as much give and whenever I see people running in the cities, I go, I get it. You want to exercise? You decided to make this whole world your gym. That's a weird thing. I saw her the other day. He was crossing Wilshire. It's just no shirt on. Tee Shirt. Air Buds. Just one of them. One of those dudes is doing this at the fucking taking his pulse and he just runs across. As soon as the light turns green, he just using the street.

Speaker 4:          02:22:30       This was like 4:30 in the afternoon rush hour and he's using this place as his gym. Amen. That's why I like robbing though. That's why I like running because as soon as you go out, you're doing it and the other nice body to. We wanted to let bitches know he did. He was slim and fit. I don't get the. That's what it was about. Probably more than any of the. Totally through Wilshire Peacock move. Yeah. No shirt on and just run around. Do you do yoga with your shirt off or on? Off? Off with all the gals there. They don't give a fuck. Do their suffering. Everyone's suffering. Yeah. I always keep my shirt on because I always feel like as a man, I'm not supposed to be there, so it should just make it less as a man. You're not supposed to be there. Even after you the remarks you heard by [inaudible]. I'm confused.

Speaker 4:          02:23:20       Well, if a man is supposed to be there. All right everybody. Look, it's just too fucking hot. It's too hot. You don't want to have a shirt on. Know that wet fucking hot thing. Smothering you want to work from. I do the regular. I don't do the hot hot one. I want to see you in a jog prop, bro. Why can't a wear something that just like like a like covers this nigga sweat band for your tits? Tits, tits. I mean, I'm not saying I want a bra. You sound okay for a guy to wear a bracelet. Will kind is some bracelets, but it's okay for you to wear with them. Tennis risk things. Yeah. It was like, like a real band. Yeah. Those headbands for your risks, those risks, those ones red, white and blue. Remember those in your head? I thought I was the coolest fucking dude on earth.

Speaker 4:          02:24:17       I had a those wristbands with red, white and blue on them. Like that's right. Tube socks pulled up to the knee all the way up. Yeah. What were those things called? What'd you call the bands? Like tennis wristbands? Yeah, the headband and the wristband and they probably had a headband to. I had A. I had one that was pretty bad ass. You know what was a big. It wasn't too though. You just go the one. You just go on the left. That was the cool move. There was a time. I don't remember what the time was, but there was a time when. That's it right there. Sock towered over two pieces. Large son. We're going to or those as soon as you. I'm going to work next time. Tom. Papa. I do a podcast somewhere. Then red, white and blue wristbands. Kids. That'd be awesome. I literally had that fresh, very fresh. Felt cool. Yeah. Cool. Don't. Aren't those popularity?

Speaker 4:          02:25:13       I was going to say something. A wristband. Oh God damn it. Son of a whore. Marijuana combination of it being allowed to wear him a for a guy working out. Sweat boobs. Thrown a lot of information. Why is it okay for a man to walk around with no shirt on and women can't? Was that what you're going to say? Well, there's. That's obvious. We women because it. There'll be a template. They definitely can, but I've talked about this before. I think I said I would just. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend will be like, don't go out there. Ted saying, if a friend tried to ask me if they think that they should exercise that right to freedom and be like, well, I don't want to get harassed. You don't want to get harassed like I w would you wear like Bikini underwear? Walked through a gay neighborhood on Saturday night at 10:30 PM. When the ecstasy just kicked in to dad. You're a piece of meat to how good do you think you'd feel walking through like a super duper gay neighborhood with like little bikini briefs on sandbars Santa and for whatever reason, you obviously shave your chest. It's funny. Maybe your chest is smooth as baby but. But your back has hair on it. It's funny because you're setting it up as a predatory kind of scenario, but all I'm thinking is would they think I was okay with like, would they like me?

Speaker 4:          02:26:42       Would you be pumped? Her disgusted? You'd know you'd be. You didn't want the hassle. That's what I tell my. Yeah. I mean, I understand that there's like a cool movement now and it's a time when women should be able to go out there and dress the way you want to dress. It's not their problem. It's the guy's problem. Let's correct the guys rather than us. Right. I love that, but there's a lot of guys that hadn't been corrected yet. Who are going to hassle you and follow you in the parking lot. Yeah, that's the problem. Those guys aren't woke once. Everyone's all. Whoa, whoa. It'll be dangerous word to use. I feel like people are going to market in the future. Woke woke. Yeah. I feel like using woke now like unironically super slippery. I see a trap coming. You do. Did you Jitsu practitioner in me is like, I don't like this move. This is a. I know where this leads.

Speaker 4:          02:27:32       Right? That's how I feel. Yeah, I see that woke thing. I'm like, what are you woke? What the fuck does that even mean? Woke up. You woke up. What do you 12? Well, it comes from my 16 year old, so yeah, it's kids today, but what is being. It means your brain is open. You're open to stuff. Your problem is. There's no real quantification. There's no real. There's no test you take to show that if you're woke. Right? Right. Like if you want to be a mathematician, you have to fucking show that you know how to do math. The professor said, check your work like you get through like, yes, congratulations Tom. Papa, you are a mathematician, phd in mathematics. It says right here on the paper. You're like, God damn it. I'm going to put that shit on my walls. You understand? I know how this stuff works.

Speaker 4:          02:28:19       Yeah, but wokeness, anybody can claim to be a master of wokeness. It's like Kung Fu without fighting. It's very dangerous. Yeah. No one's defined what's woke and what's preposterous. No one's defined what's, what's just not racist and sexist and not homophobic, but open minded and aware of the failings and the misgivings of all sides of us and with no bias. Right? Is that. Well, because it doesn't seem like it is. Isn't that woke? I don't know, I don't think. I think you just described what I thought it was. I would like that, but too many people could jump in. There's no. There's no real clear understanding of like what makes it constitutes someone being like, yeah. How many of those boxes do you have to check it? Like stopped Tom? Papa had a woke academy and you took these people. It would just been to you like bread or not like bread claiming wokeness.

Speaker 4:          02:29:09       Super slippery. What's his 62 New York Times magazine or being woke crazy. Dig It. Look, if you're woke, dig it. Oh, that's the perfect definition right there. If you're woke, you dig it. That is insane. That was my Fox man and you were copying my taste and grit. We don't jump salty on me. Whoa. Look how they talked back. Then they were trying to talk people into talking the way that made them seem more interesting. I'm going to say it the way I would say that if I lived back then hey, could make it bigger so I can see why you'd be the guy on the left. Jimmy. No, no, no. Scrolling, so we could read what they were. Six comments. What he's saying. Up Top. Yeah. Okay. That was, that was my facts man. And you were that grace and grit. So how would you say that now?

Speaker 4:          02:30:04       Um, that was my fox man cop in my tastes. And of course it's girl boy, girl. And you were saying no, that's what they said. Oh, we'll use. What words would you use today? Yeah, yeah. He would say the fuck he doing with my girlfriend dickhead. And he said, don't jump salty on me. I would say, hey, we're cool. No worries, no worries. Stop being such a bitch. It's all good. It's all good. Yeah. And then it'd be like, what? Someone's a bitch. And then next thing you know, people will be hitting each other. That's a darkened snowman with these two gentlemen to the left, it says Noah Webster. I think that might be like the webster's dictionary. A Guy Peter, Peter in the dictionary. This squirly the letters are all blurred. Right? I love that. I love that. If you're woke, you dig it. Yeah. If you're woke, you dig it.

Speaker 4:          02:31:00       That's, that sums it up, man. If you're woke, you dig it after a. how'd you find this? Jamie? Come back to that typed in. It's like know your meme. Oh Wow. So the meme of the word woke. Wow. Look at that little image though. Scroll back up. So it again. That's so strange. Like I'm bad. Shift was contemporary. Like if that was your world, like imagine if hipsters all of a sudden started wearing tails. So their jackets, they just decided this is the next level of bow ties and those tails. It wouldn't be surprising because that's all about just doing what you guys don't do. So what a weird look though. It is. It is so weird. That's a look that like, okay, so like the guy in the center, it's like those two guys, both of Gods in the center. Those guys will fly today.

Speaker 4:          02:31:50       Oh totally. The guy in the left that looks like he's dressed like he's a. That looks like me on the road, but he looks like he's an acquaintance Tarantino movie or something like he's reservoir dogs. That's totally normal. Really blend the matrix. Black suit tie, that'll door. I can go to any restaurant anywhere and no one would even bat an eye. They go, Whoa sir, can I help you? Boom, right in with the gun image guy next to him. But those two guys on the end, like, what in the fuck are they? He's got a coat with tails and those pants that are like flat across your crotch where it looks like you have no privates. Here's a good way to look at it. Imagine if you're dating a gal and a guy come over and you're like, you're really gonna. Love my dad. He's an amazing guy.

Speaker 4:          02:32:34       He's real old school and dressed like that with coat tails. Yeah, and you start feeling like you're like, you're in the movie. Get out and he's got a handlebar mustache. He's got tails. Yeah. Weird, weird pants with the going to funny shoes. You see. Get Out. Yeah. I finally watched it during sober October. Oh, you did? Fucking fantastic. Yeah, that's. But that's what you'd be thinking if that guy was dressed like that, but the daughter was going to lead you to something and you have to run for your life. But it is weird how like that suit has lasted a long time. Well this was 1960, so I'm assuming that it was mocking the style of old. So by the time 1960 rolled around, the guys in the middle where trust contemporary, but the guys at the end, they're like making fun of people the way they used to dress.

Speaker 4:          02:33:22       Yeah. Kind of in a way or at least that's what represents those people. Yeah. It just defines their time. That guy was probably around the 18 hundreds. Where were those other guys are? Do you know who those guys are? I believe Noah Webster. Webster. Webster dictionary. That's why it's got the pen and he's scratching his head. Is that guys putting out his slang? His slang is making websites. What the fuck? He's like, that's not how you really say it. So it would be like the urban dictionary, like, oh, Jamie and I sometimes get confused. We have to pull up the urban dictionary and find out what the real word of a word means. So let's pull up woke. Yeah, represented today. You know what? No disrespect. No cultural appropriation intended. The fact that it was invented actually in the sixties. It was really weird. It was just making a comeback, looking around when I typed in, like what is woke to see if there's anything and she, if you dig it, you was saying

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       were knowledgeable about your community in the world with the willingness to access and critique systems of oppression a. well that part. Exactly, yes. I mean for sure if it really is a system of oppression, but how do we decide what's the system of oppression and what is sounds like you need Jordan Peterson, weird human behavior that represents that interact with each other on a grand scale. I mean that's just, like I say, there are some legitimate systems of oppression, right? Yeah. For Real. It's like figuring out which one it is. Yeah. Before, but putting that in, that's what woke is like how do you do? How do you define what the system's like? Where does, where does the line get drawn? Right? It was the line like, why do women have certain jobs? White men have certain jobs. How much of that is because of influence? How much of that, because of their choices, how much of that is just because of natural proclivities towards certain things?

Speaker 2:          02:35:26       Well then you're talking about people that are coming after the hierarchy and if they're coming up to the hierarchy, who's to say that those people are in part of the problem? I love Jordan Peterson. The. It's just like hammers. Just. Yeah. Well then what do you want? What are you saying? Who are you? What are you buying into the hierarchy? You're loved like the exasperations in his ways. No, but it's true. It's like then this true that that woke definition was like, oh, I'm with you. This is all about being nice and kind. And then at the end it's about attacking. Right? But here's the bad crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:35:58       The thing is the end part about attacking is where it gets weird because Jordan Peterson is the guy who gets regularly attacked, misrepresented, like. Especially in terms of like that. He is somehow or another a racist because some racist like him. I've heard that argument. It's crazy. Argument doesn't make any sense. He's not a racist by any stretch of the imagination. He believes in individuals. I mean, he's more Ian Rand then it. I never say that. Right. I know her name's Ian Rand, but I always say I grind

Speaker 2:          02:36:26       really like a natural instinct to fuck it up, but it really is like. His thing is it's like the power of the individual and responsibility and doing your thing and he's. He's understanding.

Speaker 1:          02:36:37       Of course during this time, of course he's under attack, but he's also under celebration. Yeah, he's under. He's been celebrated as well as attack, but much more celebrated. It's under celebration more that he's under attack. He. It's nice to hear that viewpoint articulated in such a clear, concise way. He's a genuine sweetheart of a guy. I mean, I think if people knew him. I think part of the thing is some of his views are very powerful and polarizing to some folks who have a specific idea of how things are and what things should be and what would. What represents Transphobia, what represents sexism, and you know, these are all fascinating discussions as long as everybody's just being rational and. Yeah, and being honest about it, but yeah, it's good. It's moving, it's moving the discussion forward. It's like you should hear all sides and you should hear what he's saying is, you know, in a lot of ways is very true and very real and it's like, right, but the presentation of it in these times, it's like he's very brave because he knows that anything he says there's going to be a shitstorm in response.

Speaker 1:          02:37:44       Well, he's very brave in that respect, but it's also very brave in that he's done a tremendous amount of research on all these different subjects he was talking about and when he talks about something from a scientific perspective, he's not talking about it because it aligns with his beliefs and he will in fact highlight things that don't align with his beliefs and show that he has a hole in some of his thinking. He'll, he'll, he'll pause in midsentence and goes, well, I guess I'm wrong. Then he does. He has a hundred percent of intellectual honesty. Yeah, he's just, he's not scared to take on this system of the way people think and behave and this system works both for really progressive, open minded people that support most of the things that you and I probably support and it also. The system is also in place for people that have more stringent conservative viewpoints and we have to look at everybody.

Speaker 1:          02:38:39       Honestly, if you want to debate whether someone's opinions or one thing or the other. Yeah, absolutely. I'm with you 100 percent. The problem is when you start calling someone a racist and calling someone a racist because you think that racists like him or calling someone the sexist because you think that sexist like him or because he say's says things that you don't agree with. If you don't agree with them and you just dismissed them at this as this really shallow sexist opinion. The problem is other people got to read what you're saying. They're going to look into it and it's going to seem silly because the guy has volumes and volumes and volumes that you could read and that he has books. He has all these different lectures where he discusses these things, podcast, we're discussing these things and really complex and well thought out ways that you can't.

Speaker 1:          02:39:24       You can't say his race and what's fortunate. What's unfortunate is that he presents this stuff. We should then our responsibility is to deal with the stuff, deal with the ideas, not what does it matter who he is, how he talks, what he is and who cares, but the problem is the idea is what we should all then, oh, thank you. Take it whether you like it or not, take it and then wrestle that idea and move it for 100 percent, but we also have to be aware that there's a real problem and calling someone a monster is not a monster because then when real monsters come along, you already used that word up, right? That's this is like you have to be careful because there's real racist in the world. There's real bad people, so calling someone a bad person just because you don't agree with them, you fall into a very slippery ideological trap and a lot of times people it just to get attention.

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       They want to throw their hat into the ring. They want their, their, their, their say they want, they want to get it out, they want to make an impact. They want that love. Yeah. They want to be part of that. I want to be part of the discussion and they might have very strong beliefs that they think are correct, but I guarantee if you, if that, those strong beliefs are that Jordan is a racist, you don't know him well, there's no way you could write in. There's no way you're really familiar with a lot of the things that he says about race because he doesn't say anything racist. He talks in terms of. I mean, he, he always emphasizes individuals. The most important thing

Speaker 2:          02:40:48       that's, that Ian ran thing. It's not about that. It's, uh, it's about the person you responsible for, you doing you despite whatever comes at you because everything's always going to come at you.

Speaker 1:          02:41:00       Yeah. It's an. And it's not a denial of racism. Racism is fucking horrible. But what it is, is, is saying that we can all, we can all figure out a better way to navigate this. Then the shitty way that racists and bad people have done in the past. Right.

Speaker 2:          02:41:15       You know, it was kind of racist. I was. I wanted to put African Americans in my Christmas village. Good. And you go online and try and look up African American figurines for whatever. It's. It's not good. They haven't not yet woke. You've got there are. There are prisoners. There's prisoners. There's like worker, like there's not a lot of like just regular families. There's definitely a lot.

Speaker 1:          02:41:47       Wait a minute. White people. Okay, let's, let's get this. Let's get this before we look it up because this might be one of the untapped things. If you've got to get outraged about. Is it possible that you can buy ceramics slave?

Speaker 2:          02:42:02       Yes. You think so? Well through a store, maybe not on the Internet. Ebay for sure. Really? Yes. You know how much stuff was put out into the culture of like a Alfalfa kind of representations of kids and slave children. And how about that? There was, I mean I went through my grandmother's like keepsakes at one point, like a shoe box of stuff and she just had a postcard from her friend. It was to like black kids eating watermelons and I was like, grandma, what the hell is this? I was like, you know, 15. She's like, oh, it's just a joke. But she wasn't it. I only bring it up because that was circulated, that was being pumped out all the time in the culture. So there's definitely stuff you can get second hand on.

Speaker 1:          02:42:53       Jamie's got a big smile on his face, a lot of different slave stuff like Roman slaves, slaves that like put long as their white slaves were good there. You pay me some Roman slaves that address like there were in that girl at gladiator movie, right? Yeah, yeah. You have to fight

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       and I got some here. Okay. So this is non, it's not American. So all those slaves. So like that's isn't an interesting. Like it can't be like it's got to be like I didn't do it out. Can put them guys. None of my people made them people slaves fucked up, bro. Right. Like you have to have Middle Eastern, ancient starts getting a little squirrely. 100 BC. Oh, the rowers. But those are white people that gray, three d printed that haven't been painted. They look like Henry Fonda or up to the person who buys them, you know, to make them as accurate as they write. It looked like Henry Fonda, Kirk Douglas, they had some white ass features. So white hair, they've got white people hair, you know? I mean just put up racist dot.

Speaker 4:          02:44:00       Seems like an easy search. Just stumble across actually. Yeah, you're good. Good call. Good call. Yeah. You just don't want certain things typed in now. Exactly. You know, it's like that. Like the Alexa thing. Do you have an Alexa at home? Lex is listening right now. I know that bitch. My friend told me like, you really should. You really should take that off. And I'm like, why? I'm like, it's only when I talk. She's like, no, they listen all the time. There was another murder case and they confiscated the Alexa because they know the Alexa will have information from the last four days up to the murder. That's crazy. Yeah, that's crazy. But it still plays my music, so I'm keeping it. You don't care. You're not killing anybody, so this is. What is this a doll that you could make a slave? It says it's like say like, it's not like play, play mobile or something to push the Lego rip off. He's got lego hands chain around his neck. I'd be mad if I bought that. I thought it was a Lego. That's funny. Like even if you were a kid, your parents, like you said, I want Lego's and your parents brought you that. You're like, bitch, this is not legos. Wack ass. It's supposed to represent a pirate who was formerly a slave in historical context.

Speaker 4:          02:45:16       It's easy to write that sentence. Then to make a new lego was a former slave in a historical context on that is. What does that mean? I don't know if that means present a pirate who was a former slave in a historical context. That means he escaped. I know, but it's a weird way to put it, isn't it? Isn't that weird? It's so ridiculous. Racist Toi instructions. That's the news title. The question mark that was fucking misleading. News titles, racist toy instruction to them after the break and he made a fairly light notice how conservative they were. You know, they didn't make them super dark even they knew that was the. We could get away with that. We can make them kind of brownish. That guy looked like he had a tan. It looks like he was a, like a Spaniard. Yeah. You know, like the Nigga Montoya, you killed my father.

Speaker 4:          02:46:15       Prepare to die. Like that's what he looked like. It is. Like if he looked like a spanner on a holiday where they caught a nice tan. Are you saying even the racist toy maker was like, no, dude, don't go too dark. Yes. I'm just saying the racist toy maker was like, you know what, we just gotta we gotta play it safe. Go with, go with this color. Yeah. Go shoot for Guatemala. That's it. That's all I'm looking for. Do you go to mass on Christmas? No. No. Mass at all. I go to Willy Wonka's golden chocolate factory. Wow. It's all nonsense. Why would I do that? I'm just asking tradition because he grew up there. I. No, I never grew up that way. You did church when you were a kid? Yeah, we did, but it was for a very short amount of time to say I grew up that way.

Speaker 4:          02:46:59       It would be hard because it was. I was out by the time I was out of first grade. Oh yeah. We're talking about putting me back in for second grade, but we moved from New Jersey to San Francisco and uh, we didn't find a Catholic school on a scale of Catholic schools. Cost money to went to public school after that. But I was just done. I hated it. I was in fear of those fucking crazy people. And your parents didn't take you to church or make you go? They did a little bit. I think the idea was back then that if you had kids, you wanted kids go to Catholic school, you know, there's a lot of people that did that in that neighborhood. When I was little, it was just a normal thing you did and they were more strict and too. Dude, one thing that was for sure though, like I had a conversation with my mom bought at once.

Speaker 4:          02:47:44       She was like, you know, your grades were way better when you and you're a Catholic school. And I was like, yeah, because it was fucking terrified to get wrong. They beat the shit out of you want to live like that. They never beat me. Then I definitely threatened me. Really? Yeah. They threatened to make me sit on a nail, going to have to sit on a nail and the uh, in the closet. Stay here all night. I hope you brought your blanket. They're like really mean when you're like a little six year old kid, like, that's fucked up. It's just a weird, oh, we stuck with these people for nine months and to also for me it's like my parents were splitting up at the time, so it was very confusing and then I wanted things to have order to them, so I wanted God to make sense.

Speaker 4:          02:48:23       I remember annoying people with that, like six years old. I didn't know any people talking about what God wants. What do you mean? Like you, God says this, God wants that. Like I would say that, Oh, you would bug six years old because I was a little kid who's dealing with my parents splitting up and there didn't seem to be any order in the world and it was very nervous. Right? So when I find when I went to Catholic school, when I first got there, I was, I was happy that I was going to go to Catholic school, but then as I experienced it at six years old, I started going, this is ridiculous. This doesn't make any sense. I'm like, first of all, these people are so mean. They're, they're obviously being mean and nasty. They're not comforting. And I was seeking as a six year old comparing them to weigh like my was.

Speaker 4:          02:49:07       My mother was like, these are these ladies were nasty being so mean and I'm like, these, they don't represent God. And I was like, this is crazy. And then you could see kids getting in trouble because their parents hadn't paid for their lunch or these and there was like this really, you tell your father to get that money in. Like there was a weirdness to it that just didn't seem loving or it didn't seem like what I thought of when I thought of, you know, Christ and when I thought of it seemed to me like, oh no, this is a dark little trap. Get sucked into. So that's what's remarkable about that is not just the age but that you went from a really, really meeting it in a very real way because what was happening with your family to like normally you wouldn't turn that quickly.

Speaker 4:          02:49:53       Like within a year. It sounds like by the time I was. Yeah, it was over by the time I was out of there. Usually that change doesn't happen for 15, 20 years outside of beating me or doing something sexual to me, the, this, the mind fuck of dealing with those mean nasty ladies. Scared the shit out of me were crying. They were calling me a baby because I was crying. I was like, Whoa, just not knowing how to deal with human being when you're a six year old and this is going down and you're like, what have I done? Yeah. Like I went from always being with my mom or being with my grandma, my grandfather. I was like, everything was cool and then all the sudden you go in school and this is what you're doing in school. I didn't go to kindergarten. I went to first grade.

Speaker 4:          02:50:34       It was the first thing I went to, so all of a sudden the first grade is like instantaneously being connected to these crazy ladies. Jesus. I was like, oh no, poor. And then I would think about them. I don't think we'll kind of like thinking about why this will mean. I remember being six years old thinking this right. I'm just like, nobody probably loves them. Like they don't get. They don't have a family. You have a boyfriend. I didn't think at the time they don't have a girlfriend, but maybe they do Holla, but for sure they didn't. The whole thing was that they didn't know. They didn't have anything. No connection with another human being. What would it be? Lonelier or more angered inducing. Yeah. It was just dark. There weren't. There weren't loving people. You know any of your children. They ask about it.

Speaker 4:          02:51:19       They didn't even bring it up. We, we've talked about God and I. My. My basic take is Jordan Peterson said something really lovely. He said he behaves as if God is real. He behaves as if God exists. Interesting. Not that he believes God exists because that's sort of a. it's a bit of an intellectual trap where you say, do you believe God exists? Like, okay, define God. Then you're in the weeds. Yeah. Because do you think that. I think that there's a city in the clouds. No, I don't right now. I don't do. What do you think that there's an energy like we were talking. Is it possible that there's something bigger than all of this thing? Well, this bigger than everything. Like if you talk to an aunt and said, hey man, do you think their cities, its skyscrapers and airplanes, like, what are you fucking moron?

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       Get out of here, bitch. I'm trying to drag this dead bug around talking anyway for your fucking galaxy talk universe talk. Get the fuck out of here with your five g pitch at a time. Dragging this bug. I mean in our perspective, when we're talking about things like we're. We're so small, we're the way we interface with reality. So crude even though it's amazing.

Speaker 2:          02:52:32       Yeah, but I liked the idea of the not going into the whole intellectual discussion about God, but just like just, you know, who knows, just kind of act like he does exist. It's a great way to do it. Does make you. It does make you act a little kinder. Yeah. It's like a parent figure. It's like, okay, we're not going to do this because it's going to make them unhappy.

Speaker 1:          02:52:53       I try to do what are the, like when I'm at my best, I try to treat people as if they're me living another life. Treat. Treat people as if they're just, you know, don't think people as a bother or don't. And it's hard to do. It's hard to do, especially when you're busy or when you have your kids with you or when you're trying to get something done. It's hard to do.

Speaker 2:          02:53:14       I try and walk, walk around thinking everybody is drowning it insecurity, right? That really kind of makes me give people a pass in the biggest and smallest ways. Everybody when you see people hustling, do whenever businessman, businesswoman, looks like she's on top of her game person, like on the subway, who was obviously going someplace. They don't want to go with no money in their pocket. If you realize we're all just drowning and insecurity, it just makes you just give them a little bit of a a pass that that's been where my head's at, been at lately. That's a great place to keep your head because we all are. Everyone's balled up everyone. Even the person you admire the most is like, ah Ha. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:54:02       you know we were talking about earlier about the traps that you fall into is you're trying to achieve and do things. You're also fall into traps even when things that you love and you can get so caught up in a, you know, the things that you love that you kind of forget to keep your, you know, you're, you're, you're, you're, when you're at your best. What feeling or keep that in close range. Yeah. I feel like getting away from you because you're too tired because you're working too much because he pulled that back. Yeah, keep. Keep it at close range where you are operating at your best, but be respectful of that. Right, and I think this is something that I've been guilty of in the past. I wasn't respectful of the energy that's required to be at your best. I just figured I'll just do all these other things.

Speaker 1:          02:54:49       Yeah, but you only. I really firmly believe you only have so much bandwidth in a day and this is coming from a person who pushes their bandwidth too hard all the time. I think you only have so much in a day and when you get to a certain state, you up diminishing a lot and then I think you want up diminishing a lot of the. All the other things that you do, like if you. If you have like seven things cooking in the background on your phone, it's not going to move as fast. Allegedly actually does work that were some computers, but people do that too. You have too many things. Cooking.

Speaker 2:          02:55:20       Yeah. We all do all the time. All the time and then you take 20 minutes of transcendental meditation and take your nervous system and put it on restart to and just let it wash out. You hypnotize me Bro. This thing in hand, it's freaking me out. Let it wash out. Twenty minutes. Okay. Because we're all under that all the time. One hundred percent frazzled. No matter how hard you're pushing or just coasting. Three o'clock in the afternoon, 2:00 in the afternoon, 4:00 in the afternoon. That nervous system is shot, right? We're all the same. How do you. Twenty minutes, what do you do? Talk me through it. You take your nervous system and it's the result of it is you come out and you've rebooted the system and you can now have a good part of the second part of your day.

Speaker 1:          02:56:07       Do you have a technique used? Do you use an APP?

Speaker 2:          02:56:09       You know, I went to. I went to a transcendental meditation teacher. Oh, and in without the hippy dippy. That's the biggest part of it. It literally makes you realize just what you said. We're all just frazzled and running out of steam. At a certain point, your nervous system is shot. All that stuff that's happened just between 7:00 and 3:00, whatever would happen. You're that nervous system has been dealing with a ton of stimulus all day long. That meditation gives you a reboot and you can it. It's like a needed thing that's better than sleep that you. You're actually a yearns for. I'm telling you, since I really started dialing it in and did it in the best way I can describe it as that. It added another four hours to my day. Whoa. Yeah. How so? Because I would just be limping across the finish line. I'd be exhausted, I'd be trying to do and with motivation and I work really hard. I would push through and get to maybe two hours more of what I needed to accomplish. When you do this effortlessly without struggle, I'm able to just sell like I did between nine and 12 that day. Really? Yes. A hundred percent.

Speaker 1:          02:57:39       Do you think by using this practice your alleviating tension so you're more efficient with your energy, like what makes you?

Speaker 2:          02:57:48       That's part of it, but it really is. It really is taking this nervous system that is dealing with the outside world all the time and just giving it a real practical way to shut down flat line and then come back on the grid.

Speaker 5:          02:58:07       Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:58:11       and it it like your physical body needs a rest. Your things need to be rebooted. Your nervous system is kind of this thing that operates all the time that we're not really that conscious of. We're not really that aware of that. How hard it's working and this is a way to pay attention to it and give it a chance to regenerate. That's interesting and it's going to been doing this, you know, I meditated for like since college, just out of reading books and then probably about three years ago, uh, my friend said who always did transcendental meditation. He said, go, just see if it dials you in. It actually the stuff you are doing, the way you talk about meditating, it sounds more laborious. It sounds like you're doing too much work. Just go talk to this guy. And I did for like three, four sessions.

Speaker 2:          02:59:03       I went and talked to this guy here in la who was a transcendental meditation teacher and he just explained it, dialed me in on it. And for the last three, four years I've been just, I haven't missed a day and three or four years. Yeah, every day. Every day. Seven days, seven days, no cheat day. Cheat Day. How long? No need for me. It's the opposite of what you want from a cheat day. It's like 20 minutes. Where if you can get to in, that's the best. If you can get one in the morning and one in the afternoon, then you're like superman. Wow. But if you can get one in, I'm telling you, start to finish how long? Twenty, 20 minutes. 20. And you do this everyday. Everyday. Everyday. Maybe that makes sense man. Because a, it's the things that people remark about you is how easy going you are.

Speaker 2:          02:59:52       Like the like people have said, dude, I love and Tom Papa was on your podcast because it's so easy. Go like did you guys Gel so well together? Flow together. If you're tuned into president together, we're just, we're both, you know, you're kind of not struggling and that's what it teaches you. You just see this is a big roaring river and it lets you just kinda go underneath, catch your breath and then come back up into it. Do you feel that way when you exercise? Do you feel like when you exercise you get into like a zone and you reset your brain? For sure. I feel less. I feel less depressed when I exercise. Like if I'm in a funk and I'm like and I go for a run, I'm like, my day's different. Yeah, it's weird. It's almost like a. That funk is trying to hold on to control too. It's weird. Yeah. It's like it's tricking your brain. Yeah. Do you feel like shit. Today I was like, let me just put these God damn shoes on and go run. Yeah. You know, you feel so good, but the meditation is different. The meditation is like, the run will give me energy. I won't feel so shitty. I'm like, I'm okay. I feel good. I feel alive, whatever,

Speaker 3:          03:01:00       but the meditation in a very subtle way, five hours later when you're faced with a stressful situation, you don't feel as stressed as you normally would because it's just you're near your nervous system, which is very powerful. Has Been rebooted, is now able to go and deal with another situation. You should go see him. Okay, I'll do it. I'll give you the name of the guy. He's amazing. I mean, he's not amazing. It's not a guru. It's not the one sperm guy. It is not about him. One minute. It's not about a religion. It's not about a people drop of Mush. Sperm dot does will not give you his sperm. He's just delivering the message of this little practice, which is very. It's not hippy dippy. It's very practical. Practical and can use it. Yeah. It's, that's the best part of it. Would you, have you tried the tank before in the float tank now?

Speaker 3:          03:01:55       Would you be interested in doing it? You know, we have one here. You can use it anytime you want. I would like. I'd like to hear what your take on it is. Yeah. Especially. Yeah. Especially if you wanted to practice those techniques in there. Yeah, I think that'd be really interesting. It's crazy environment, man. That would be great. Yeah, you should do it. I'll do it. Yeah, for sure. Not Today. I'm drunk. No, but there's a, there's also, you know, there's a bunch of big places around two. There's the float lab down in Venice and they have one at Westwood and then what's the big place that's in Pasadena has the biggest one in the world and people that come in like a gym. Yeah. He sign up, go in there and float password. Got a giant. Just flew. Yeah, just float in Pasedena shoot.

Speaker 3:          03:02:35       They don't. They have like 40 fucking float tanks with some crazy shit. I don't know how many they have, but I think they use all float lab stuff too. That would be cool. What's another interesting thing? If you get the morning one in, you know how sometimes you wake up, you've slept, you went to bed at 11, right? You're up at seven, but you're exhausted because your night's sleep is restless. You've got up to pee a couple times. Who knows? You look back at your bed. It was just a disaster. You do those 20 minutes before you go about your day, just before the kids get up, just get 20 minutes in. It's like a you. It was more valuable than what you tried to accomplish in that eight hours spinning around in the sheets like especially for someone like you, right? Who's job is to create things. Yeah. Right. To put your mindset and to put into a particular place is super beneficial if you're just creating things all on time. Totally, but it's for everybody. Right? Right, right. It's literally like, yeah, we're all just human beings just struggling everyday going out, doing all this stuff and it's like you could be a single mom living in the city, taking the bus to work after dealing with your kids and go. Her nervous system is being bombarded. Yeah, 20 minutes just kind of sit in there

Speaker 2:          03:03:57       on the bus. You could do it on the bus by your with all this other. It's not a a pristine thing. It's not a hippie thing. It's not an. I was gonna say elegant, but it is kind of elegant. It's not a special thing. It really is just like a, like a controlled that in a way and it'll. It just gives you more to go on. We're all, everybody, no matter what you're creating, no matter what you're doing. We're all under assault all the time, right? Yeah. I mean not, you know, don't equate it to war, but there's like bombardments of energy and stuff that's coming after you all the time. You have to kind of tend to the system that's dealing with it

Speaker 1:          03:04:42       that I think anything that gives you a perspective reshift or reboot is great. Yeah. Anything, whether it's going for a swim in the ocean and whatever the fuck it is. Something that gives you a perspective reboot. We, we get caught in some pretty gross ruts. Perspective. Reboot is a cool way to say it. Yeah. I think um, we have these views of the world sort of we have this, um, these, these patterns that we sort of recognize and we see them, they're out there and we get locked into them and we're just visiting the same websites and seeing the same people and doing the same things every day. And sometimes you need something different. Some. Yeah. The knock you out. You need something that gets you to think about other stuff, you know, maybe it's going to a place that. This is why I travel so good.

Speaker 1:          03:05:33       I used to never get traveled when I was a kid. Yeah. That's like, what the fuck wants to travel. I like being home, but one of the, I do like being home, but one of the things about travel is it allows you to experience the feel of someone's culture in real life. Like you're walking through the streets of Cologne, Germany, like you're like, wow, this is how these people live. It's crazy. We walked through the streets of Rome. It takes you to of yourself. Yeah. It gives you this. First of all, it gives you this appreciation that there's different rules over here, but these are still people. Modern people just like you and then some of your ancestors came from here, but here they are where there's different rules. Millions of millions of them, and then they got people that are coming into them from Africa and it's like, whoa. Like this is crazy. I guess this whole thing is fascinating. This is a. and then were around, you know, Pompei and you've seen the ruins that mount vesuvius erupted, killed all these people, and you're wandering through all this stuff. Like this is fascinating. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:06:25       It's a long way from thinking about the three apps that you sit on your phone every day and get your news and get your thing and check your instagram and facebook. That's a whole nother whole nother mindblower Oh my God. It's a whole universe of other stuff to think about. That's why I love walking in New York, like you have your routines of like where you're walking on the other side of the street and go the other direction. You're a wild man. It's a whole nother world, but really it's just literally like when you're your run with your dog and you if you just look the other way from when you normally are like doing your thing. It's a whole nother perspective. It's a whole nother world. It's crazy, right? But literally just looking the other way, running the other direction. It's this true, but look, it's not a small thing because we liked the order we like that provides calm and safety. If you're just going that same route all the time, but then there's a limit I guess, and you end up. It starts acting negatively on your life

Speaker 1:          03:07:29       and your height. If you're just a constant vagabond traveling around the globe, that's probably not. Not Positive either, right? Yeah. Always going on. Never having a home. I love home. Yeah. I love home too.

Speaker 2:          03:07:40       I love home, which is so weird in a. In a career where we have to travel so much.

Speaker 1:          03:07:48       Yeah, but one thing that I love to say like equated to good knievel, but that there's some weird sort of balance in this life and that we do really have to experience negative things to appreciate positive things for what they really are. If everything is positive, if you're the lottery winner when you're five and you win that golden power ticket, $500 million. Jamey. When you're five years old and it's all made, then you don't have to imagine that you growing up, it ruin your life. Like, listen, little Tommy, you never have to work again. It would ruin your life. Talking about grandpa bought a lottery ticket when you were five. If you'd be so nice to give us some of that money, that would be nice. But if you have $790, million dollars, like what? GRANDPA? Yeah, GRANDPA put it in a trust and it's all yours and you can have it. Yeah, when you turn 18, but you could give us some of it now and just sign right here. Come on Bailey. Be fucked. Imagine growing up being like richie rich. Yeah, you'd be a mess. You'd be like, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          03:08:45       Be a massive, a face full of cocaine chasing this feelings that you can't get just from practical everyday work. Cute. Imagine. Remember that fucking commercial? The cartoon. Richie rich. Oh yeah. Comic books everyday. The day. Every year at the Jersey shore. I get his comic books. He always had new ones.

Speaker 1:          03:09:02       That's got to be one of the weirdest cartoons of all time. A really rich kid. Really when all the money in the world, all the poor kids would read it and go, fuck, I wish I was richie rich, man. This guy's gotta. Go Cart. It will get them seeing their Scott Bachelor's. He's got a Sunday chocolates. I want my little dear boy. Comfy while he takes a nap t and he says, oh, well thanks mom. Thanks candy. And there's a butler dressed like that. Dude with the tailcoat coincidentally, but look at it,

Speaker 2:          03:09:33       but look at it, look at the name of it. It's richie rich, the poor little rich boy, right. That's what it was. The poor little rich boy because he's.

Speaker 1:          03:09:41       Because he's not happy like he's really said, well, first of all, look at the size of his ankles. Kids got gout. He's got the gap. Check out for sure, but the dude who's got the Ice Sundae, he's the

Speaker 4:          03:09:54       same. Dressed the same as. Go back to the picture please. The dude with the ice cream Sundae is the very top. Yeah. He's wearing the same clothes that were mocking him and he's wearing the tails. The whole dot. James got the whole getup. The 18 hundreds get up. See? I used to think about a guy like that, like in the shining or something like that. Then there's some Butler and I would think of, oh, that's a proper man. That's a man that he's the guy from the shining and he's just gonna come over and be proper. But yeah, normal normal. But then as I got older I realized, oh no, no, no, that's a guy. But it's just a guy and this guy has this fucked up job. Whereas to dress like he lives in another time period and the weight on all these rich white people. Like what? In the. It's a tortured man right there. If you were a serious black rapper, like one of them guys with diamond teeth, wouldn't you get a diamond white servant? Like that guy? Yeah. That's good. Cut All white Butler's. Yes. I'll wipe Butler's just like super, super high end guys from England. Yeah. Professionals. It's true. I don't think he's a professional boxer. Hilarious. I love diamond teeth. Yeah. Little Richie. Rich. He wasn't happy. Was Cadbury Cadbury? Perfect. He had perfect butler.

Speaker 4:          03:11:21       Cadbury was his butler. Oh, perfect. Butler. Bring over that Sunday. Look at that other poor kid. He's all deformed and shit. He looks like he's evolving. Another kid looks like his grandparents were Australia. Pithy. Kiss enriched. Rich. Just like, oh, let's show you what it's like to be rich, rich, rich, rich, rich. I never had these neanderthal looking fella. I never sat at a table before. Blow that picture. That kid again out. Tell me. It doesn't look me into tall as he is. He has a monkey face. Straight up does. He does. He's got totaled neanderthal things. Lawyers are real low, isn't quite big enough, but they definitely gave him some odd features. He does look terrible. Yeah. He's got a bald patch in the back of his head. We'll see you in a bulletproof scalpel or a little guy or a little fellow. Who was his name.

Speaker 4:          03:12:12       Oh, no, fuck face. It's really rich. Cadbury and his friend. Fuck face girlfriends. He's going to get all the girls. Yeah. That is hilarious. At the bills I. So it was one of them. His mom, the lady with the blonde hairs. His mom, right? Oh, but the girl with the blonde hairs, his mom. Right? Little Auto Lot. A lot of their names are written down. Little Lotta little glow. Christ. They're all his girlfriend's little lot of get it. She's big. Get it. I'm not. I'm. I swear to God. I'm having flashbacks from every summer as a child. I'd go to this bookstore and their big comic books and I buy these little rich richie rich comic books and go home and read them. Lucky he's looking at his shadow is a dollar symbols for shadow. When did, when he's got a girlfriend, when is a bad ass rapper? Gonna.

Speaker 4:          03:13:09       Recreate this picture for the covers album. I think that would be perfect for like Gucci Mane. Richie rich. Yo. Come on and tell me that wouldn't be having them walk away cause he's. Oh, he might've already done it because it takes a lot of pictures with his lovely wife. There'll be a perfect picture for Gucci Mane and his wife honey dollar bill behind them. Hollow dollar bail. Y'all check. It's so weird. Right? What a crazy idea for a comic strip bay area rapper named Richie rich. So. Oh, there you go. Yeah. And I don't remember it being like the weren't really sending a message. Just like money isn't important. It really literally is awesome when you want to be Richie.

Speaker 4:          03:13:52       He could get ice cream whenever he wanted. It was always the thing too. They're always getting ice cream. Cadbury, the Butler frightfully fit. Oh yeah. This is a rich one. Should keep fit. I exercise a whole lot of time. Interesting. Cadbury, that's literally the lines. That's the comedy. The size of her arms. They're like Ham hocks. She just mounts you and just wrapped your head up and those arms and smothers you to death. You try to chew your way out, but you run out of air. You run on an air. Oh, interesting. Those meet flaps. Kitobah here. God battery. And if she's ever in trouble, she could literally leap off a building with those things. Just glide to safety. Jabber is Cadbury fucking Jack. He takes off his look at them on the left. He's going into a hot tub. He's got a towel on and no shirt.

Speaker 4:          03:14:46       He's ripped. When did Cadbury? We came and looked at him. What a butler. Well, homoerotic. Ah, what a but so strange. Wait a minute. You're putting your. Oh God. Look what he says there. Gosh, I've been keeping you from your bath. Cadbury. I'm sorry. Please go. No need for apology. So some day I shall relate the story of how I was once lost all my clothes at the South Pole and they says what a Butler as he's walking them, walk away with his tiny little towel around his junk. Look, a little of that town was where do you even find a towel? That little that makes it way all the way around your ass. Yeah. He's going outside and you got to make a choice. You covered your Dick. Are you covering your asshole? But you definitely not covered in both. With what kind of strange snake like towel or you possessing six inches across 12 feet long.

Speaker 4:          03:15:44       Yeah. Cadbury gun on the Jews started lifting. Got a fitness coach. It's so funny. That was very homoerotic. It was weird. They were allowed to do weird stuff back then. Imagine if you had that cartoon today. Fucking feds show up at your door. Hey Tom, papa. Let's see your fucking hard drive. Another one of the pedophile conspiracy. Creepy Shit. Fuck he been up to Tom. Popular podcasts is five hours long. How long have we gone to?
