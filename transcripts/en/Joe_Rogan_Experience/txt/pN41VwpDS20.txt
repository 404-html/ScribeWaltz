Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Five four, three, two, one funk. Does that sound that everybody knows? Like if you play that sound, people know that's an Arrow, right? Yup. But it may be throwing knife, but you known as an arrow. Dang. Right. We do. Dang right. That's it. That's an Iowa boy right there. That's the midwest coming out here. Sometimes I hear you on your podcast and I'm like, man, he is so midwest. It's hilarious. Sorry about that.

Speaker 2:          00:00:31       That don't apologize. It's awesome. I'm actually more of a half breed. I'm a little bit of south, right? Yeah. Yeah. I was a redneck for awhile and then then became a Yankee. My, the people up north don't give a it. They don't give a shit what people think north or South. But this, the people from the south, my family, they're like, you're part Yankee now. Yeah. Not Weird. It's a little weird. They lost. That's why they lost the war thing.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       Can you imagine? I mean, we are, we're several generations removed. But imagine growing up in like the late 18 hundreds when it just happened and you're dealing with Yankees Samos, my mom murders, right. People Killed Northerners and northerners killed southerners. And it must have been a lot of that. It was ruthless, I'm sure. Oh, how the fuck did that happen? That is a crazy time you think about the, the history of this country that just 200 years ago we were in, you know, less. We're in the middle of a bitter war from the, the north versus the south Americans fighting Americans to the death, big fields full of dead people. Um, my dad was at one of the fields, I forget which field it was. Um, but uh, he said, you know, it's one of those memorial places in the south. And he said the feelings Berg or something. Yeah. Want it was Gettysburg and he sent you feel it. He's like, you feel sadness then. Yeah. So I get sound. I know it sounds crazy. And he was saying, I don't even believe in that stuff, but you feel it. Like you're there and you're like, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       Oh yeah. We've been in a few memorials. Um, a few memorials and a few big, you know, like, especially like military cemeteries. Oh, you just, uh, you know another one. I felt it like exactly what you're saying. Um, I went to, um, a historic part of custer where they lost the battle and I walked the whole hill and everything. You can feel it there. Wow. What is that? Do you think there's like memory in places? Hell yeah. There is.

Speaker 1:          00:02:36       Yeah. It probably is. Right. I think there is probably an instinctive reason why people don't want to live in a house where someone was murdered. Yeah. I don't want to live there. I don't want to live there. I could you like, um, there's a house that Jon Benet Ramsey was killed in, in Colorado. They can't sell that fucking house. Dude. I live there.

Speaker 3:          00:02:55       Mm.

Speaker 1:          00:02:56       Nine years ago, eight years ago, somewhere on with them nine years

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       ago and they were selling it then they still can't sell it. It's a beautiful house. It's in a really nice neighborhood. Can't sell it. They have changed the name of the street. They changed the name of the street. Still can't sell it. I'm not kidding. They just can't sell it. It has it. Does it have like historical everybody's terrible sightings and stuff or was it just the killing? Just the killing and the hold. The darkness all behind it. I mean that was one. It was just was, it wasn't just a little girl died, but there's all this darkness. She was sexually active. There was something going like someone was probably molesting her, someone in the family or someone else who knows. They think someone in the family might have killed her. They don't know who it was. It's never been solved. No one's ever been tried.

Speaker 4:          00:03:41       It's a dark. Yeah, I'm not moving there. Fuck that. They can keep that, keep that house. I think they should level that thing to the ground and maybe even do something with the ground underneath it. Scoop all that shit out. Put some new dirt and I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. Like that might be the only way you're going to throw that Mojo on though. You've got to put that term. You got to put that dirt somewhere. Yeah, he's worthy of taking it. Right. Where would you put that dirt? You have to exercise it. You'd have to build like the most awesome park for kids. Like you'd have to turn that house into something positive. I don't want to do anything for kids. They're for sure that would be bad taste, but you could always take that big scoop and kind of put it in a freak party desert or something where people that like ghosts and crap can go out there and play in it or camp on it or what he likes little kid ghosts you want like some old man goes can tell you secrets.

Speaker 4:          00:04:36       Have you ever seen it? You think you've ever seen? He goes, no, I do not. Have you ever experienced something that was like super creepy that you know what? A couple of my friends at the comedy store have claimed to have seen ghosts and claim to have seen things and I with many of my friends that work there and comics and stuff, we've gone upstairs to the belly room in the dark, just freaked ourselves out and went and ran out of there. Stoned out of her mind. I feel it. We got to go. Well, are you going into the main room at night? You know, like, give me a hug. Hold me. Ah, I'm scared. It's, it's a weird place, man. People for sure been murdered there. It was a bugsy Siegel's nightclub in the 19. What was it, the thirties or forties or some shit.

Speaker 4:          00:05:17       It was Ciro's nightclub. Yeah, there's definitely some Mojo there, cal. Yeah, for sure. How do we get going down the pattern of death? I mean, all I do was write a werewolf and pictures. Awesome. Go to my instagram. John Dudley is riding the Werewolf. We were trying to figure out, well, the wearables, um, Patrick McGee made that Werewolf and it comes in to pate pieces. You slide it out and ball. Patrick Biggie has a new movie out. I should pump his new movie out. If you're into, there it is. See it. Fuck you. Fix your bed. Oh my God. It's hilarious. It's got 5,000 likes already. I put it up two minutes ago. That's such an awesome picture. I know. Pat Mcgee, the guy who made that, uh, just made a movie, a big foot movie. It's called a primal scream, I think. Isn't that what it's called? It just came out.

Speaker 4:          00:06:08       Is it a legit one or like a horror movie? Oh yeah. Put your monster. Okay. Kellen people. I watched that Jack and people in the woods. I watch that. Yeah. It got good reviews. I hope it's good. I love me a good big foot movie and there's not a whole lot of them. I think we would've saw bigfoot a long time ago. There's, yeah, for sure. I think, but, but um, what would you do if you actually ran across one double lung, which you take the, take the penalty double on proven point. No, I would hope I'd have my camera on me, but then people would call me a fucking liar. That would be a bummer. If you really saw big foot, you're like, God damn it. He's real. Never one's gonna think I'm crazy because everybody that I know that believes in big foot, I'm always looking.

Speaker 4:          00:06:53       All right. Everybody thinks they chart. Even if you've got a picture, no one, no one's going to believe. Yeah. Then you're going to meet all the good faith that you've built up by being honest all these years, people fuck that guy. He's full of Shit. He faked a bigfoot sighting man. Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't shoot it. Definitely not. But I think if it was real, I really do believe that if it was real, this is the, this is the, uh, the trailer for Omar C and Pat Mcgee did this with a all special effects like suits and shit and actual makeup and prosthetics and all the stuff that they used in the old movies. Like he doesn't believe in that CGI shit. And I think he's got a point at CGI shit. It's just too, it takes away. It does. I mean, you look back at some of the movies that scared, you know, scared the hell out of you when you're a kid and you watch them down and you're like, what the man did?

Speaker 4:          00:07:48       They, it just seems so much more real. But if you watch something to where you know it's fake, it's almost, can't picture the fact that it's flesh and blood. Right. And you need, you don't feel it. Like there's some of those transformer type movies. They're smashing buildings and like, I know this isn't happening. Just you don't feel it. It doesn't feel like a real explosion. It doesn't feel like a real robot. Just feels like horseshit. Yeah, but the Dyno bots pretty. They're pretty dope. What's the Dyno Bot? It's a dinosaur version. Is that one of the transformers and your years? Well, schooled robots and transformers were the bomb man when I was a kid. That and a cabbage patch kids. So it wasn't a crazy that that became, that transformers became huge hit movies. It was a dumb toy, right? Yup. Was it originally a toy? Yeah. Transformers. They were cool and shouldn't say dumb toy. If anyone's a collector, they're freaking out. Right. Dumb to me. How about that? Yeah, go bots and transformers. They were, I mean, before that you had, you know, army men Musselman. You remember those? Those little pink muscle

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       man? They were all freaking jacked. You know what I remember? I remember stretch Armstrong. Yeah, home part.

Speaker 6:          00:09:02       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:09:03       Yeah. They never made a movie out of him, did they? My boy. What's funny is they didn't have, they did have some of that stuff there. They are a little muscle. Then there's something that looks really good about that. They're all pink girl pink and those were pretty cool. Just on a, just a roundabout gas. How many dudes have stuffed those up their house? Hundreds or thousands. I'd say thousands. Thousands, right. Thousands of people. I've had those in there as we're going down that road already. Why not? If you just, if we could pull out like a pullback, you think of a teenage mutant Ninja Turtles, right? Did not start off as a, was that a comic book? It was a comic. That was a comic book. Yeah. It wasn't a toy first. That's my boy. He really got into, I don't know what it was, but he had this Peter Pan doll and I think because he didn't have a brother or sister, he would beat the shit out of this Peter Pan doll and he wouldn't do it when everyone was there.

Speaker 5:          00:10:07       But you know, you as adults, she of, you know, you ended up coming around the corner to see if they're okay or whatever. Maybe. We went downstairs for a while and I come up there and I mean he's just got his back to the door. Just fricking power drop in Peter Pan just kicking this thing in the face punched in it. I mean Sharon and I just laugh about it or like he doesn't do it with anyone else who for whatever reason Peter Pan is just his little brother and he just kicks the shit out of that sucker. Peter Pan's his bitch. What about Robin Hood?

Speaker 5:          00:10:42       There was a robin hood toys ever did ever kids ever get a robin hood toy that we need a disney movie, so I'm sure it got around now. But that was because of the story, right? Robin had the Disney movie. It was all because of the original rob. You story physical like action figures. Were they popular? I don't think so. Yeah, I don't think so. No. Maybe when that Kevin Costner movie came out, they sold a few, but I bet they didn't. I'd say a lot. Maybe a few. I forgot that was a movie. How bad was Kevin Costner's forum and that movie was it? Okay. Um, did you watch it and go, Whoa, I gotta go. It's like when I, when I see bad karate movies, I'm like, get the fuck right there. I Dunno. L Elvis doing karate. I watched that. I sent you a text.

Speaker 5:          00:11:22       I'm like, I watched that so long. Kevin Costner and Christian Slater to checkout that feather the feathering on the back of his hair. Yeah. It was members from the duck feather was like kind of kind of the style. Yeah. The feathering. The hearing somehow or another, he got his hair feathered wise in the fucking forest. Nottingham was perfect haircut. He's got a soup. Look at that. Come on man. It's got a super cuts right down the street. The fuck did you get that hair cut son? You that haircut I got the other day. Cost cutters. Look how they made arrowheads. Is that real? Is that really how they did it? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       It looks like he's pouring a full metal one. Wow. That's dope. Yeah. They would melt it down and pour it in a cast thing out like a rocky mountain cut throat or something. I'll look at his, showing them, making the arrows in the bows and shit. Yep. Wow. It's right there. He goes, drive home in it. How did they possibly know? Did they use scales to figure out how much the arrows weighed back then it was even a scallop. No fucking guy on the right. It's killing me. That's about how everyone would shoot with that equipment. Nowadays. Morgan Freeman was asthma blood. Why in the fuck beyond the wormhole? This is hilarious. This is so dumb. I'm a Kevin Costner Fan. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a hater, but damn Kevin costs has been in some stinkers. Oh, now they're getting better. Look. Oh yeah, they learned Little Robin had coaching. It wasn't bad. Good, bad. Oh, just split another one. Wow. Look at his skills. See, people don't understand. Splitting an Arrow is fucking stupid.

Speaker 4:          00:12:55       It's costly. It's not wise. Well, at least there was no cgi in this for sure. I mean, I licked the feather before you're fired. Is he trying to curve it around it. I don't know what he's doing. Why is he looking at, he's going to cut the string. Let me this. They got all the dramas killing me. Sincerely is saying I wasn't sure if it was going to hit. The drama is killing me. That's a slow ass heroine, right? Yeah. How much, I mean seconds. I don't know if you shot that and access dear thanks. Just Steve would be like be on the other island. I've never seen anything like those things. Um, John and I hunted axis deer in Hawaii where they were brought over. I was reading as a like a gift to the king in the 18 hundreds hosted that today actually. Yeah, that's probably where I was reading it.

Speaker 4:          00:13:45       I'm pretty sure I knew it already, but I think of it, that's exactly where I was reading it. But they, I've never seen anything move as fast as those things. Like you could shoot at one that's 40 yards away and by the time the Arrow gets there, it's nowhere near it. It's like Chung. Yeah. You need to load those fast twitch muscles in a UFC fighter of today. Just be concussion city. It'd be crazy. I've never just, I've never seen an animal react to something so quick, but it makes sense that they evolved around Tigers, tigers and leopards. Fucking shit. Roll the dice. Imagine being tiger and Leopard preferred food. And that's the other thing about axis deer. They are delicious. Yup. Yeah. Like one of the most delicious animals on the planet. And obviously tigers must know this. Oh I bet they have to know it. Yeah. I mean there has to be a correlation between something that's extra fast and extra delicious. I really think there is. Well does that make sense? Not really. Right? Because like I dunno what to eat a hummingbird probably tastes like shit. I think a lot of it's their diet and how much they're actually having to move too.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Yeah. Cause I think things that are running a lot like full speed, it seems like the meat maybe isn't as tinder, but it's hard to say. That's true. Well. Um, what I've found is that Chad ward method, the your your friend whiskey bent barbecue, he's changed the way I cook meat. Um, I do that here now and I use a meat thermometer. Always. The only time I don't is when I um, I will saute backstraps slices or steak slices in a frying pan, like a cast iron grill. I'll put some butter and some garlic salt and some cracked pepper and I'll just cook them pretty quick on a really hot skillet. I like cooking like that too. Yeah. But when I cook like a roast or something like that or a thick piece of meat, I always use Chad's method. Yup. It's a way to go get it, get the internal temperature.

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       I get it to around one 20 and then I take it out and just sear the outside and the frying pan and let it sit for 10 minutes. And Oh, one thing that a lot of people don't realize too, um, when it comes to cooking, a really good roast or a steak or anything is I love having those soft Yeti bags or the smaller cooler. And I'll take the stuff and actually you know, kind of wrap it up just slightly and foiler but your paper and then put it in the cooler and let it actually stage in there and you know, and just stage in that moisture while I'm doing my vegetables cause it takes about 20 minutes to do vegetables and then take it out right at the very end to do that reverse year. Normally when I put it in there, it gives me time to get, you know, a cast iron pan hot enough with the butter to do reverse sear.

Speaker 2:          00:16:27       So it's like really good for timing and it, it really helps break down that that protein a little bit and it just makes it that much more tender. That's interesting because I was doing that for a while but I was doing it after I did the seer. I was, I was taking it right from the grill and then I was searing it. Like I'd have the Pan Ready, I'd see her right off the grill and then I'd wrap it in foil and put it into yet. But then you don't get kind of that crispness of this year, which he like were at, because it stays moist until you're saying, yeah, yeah. Stage at first start your vege and then like you know, probably two minutes before you feel like you're going to pull your vegetables off. Just get that butter going in that cast iron pan and then do your reverse here.

Speaker 2:          00:17:06       You know you can do one side and then as soon as you flip it, pull your veggies off the grill and you're literally, you can go right back to the, you know that one side, your reverse sear and take it off and you're serving hot. Everything's done well. That's one thing that I really give credit to. Steve Rinella. Steve Rinella really got me interested in wild game cooking. And then Hank Shaw, who he had on his TV show who's a brilliant chef and he's gay, he's got a couple of books out. One of them is buck, Buck Moose I think, and then he's got another one duck moose or something. So I had it sitting here for a while til we moved everything off. This stable, it's table gets so cluttered. I'm always trying to put, everyone has always given me books and also there was just sitting here, just got one.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       They're always just stacking up and I've been meaning to give you this book. Moose recipes and techniques for cooking deer, elk, and Moose by Hank Shaw. It's awesome. It's really good. I'd be no, his book's really good too. He's got two of them. Hunting and cooking wild game.

Speaker 7:          00:18:04       I feel I'm so inferior to those guys when it comes to cooking. Oh yeah. But I almost liked the fact that that people really like my cooking or at least the pictures and what I make, people are really into it because if they knew that my knowledge of cooking wild game is so limited, it's, it should be hope for anybody to be able to cook that easy. Because I'm not those guys. I mean, I think if, you know, I would love to do that, but I'm as simple as it gets when it comes to to grill and stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:18:40       Yeah. But I'm telling you there's an art to that simplicity. Like just you describing your method for, you know, like letting it stage and then searing it and what we learned from Chad when we cook that wild pig. Yup. That was amazing. That was so good. And I think there's, there's something amazing in that simplicity because a lot of people fuck that simplicity up. Like that simplicity is a real common one to screw up. People just overdo it or overcook it or something goes wrong. But um, Rinella really turned me on to all the various really fascinating dishes and he had several episodes of his TV show mediator that are just dedicated to cooking. And I don't, there's not a lot of hunting shows that ever have that. It's always just about hunting and then the shot of the animal getting shot and then everybody's smiling and high five and that's it. Roll credits when it's pretty much, yeah, 60 70% of all those hunting shows and his really stands out because it's like, hey, this guy's a real chef. I mean, it's an amateur chef, but he's a real chef. He knows a lot about cooking and he makes these delicious meals and they're intricate. It like, it makes us really cool. Elk Meat Loaf, it was really good.

Speaker 7:          00:19:44       I've never done anything with Steve. We've, we've passed, we've actually been within the same group of friends talking at times, but we've never actually done something where we had to have a communication just the two of us. But um, yeah, he's a fascinating dude. Very, very smart guy. I would love to actually, I talked with a remi and uh, I told Remy, I said I would love to do, um, just a weekend getaway where we just go back country and all you teach, you know, just Kinda, I want to just follow remy and see some of his, you know, just as natural, like camping and survival type skills and then actually do an on the mounting coaching thing with Remi. We were talking about doing a show where I literally retrain his way of shooting while he's retraining my way of back country hunting. And literally he's doing his element. I'm doing mine and we're able to to just do it in the middle of nowhere. That sounds cool. Yeah, it'd be pretty fun.

Speaker 4:          00:20:45       Well, I'm really fascinated by what remi does

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       and uh, Tim Barnett and a bunch of those guys that have, um, really taken up solo, back hunt, back country hunting where they backpack in and they'll go in 20 miles with a backpack. I mean, obviously, uh, my favorite stories, Adam Green tree, that fucking crazy bastard. Our good friend Adam went all the way deep into the mountains of Colorado and then again he went, came out for a bit and went to Idaho, right? Yep. And that's when he had all the Grizzly and counters, but 28 days just living out of a backpack and putting his camp on its back most of the nights and just carrying it around and just living literally off your back. And there's an art to that and remmy doesn't just do that, but he also solo films, everything, which is incredible. Well that's, well,

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       I don't solo back country hunt that I definitely have really. Most of my tv show experience has all been from cell filming. I mean, I've been doing it 20 something years. A lot of what you saw for me, it was all self filmed, which a lot of people don't appreciate how tough that really is until, yeah. I mean it is hard. It's hard enough to, uh, to hunt and be successful. But to film it is like a whole

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       Ooh, new level. Yeah. Just to bring the cameras around with you. And like with Remi, like if we're watching a show solo hunter or timber nat, the other guy that's on each other always like holding the tripod, running up the hill while they're also holding a bow and setting it up and putting the camera in place and then trying to draw back and trying to get the, and move the camera because the deer's move in like Gopros helped a lot. I'm just fascinated by the people that choose to go deep into the woods and live by themselves and do it for long, long periods of time because it's, um, it's, it's a very interesting and solitary pursuit. Like when you're out there, there's no TV, there's no phones, there's just you, you only, and a backpack and a little tent, maybe a baby. You're sleeping under the stars and then you get up in the morning and do it all over again. And some of these guys do it for like 20, 30 days at a time. It's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:22:58       It's hard for me to, uh, I don't actually like to post. I don't even if I'm out camping on a hunt, I actually don't post when I'm doing that just because of those guys. Out of respect for those guys, it's who really, really, really, I mean, honestly, I, I understand what they're doing and I don't, you know, it's no different than, you know, there's, there's people that post photos shooting archery when, when, when I look back and see how long they've really done it. And you know, they build up a persona, but there's also guys, there's guys that have done it twice as long as me, but there's guys like me that have done, you know, possibly millions of arrows. Um, so it's, it's hard to, to see people like make pretend to be that. And I feel like I'm that guy. If I, if I post a picture of, of me out in the back country in a Bibi, it's not the same as seeing Adam posts a picture and a bivy or remy or Rinella.

Speaker 2:          00:24:05       We should explain a Bibi that people don't know what it is. It's like a combination tent. Sleeping bag. Yup. Yeah. I mean it's like literally you can get, yeah, you can stuff it in your bag, go out and you're more or less a hunting. Just lay it on the ground, sleeping on the ground. You got some little bit of cover. Sometimes people bring pads, sometimes the hard, hard hardcore dudes don't even bring pads. There you go. That guy is shooting Alan Yang. That's how I wake up. Wake up and Oh, I hear an elk wake and bake. Right. Breakfast is served. Yeah. Well that's crazy. He's all got Cammo on the Bibi too. Can you appreciate that though? Yeah, I feel that way. It's not just in the hunting world. It's like that with a lot of things. Um, but you know why? If I have a truck, I have trouble posting pictures working out.

Speaker 2:          00:24:55       I know what you mean. Yeah. Like I'll, I make sure I make sure people that are following me and trying to maybe be motivated by what my daily routine is. I like them to see that I'm going and things like that. But to actually post that I'm doing it because I do it to stay healthy. It's not my life. Right. And archery is my life. So that's why sometimes it gets hard for me when people are pretending to do that or, you know, and I guess I don't have a problem with people doing it, but I don't want him to do it. But yeah, I don't want to be enthusiastic about it, but I know what you're saying. Yeah. I just, I'm trying to show respect for the people that are literally putting in the grind for those specific things. The same as what I have done with my life or archery. That's all I'm saying. I know. Exactly, Sam. It's like, uh, I dunno. I have a different attitude about that with standup comedy. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:25:52       cause I really, really like when new people get into standup comedy and it's, that's contrary to like how a lot of professionals feel. Like I was talking to a friend of mine the other day, she's very funny and she was telling me that her uncle was a thinking about getting into comedy and she was like, oh well, Oh God, no. You know. But when people ask me like, hey man, I'm thinking about doing comedy, I'm like, you could do it. Anybody can do it. Just figure it out. It's just like everything else. It's like Jujitsu or

Speaker 2:          00:26:21       mm.

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       Martial arts like fit, fill in the blank. It's anything else. It's like music. You learn the chords. You figured out how to play, you can do it. You might not be able to do it, but that might be on you. I mean like whether or not, I think if you're a rational person, he thinks and you like comedy and people laugh at you. Like you say funny shit. Sometimes you can be a stand up, will you? Will you do it? I don't know. People think it's a lot easier than it is. They don't really know. They don't see, um, there's no way you could. There's no, I mean you think about all the hours, all the time, all the different sets. But I like it when people get into it. So if some new kid has only been doing comedy for three weeks, throws a bunch of pictures on his instagram page about going to an open mic, died, I'm happy. Like go get it kid.

Speaker 2:          00:27:07       Well, I mean especially when it comes to art form, there's kind of a line there. Cause when it comes to competition, I'm very, very active in getting people involved with trying to compete because I always felt like even as a coach, when I helped people that were maybe not up to the rank that I was, I felt like once I felt the pressure of them pushing on my heels, it always elevated my game for sure. And I've got friends that, I've got friends that are within different fields that I'm in. And they actually have came to me and said, hey, we want to show you exactly how we're doing this. Um, and in a way I'm a competitor because I'm in the outdoor business, but there's been a few times where some of my friends have said, the reason we're telling you exactly how we do it is because we know that you're going to do it different, but maybe a little bit better. And some of them have said, we're stale right now. We know we're stale, we need to push and we need someone to like push past us. So that will our competitive drive we'll, we'll push through. Well you know what,

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       in the outdoor business, but I'm going to steal a page from my friend Sturgis book. Not a real book, but we said the other day, he's like, he goes, I'm not really in the music business. I'm in the sturgill Simpson business. And I was like, damn, that's right. He's right because I'm not in show business. Yup. I'm in the Joe Rogan business. 100% like, I mean I'm in show business in terms of like, I guess I work for the UFC, that's show business. I, I show up at the comedy store that's show business. But that's where, that's my gym. Yeah. That's where I'm practicing to be in the Joe Rogan business. And you're in the John Dudley business, you know, I mean what I was saying before, I wanted to let you continue your thought, but what I wanted to say was the you feel that way because you're a legit guy.

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       Cause like what you've done, like a lot of people don't realize there's a lot of people in the archery world and there's a lot of people in the bow hunting world to talk about bow hunting and they were really into our tree. But your background as a competitive archer is just insane. I mean you really, like, most people don't even know, like you really did it all over the world. I mean you compete internationally, you flew millions of miles. I mean that you did the whole deal and it, it's something that you, because of the fact that you know, you put so much effort and so much hard work into it and you're solidified as 100% legit, you're very sensitive to things that you're not legit in. So that's why you're a very authentic person. Like when you're thinking about like all the running, like when I post pictures of running, I often think like, yeah, I'm running but I don't even have like a real job. Cam hanes is out there, rode 25 miles a day, that fucking crazy ass and he's one of my best friends. It's like I can't really, I can't really think that I'm really run. I mean I know I'm doing it, but it's bitch ass running.

Speaker 2:          00:30:08       I didn't want to use that example, but to do an example, that is the perfect example because yeah, I don't post pictures of me. Yesterday I actually did arm day. I'm not like arm day all the time, but yesterday was, let me have some of that Alpha brain. Yesterday was a legitimate arm day and I thought Cam's already posts arm day and he does it every day. So yeah, I don't know. I know he doesn't get tendinitis. No, cause I'm going, he's down this dude, I don't know. Why doesn't he have a tendonitis in his legs? That's true. Runs it. He's we, you and I talked about, I've shot a right handed Bo my entire, well I shouldn't say my entire life when I hurt my shoulder, I had to shoot a left hand, a bow. But um, for the most part I've shot a right handed boat my whole life.

Speaker 2:          00:30:58       So my, my left, I mean my left Pec is bigger than my, than my right. My left jelled. Yeah, my left tricep. And then on my right side, my right trap, the way my whole right side sits in my bicep or also from pulling a boat my entire life. And you and I talked about, you know, if you really wanted to balance yourself and stay symmetrical, you almost need to shoot lefthanded as much as you shoot right hand. Yeah. Well that's the key with martial arts. But in a way, I mean that is what Cam's doing. He's running right? It's all lower body. And then he's literally lifting upper body every day, which is a balance. I mean, people are going to, people are definitely going to say, well you can't train up her body every day, but he trains lower body every day. So is it like, I've thought that many times

Speaker 1:          00:31:51       low weight, high reps, not always so low either. By the way. That kind of strong as fuck. Like you'd be kind of stunned and how strong he is. Like he came over here and uh, he picked up my hundred and 25 pound dumbbells and he was doing presses. So he's pressing to 50 with dumbbells, you know, and he's,

Speaker 2:          00:32:09       it mean

Speaker 1:          00:32:10       is it, he's a crazy guy. Like I don't know anybody like him. So like he's doing, he's doing low weight, high rep running. He's doing that. But I'm saying he also lifts to 50 with dumbbells and he only weighs like 175 pounds. I mean, it's pretty crazy shit. He's a felon at one 75 and I'm two 25. He's a tank. He's a madman. Like I've met a lot of people that have a lot of drive but he has a very unusual drive. It's very, it's real weird.

Speaker 2:          00:32:37       Have you ever done the math on I'm, sometimes

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       you shoot most of the time you shoot a hundred arrows but I know there's been times where you and I have shot where you've shot where I know I've shot over a hundred arrows and you've shot double that because normally when I'm about saying I have feel like I had a good practice. You're like yeah man, I feel really warmed up right now. You know where that comes from. It comes from playing pool when I and when you play pool, this is, this is real high level competitive pool and I was never high level but um, when I got to be as good as I got, I was always a what you would call a b player. It takes a lot to become a b player. But I was always a b player and there's a, is an a player, an a player like borders pro and then there's pro, which is like stratospheric, like you know Earl stricklin effort and ray is best of the best top of the food chain.

Speaker 4:          00:33:28       This is different level, but when you play pool, as you get better and better, one of the things that, uh, that you get, you develop like this feel and the feel really kicks in with me about eight hours in. So I would, I would be practicing, I'm not joking, eight hours and I had a full on sickness. Go ahead and pull that. I know you're trying to do it off the mic. How addictive of these goddamn on it. Protein bites. Holy Shit. I want stock in these right there. It's on these fricking to say good. I hate for those this morning. And I told myself I was willing to eat one. I was just doing some shit around the house before I made breakfast and my fasted a window was up and so I was like, I can eat now. It's like I just have one of these things. I ate one. I'm like I'm definitely having to, and then I ate too cause there's two in a package and I said fuck that. I'm hoping in another package I ate four of them. So I, what is it, seven grams each. So there's 28 grams of protein. I ate inside of five minutes. These are so good. Prepare from I the other day I said for anyone out there don't do it. Cause if you do it, whatever these, whatever these are, you're going to go from like this,

Speaker 2:          00:34:41       the new on it. These are the protein bites, coconut cashew and dark chocolate. Actually the good fight you, I didn't have these, Andy Stumpf had these first and he gave me these out of his backpack. Where were we? Oh in Oklahoma we had done, we had done quite a bit of a ride on the bikes for the day and I'm like I am starving to death right now. And he pulled these out of his backpack and I just said to tell how many of those did you bring? And he's like, I don't know why. And I'm like, those are going to be gone. These are dynamite. My problem is in the morning, I'm always, I do like too fast in the morning before my workouts. What? What's the window you give yourself? I normally don't eat until about 10 30 or 11 in the morning. And what time do you eat at night before you go to bed? Seven. Oh, that's good. That's a good window. Yeah. And honestly, I, I'm like

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       starving, but I'm not ready to cook yet. Or you know, normally for my breakfast I'll normally half an avocado to a full avocado with anywhere from like four to six eggs. And if I have any, any meat leftover from the night before, I'll slice that and have it with, but these things on the way to the gym, if I just feel like I don't have anything in the tank, these had been awesome. They're very low glycemic index, low sugar, and even the protein's not ridiculous. And when it's seven grams, is that per byte or is that for the whole bar? Read that shit according to most freaking serving samples. Dude, I was reading something. Oh my God. It says one bite. Yeah, 1.7 servings per container too. Yeah. This is supposed to be one bite. Well it's the bite is like the name for it. It's not supposed to be like, how are you going to fit that whole thing in your mouth?

Speaker 4:          00:36:29       To me that's a bite. Well it's they're called protein bites. Why wouldn't it be one square? Cause you already bid out of it like you've been out of. Again, that's two bites. That's ridiculous. It can't be one bite. I mean you could do it if you had to. If I wasn't on a podcast, I would have done that. Like nothing. People get real mad by the way. They're gonna get mad at you for chewing on the Mike. Can't be more annoying than Mel Gibson's fricking pin almost shot myself in the face for that fricking thing. I couldn't say anything to him. He's sitting over here, dude, I, if I want a nice guy, he's a nice guy. He was, but he's fried. There's a circuit that that just hit an overload and there's a black area where it used to be connected to the motherboard. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:37:12       Well you know more than me. Nice guy. What's funny is, um, you know, my, one of my followers is the brand of all Brad's. He does all this on your podcast. That was great podcast by the way. He made that yesterday, which is kind of hilarious. John Dudley death dark your face over Mel Gibson. Oh, that's hilarious. It, yeah, it was funny. But you have whatever that Penn was my God, that was terrible. Yeah. Well you know what it was, I just don't think he could just sit and chill. And when Dr Neil Riordan was discussing all this real hard, heavy duty scientific stuff when in regards to stem cell research and all the different, I mean he's had, I mean one of the reasons why he came on, he wanted to come on the podcast and people were like, why didn't you ask him about his wife?

Speaker 4:          00:37:57       Why did you ask him about the, that's not what he's here for. I want to be respectful to the guy. I'm a fan of Mel Gibson and he's a nice guy. What he asked is he said, can I come on the podcast and talk about the stem cell research they're doing in Panama and the treatments that they gave to my dad at 92 years of age. Now he's thriving. It almost, it was a great podcast. And you know, I'm, I'm, I'm a believer in stem cell because you actually introduced me to doctor Rati Mcgee in Las Vegas. Saved, I mean potentially you saved my archery career. Well, cause we get from surgery if I will. Yeah. And surgeries

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       are fricking hit or miss. Right, right. So that's what I'm saying. I was lucky with my shoulder surgery that I got out of there. Good. I know a lot of guys that are into their third one for the same type of thing, but literally I got

Speaker 6:          00:38:50       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:38:51       three injections the first time and went back for a second round because I think one of my tears didn't take. And literally I took completely avoided surgery because of doctrine mcgee.

Speaker 1:          00:39:03       And we should talk about this because I don't know the exact specifics of what it was called, what the original treatment was called, but the original treatment that you and I both got, he no longer baby. Definitely quick, quick got a baby does this past weekend, but it's not available anymore. It's a, it's because they believe this is what they're trying to make it legal. But it has to go through a series of, uh, there's a whole process that it has to get it passed because they've declared it a drug. Because you take the, is something about umbilical cord stem cells. You take them and convert them and then that somehow or another, the in during the process they believe it's become a drug. Whatever that drug is. I had a full length tear of my rotator cuff. Now this is from an MRI, full length tear of my rotator cuff. It was painful. It was a real problem. Doctor Rati Mcgee in Las Vegas, Nevada, shot, whatever that baby dust is in there. Gave you some end, uh, the most recent MRI that I got, which is over a year from his original treme. But I knew that it felt a lot better, but I have, I just haven't got it checked. It's gone.

Speaker 2:          00:40:09       Funny enough, I was with you both times right the first time, which, I mean, I didn't say anything about, but you had, you had been struggling to shoot a lot because you know, you had just, it's wearing tear. I mean, the bottom line is it's wear and tear over life, especially with you and I, we do a lot of active stuff. But for you to go back and you and I went in together, uh, last week and when he said he looked at you with this confused face and said, yeah, hey, a new MRI that is healed, that's fricking massive.

Speaker 1:          00:40:45       It's massive. That's a tear that would have normally absolutely required surgery or I could have just been in pain with an unstable shoulder. You know, one of the things that I'm realizing is that over the years of uh, essentially being engulfed in martial arts, most of my adult life and even into my teenage years, like at 15, I became a fanatic. Like from then on, martial arts has always been a part of my life. I've done some ruthless shit with my joints. Both of my knees had been reconstructed. I've had some real problems with my neck in the past, both of my shoulders, f of cause of problems. It's just explosive, crazy shit. Your arms are getting yanked in weird directions, your foot windmill, that stuff. That's the easiest stuff that's probably saved me all that big foot I really think saved me because that's shoulders to ability because that's controlled, you know, all that stuff that I'm doing that's all strengthening all these muscles around it and that doesn't bother me. That doesn't give me any pain. What would give me pain is like off angle punches. Like you land on someone's elbow in a weird way and you feel something

Speaker 2:          00:41:50       go for it right now. Even thinking about it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:53       Getting caught in something like Kamora and not tapping. I've done that a bunch of times. Like a shithead. You're a meathead, you know you, you don't want to tap but you gotta tap but you don't want you to like, there's gotta be a way to get out of this without tapping and then you get out. But then you can't do chin ups for like three months. That's happened 30 times in my life. Like no joke. Like where I didn't tap and then I was fucked up for a few months and then I would tape everything up and keep rolling.

Speaker 2:          00:42:19       Well you, you hooked me up with, with Damien in Demoine for 10 planet and I really wanted to do, she just did classes with them, but I'm so afraid to do it in a class because for me it's my arms or my career. Right, right. And I mean it would literally be like turning a light switch off in your room.

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       My friend Max [inaudible], he's a professional pool player and he said the same thing. He was really interested in trying Jujitsu. So scared of getting his arm bar, getting locked in an arm bar and fucking his elbow or shoulder up and then he wouldn't be able to play. Well it's a real legitimate concern.

Speaker 2:          00:42:58       Two days ago, I don't even know if I told you this, but I'm andy texts me and she stumped. Yeah. He put me in a group text and needed a closer and Jocko reached out. We were in a group text and Jocko wants a boat and wants lessons he wants. So does of course he does. So it's kind of a fucking knife in his teeth. What? Full draw. Yeah. And he's like just make something, he won't break in half cause he's like he will break it. Yeah. And uh, I thought Ah Shit, if I've got to have jack over, I know we're going to end up working out cause if he's at my house more than two days, I'm not going to skip two days of working out. So I thought I better hit the fricking squat rack cause I'm more of a bike guy. Like all, most of my leg workouts come from, well they come from kettle bells or they come from, from biking because I liked the bat bike or ruck when I thought we'll explain ruck to people rocking is where you just have a, a full weighted backpack on essentially in your just power walking.

Speaker 2:          00:44:01       You're almost going for an outdoor walk. And um, the outdoorsman, which you actually sent to me. Thank you. Um, cause I kept telling you I want to do, you know, some power I want to do, like pretty much, I want to pretend like I'm packing out elk quarters to prepare for it. And you said, dude, you gotta check out this pack. It's called that

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       atlas trainer and it's available at outdoorsman [inaudible] dot com not a sponsor. Just nice people that make good stuff. They're there. They specialize in optics, really. Most of their businesses and selling high end binoculars to a hunters. Yeah, they're, they're, they're the optics authority. They're amazing with optics. Like they do a lot. Have you ever listened to the Jay Scott outdoors podcast now? God's got a really good podcast, super specific to hunting. Anybody. I mean, it's not like this podcast where it's like, we'll talk about all kinds of shit and how many dudes have little rubber muscle men up there ass she's got, it's not talking about any of that, but what he's had, cody Nelson who's one of the owners of a outdoorsman and they go into like edge to edge clarity, high end details of Swarovski's Zeiss, a vortex, like all these different by nose and they talk about, you know, all the different aspects of like what's, what's the best shit to buy, what's the best shit for this price point for that price point.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       And they get like super geeky and in depth with it, but there's no better resource than outdoors. ms.com like they have everything. They have all the high end stuff, they're really good deals. But they also have this, uh, atlas trainer, which is because their whole thing is western hunting. And see when I think most people that don't know what hunting is or did it not in the world, which to me prior to 2012 they think of hunting is fucking elmer fudd some dude with a orange vest on shooting some poor, innocent animal. What western hunting is, and this is where it gets really weird. It's fitness with mental strength, discipline and then hunting. There's so much involved in it. You're dealing with mountains, so you have mountaineering, hiking. It's a tough mudder with a weapon. It is and that's what it is. You can only appreciate that.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       I'm trying to get them to trying to get them to, because I become a new are absorbed like this backpack shit that we were talking about like what remi does on a regular basis. Aaron Snyder and Snyder who does a, an amazing podcast called Kfar who cast, it's a, it's a Cafaro was a real high end, a backpack company. They make like real rugged backpack specifically designed for hunting and for military tactical and stuff like that. But Aaron Snyder, one of the guy who runs it is a serious hunter and he does those crazy 30 day trips like out in the bullets, out in the woods, just living off your back book. That's what Bush, Bush and woods hanging around with. Adam Green tree too much. I call it the bush. I think we're, we've officially killed this angel's wings. Too much body. What? There's too much mass in you. You can go through too much alcohol. Like I have to think about you probably wait like 40 pounds heavier than me, so I have to have to put it in consideration. How much to take in. No, you don't. This is great. Podcasts are made by friends and alcohol. Yup. Well that one that we did in Lanai when it was all of us, you and me and Ben O'brian and Sam. So halt and have to get Shane Dorian, Jack.

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       I'll go grab it. You just keep us occupied. Yup. Remi uh, Shane Dorian. Ben O'brien, my wife Shazzie fresh and my boy was there. I think I got everybody. I think you got everybody. Um, we said Remi, right? Yeah. Yes, Shane, Jack or you want to try this? Mccowen counting Brian. Good Little Brian. What you want to try some local stuff? We've got some stuff that I just got from bigger stuff over here. I'll, I'll take this sucker over. Um, yeah, I made a note here that was b and I have no idea what that topic was. We've shifted gears so many times. This is a bauers bauers whiskey in this from Bakersfield. And I was just in Bakersfield. Not a sponsor, but not a sponsor, but nice folks that left me in a nice glass of a nice bottle, rather a whiskey. So beautiful bottle. You know, I didn't know this, but that area, Bakersfield, like that whole area, that's where, um, that's where there will be blood was all about.

Speaker 4:          00:48:34       You ever see that movie? Daniel Day Lewis? I love that movie. I didn't know that, but he was amazing in that movie. Right? I actually really legitimately like that movie. Oh, I love that to ice. But that's all right. We get some more ice cream. We've got a to hook us up. The spice that was, that was at least 20 ounces. Like you could die. We're not driving. We're going to be shooting arrows. Luckily face no one here. I know. And we're surrounded by concrete concrete. By the way, Dow grade is that set up by the way. I got to thank you for hooking me up with those uh, block targets. Awesome. Only my arms are long enough to reach across this table. Anyone else you would have came up way short, Dick against the wall. Um, but these guys that do this, this, uh, there's this hardcore back country hunting.

Speaker 4:          00:49:27       It's sort of what we like what we were talking about before it was worth, there's levels to this and the way you work out is to stay healthy and to be fit in comparison to some guy like David Goggins, some maniac, some campaigns type maniac, right? But there's, there's levels to like everything. Like some guys just want to go out and try to hunt for their meat and you know, go out and have a weekend hunt and Wisconsin or Colorado or wherever you guys want to put orange on for seven days. The other totally content with that. And then there's guys who take it as far as you can go. Weirdos. And then the Weirdos amongst the Weirdos, right? Guys like Adam, Adam Green, true goes lives in the mountain and facebook's the whole thing. And instagram lives the whole thing. Yup. Yeah. It's a, it's a thing. It's not what everybody thinks it is. It's a thing. And I think that thing gets clouded up by so, so much distraction. I think a lot of don't know what the thing

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       is, you know, so they think of it as being some, oh, look at that. A little nice. Ooh. Ooh. Breaking ice in jre. Is that a Yeti ice bucket? I'll be darned. Does it? No, it's a regular ice bucket. Does you have an ice bucket and we need an ice bucket. Oh, for everybody who wanted one of these, uh, jre tumblers, they're gone. Gone to 20 minutes. I underestimated it. Sounds like my releases. Yeah. I only ordered 300 of them, but we're ordering water in 2000 now, so I fucked up. Sorry. Sorry. We'll get them as quick as we can. Hopefully Yeti. If you, uh, just find Ben O'bryan on instagram and yell at them or guy. Cheers. Thanks for having me out. My pleasure, brother. We're, we're prepping. People hate that sound. They hate to sound slurping. They hate the sound of chewing. I get it.

Speaker 2:          00:51:23       You're on the treadmill right now. You're on the treadmill right now. You're thinking about quitting and you hear someone chewing, slurp and you're like, fuck this podcast man. Fuck this. Well, I got off subject, but what I was talking about, I was going to do some squats just because I felt like ready for Jocko. Yeah, yeah. At least need to do one 35 ones. Uh, but a member the other day when I was in Rodney's and he was ben to me all around checking my arm when I hold a squat bar, that is what gives me my pain right now. Do you get massaged often? Um, I get, I normally get it about four times a year. I have a guy that I go all the way to Oklahoma for, it's about 600 miles, but his name is Lester Phillips. Did you fly or do you drive?

Speaker 2:          00:52:13       I drive down there, Geez, yes, name is Lester Phillips. Ain't trying to get a massage and he's at a, he's actually at a, um, uh, fitness building called body masters, but he is amazing at breaking apart scar tissue and literally getting into areas that most people don't take the time for. Um, and I normally go for two hours just for one joint. Jeez Christ. But if you're sober this whole time, yeah, but if you're doing something well it's arguable, but it depends. Um, if you're doing something that's very repetitive in your sport, then those particular areas build, you know, it's just like I would, a lot of times he tells me that my, my bicep and my forearm connector on my right side are a lot like what a fighters are. That's a right hand prominent where they're having impact in the same with my left because as you're shooting, it's just constant hyperextension so you build that scarring in there and when the scarring isn't, you know, it's restricting the muscle from moving properly. You know, he talks to me like he said, if, you know, if you have long

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       hair and you, and you get out of the shower, it's not all the fibers aren't going the same direction. You have to like get all the knots and stuff out of there. So essentially he's trying to break up those areas where the muscles aren't flowing back and forth, um, smoothly. So even though I don't have necessarily a tear, I feel soreness at times. Um, I would say maybe even a chronic soreness, but if I go and actually have that broken apart, uh, it's extremely painful to do. But my performance afterwards is just night and day different. I think you should do it a lot. I really do. And I, and I, I'm, it's hard to find that good person though. That's the problem. That's why it goes so far, you know, is to find someone that really, really knows what they're doing. Do you have a time massage place in your town? No. I don't know. I mean, yeah, no ties. Make it up to Iowa. Yeah. This is some kind of, I'm around here man. And you know, not, not very expensive, but amazing. Like I had this lady that walks on my back, she's probably about 60 years old. She walks about on my back, grabs my wrists and pulls them up, pop that back.

Speaker 4:          00:54:38       But she's, she's stretches you out, man. It's like part of the thing, um, is a massage. And then once she gets in that tissue and loosens it up, then she starts pulling on your arms and stretching you out. Time massage is legit. It's really good holders. Jack. Now my best helps it. I'm lady trying to rip your arms out of the socket. I'd be fucked without her. It'd be fucked with a lot of different things. But that's one of them. Yeah. Um, but this, uh, stem cell research that they're involved in right now, they're what they're doing right now in Panama because it's not legal in the United States. That was a good podcast. Yeah. It was amazing. Right. The Guy, Dr Neil reared, he's very good. He's amazing. They just passed a significant hurdle in Texas. Yup. So they're real close to being able to do that in Texas.

Speaker 4:          00:55:23       And it might happen as soon as the fall. So somewhere around, uh, archery season, you might be able to go. He's like to be able to go to Texas and get all the same stuff that we're going to get in Panama. What you should do, man, if anybody listens to that podcast or anybody's talking to talk, talk to someone like me who has benefited tremendously from it and I haven't even gone and done what he's doing, which is complete next level in Panama, but I know Tj dillashaw, UFC bantamweight champion, he's gone there twice now. Fucking had massive, massive recovery from it. It's amazing. We're, we're in an incredible time when it comes to medical science and technology and innovation, like what they're able to do and fix and heal people, you know, that have had really significant injuries. That would have been a giant problem before. I have a friend of mine, she works at the UFC. My friend Heather, she had a achilles tendon injury from Rati. Yes. He did the surgery. Yes, and she's

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       six weeks later walking around without a limp dude. She told me that sick, it would be six months where she would be in a cast if it wasn't for a, there's this new stuff that's crazy. She's walking around without a limp.

Speaker 2:          00:56:36       I remember when you were in there and I was uh, Rodney came in and he, he had told you about the MRI and said it really looks like everything has grown back together. It's healed. I just said that's some tron shit right there, dude. I mean that's, that's like to be able to reconstruct something without having to go under the knife for someone. For me, I went under the knife with my shoulder and I know that the difference in recovery between literally not being able to almost function a part of your body entirely versus them saying take it easy and work your way back into what you want to do. Those are two pair. I mean they're like completely different universes, right? Being in a situation where you're, you know, one, you have to take painkillers, which that's not cool to having to have someone that you're dependent on, you know, pack pillows under your arm and keep you steady for three days in bed and you can't freaking move around. Then you got this, you know, big wedge under your arm and you're walking around versus we literally went in, went through the process, get an ultrasound, they find the place to target. You see a syringe, literally go in, no different than if you go and get a tetanus shot, you could see it in the ultrasound. You actually watch it go in, it goes in, comes out, and then it's done. You mean, and you literally go home and you're in these things just go to work.

Speaker 1:          00:58:13       Yeah, I mean, I'm really, really hopeful for the future. And we just went into this past weekend a rottie looked at the MRI and uh, he was stunned at the fact that my rotator cuffs had been completely healed, but I still have some little tears in the Labor area. So we shot some right into the joint. But again, what they're calm, they're constantly innovating. So now they're using umbilical cord blood and apparently they're having massive results with umbilical cord blood and then they're using your blood and the PRP. That was cool. It's crazy to watch the machine. Very cool. It mixes it all up and then it and puts it with the stem cells and it's like we're living in the future man. Cause I almost feel like I got gypped that, you know what I mean by that? Cause it healed you. Yeah. I mean I had a hard time carrying a jug of milk with my right arm.

Speaker 2:          00:59:09       A lot of people found that hard to believe because, you know, my arms aren't small, I don't think in average. But, uh, I had a tough, tough time carrying a jug of milk and a hammer fist position and then got the Mri saw few, you know, actually three areas where I just pretty much abuse it and tore it apart and got those three injections the first time two of them took, I ended up, actually roddy had me back there for a Fox News thing because I sent him a video of me doing 60 pound curls three, three weeks after the first stem cell injection and I wasn't even able to carry a jug of milk and I was doing 60 pound curls for sets, no pain, no pain. So I went there and did that. Well then it ended up slowly coming back where I felt pain in one area of the three.

Speaker 2:          01:00:08       So I had a different, I had an injection then, but what I had at that time was what we referred to as a baby dust. But now, um, you and my wife Sharon had prp, which was really, really cool to see that machine work. PRP mixed with stem cells. That's right. That's right. So it's an actually, the very first time I came in, they had us, um, he asked me to do a light workout after, but then the second time I came back, he had me do a workout before. Yeah. He did that with me as well. And then, and then injected it. And then we talked about the benefits of like the sauna and what that would do for it. Yeah. And then now it's already at a different stage. So I mean it's, no, there's no, uh, no doubt the progression of this is just, it's like anything, it just gets better and better and better and better.

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       What's interesting about rodey too, what's great about Rodney, I should say, rather than interesting, is that Roddy is a student of medical science as well as a practicing physician and surgeon. It's a good point. Yeah. So he's constantly on all the latest stuff. He's not stagnant in any way, shape or form. He's constantly up on it. So every time I have a conversation with them, he's like, there's some new research coming out of this place that shows this and he's just constantly on the ball with it. And so, um, the most latest thing was this weekend. I mean, last time I saw him was just a couple months before. It's definitely on point with the stats. Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:01:39       Yeah. We can't really match that on the podcast. Boy, we were, uh, I was, I had some speculation. This activity's taking place in La and Las Vegas rather on a daily basis what they would be. I was like, my real big question was how many times does a gay guy come in and other guy's ass and yell out Woo in Vegas? Oh, how many times does he ric flair? And Roddy was correct. Roddy was like, not every day. And I think what, I think you're right, everybody else was like all day, every day. I'm like, what are the odds? Chamie just came alive.

Speaker 2:          01:02:15       This, by the way, this was at a very nice dinner. We're good. Is

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       that steak house? It was very good. Yeah. The, um, shout out to craft steak at the mgm grand chronometer was delicious. So yeah, games we were having some of the bay best that Vegas could offer. Meanwhile Joe got on some, uh, subjects that were probably only probably only uh, I dunno, illegal to talk about in a comedy situation. You can talk about it anywhere now

Speaker 4:          01:02:45       for now, for like the next couple of months and then they'll make that illegal. Yeah. Yeah. Vegas is a great place to get meals. It's like one of the best restaurant places in the country.

Speaker 7:          01:02:55       It really is. I want a shout out to, uh, I want to hook up with Gordon Ramsay. You did some, you did some videos about hunting and cooking wild game, but you're missing out, man. You got to do this the right way. Yeah, that's wrong. He's missing out on, it was kind of a cheesy rifle hunt with the hog. But I think we can do way better. And one, I think he need to learn bow hunting just because you're missing out if you don't, here's the problem. Let me speak for Gordon Ramsay real quick cause I met him, I met him briefly in, shook his hand and let's hear that. I think I know him very well.

Speaker 4:          01:03:33       Let them for all 14, 15 seconds. Uh, he doesn't have the time, man. The guy's like 18 different TV shows. I was watching them yell at some dude who was cooking somewhere. He was yelling. Uh, oddly enough the guy was cooking elk and Gordon was complaining about the elk. It was complaining about it being tough and it is inevitable. Good complaint. And the guy aided, he's chewing on and he said his tender and delicious. I'm more with the guy. I think Gordon got a little, he's doing a TV show up man. Oh yeah. I don't want to be cynical. Is playing a character. I don't want to be cynical, but there's a re, first of all, the guy did step way over the line. He said he was trained by some of the greatest chefs in Europe and then Gordon Ramsey called him on and he said, I never said that.

Speaker 4:          01:04:16       And then they had video, they played back. So that guy's obviously a dildo. And then on top of that, unfortunately buddy, sometimes in life we're delta. I've been Deldot, I've been a deldot more than once. People know I haven't been deldot, but I have been one not that way. Not In the actual mechanical sense. Anyway, this guy was trying to explain, um, you know, led, he's not a chef, but then there was video footage of him saying that he was a chef. But the bottom line is Gordon Ramsey, he's playing it up and he's like talking about how terrible the food is and chatting on. I'm like, that's his show. His show was about sort of like kitchen nightmares. It's like I show up and you show has to be, your kitchen has to be a nightmare for kitchen nightmares. T to work. That's the guy.

Speaker 4:          01:04:59       That's the gentleman. We don't need to play this guy. I don't want to shame this young man, this young man. He's on the young man. That's a shame. This guy shit all over. Awesome. But don't you think this is a lot like a guy who doesn't really know archery talking shit to you? Like your Gordon Ramsay and that guy's guy who, you know, I've been finger shooting my whole life. I don't need a release. You know, I don't use a site because I shoot instinctive. And you're like, well, you're just not going to be accurate. And you're like, no, I'm accurate, I'm accurate. And then he shoots and he misses the target and you're like, see, I told Ya and then, but you're a nice guy. Gordon Ramsey is a professional asshole. And I don't mean that in a bad way, but I mean when someone fucks up, that guy comes down and you with the hammer of truth, it's brutal to watch.

Speaker 4:          01:05:44       My seven year old was so annoyed at me. She's like, why are you still watching this? Because we were in the morning, she's someone else. She wanted a roll around on the hoverboards and I was like, just relax one second. I want to see where this goes. Because they were, the guy was like talking about Gordon Ramsey did not know how to cook elk. All right. But then I was watching him cook calc. I'm like, Ooh, I don't think you know. See, that's what I mean. He needs to learn. But here's my argument. You don't have time for archery there. Yeah, but I'm crazy. Exactly. I have a real many, I need, I need, uh, need Gordon to get crazy. He's not going to do it. It's not the same guy. I think he goes at archery. Find the people that you don't want to think. Actually, it's like a game of Tetris, right.

Speaker 4:          01:06:33       As well, falling in place. You've got to figure out where it falls in place. You can't foresee English. So Gordon, Oh, same thing. Give it a try. Basically the same thing. Yup. Right. Yeah. Um, that's her, that's her. I mean, she was completely, she had no, literally no perspective to hunting before we met. I mean, imagine Sharon and I met on a plane to France. We met again on the plane back from France. She was from England. I was from the u s I just happened to be routing through Liverpool. I said, I appreciate, we talked, might not have talked about it on the podcast, but I think did I think, I mean, uh, but it's a great story. Yeah. It is a very good story, better. And then you're like, damn, why didn't get her number? And then you met her again. Hollywood. We need a movie called love at first flight.

Speaker 4:          01:07:23       This is it. You can uh, have nicholas cage play an archer. But I'm just going to go out on a limb which say terrible job. She is from England does not mean that they're the same thing that him and her just like already laying is also from America and he is not as same as me. We are different. He has way more experience with pharmaceutical drugs and heroin. And I have a more experience shooting animals with a pole and Arrow and it will always be such, yeah, do whatever you want to do in this life. You know, I don't think he needs to go out and hunt with a bow and arrow. The one thing is it would require a tremendous learning curve. Right? Especially like my first experiences were, uh, bears over Bait, which is a much easier proposition. It's a very controlled situation. But is,

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       I mean, I think controlled situations are important for any beginner. Yeah. It doesn't matter. Sure. Right. Sparring, when you teach people how to fight, one of the first things I suggest always they spar and advanced belt. They spar. Someone's not going to hurt them. Well, mark talked about that at dinner. We talked about a sparring. Yes. Right. Yeah. And we can, you can read it. Mark and I, we, we, we haven't asked the brain. Yeah. Mark and I actually, uh, I, I played a video for him that I was really disturbed about. We, we actually played it yesterday on the podcast. Did you have, it's a heavy virgil. I haven't watched it yet. No. Yesterday wasn't surgical. Brendan Shab and Brian Kale, we talked about, um, heavy sparring that there's guys that are hitting each other as hard as they possibly can. And all that is, is like an ego exercise.

Speaker 1:          01:09:03       You're not, you're not getting better. You're hurting each other. You're fucking each other's brains up. And Mark and I were talking about that, like how many guys get turned off to sparring because they spar with someone who just beats the shit out of him in a bad gym rather than spars with someone who teaches you just to get touched. You just get touched in the face. So you know you got hit, you know, and someone who's fast but has control and then you learn how to operate without the, the fear and consequences of like a wild Jim Brawl, which is like really common. A lot of gyms, they have brawls where it should be just sparring, but instead you're really just fighting all the time. You're fighting constantly. Those people always wind up with brain damage, like almost always. So Real, real issue with a lot of, um, low level gyms or gyms where people haven't really considered the consequences of their actions.

Speaker 1:          01:10:00       Did you uh, yeah. That's fine. Did you play that video that you showed when we were at dinner? The other guy get knocked out? Is that what it want? Yeah, that's the one. Yeah. Yeah. Mark was like, this would never happen at his gym. Never happened. Mark's amazing. I think it's important. I mean, any type of, any type of beginner needs a controlled situation and you need training wheels. I mean, yeah, it's important and there's that feeling, well this is what I've been preaching forever, is that feeling of not knowing how to do something and trying to figure it out is crucial. As a human being, I think we're human stagnate. That feeling makes people feel weird. They don't like being a loser. They don't like being a beginner. They don't like it. But I think that feeling is crucial because when you get really good at something and you get stagnant and you, you don't worry about it anymore, there's no growth, there's no movement.

Speaker 1:          01:10:56       You know? There's something about that that's very detrimental to the human psyche. It's very detrimental to your growth and your a constant self examination, which a lot of people don't like, but I think is important. This is why I think it's, I think it's important for peace of mind because I think it may bring rocky moments where you, you don't like what you find and you just feel like, God, can I just just, just be cool with everything and real. But I think through that path, those rocky moments, you get to understand yourself in a very pure way versus understanding the projection of who you would like people to think you are, which is what most people exist in. Most people exist in this world of slippery shoes and shiny fucking cars and ties and wearing the right things and saying the right things. All those things are sort of designed to project an image that's not necessarily you.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       It's a cheap way of getting people to think greater of you. Whereas the only way that people think that the really know who you are is see you doing something hard, see, see you doing something difficult. They don't know who you are. If you show up and the, the camera's start flash and you're on the red car, but you're in the perfect suit, you hop out of a limo. You've got a gorgeous girl and your arm don't know Jack Shit about that. It looks amazing. I'd like to be that guy. Everybody would, but they don't know God damn thing about you, but if they saw you at mile 59 of a 200 mile race and you're shitting yourself over a cactus in the middle of the funnel, in the middle of the mountains, the campaigns, then then they would know who you really are and I think this is also one of the reasons why a guy like you,

Speaker 7:          01:12:42       you're hesitant close to yes, my litmus sex is hunting. Well it's, I mean not hard. If I'm, if I ever really am at a point where I feel like is this going to be a legitimate friend or is this going to be someone that I just do business with, then that's, that's where I test it is in something tough because those people, to me, those people put themselves, you're probably the same. There's maybe six or seven people that I talk to on a daily basis and then there's like a different tier to that, but that is my litmus test. If, if people can can do those things and really proved themselves like at the tough, tough, tough times. If you handle it. Yeah. If they can handle it. Those are the people that I want around me. That's the tree for fuel, right know. Yeah, because when you're ready to be like, should I just take a break right now and they're still going. You're like, I'm not going to let him beat me cause he was going to ride me at the end. Have you seen ever seen Jockos video? It's just called good. Ah,

Speaker 1:          01:13:59       you haven't seen it play at Jamie. Find that. It's one of my favorite videos on the Internet. There's a lot of videos on the Internet.

Speaker 7:          01:14:07       Crazy isn't the world that Jacko and I met in

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       an, we literally pass each other in an airport. Pretty crazy. Took, we both had a just enough time to take a selfie and we texted it to you. Remember that? Yes. Yeah. It was amazing. Let's, we're going to play it because this one thing I know the Jocko would never flag us off youtube.

Speaker 8:          01:14:29       One of my direct subordinates, one of my guys that worked for me, he would, he would call me up or pull me aside with some major problem, some issue that was going on and he'd say, boss, we got this and that and the other thing. And I look at him and I'd say, good. And finally one day he was telling me about some issue that he was having some problem and he said, I already know what you're going to say. I said, well, what am I going to say? You said you're going to say good.

Speaker 9:          01:14:56       Uh,

Speaker 8:          01:14:59       he said, that's what you always say when something is wrong in going bad. You always just look at me and say good. And I said, well, yeah, when things are going bad there's going to be some good that's going to come from it.

Speaker 10:         01:15:17       Didn't get the new high speed gear we wanted. Good, didn't get promoted. Oh, mission got canceled. Good. We can focus on our own, didn't get funded, didn't get the job you wanted. Got Injured, sprained my ankle, got tapped out. Good, got beat. Unexpected problems. We have the opportunity to figure out a solution.

Speaker 8:          01:15:53       That's it. When things are going bad, don't get all bummed out.

Speaker 10:         01:15:57       Don't get startled. Don't get frustrated. If you can say the word good, guess what need. You're still alive. It meets. You're still grieving and if you're still breathing, you still got some fight left it. Come on, get up,

Speaker 8:          01:16:24       dust off, reload, recalibrate, reengage. Go out on the attack. Come on

Speaker 5:          01:16:36       Sun. Dang. If that doesn't make you find out, oh, you need to go to a doctor. Can people hear that on the podcast? If like downloading the itunes that hear that for sure. Yeah, we're playing that. Listen, if you listen to an empty friends in here, I'd punch someone in the face, right? I want to shoot a broadhead through someone's neck. That's what Jocko is all about. Man. When I run, I literally hear that sometimes when I'm fucking exhausted, I'm going to hit the high hills. Never ran to that. If I did, I'd, I wouldn't even be here right now. Die of a heart attack somewhere out of fricking had a cardiac arrest. I don't listen to it too. When I run because I really believe that listening to music when you're running is cheating. Why? Why try? Cause that's easier. Are you kidding? I'm serious. Yeah. Well I think that when you run, it should be in your mind. You should be, you're such an issue with your thoughts alone. And I think that when you run and you listen to music, it's easier. Therefore it's cheating.

Speaker 5:          01:17:40       I'm pissed right now. Last time, two homos running with your walkmans with your ear plugs on. Alright, go five miles. Then their ear buds. You think it's different? It's different to go two miles and five miles to do. You need, I can do two miles in 20 minutes. Right? But can you do two miles in the hills? Tribe miles is probably easier to to, it's just overall, it's as longer distracting an hour. Right? So you have to listen to music. You, Brittany Spears gets you through the last three. Don't have to, it helps with like the mind games. Sure. I'm sure. But that's the whole idea. It's cheating. I'm pissed. So I was wearing shoes then. Yes, you're right. You're right. It is wearing. Wearing shoes is cheating. What? Yeah, you should be careful. Here we go. We were watching a video the other day that Jamie almost made me throw up.

Speaker 5:          01:18:29       It was a dude who was carving off of his callouses with a knife. He had cows that were so thick. He had a knife out and he was carving the cows off and then a dog was eating them. Well, I don't know about the dog eating part, but I've definitely carved up calluses. Ever seen counselors like this? I mean, I dunno. This guy looked like he'd been walking barefoot for several years. I'm just pissed because last time I was here you talked about the fact that's it. Would I talk about last? Do we have that coin flipped over saying, yes, please. Oh, the Brazilian Shahaz Korea coin. Look at this. Look at this. Fucking, come on. Look at this. It carving off chunks of his callous with a fucking knife dude, and the dog's going to eat that. Of course he will says, man cuts calluses off his foot with calyces.

Speaker 5:          01:19:20       That's all dead foot like Mr Deeds is on youtube right now. He's moving around though. He's alive. Look at that. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Come on son. It's got a goddamn fillet knife. She, anyone who's anyone who's watching with the podcast, anyone who's listening to this podcast bring up please youtube. This dog dog's going to eat it. That's a starving dog. I liked that. Beagle dogs confused. It's like, am I? He's like, is this blue cheese or is this humans? It's this blue cheese. There's just a little trimmed. It's a hard video to get over. I thought I saw that video. I had to take a leak at like five o'clock in the morning. I try. I always do this, man. I was, I'm thirsty at night and I'm like, you shouldn't drink because if you drink then you going to wake up in the middle of the night.

Speaker 5:          01:20:06       You're going to have to pee. You know that thing, but on my bed, I'm thirsty. Fuck it. I'll deal with that later. I'm going to live in the moment kind of guy. Oh yeah, and if I've got your pen and all I'm thinking about when I'm painting, I'm shaking my head thinking about that dude chopping cows is off his foot with a goddamn cleaver. I like that. I think they could serve that with a cheese plate. That guy probably runs barefoot like, well, last time I was here serious calcis you talk to me about having kettlebells and random places so that as you walk by him you can just grab them, do a few sets, go to failure, right? Yeah. Now you're fricking running with no music because it makes it tough or yeah. I don't want to be a pussy. All those people running with music. You heard me? People listen to the Rogan podcasts right now while they're running. Turn it off.

Speaker 5:          01:20:58       So some kidding Jesus Christ. I don't really think your pussy. I listened to music all the time when I'm on an elliptical machine. If that makes you feel better. You told James Hatfield but Hetfield that you listened to his podcasts that more or is a new record that morning until you, you're working out? I did, yeah. It was in the gym lifting. That's your pussy. It came from a town make that mongoose bike. I like the fact that we talk is still going hard. I mean they like 85 years old. I went to their concert and I will, my buddy torsten, his wife Trina, she works for q prime, hooked me up on some tickets to the metallica concert in Iowa dam and they freaking rocked. See what does this, this guy him from metallica on the world wide tour. Get rid of the Goddamn pop up son of a bitch.

Speaker 5:          01:21:56       I know. What is this? Jim Brewer is actually the one who oh, there he is. Oh, another popup. Jesus Christ. Welcome to the world. We live in. Pop it. People are so greedy. Crazy. Yesterday Sharon was looking, cause I'm still, I still have my real wedding ring on the wedding ring. I have mine too. I know. But have you seen any of those weird uh, videos of people stripping their fingers off on pull up bars and stuff? I have a friend who had to get an operation, not friend. Uh, dude, I know who had to get an operation because uh, while he was doing Jujitsu, now he knows he's not on the list. Well, I know. Um, but I don't know him. I don't have his number. Okay. I don't have your number or your email and never emailed him. Anyway, his, uh, his wedding ring bent and dug into his finger while I was training something happened.

Speaker 5:          01:22:48       Imagine how strong like an arm bar has the knee or the pressure on your joints, whatever the fuck it was. But it dug into his fingers so deeply that he had to get it sorted. Jitsu been terrain Jujitsu. Oh my God. Oh my God. Indeed. What do you got pictures to Jitsu but not happen to Jimmy Fallon, like injury that caused ring ambulation bout with ring ambulation of finger injury. That looks and sounds like something from a horror movie. Okay. Let's suppose that was his wedding ring as well. Yes. Rip The skin off his whole finger. I think I'm down. I'm down for the Tattoo. I'll get that bone. I'll get that queer red wedding a, you know that tattoo that guys get. I've tried to get it, but they talked us out of it. Two different tattoo places said it was the jinx said if he, if you do it, it's like the curse.

Speaker 5:          01:23:41       That's not true. My friend Big John McCarthy has that shit. He's been married forever. Happily married. It's give a time. Nah, sorry John. How long can it last? I mean, he's almost dead. I'm just kidding. I Dang. That's ruthless. He's super nice. He's the, I've met him. He's the guy. He's Super Nice, but I'm just kidding. She brings her archaic. You know there, there's a company that makes a rubber ring. Yeah, yeah. Literally. That's what I was talking about. Yes. I tried to put that shit on. My wife had spit my face. Here's what's weird. My Sharon was going to buy me that four just because I kept telling her like, I'm worried about ripping this finger off. Right. Mainly because of my wedding ring is definitely too small, so she was looking at some of those, a silicone rings and we were literally looking at it on her ipad in my kitchen.

Speaker 5:          01:24:34       I open instagram and started looking. It's like sponsored ad buy that ring company. Isn't that what's weird? It's very weird. We were just talking about that. We're just talking about that the other day that we stuff you Jamie and whoever was on the podcast we were talking about like having a conversation and if you have like Alexa or if you have like certain things that like listen to you while you're talking like maybe even possibly Siri and then all of a sudden you'll go to google and what you were talking about like slick trick broadheads or some shit like that will show up in your Google ads. You're like, what in the fuck? Maybe series series a total fricking. She is a peeping Tom. He's a two face little Ho. She, I don't think she's too faced. I think Shay Siri, she doesn't have a single face.

Speaker 5:          01:25:28       You're a two faced bitch. Oh, you're not connected. Is that a bad thing though? I know it. It's weird and it's that bad. I mean at at potentially you could view that as something like, I would probably want to buy that and now that it's here in an easier way for me to do it, that is kind of, I'm just going, Jamie, if you say, Oh my God, I'm gonna die out here. At that time, Siri can step in and say, would you like me to call a helicopter? But when you're looking at rubber rings for your wedding ring and then it shows up on your laptop. Yeah. At that point he's a sell. Get to the bottom of this. Well, it most certainly exists with Google because I've, I've looked at like, what are you? Cheers. I've looked at some, you're milking it over there. I'm all right. Sadly, I smoked pot though. You didn't. Oh, you did a little sh. Don't tell any sponsors. I might've made that last part up. This. The problem is like you'll be looking at something super obscure like a, like a casio watch sound like casio. That's Cassio.

Speaker 6:          01:26:37       Yeah. All right.

Speaker 5:          01:26:39       It's, it has its good one. I like this one. It's like a pro tech and that totally doesn't limiter and a an accomplice in it. Totally. It doesn't look like it. It is a casio Lord. Come on. Well, no shit but the eye, but then all of a sudden it'll show you whatever you search for, whatever it was, whether it's surf ports or fucking Hilda Berg tents. There'll be for sale and you'll see like amazon.com ads for like what? Like I was looking at Zeiss by knows the other day I read. Talked about it. Yes, actually, yeah, but then I read a review on them and I actually googled them, but then like everywhere I went, if I went online, I would see a little google ad for Zeiss by knows. I'm like, this is kind of creepy, but that's different. I think if you google search it, you're on the grid. You are. If you're on someone else's device in your home kitchen, it's not like I was looking at it on mine. Right. I was on Sharon's Ipad then, oh, she was ordering me a ring on her ipad and we were talking about it. Then I opened my instagram up and hears the silicone rings as a sponsored recommendation within my instagram feed.

Speaker 6:          01:27:57       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:27:58       he's backing up. You gotta back it up, back it up. Oh, I want a drink of water. Go back to that. Gmail is free for a reason. These are all free services we're using and not paying for, so you have to give up a little bit to get these cool things to give up your, I get it. Your privilege. Here's my position. My whole, everything I think of is out there. I'm a professional talker. Every, every the most fucked up ideas I've ever had have all been recorded. Very true. 100% true. There's no getting around that. Like I don't have any highly put some crazy stuff. Anybody would anybody I, I'm telling you, there's nothing special about me. Anybody would, if you didn't have a job and you had enough free time and you were worried about paying your bills and we'd have to think you are, you were in tune with the universe. Anybody would, we all would. It's nothing special me. Cheers

Speaker 4:          01:29:03       Andy. Powerful about that. Freak jumping off cliffs flying around and posted his video today. I know you want some of that. No. Good. Good for you. I'm glad you stay away from this. This is a bad drug. Is the God that this is a drug that government doesn't approve of.

Speaker 7:          01:29:23       California does. Jeff sessions was in town today. Kick grief. Who's telling people? Stop letting Mexicans are watching this. It's actually five feet away from me, but it looked like a fog machine and Hollywood right there. Like some horror movie. Yeah. Do you know, um, remember when I talked, have you ever listen to my podcast with Mike's linkerd with hex? Yes. I've listened to every podcast you've ever done. That's crazy. Knock on.tv. That's not done. Not Gone. Podcast. Yeah. Nope. Um, Mike actually went to Dr. McGee. Did he? Yeah, he couldn't pull his boat for almost a year because he had so many problems in the shoulder and he was really dreading the surgery because he was worried about his downtime and I told him like, man, you need to to call Rati because there's a possibility you don't need the knife. And so he went down there and he ended up getting in an injection I think in September or October, and then he came hunting with me in November and we actually shot together and he goes, this is the first time I've been able to shoot my boat in a long, long time. It's crazy. Wow, that's amazing.

Speaker 4:          01:30:48       It's just so cool that there's something like that out there for people and there's a bunch of different versions of it. I know people that have had really good results where some places they take the stem cells out of your fat. They like to give you a little baby liposuction, pull some fat out, take the stem cells, mix it up, shoot it into joints. People who had real positive results with that. It's weird that we ha we did it the way we did it with the blood, but then there's also the out of the bone marrow, which is supposed to be more painful. It's supposed to be more painful, but it's also supposed to be really effective. Ah, Daniel Cormier had that done. He had real good results with that. He had that done with a knee injury and uh, he was concerned like I think I believe on, on to speak out of school.

Speaker 4:          01:31:30       I'm pretty sure it was an MCL wasn't um, the big one. It wasn't the acl. The acl is the big one. That's a tough one because that's the stabilizer one. That's the one that goes through the center of the knee. I blown, blown both of those out heavy. Really? Yeah. Even both cut on or, yeah, both of them reconstructed. Yeah. The first one I had done where they take a chunk of your patella tendon with a piece of your knee cap and a piece of your Shin and they open you up like a trout and they fucking screw that baby in. I don't know if I've ever seen the front of your knee cap. Yeah, you can see it. There's like, that's a big cut. Normally get those barbell jeans up. These are by the Belgians minor to also not a sponsor. You can kind of see they're awesome guys.

Speaker 4:          01:32:18       Well, it's a great product. There's calf out there that I'm not flexing and that's just what my calf, I am, I'm not, I am, I have large your flex. I'm not, I'm the rock. I'm not at all. Look, look, see, I'm losing. I'm very loose. Flicks him. Um, so I wanna look cool. This is great now, but it was, it was in pain for a year. A solid year. Like I couldn't kneel net, no kneeling. There was no kneeling going on. If I had to suck Dick, I'd be in real trouble. I have to lie on the bed. Let it do not my face. There was no way I'd be able to say that's the alcohol talking. The point is, it was painful. But the other one that I had done a, I had it done with a another planet. I had it done with a cadaver and that way, way easier.

Speaker 4:          01:33:05       Yeah. That was ways you're in, but way weirder because you're thinking about it. You get some dead person's parts in your body. My father, well, I shouldn't say that. Sharon stepdad has a pig heart and he's pretty proud of it. Wow. He has a pig heart grew it in a pig. What you mean it's a pig heart like it's his, no, they used a pig valve in his heart. Okay. They can't do that with a whole heart. I don't think so. But they can do with parts. Right. Pigs are super similar apparently to people with certain organs to the point where they think that there might be a time where we, uh, use genetic engineering to manipulate a pig to grow a human body. Parts what? Yeah, they're real, they're real close apparently to figuring out a way to combine human. They're scientists grow bullish on paid to human transplants.

Speaker 4:          01:34:02       Jamie just pulled up an article. It's Baltimore. It's the website science mag.org. And uh, this is something that they've apparent. There's apparently enough similarity. This is coming from a dummy, by the way, settle down enough similarity between pigs and humans that we might be able to grow their organs, grow our organs rather inside of them. And so like if you need to, if he needed a new liver or a kidney or if you needed maybe even a heart, something they could possibly grow it inside of this genetically altered pig cause they're really close to us.

Speaker 4:          01:34:42       It's Freaky Shit, man. It's definitely freaky. It's freaky shit because, uh, one of the things that I've gotten more and more adamant about from, um, being around wild animals, um, is that that's really the only way animals should be. I mean, there's one thing like your dog like shades. Yup. I don't want the shades to be wild. She's a sweetie. Right. You know what I mean? She wouldn't make it. That's a different thing. She wouldn't make it different thing. Pat is a different thing and anybody thinks to start a different, that's a family member. Uh, my pets are family members, my dog, my, you know, if, if I have an interaction with a dog, it's like I love them. And this is not the same as, um, the way I feel about a wild thing. Wild thing. I want to be wild. Really want them to be wild because I just think that we fucked up.

Speaker 4:          01:35:40       We got real comfortable with this way of a raising and treating life outside of our own species. Even her own, she would argue. Sure. Right, and you'd be right. You've been around. Even her own has been, I think the whole, I think the whole picture is completely different now. People won't get it. I mean we want our, our pet dog to be part of our family, but the reality is if they were legitimately out there in the wild, they would be dead quick. My kids got rabbits, they're useless. They don't give a fuck about these rabbits, which we talked about this in favor like we have to give rabbits, but okay, okay, we'll get rabbits. They don't give a fuck about those rabbits. They go like a week without even looking at those things. They just don't care. And the rabbit stay chill with the chickens in the chicken coop.

Speaker 4:          01:36:39       So everybody's good rabbit's, you're having a good old time. They're selfish too. Here's the thing, what rabbit is, is a small prey animal that has to dapped its environment. So if its environment, it's just them being outside by themselves all the time. Well, as you expected them to be domesticated, they're basically wild in the cage. You know, they're not constantly getting direct contact with people, but don't you think some people could be argued the same? You have for sure, but a button. But he was the one, I haven't let you see this yet. I'll let you finish your point. This is just such a difference between them and a dog. Like the idea of that a rabbit interacts with you with the way it fucking dog does is bananas. You're losing me if you don't tell me you like dogs more than you like rabbits. I can't talk to you because I've got dogs that are like little people. All right. I mean they're, they're like when my friends like Marshall's, my friend, he's a one year old friend that I have. I have one friend who's one years old. This dude and he's literally your best friend and he, there's like, do nothing separating you from his best friend. No, we're, we're super tight. We're like this. As long as he doesn't steal food off the table, which she will if I'm not looking. That's your side

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       to his side. He's 100% dedicated unit. Even if you stoled food from his side, he would still be your best friend the next day. 100% he's just gotta know the rules can be stealing food, can be climbing on the table and he fucking savage like dogs would just jump on the table and just, you don't realize how like, oh that's a course. That's is the food is, why would he jump up there? It's amazing you've been able to stop him from jumping up there. The moment he gets in the room. That's what's really amazing. Here's what's crazy though. If people had to really go out in the world and defend them, fen defend themselves like our dogs would that are technically family members, there would be a very clear line drawn. Yes, but they don't and that's why we're delusional. And then there's movies, Disney movies, Bambi, all that crazy shit.

Speaker 2:          01:38:47       Yogi and booboo. But Molly's that rabbit movie. Cause when we got on this subject, most recent one? No. Sharon brought up that movie that was like the darkest kids movie. Does it ted? No, it was, it was a rabbit movie. Rabbit movie. What was the name of it? Look it up, Jamie. It was like, it was considered one of the, I don't know, one of the darkest kids movies. It was where it was all about rabbits and I'm trying to think of the name of it. It was, I don't even know what that is. I, there was a youtube video showing pretty much, it was like a highlight reel of that movie and it was too, I think a mirror inland Manson song and it was crazy. It was pretty dark. I think it was called bright eyes or maybe that was the theme song to the movie.

Speaker 2:          01:39:38       Bright Eyes. A dark rabbit. Mophie dumb, dumb, dumb. Seriously. You need to look that up on Youtube. Little by a right eyes. Imagine fuck bigfoot Matt. Just seven foot rabbit. I tries to bite your head off with those giant teeth. I don't know, seven foot rabbit. I don't know if I'd be that terrified, terrified. Seven foot Grizzly, I'd be way more terrifying. Sure. Seven foot crocodile way more terrified. Okay. Komodo Dragon. Did you find it? What does leadership down? Maybe that's it. That's it. Pressing rabbit moving it is to die. Remember this, he needed to watch this. Wow. Watershed Cam trailer. If we play it, we'll get yanked off of youtube. But can you play that? Uh, we can't play any clips today. It's crazy today. What's going on? Well, after the hold up, it's not, go ahead and take a, take a leak. Hey Jamie, that while we're talking about alligators or crocodiles, you gotta see this? This is actually, um, one of the guys that dragons, yeah. This is a new short film coming up. This is one of the guys that is, he documents wildlife, um,

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       that mouth and he's, he's a hex advocate, but he wasn't a hex advocate first. He was a, well, let's explain what hexis you can explain it. A hecs rather is a, it's a company that makes um, these suits that apparently the idea is that they block and electro magnetic frequency that people admit is that I saying, yeah, you're good and electromagnetic current. There's something body emits that they think John Dudley has left the room. He has to pee. I don't know. This is the, the most honest way I can say this. Um, John is a big believer in this heck system and I don't know if it works but I know a lot of people think it works and there is a task that they use where there's a machine, see if he could find, they have a video of him explaining how it works. And in the video it says it in there.

Speaker 1:          01:41:57       There's a, on the website there's a video link. See the video link? Yeah. Um, see where it says videos. Uh, third from the, yeah, there is um, there's something where they show the, they can swipe their arm over some sort of a machine that is designed to detect electrical current that comes from your body. And they do it with just a normal arm with like a shirt on and then they do it with this heck suit on and the heck suit it blocks whatever that frequency is. And so the idea is that we're assuming that somehow or another the animals might have some sort of method of detection by way of the actual electrical energy that's come from a person. Do I know if that's correct? I do not. I do not know if that's correct. It's fascinating to think of though, because I wonder how many different animals have this interesting sort of ability to detect things other than just smelling and seeing.

Speaker 1:          01:42:58       Like maybe there's a feel, maybe they have a feel and apparently these things are particularly effective with predators, which kind of makes sense. I guess that predators would, it would feel the electrical frequency that's coming from a UN nervous scared animal or something he's trying to run from it. And um, these things are really effective apparently with coyotes. And this is this documentary or this little short film rather, uh, dances, dancing with dragons. Perfect timing. I just explained hacks to a t. I'm a wizard without knowing shit, barely got through high school. This is, um, so apparently this signal, whatever the, the human signal is, I mean that the fact that they can detect it in this machine and I've watched that detection, it's real. It's legitimate. So something's happening that the machine detects. I think we'd be foolhardy to believe that animals can't detect that as well. Now is that mean that it will work on everything and no, believer, I'm a believer too, but this is what I think. I think it's, there's a whole, there's so many factors when it comes to getting close to an animal. I think they have so many senses. I think they could smell in some insane way that we can't even imagine. They can hear shit. We can never here. They're just tuned in the idea that that would be it. That they wouldn't have some other shit that we haven't really thought of.

Speaker 7:          01:44:20       This would be a good guest for you. [inaudible] name is forrest Scullin. Tay is actually, um, he's got some really cool stuff coming up that I'm not able to talk about, but I, I know you and now tell me the things over. I know you enough to know that it's in your wheelhouse, but, uh, this is all a hundred percent wild, I think, I don't want to say it wrong, but I think it's at a certain place down south of Mexico. This, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So this, um, he had, he just had a documentary that came out. He's in a document, he's in a heck suit that actually has a pattern that resembles the saltwater crocodiles. Wow. Did you notice that part? I did not want, but I only did once you brought it up, I was mimicking, he's mimicking the behaviors of a saltwater croc so that he can literally be within a few inches of them.

Speaker 1:          01:45:21       So did they wa they would probably be real dangerous to try that even the way he did it. But did they try it without the heck suit? Like did they try like a, like a rash guard that with the same exact

Speaker 7:          01:45:32       pattern on it? Yeah. Yeah. There's, there's, there's a lot of really good videos showing the difference between how much interaction you can have with certain animals that, especially ones that have, it's scientifically been proven to test to sense it. Yeah. So you know, in the wildlife community things like sharks and shark week obviously have a huge amount of funding behind it. A migratory birds, same thing. So all that stuff. There's been very good documentation on, you know, electromagnetic fields and what animals can see. But when it comes to like the hunting community, obviously there's not a lot of big funding behind it because it's a much smaller community. But things like this, things that are on animal planet or Discovery Channel, I mean these are things that are at I think a higher level of maybe testing versus what we have in the hunting side. And I just know that me personally as a hunter, I've experienced more like up close interaction with it. So I just find some of this stuff really, really cool, all

Speaker 1:          01:46:44       that, that's like a placebo effect that you may be just, we're in a really good spot with really good wind. And you had a few experiences, so you put it together and he said, this is what's happening. Is it possible?

Speaker 7:          01:46:54       It's possible, but in the same sense, I'll leave that up to you. I think it's possible too, but I just want, I brought it up

Speaker 1:          01:47:01       because I think, I think it's possible, but I think people want one or the other. Right. And I think it's also entirely possible if there's a machine that can detect your electrical magnetic frequency or whatever the fuck that is. When they do it over that machine to there is there is and I've seen it. Yeah. Okay. So what's happening there and why are we assuming animals can't see that? Definitely didn't see at night. They could see at night. Right? They do things that we can't do. They smell things. We can't smell the hear things we can't hear. We have intuition. Why would we assume that their intuition is not thousands of times sharper than ours? They're running away from fucking crocodiles and shit.

Speaker 7:          01:47:35       Do you know that? Um, I know when you did the podcast with James Hetfield, you guys talked about bees a lot. Do you know that bees when they go to and from certain flowers that actually they leave in an electromagnetic signal on that part so that actually other bees can see that and know that something is another b had already been there to pollinate that area. Oh, I've got a video I can show you that actually shows that. But um, did I ever tell you about my experience with bees on fear factor? Yeah. Super Cool. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:48:14       They got together, this was a crazy moment. They had trained be communication contests. These bees of this guy had brought in who's a beekeeper and then while we were doing the stunt on these people and they put the bees on these people, all of a sudden this local beehive emptied out and came to visit and they all, all the bees got together in the middle of the sky and talked and we had a sit down for like a half an hour. The guy was like, you know, we're not gonna do anything. We're going to do that. We have to step back and let them work this out. So he just knew. He knew how like these alien beings we're going to communicate with each other, how they're figuring out their life forms, man. And we're just like, oh it's just bs. No it's on, it's a little weird life form that can fly that somehow under the figures out they exchange information with these other weird life forms. They realize, hey we don't, we didn't ask to be here. We're not trying to take over your community. We just, we showed up cause we're doing fear factor.

Speaker 7:          01:49:08       He know the wiggle dance. The little thing that bees do, the wiggle dance, what is that? They say that's, they assume that's that that's actually an electromagnetic dance that's done to where it gives a signal to the other bees to where they can actually know what they're communicating so they can say things. Yep. Did they know like how complicated the speech can be? Well, I mean, obviously if a bee is sitting in a hive in my Bush out in my front yard and he knows to go three blocks down and two blocks over and get into

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       those purple flowers that are in someone's front yard, they must know pretty dang good too. They know. I mean, we just, we just left. They had a heck suit on. They probably wouldn't be able to figure it out, be screwed. That's an interesting idea, man. That there is really some sort of electrical fee. Whoa. Electrical fields of flowers. Jane simulate the sensory hairs of bumblebees. Holy Shit, dude. Heck seen on a bumblebee. And he's like, nothing's getting pollinated. Listened what that says electrical fields of flowers stimulate the sensory hairs of Bumblebee. So their hairs are feeling where the wind is pulling them. They're, they're feeling some sort of electrical charge to a certain little, little green, the dance solid fuck man, that is, we're just, because they can't send emails, they don't do anything. That's really, we weave so slept on bays. They're dying off like they're crazy because they're super cool.

Speaker 5:          01:50:51       These are super, they're super cool. Yup. Yeah. Yup. People that don't give a fuck about bees like those are like the most hardcore, the most hardcore radical Republican guys. All right, we'll figure out mechanical piece. Don't worry about it. There was a black mirror, just people that are like that. Man. That was a good show dude. He started sharing and I started watching it because of you. Did you watch the dog one with the robot dogs? Yeah, we watched them. It was a fucking terrifying show, right? Cause you're like, oh, this is all like, well, within the realm of possibility, all of it. It's almost like a warning show. It's like gay Fuckos. This is what could go wrong. Every episode of that. Did you see the one with The v? I don't want to give any spoilers or words with the video game that they put a chip in your brain.

Speaker 5:          01:51:41       You see that one? Yup. Holy Shit Man. That's 100% going to happen. It's going to happen. Oh my God, we're so fucked. We're so fucked. We're so fucked. It's going to have bad. It will get bad. It's going to get really good too. I think it's the, it's at the same time. Yeah, that is true. I think it's going to get weird and it's going to get really good. I'm, I'm very optimistic, you know, a lot of the most, I don't know, a lot of the most informative stuff that I learn each and every day are from my boy that is in college right now, Harry. Yeah. And uh, actually I think he's in charge of, uh, his science clubs, social media. I forget what it's, I forget the instagram. You don't have to look it up, Jamie, but I think it's like Simpson Simpson Chemistry club or something. But he's every day, every week he posts different Kim facts,

Speaker 7:          01:52:46       like chemistry, facts. Science is crazy. If you're someone who doesn't really study it, there's a lot of ridiculous information out there. You start looking at that and you realize any of the stuff that we're talking about, it's 100% possible.

Speaker 1:          01:53:02       Well, there's, every new innovation builds on potential new innovations that branch off of them and they're were always constantly pushing the curve. It's like they're not staying stagnant in any industry. Like there's nothing where technologically everybody's stagnant. Whether it's automobiles, automobiles, like they're, they're getting better and better every day. Computers better and better. Everyday phones, better and better everyday tvs, better in bed. It's just never ending. It's not there. They are on this constant state of innovation and progression that is really stunning to watch because we're almost like watching some cascade of complexity that is reaching some infinite point. Did the, the newest, latest a htc vives, these um, uh, virtual reality goggles that you put on there, just they're letting you know, hey, this is the future. The future's other realities in pill form. Other realities that are going to be able to put your hand on a building. It's going to send you into another dimension. I mean, these are really real things that are going to address real matrix. Really make real matrix within 50 years.

Speaker 7:          01:54:10       In 50 years. Do you think it will desensitize a mean? They say video game. Well, back in our day they said music, right? Music was what? Desensitize people, right? That's the basis of

Speaker 1:          01:54:25       now they say video games. This is right now, it's, trump recently said video games are causing violence, which is like, come on man.

Speaker 7:          01:54:32       I don't know if it's causing violence, but I would certainly, I would certainly think that people desensitized to blood and Gore. Yeah, because I mean you're right. Back when, back when we were, well you would have been before me, but like, I don't know, grand theft auto. It was a little bit after my time. Like for me it was mortal Kombat. Oh yeah. The adult population couldn't stand mortal Kombat because you ripped someone's spine out and held it up in the air and that was it calling. Can you talk about that though? Instead of being desensitized, aren't they just not sensitive enough yet because they haven't been exposed to it? So like you write the piece of what you're describing, a combat lived through Vietnam. Like they, they saw all of that

Speaker 1:          01:55:22       as kids. You're a hundred percent correct. Powerful young Jamie. Yeah. Good point. That's a very good, very good point. That's a super good point because that's really exactly what's happening. You know, they're not experiencing real violence and maybe that's the answer. Maybe it was like the, a real understanding of what real violence is, what would make you more of

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       real violence. So the more disconnected we are with real violence, the more, almost as cartoonish expression of violence as being an alternative for being bored, being an alternative, being like bullied or tortured. Like instead of something to be avoided. It's like your, your last hurrah before you exit this life. Like you're, you've, you've flipped over the board game, you've pulled the plug out on the video game ness and this is what, like extreme violences that it seems to be more of that maybe even than anything. Definitely could be. I mean, you know, my boy is a, he's going to school to be a vet and he's been, you know, he's able to, to look at, luckily he works for a veterinary clinic in our town and he's personally been there for surgeries and he's been there for several years. So he's seen a lot of things.

Speaker 2:          01:56:40       But, uh, the doctors were originally telling him, you know, hey, if you feel a little bit sensitive this, or if you feel like you might pass out, let us know. But you know, Harry has been with me through a big portion of his life, so he's seen one of these things, seeing things get shot, and he'd seen things get, feel dressed, he's seen things get broken apart and he's seen things get cooked for the family. So he's literally seen all the stages of really what life is. It's a port, you know, it's living, it's dying, and then it's being consumed by what is living. So, you know, they were a little bit surprised by the fact that he understood all that. But I think because he's experienced that he did understand it. Oh, for sure. I mean, he's experiencing it in a real life scenario versus in a video or in a book, right?

Speaker 2:          01:57:43       You just, there's no way to learn life from a video or a book. What you can do is get exposed to ideas that will intrigue you and you want to have those experiences. But this is a giant difference. It's like the difference between watching porn and having sex, I literally is right. I mean that's the perfect example. Yeah, it actually is. It is the perfect example of that. You have to experience things and until you do, you don't know. And you know, we're always battling for, you know, people take us seriously. We're always battling for our position in the social food chain and all that clouds the way we communicate with each other too. I think we just have to get way better at this and I think we're operating on some were we're in like this weird snake shedding of the skin stage. We're just got to shake off all the stupid shit that was invented by slave owners. All the dumb shit that's been like involved in our system from the beginning. We have to realize like no one knows what the fuck's going on.

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       We have to look at everything for what it really is and forget about the past.

Speaker 7:          01:58:46       Can we do right now? What can we do right now? And do you think it's like a lot of things in life where you really, really liked something in, you almost go too far and then in the end you think, okay, we've gone maybe a little bit too far. We're going to back things off. Do you think that's the truth and what we're doing right now? Do you think we're almost becoming too lenient? And then we're going to get to the point where like, you know what, we have to have some, some discipline to where I wasn't a starbucks the other day I thought about posting it, but I didn't, I actually thought about sending it to you, but I didn't. But it was, it was in a starbucks and it said, uh, there was a bathroom that said any sex and there was a male, a woman and a guy in a wheelchair. I'm like, since when? Since when is a a person in a wheelchair, a sex like, you know, it's almost like they're afraid to, to put something on the door to where they just make it as broad as possible and it's like, you know, we have to have, we have to have some lines. Otherwise it's just nothing but gray. Well there's not,

Speaker 1:          02:00:05       here's the thing man. I think all this is in response to the idea that men and women are competing against each other. I think that's what we've got to cut the shit.

Speaker 7:          02:00:13       I think if this idea that like there's a diff, like there's no doubt

Speaker 1:          02:00:21       that you need women

Speaker 1:          02:00:24       and you need men. We need humans, right? We need each other. Yup. So we've got to figure out like why is everybody so hung up on gender? Is there an imbalance? And whatever that imbalance is, it's got to be corrected, but it's got to be corrected honorably and it's got to be corrected. Honestly. Like we have to be nice to each other. All of us, we like each other. Girls like boys, boys like girls. That's how it's always been. And any aberrations of that can really fuck your head up, but I think they're more aberrations than they are the norm and I think we have to figure out how to make those aberrations lesser and lesser and no one's concentrating on that. Instead, they're concentrating on boys versus girls and I think that's crazy. It's like if you only like men, I can't hang out with you, dude.

Speaker 1:          02:01:08       You're going to say some fucked up shit about women and I'm going to go, that's my daughter. That's my sister. That's my mom. You can't do that. Like this idea that like we're on a team and we're on team dicks and team vaginas trying to fucking steal our gold. Like this is stupid. It's stupid. It's stupid. We can't do that anymore. Just like we can't do team white people. Right. That's not good either. It's not good team. A fucking beige people. If you all beige people, all beige people speak Spanish, get on a team. Come on. What are we doing? It's all the same. It's whether it's, whether it's sexual orientation, whether it's gay, straight, whether it's black, white, male, female, Asian, Spanish, Galleon people, people, nice people, interesting people, different people. We have to learn that we're in a global community, like who really have to figure it out. And we're closer and closer than we've ever been before. But along the way we're going to get ridiculous shit. We're going to get like people that are completely overreacting and all men are sexist and all men are rapists and all sex with a penis and vagina is rape. And there's like, there's a lot of that going on right now, but that's, those are the echoes of the farthest reaches of the idea. And then that idea, we'll pull back into the middle and then the general consensus will be established. That's what people do.

Speaker 7:          02:02:25       Did I ever tell you about the time I went to India? No, I did. I don't think so. I went to India for just short of a month coaching. And uh, you did tell me this. Oh, now I remember. Yeah, it's a pretty good story. But the first part was I wanted to try to blend in. I never been to a third, third large giant man in America, in America, you know, do we take pictures together? I'm like, it's like, it's cute. I'm like looking up at your armpits so you are in your giant for a place that doesn't have giant people. I told him, I said I will, I'll come down and coach, I'll work for a month. But I said, I, you know, I was more worried about my safety than anything. So I said I'll come down, but you know, I really want to, I want to have a good flight.

Speaker 7:          02:03:17       You know, I was going along way and said I want to, if I'm on the train, cause I knew I had about a four hour train ride. I said I want first class, you know, start to finish. And I don't want to sound like a Prima Donna, but I also knew that I was going to a third world country. So asking for first class doesn't necessarily mean firstclass here. Um, so anyway, firstclass meant that my seats on my train had, um, vinyl covering on there. So I flew into my airport, got off the train, I was trying to blend in, had some old blue jeans on, gray shirt, literally stepped off and it was like the DJ fricking scratch the record from like song five to song one. It was like,

Speaker 1:          02:04:07       yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:04:09       And literally every single like a sea of people that were two feet shorter than me just literally stopped trains, stopped everything, stopped everyone looked at the six and a half foot dude standing in this Indian fricking trained train depot. And uh, I thought all right, so I'm to so much for blending in and went up to the first class, a train lounge, which was pretty much the train's loud, a train lounge that had seats. Um, went up there and made friends with the cockroach that was in the bathroom. And then I got on the train, uh, did about three to four hours on a train. Uh, we stopped a few times cause there were some cows on the tracks. You're not allowed to mess with the cows. I guess so we had to wait for them to naturally move off the tracks. Beep. There was actually two dead bodies on our train.

Speaker 7:          02:05:10       Have I ever told you this? There are two dead bodies and they put the dead bodies in the, on the floor of the aisle between the people. So our s our seats had vinyl on there. The first class, the non firstclass did not. I remember at one point I looked back in, there was two dead bodies that had sheets over him. And then in the far back of the train, like where the trains connect, there was actually a, um, an Indian guy that was squatting down pretty much rip and has dong a backwards so that he could take a leak while the in between the trains. Like he opened the door and he was squatting down letting one rip between the trains. And uh, yeah, I was sitting there thinking, Oh man, I've got 20 days left here. But in saying that, once I got to where I was, um, they were probably the best students I've ever had because they were the most disciplined.

Speaker 7:          02:06:18       Every one of those students wanted to get out of that lifestyle and they saw that being a national level shooter was going to get them out of that lifestyle. So every single thing I taught them, they took it to a level that was far beyond what most people here would ever, ever, ever do. Did they build as well? Did they build beaus they teach them how to do all that stuff to their peeps? Some of their, some of the people on their national team, their peep site, which is the small little circle that's in your bow string that allows you to kind of, it's almost like, if you can imagine a rifle he ever rear sight and a front sight. So the peep side is in your string. It's a circle and it's your rear sight and then you align it with the front sight.

Speaker 7:          02:07:10       There's was, theirs was made out of wood. They would have a stick with a hole drilled in it and they would put that in their string. Wow. So imagine someone like that in your, they're giving him instruction and every single thing you tell them to do, they'll do it to the 10th degree because they want out. I mean, it was extreme motivation. I felt like everything that I was doing from a training point of view was inadequate to what they were doing. The only difference was they didn't have the education that we had. They were disconnected. I remember, um, I would actually have to go to an Internet cafe and I'd have to pay for five minutes of Internet, like dial up internet to call Sharon. So, I mean, you look at people that are like that, they want it at a level that's so far beyond what a lot of, I mean, we're just floating in the gravy over here.

Speaker 7:          02:08:14       I mean, it's, it's true. It's true. It's totally true. Yeah. You look at some of the, some of the people I've, um, I was a keynote speaker at an, uh, an international coaching convention in Brazil before the Olympics there. And you go down there and you realize some of these people are, they want it way more than the people that have it easy and the, and that was the case though, right? Yeah. That's the case. That's the people that are hungry are the ones that are really struggling to make it. And that's what gets tough is, you know, learning to stay on top. Um, when you have it easy, when there's people that are literally investing every single day and getting to that point.

Speaker 1:          02:09:06       Yeah. It's, that's the fuel, right? Those, that's one of the weird things is very few people who grow up with like some crazy inheritance plan and millions dollars in the bank as well. That's a bond problem. I think it's a giant prior, I think it's a big problem. It's a giant problem with those people. Anybody that grows up in that scenario where you are never really taught the value of accomplishing things and then it's, it's not just about securing your fate, it's also about managing your consciousness and accomplishing things is good for you and you can't think it's not. You have to just accept it and learn it and think of it as a sort of a growing experience. And if you don't do that, you're not going to grow. And if you don't grow, you're going to be fucked. You're going to be fucked. Whether you're rich or you're poor, it's your missing the thing.

Speaker 1:          02:09:55       The thing is now how many Zeros and ones you collect. That's not the thing. The thing is like how well do you feel while you're going through it? And if you're doing it wrong, you've got to figure out what it is. Well, obviously having $1 million in the bank is not doing it right. If the dude's still taking pills and super depressed, it's not the money. Right? So what is it? What's the thing in you? And I have both met a lot of people in that category. I think everybody you talk to on the, everybody that's goes through, it's hard. Life is hard. There's a lot of people that have fallen, fallen into that category, and it could have been me. It easily could've. I had different scenarios, different circumstances, different,

Speaker 7:          02:10:34       you know, different neighborhood. I grew up. In any case, it can go wrong. You, you, you can go down the dark road and all of a sudden you're fucked. That's, that's the case for all of us. Do you feel like, I feel, you know, a lot of people look at me as an archer. I've been, uh, uh, made a very, very good career. I couldn't possibly have made it better. I don't think for B for shooting a bow for living. I don't think I could have made it better. And there's definitely archers that are better than me. I never claimed to be the best. I just claim to be the one that is willing to share the most. I don't claim that I have the most natural title talent. I just feel like I, I'm willing to share the most, but I dunno. I also feel like feel like there's this, I don't know, this part of me that feels like if I didn't, even though I don't have necessarily talent, the fact that I am willing to share it, I think it takes it to a different level because I don't know if I've ever shared this with you.

Speaker 7:          02:11:44       Do you know about my past as a kid? Yeah. You, you told me a lot of different things about you burn your house down accidentally. I did. Okay. Yeah. So a big, a big part of why I actually joined sports to begin with because originally I was a skater. I like to skate and um, you know, I wasn't really into organized sports. And the craziest thing is you abandoning football. Yeah. For archery. Yeah. Well, but before that, the reason I got into football's because my dad was such a great athlete that, you know, I played with matches and took it too far, ended up burning my house down, literally had nothing. My mom was in Puerto Rico on a business trip. My Dad was at work, burned her house. So the ground. Um, I remember being there when my family was sifting through ashes, literally trying to find something to salvage from our history as a family.

Speaker 7:          02:12:48       Um, and my dad was such a stellar athlete that I felt like the only thing I could do to really make him proud of me at that point was become a good athlete. So I focus on becoming a good athlete. And that was my drive was because it wasn't because I really liked it. It was because of the fee. It was because of guilt. It was because I really felt like the only thing I could do to make my dad who was, um, a military guy, someone who had definitely earned a street creds. I felt like the only thing I could do was become this great athlete, which he was in order to earn his respect. And Kennedy did that in order to make up for the fact that, you know, I had this one moment as an adolescent where I literally burn down every single thing our family ever had.

Speaker 7:          02:13:48       Holy Shit, man. I mean, imagine going. Imagine, right now when we're done with this podcast, you get a call and you realize your house was on fire and it's different now because we have phones. But imagine we don't have phones. Every single picture you have of your family, you know every single one is gone. Every, you know, every single thing that maybe someone's signed for you and the UFC has gone every single year. Black belt that you got from Eddie is burn. It's gone. Like that's gone. Every single thing from right now into till you were born is gone. That's what my parents loss and it was because of me. So you know what man, they did lose you. I think ultimately the difference between you making a mistake of burn the house down, which is horrific. Are you dying? Yup. That's the big difference. Like everything worked out.

Speaker 7:          02:14:55       Look, hey you are, everything's great. Well, and that's, that's what was great about my dad was the fact that once that moment happened, my mom and my dad have never ever brought that up. They've never hold that. They've never held that over me. It's been me from the outside looking in thinking they've never mentioned this because they know that I feel so bad about it, but me being competitive as a, as an athlete was because I wanted to make my dad proud from that aspect and literally that competitive drive as a football player and track or whatever else that, that fed the archery side. Because when I went to my archery tournament for the first time and I sucked at it, I was naturally competitive and really wanted to be better at it. Now that wasn't because of the fire, but that was just because of really because of a principle that competitive sports put in me, you know?

Speaker 7:          02:16:00       So it, it's crazy how, uh, it's crazy how it all these little pieces build character. But you know, that's why, um, several weeks ago there was a really big archery tournament and I actually got wind, which I'm not, I'm not big on kind of feeding in or buying into negativity at all. But there was some, some negativity that I heard from other shooters that are shooting now and shooting currently saying, you know, why is this guy, why is this guy popular? Why is it a successful? He's not even shooting right now. He's not even competing. And you know, yeah. Dirty Green Monster and V. Yeah, exactly. It is John Dudley get all the, yeah. And, and I, I've been pretty, uh, are you going to do gollum again? He did that on the last podcast. That's not calling. It's pretty good though. Um, I dunno. I feel like, I feel like these people that, that feed on the negativity, they don't understand that all these little things that have happened or building blocks and I want to use it as motivation to the people out there. Not everyone has a perfect picture, you know, people see where maybe you and I are now, but they don't realize. We also had huge hurdles before we got here. And it's how you address those, you know, and how you take adversity. That's really who defines you and it's a really, really good opportunity for you to, to set a precedence of I had hardship, I made over it. And you know, you can become inspiration for people by having that obstacle and then overcoming it.

Speaker 1:          02:18:02       Yeah. Well I think that's the big point is that we all learned from each other. Now, most certainly learned from you telling me about your struggles as well as I have from most of my friends that tell me about their struggles or things that I've read about or things that I've seen in documentaries or things we learn from each other. And you, you get, uh, we're, I think we're all accumulating data as far as like how the world works, what's the best way to behave and what's the best way to live. And we're all in the middle of accumulating all this data. We're all taking it and inform each other and we've gotta be open to it. You know, you've got to be open to taking it from even like, although it seems kind of corny sometimes, like I will read some shit by the rock or I will watch a Kevin Hart instagram video and I get fucking fired up.

Speaker 1:          02:18:45       I'm like, I'm going to go do this man and mean if it's not jocko saying good or if it's not just dope. Or when I think about that David Goggins podcasts, I did very good dude. I think about Goggins and my Jesus Christ. Yeah. I just, I can't even understand that kind of mental intensity. That'd be just, he was freaking me out, man, who's freaking me out and the most impressive way, like, I just like, I'm like, he was 100% that goes 100% seriously ready to die, uh, on a foot race. He's ready to die. 100% he's looking at, he's not lying at all, was not no party. He's taking it to the dark lands. He's going to take you to the dark lands. Will you follow? Will you follow him to the dark lands gam those ceos and does the same? He took us to the dark land with Tequila, the Tequila universe. Well, he'll do it with everything. He's an animal, but, but those, those people and they expresses itself differently in all these different exceptional people. Like Jocko is different than Tim. Tim Kennedy. Ted Kennedy is different than Andy there. There were all different but also all incredibly exceptional. But there's something that they give off.

Speaker 7:          02:19:55       I like that though. When you talked about the exception among the accent.

Speaker 1:          02:19:59       Yeah, that's what, um, I think, um, he'd called it David Goggins called it uncommon amongst uncommon people. That's true. Yeah. That is very, very true. That's the Colby Bryan and killing people right there. They just, I mean, I read this thing about Kobe Bryant the other day. I was just reading, oh, I don't know anything about basketball. Okay. And I always refer to Jamie, but anything in basketball, I have zero idea. I don't know how long it takes, can take a day. How many corridors? I have no idea. I would imagine if you say quarters, I'd say there's four of them. Can you see how many periods? I don't know how many. Half Times, but it was reading all this stuff about his high school coach saying that they would, they would get there and he would be shooting baskets in the dark because they hadn't even turned the lights on yet.

Speaker 1:          02:20:49       He'd be there an hour or two hours before everybody that he would show up at these practices. Everybody would be at breakfast and he would show up with ice on his knees and he was fully sweated out. Like he just done three hours of work and out before anybody did anything. There's, there's people like that man, and you can hate on them. You can hate on them. You could decide that this not worth it, but you got to, the best thing you can do is acknowledge that they're doing something that makes you feel funny. Yep. And that makes you feel funny, is your sense of understanding who you are. It's testing, testing how you feel about yourself. It's testing how you feel about your place in the universe is testing it. You don't want to know that there's some crazy Koby Bryant motherfucker getting up at four in the morning, you know, doing dead lifts like Shit, I want to sleep, but I also want to be number one bro. Yup. Former Lakers player and head coach Byron Scott said he wants found an 18 year old bryant shooting in a dark gm two hours before practice. I used to do that, but it's throwing footballs, throwing footballs into a, it was actually into the laundry baskets. It's not uncommon, man. It's not uncommon if you, if you really want to agreed.

Speaker 7:          02:22:03       I mean, you know, my sleeping hours are super, super regular. There's times where I feel like practicing or a lot of times you'll probably get up in the morning and I've already built your bow and I built a four or five in the morning because two people that are the exceptional among their field, they can't sleep if they know that they have to do something. What is, what are we looking at something because as you guys are talking about this, he just tore his Achilles. This is probably one of those last things he did. He tore his Achilles led in order. This is like a rule in the game. He had to shoot. His free throws is, it's a weird stipulation. So he's walking back out with no Achilles and he did does this. It was pretty, pretty impressive. Barely walk man. Holy Shit. No crying or nothing.

Speaker 7:          02:22:52       But yeah, it's really fucked up. That's how you have to be. If you want to be a winner, there's just no way around it. You know, Swish hollow. That's why I get the money. Look at my mansion at that point. It's just subconscious taken over. Anybody that doesn't think that someone like coby Bryant doesn't deserve mansion and all the money has just done, does not understand what he just did. Two swishes in a row with no Achilles. Just shut the fuck up. I don't know shit about basketball. I know. That was amazing. I've been pretty, I've actually been pretty stuck on this subject in the last few weeks. Um, I hardly ever, ever, ever look at negativity. I mean, I really don't read it, don't look at it. But, um, there was a really big archery tournament, uh, about a month ago and there were some other pros that had made some comments about me just saying, you know, how has John Dudley on a gre podcasts, he's not even competing, he's not doing anything. And you know, people wanted to know how I felt about that. And I said, the reality is there's several archer's out there that have 10 times the talent in me. No question. I'm not saying that I have that,

Speaker 7:          02:24:15       but what really is shitty about that situation is when someone has 10 times more talent in me and they do a 10th as much,

Speaker 7:          02:24:24       to me that's a big problem. So you think there's a lot of people out there that are not realizing their full potential. So because of that, they're critical of other people because maybe even they're looking at their own self and they, they feel like they're not, I don't know. I think, I think they're looking at the problem is because the people do do that, right? Yeah, absolutely. You limit yourself when you are not looking at what you're doing, when you're so occupied on what someone else is doing, you limit what your true talent is. So is that my problem? Is it my problem that you have 10 times the talent in me, but I'm doing 10 times more with it? Is that, is that my problem as a big numbers? Okay, let's say two times. Okay. Okay. Let's say, let's say you have twice a town naturally have more, but you're doing less, right?

Speaker 7:          02:25:19       Yeah. I know what you're saying. I just feel like there's a lot of people doing that, but yeah, there's, I think, I actually think the majority, I think the people that are standouts are people that don't have the natural, true talent. I think Jon Jones is a perfect example. If he was able to literally 100% maximizes talent, how good could he be? The problem is he's the one that has 10 times the talent, but he's screwing it up and there's guys that have half the talent that are bigger stars because they're actually doing it the right way and they're maximize. They're almost, they're almost doubling their potential because they're working at it in the right fashion versus someone that has the true talent isn't really maximizing their talent.

Speaker 1:          02:26:15       Hmm. I know he's saying, yeah, but I think here's a good sign. He's a really good sign. This is an easy way to decipher it. When you see someone complaining about someone else's success, anytime you see that, anytime you see someone complaining about someone else's success and possibly equate again to like some injustice in the world because they don't have equal success, the person's making a mistake. They're making mistake and even the way they're thinking, if you criticize something because you just think it's bad, well that's certainly your prerogative, right? I mean if you just, if it's, especially if it's an art form or if it's something someone created, that's one thing, but if you're upset that someone success, that doesn't make any sense. Well, they want it to be successful. They did the thing that it took to be successful. They became successful. And what's your point?

Speaker 1:          02:27:07       You don't have a point. Your point is born a mood. It's the little little kids version of would me, what about me? Well, I, it's not fair. It's not fair that some people are born billionaires. It's not fair. It's not fair that some people are born with birth defects where they don't have feet. It's not fair that some people, their their, their fucking brain doesn't work as well as yours. There's a lot of shit. It's not fair. Look at what you got. Look at what you got. You're doing well and you're worried about someone else's doing better. Why not just look at them? Why not just look at them and go, well, what does that guy do in different, what is she doing different than me? How come she's so much more successful? How did he figure out how to do that and look at it that way?

Speaker 1:          02:27:46       Don't look at it like you're angry at those people. That shit is wasted. It doesn't do you any good. It does zero good for anybody involved. Not You, not the person, your person. You're trying to figure out why that was fucking good. Good. That shit is just bad for you. It's bad for everybody. It's bad for the person thinking negatively. It's bad for everybody around them. The best way to do is like, Huh? Like even if you not even hateful about it, like, like here's a good example. Like if a movie is fucking giant in the box office, you're like, wow, I thought it sucked. I didn't like it or whatever. But if you freak out hose full move with Jumanji

Speaker 5:          02:28:23       fucked shit. Me Bro. Jumanji that fucking piece of shit in our people get crazy. They get crazy that I made $800 million for fucking Jumanji can't. It's not good for you man. You gotta to let that go. Don't worry about Jumanji worry about yourself. She [inaudible] it's pretty good. It's hard twice kids, man. I haven't seen it yet. It's pretty good. I thought it was very good. It's really well done. It's Kevin Hart and the rock together. You can't mess Jack Black and one of the best performances and years and whoever was the hot redhead check. She was great too though. I think Jack Black was getting shame. He's got one of those Farrah Fawcett poster is going to check. I just look something up weird. It's not, it's sort of related. The Jurassic world. Did you see that movie when it came out a couple of years ago? Yeah. It's the number three all time grossing.

Speaker 5:          02:29:11       Thank God. Thank God. Are you kidding me? Hey, fuck the godfather. Chris Pratt. If you want archery lessons, legitimately does. I bet he does legitimate. You know, did you see that an instagram post that he put up of is a sheep or a lamb that he killed? He had a pet lamb put a bolt to its head and you know, and chopped it all up and people freak the fuck out though. Like this is our food. He didn't see it. Dude. Chris Pratt, Scott some balls. I saw him post a picture of a rub in on a tree. Oh, he hunts and he said, uh, said something about trolls. Yo, what's up Chris? Right here. Now the 2018. What's that? This is like a rap rapping that sounded like this. The new album. No. Pratt rap. He um, he does though. Go is, uh, that's not it. There's a video where he shows the lamb that he's actually taken apart. This is the snow in the video. It says it. Okay. When I ate it all.

Speaker 5:          02:30:17       Well, no. What I meant is there photographs. She's actually photographs of the butchered lamb and people lost their fucking Shit, man. That's, that's not it. It's um, there's actually like photographs of the meat and like there's a roast in the roast is there. It is, right. The one in the middle. Yeah. And this one gets a legitimate, I don't know if that's necessarily land. They came from his, I'm assuming it honestly sounds like it says, look at all this glorious food. We will eat off him for a month. His wools becoming yarn as we speak. He lived a very good life. He was groomed and shorn. His hooves medicated. Why he wormed and no antibiotics necessary. Surrounded by laughing and loving humans, including children to whom they provided such joy nozzle, pat and loved every day. No stressful travel to his final destination. Trauma free just to touch of a u s d a certified wan to his head and he goes to sleep. The other sheep don't even notice. It's unplugging

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       your TV. Then Waka Waka he's got a butcher name. Wacom, Wacom, my Bush or Waka Flocka side job then blankets or wrapper. It is definitely, you're so white walk. My butcher were magic. He's definitely right now the meat is for friends, family and gifts. Soon though it may be available to my followers as we test recipes and opened up to market. Oh my God, he's got a murder animals for a living. I got to get some things dialed in first, including murder, murder of sheep. Just kidding. Like he is. I eat meat, but that's a glorious how get the balls in this guy. When has a a list actor ever considered opening? I agree. A meat shop and showed a photo on his instagram of the honest procurement of meat in an honest way. Did you see that post I made today? No. What? Which one?

Speaker 7:          02:32:20       My, I have my airplane mode on so I can't post it. But I think, um, I made a post, uh, it was a google search that I did. There was 21 independent, um, legitimate scientists that found that if you ate 50 grams of processed meat per day, your chance of cancer was 18% higher. Holy Shit.

Speaker 4:          02:32:50       Just think of that number now is at night nitrites. What is it? What are the, what are they thinking? It's causing that.

Speaker 7:          02:32:56       Yeah. That part wasn't clearly defined, but I would definitely think it was preserved based, but

Speaker 4:          02:33:04       they don't really know though. Right. They know it's processed meat. It's really dangerous. Yeah. They don't know what it is exactly. That's what right.

Speaker 7:          02:33:11       Awesome about how you and I hunt. I posted it specifically to actually some access backstraps from Hawaii last year. Um, because I think, I think it's maybe ignorant for people to automatically make a post saying, you know, you're a killer just because you post a picture of, you know, free range, organic meat that you decided to choose a touch. Um,

Speaker 4:          02:33:40       look at it. I know what you're saying, but you got to look at it from their perspective. I do. Even if they're not right, and there's no right here. The thing is there's there, right, and you're right, it's everybody's right. It's this really what's fucked up about it. Like an animal does have to die. You know it. That is a fact. And that does bother people, including you and me when it happens. And people don't realize that. But that is true. They don't. But the, the understanding at the end of the day is that this is the cycle of life and this is what life is really all about. So they're right in your right, but this whole, this expression of outrage, like you should be expressing that at

Speaker 1:          02:34:17       Burger King. You should be, and not Burger King, just, you know, I'm not singling them out. Anybody that has fast food, which I've eaten many times. If you want to live in a society of 20 million people, you're going to have to live in a place most likely with this model where you've got in and out Burger. And I like in and out Burger. I like them. They taste good, but go ahead. We went there in Vegas, they've got damn good, right? It's hard to beat, so I don't necessarily hate those things, but you have to understand what all this really is. You know? It's the whole thing is crazy. You're here for a very short period of time, as are these animals. All of us are trying to stay alive. All of us are freaking out. One of the things get eaten and we're all just going like, well, I just want to be the best version of me.

Speaker 1:          02:35:01       I can be your right hand there, right? They just, they haven't experienced what they, they have decided that an animal should not die. There's no way an animal should die so that they can live, and if they can live that way, that's their choice. They're welcome to that choice. They just don't understand the merit of your choice. The merit of your choice is just diametrically opposed to what they think should be and should not be a thing a person does. You shouldn't be a person that kills animals, but when you're engulfed in that world, when you're living in the woods, when you're, when you're going through these seven, eight, nine, 10 day hunts, you give us understanding of what this world around these things. It really is. It's this crazy, beautiful, complex interaction between Predator and prey and it's been going on since life was here. Yeah. Just what it is and what you're doing as a hunter is just figuring out with your soft bitch ass skin and you're, you're fucking shaky knees, bad ankles weasely yourself into a position where you can jump into the food chain with wolves around that fucking conversation that we had about wolves. Did that change people's understanding of what a wolf is when on the first time you came on the podcast, you talked about how the wolves to try and take your

Speaker 2:          02:36:16       away from you too. That's a crazy story. Yeah. I mean, there are my all time favorite stories. Yeah. There at camp, I mean, there's an interaction going on Predator and prey. This is happening. Your name. It's not like it's established and it's written in stone. Every level of the food chain is being competitive with the next. Yeah. It's not like it is a very clear cut concrete step to where every step is clear. Humans are here, wolves are here, grizzlies are here, access deer here. Turkeys are here and I would, I would inject one other thing. Cwd Yup. Chronic wasting diseases. Kill study biology comes into this thing. Diseases is

Speaker 1:          02:37:02       are creeping in and killing deer left and right and a lot of people feel like these diseases were created by people farming those deal. It was dear taking them out of the wild environments and letting them like eat off

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       the same food and constantly exchange bacteria with each other and that's what created this thing.

Speaker 7:          02:37:21       I've, I've told people metro times that I feel like mother nature is a form of Karma. I think Mother Nature will take care of herself. I think as things below that level, try to occupy their own status. I think that's the balance. That's a check that's in process. I think Mother Nature, naturally, I think if you decide I'm not going to shoot any turkeys, I'm going to just let these turkeys go as wild as they can. I think all sudden mother nature comes in and says, uh, I'm going to throw a little trump card in here called black heads disease. This is going to kill every freaking Turkey in your area and I'm going to regulate this

Speaker 4:          02:38:09       according fasting. Does that always happens? Yeah. When animals get over it and that's one of the things and it's being concerned about Hawaii, right?

Speaker 7:          02:38:16       Disease. Yup. And then you look at a white tail and areas where maybe there's been, you know, I guess quote Unquote Trophy Hunters to where they've not really, um, I guess regulated the population of Whitetail deer to point where, you know, they're trying to grow trophy hunting. So to me to try and grow a deer with large animals, larger antlers. So there may be shooting less numbers and then all of a sudden here comes this little thing called Ehd, which kills every whitetail. It goes to drink water. I don't know it, it is chronic wasting disease. EAC is different. It's an image that actually lives in the mud. I'm on the receiving water line on a pond. So as a, you know, as a whitetail deer would go into actually drink, uh, this mitch fly lives in the, in the soil on the re the receding waterline, and it would go into the nostril of the deer and then literally within 48 hours, that deer's debt, if it, if it gets that,

Speaker 4:          02:39:27       that virus, look at the name of it. Epic Zoo, epizootic hemorrhagic disease and you know, so it's like an ebola type disease. I think a bowl is that Ebola hemalogic disease. Not, didn't have to pee so hard. Me Too. I've never had a pee more of my life. This is awesome. We've had a, I did I pee before the trial. There's a different suit. Wolves and coyotes. I saw that picture. It's an amazing picture. Somebody's got to picture between this majestic black wolf with fucking white glowing eyes that both looks amazing. Like I'm out to coyote is like, fuck all this. We've got to get away from that thing, man, that is so heavy. Go from Ehd to two coyotes running from a black wool. How do we concentrate on the, what's that set

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       it up. Um, did you think you guys could talk for a few minutes? Where Ip, go for it. Keep it together. Yeah. Talk about sports. Sports. All right, Jamie. Well, yeah, I mean is this is the first official podcast where Rogan's had to actually maybe like the second or third time and a second time? Yes. It's dumped back on podcast. The flex that,

Speaker 7:          02:40:38       yep. Uh, no, this is pretty, pretty epic right here to make Rogan actually go. That means he's consumed more than he's talked. That's pretty powerful. That happens from time to time. I know. I like that sweatshirt. Jamie's actually told me earlier, he's trying to make a profession out of video gaming, which I would know about refreshing, but a, I stream from time to time on twitch, which is an interesting thing that you said your son does it a little bit or he looks at it. Yeah. Well, I used to play quite a bit. Our, uh, we had two accounts. One was death by Dudley on playstation. And, uh, the other one was bald, hairless Yeti. He playing with them like you guys play at times? We did. Yeah. We were big modern warfare guys. Um, we really liked that and actually I met, um, I met several cool dudes during that, during that, uh, online play.

Speaker 7:          02:41:37       I always, you know, honestly I felt like if I was a competitive archer and I would have been online prior to my competition, I feel like I almost could have helped some of my performance anxiety when it comes to competition because there's so many. You get so like into beating the guy that you're going against that it's, you can almost freak out and you don't do things according to a systematic method, which is really all a video game is, is it's if you follow the systematic method, you can overcome the alley algorithm. Right. For sure.

Speaker 5:          02:42:21       Um, but here it goes. That was rough. How was full of those? Um, I got to go now. Do you, go ahead. Go ahead norris. What are you going to talk about? Whatever you talked about. I'm going to, let's, let's hear this so hard. That was crazy. I was talking about her. I talked about my two online video gaming accounts with, with my little dude, Harry. One was death by Dudley and the other one was bald. Hairless. She, Eddie, what do you play? Mainly a modern warfare stuff. Oh yeah. Anything that you kill someone. Sadly enough. Go get you your and on me and I'm young. Jane will talk about the implications to that. Let's hear about this. What is this? What is it about these? I have three coffees. That's not good. That's a lot of caffeine. Thank God you've got that whiskey. That's dumb. It down balances. Perfect. You'd be talking to how to control

Speaker 1:          02:43:24       it was one of the drunk or podcasts. One of them. Right, but there's something fun about getting together with a really good friend. Just getting lit up. Smoke a little weed, drink a little whiskey. It's have a good time. Just have a good time. Today's been a good time. That guy's a good guy. John Dudley's a fucking good man. I love that guy. He's fun and he's also, I'm a master at something that's very difficult to do. He's a master, not just at like executing archery, but instructing it, teaching people. It's a fascinating thing that archery man, to me it's super important and I think that everybody goes to these like things where like what's important to them, like to you might be a guitar amp, you know, might be a certain drums, a drum sticks. It might be whatever the fuck you're into, you know that might be important to you.

Speaker 1:          02:44:20       But archery I think is one of those things that most people miss. You just don't get a chance at it. You're like, God, that looks good. That looks like it'd be fun, but you don't know where to go. And you never do it like by far most people. But once you do do it, you realize like, oh, I can learn about life through this weird thing. I'm pulling that string back and I'm launching a pointed stick at a target and I'm learning about myself. Like what I'm learning about how I deal with situations where I have to execute correctly under pressure. Even if it's just a minor pressure of hitting a target or the major pressure of hitting an animal. He learned to that shit. Jamie, what are you showing me?

Speaker 5:          02:45:02       There's this game. I feel like we've, I showed this to you awhile ago, but this is called the hunter call of the wild. Should we tell people archery part of it? Should we tell, oh damn. It's a compound bow it. Who's got a real bow? Yeah. Why has he goes sideways like he's Gangsta? I'd probably say you can see, I bet even once you pull it up to aim, he better, so I'm hoping I can get you better pull it back. Oh yeah. He goes, wow, that's legit. Look at this John Dudley, this gundam archery video game

Speaker 1:          02:45:27       guys pulling back a bow and looking through a site like you would like a real compound bow site. That's amazing

Speaker 5:          02:45:34       with the whisker biscuit, powerful whisker biscuit and then you go home. A lot of people still rocket. A lot of people still rock the bus about, I wish the biscuit was in fallible. I wish it was. The way to go. Seems so easy. I just hate the name. Yes. Your biscuit. Yeah. I mean I hate it but it's definitely provocative. People don't know what we're talking about. It's the Arrow go. Some people definitely do. Most people don't. Most people listen to this podcast, probably don't. It's a type of archery rest where that Arrow sits. It's very controversial. This is how geeky archery is. It's very controversial. Should you have some fine mesh that's sort of cradles the Arrow and that fledglings will pass through that five mesh possibly knocking down how many feet per second? Five. I'm five feet paws. Three. Five scientific. I don't do that so we'll be stuck in an hour so we'll be real conservative and say three, three feet a second, which is pretty probably knocks off more than that but some people like it because of its simplicity. There it is. That's a whisker biscuit and the fletching is a pass through. Those fine fibers slow down a little bit but not too much. That's literally like training wheels for your Arrow with John Dudley believes in is like this crazy drop away type thing where they have an arrow rest that drops down. He makes his own era.

Speaker 7:          02:46:57       Yep. Knock on Arrow rest. [inaudible] it's, it is the knock on elevates the shit. Jason. It's a, it's a subject I want to talk to you about. Never talk to you about this ever. Oh, so no. A bunch of my u s team members, they're going to shoot me in the face for tough talking about this because in the face, yeah, literally in the face because one thing that was an ongoing thing for when I was on the u s team, we, there was this thing that went on about how long we could go at a tournament before we talked about this particular person. So during my time on the teams, we actually had a person that was, um, she claimed to have a medical disorder or she didn't actually claim to have it, but supposedly it happens. But she claimed to have a disorder where she had attachment to items. This girl that was on my team actually ended up marrying the Eiffel Tower. I'm serious. I'm not kidding. She had an attachment to a love interest that she actually filed some claims against. Supposedly filed some claims against a boat company that this boat company actually had a rubber laminate on the limbs of the bow and

Speaker 5:          02:48:30       there she is. Mary's I feel cow. Is that her?

Speaker 7:          02:48:35       Wow. She married a Harris is famous monument. I wrote a mini buses with, with her. Oh my God.

Speaker 5:          02:48:45       A former soldier who lives in San Francisco. She has been in love with the objects before. Her first infatuation was with Lance, a bow that helped her become a worldclass archer. She is fond of the Berlin Wall and she claims to have a physical relationship with a piece of fence. She keeps it a bedroom. What in the fuck? Why I doing?

Speaker 11:         02:49:08       What are we doing people, we can't. We can't do this. We've gotten too crazy. We got to pull back. We got to pull back. Here's the thing, Mary. A fucking bridge. This pitch married a bridge. She married a Brooklyn Grit near the Eiffel Tower. This bitch is marrying a bridge though. Just kissing. She's kissing bridges public object. But what the fuck does she just say? Love of the public object. Crank that up. I want to hear this crazy lady. I feel very, very blessed to have a piece of my sweet Golden Gate Bridge. Oh, Jesus stopped. I give up. I'm out. I hung in there as long as I could with the bridge. Hey Dad,

Speaker 7:          02:50:02       wait, wait. In the middle of all this, there's a lot of people like me that have shot tens and tens and tens of thousands of arrows trying to win a medal for the country. But that's different. You're chasing an accomplishment. You're not fucking a bridge. The ladies trying to fuck. Meanwhile, she's on our team bus. She literally, she slept with her bow one night at an, at an event and then got an infection from the silicone on the limbs and the rest of the team had to deal with this problem. Um, when you say infection, I don't know where the infection was, but I would have met Elle. Oh No. I want to have on the bottom and a step away from it. Mike Olsen, but hey, how good was she as an rj? Jamie? This is pretty rare. He's actually like son of a bitch. Um, how good was, she has an archer.

Speaker 7:          02:51:06       She must have been very good. She was on a team, right? Oh, putting the hat on the bow. Not a good time actually look like pot holder, but she must have been like a worldclass archer. Right? Don't do it. Don't do it to me. John does. I would say decent. Good Archer. Dangerous, decent. Here's, here's the thing. Okay, so she married the Eiffel Tower. How'd that work out? I think she's still married to it. Friends. People were pissed. This is true. This is 100% true. French people are pissed because American just goes over there, gets his fiance visa, marries a tower. Right. So now we got to dual citizenship. Meanwhile she's got this thing for the Berlin Wall. Yeah. Okay. Well the Berlin Wall was a flirt first of all. So what Berlin Wall is always like being real and

Speaker 5:          02:52:06       giving you this extra long hugs. The Berlin Wall. Fucking asked for it. Jamie cannot. Of course she's, she's in love with the Berlin Wall hose. Dot. How about you? Gotta married. She's married to Eiffel though. So here's the deal. Listen to this. I want Joe to listen to this. I just randomly picked a spot. Her last name is eiffel though. She literally took the legal name and her name is her name. Originally it was Islah bree and I had to travel with her, but now it's Iowa. I uh, eyeful Jamie, I have to send you something that, uh, someone sent me today that I sent to Brian Cowen. I'm going to send you it in two seconds. Um, who did that think about France moves to see, just so you could probably Google it. France moves, it's on NPR, so it's legit. France moves to make 15 the lead legal age of consent for sex. And it's because a bunch of dudes got in trouble for having sex with 11 year olds. What? Yeah, we were talking about Roman or not. I'll leave that. France moves to make age 15, the legal age of consent for sex. Like, whoa.

Speaker 5:          02:53:23       There's a, there's parts of the world that are just not where we are right now. Nope. They're just not, you don't look at that like you got to who was saying this? Who's saying 15? Like woody, what you 15 for what an 80 year old, an 80 year old can fuck a 15 year old. Is that what you just said? I'll kill you. I will fucking kill you. Hearing guns. As long as violence, coercion, threat or surprise is not proven. Sexual intercourse with a minor, even one under 15 is considered. And I don't know what that means. Uh, which is an infraction and not a crime. It says, uh, on tench attention, sexuality, which is an infraction and not a crime. I don't mean come on, I will put a try pan right through that guy's face. Yeah. They're not even blink. This is a correction necessary.

Speaker 5:          02:54:17       You have a, a cultural issue that's a cultural issue. Correction necessary. No, you can't fuck 10 year olds. If anyone has a problem with, with guys that are, I can guess, but that's a hunter's like idiots like this. That's terrifying. That is terrible. But I think terrifying. I think this is what happens with people, man. I think people get caught up in whatever the other people around them are doing and this is weird mob mentality method. That's how was the craziest thing I've seen all day long. I mean that's ridiculous today, 2018 March, 2018 while we're talking, this is on the news as of happening right now in Europe to go,

Speaker 1:          02:55:03       Whoa, let's make you to make it illegal to fuck 14 year olds. Like what? You don't have that already on the books.

Speaker 6:          02:55:13       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:55:14       you could fucking nine year old over there. Right? How old are they have to be? Is there an age limit at all or is it just, oh, he fucked it. Bibby module module or sorry, mercy.

Speaker 6:          02:55:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:55:28       That maybe, is there a year it should make your stomach turn? It does, but here's the thing, if you pay attention to history or if you read anything about the atrocities that, why don't we learn? Well, we got, we have learned a little at what point we're, we're, we're better than we were a hundred years ago. Better than we were 200 years ago. But

Speaker 6:          02:55:49       yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:55:49       in the past it was like really commonplace. I mean, if you, I mean if you read anything about socrates or anything about Plato, like that time of the world, like men having sex with children and little boys and stuff was like extremely common. Extremely common. What? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:56:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:56:08       Yeah. And parts of the world. Men having sex with boys was extremely common for humans. Even in like what we would consider like classical cultural culture, intelligent civilizations like the ancient Romans, the ancient Greeks that like, it was a normal part of life. It's really weird. You know, we'd want to deny that, but there's undeniable proof that that's a fact that it's w it was way more common in those ancient cultures than it is today. Like what is that like, how did that happen? Like why did people allow that? Like why did that take place? I don't know. I think there's, you freaking out over there, take some dads need to step up and beat some ass. Okay. In 2005 the core DDI cuss, say tion Frances highest criminal court stipulated that coercion is presumed for children at a very young age and quotes. That's an outrageously blurry formulation. That in practice has largely been applied to children under six what? This leaves children above sex above six years old, six potentially considered not raped when violence cannot be established. It also allows the state of paralyzed shock experienced by many victims and all the more so children.

Speaker 6:          02:57:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:57:29       To equal consent. That's terrifying. That is ruth, this vikings, barbarians, barbarians. And is it? This is, this is ancient European barbarian law that's in place for thousands of years and they, they never caught up. They never refixed it. You've got to fix that. This is crazy. You have the internet fix that. That's crazy. You could have sex with someone under fucking nine or six or whatever the fuck it was. That's nuts. Yeah. That's, this isn't, this isn't 16

Speaker 2:          02:58:02       two this is 2018 this is not the time for that. That it's amazing that this still exists. That's amazing. In a, in a European civilized, it like really exalted culture like France and people love the France. It's weird. They fight so passionately about some things, but then they have something so stupid. I think they're, they're just freer and a lot of ways, which is bad and good at the same time. It's bad in that regard of taking care of children. I'm like pr, like fucking with children's heads sexually, whether you're just dooming them to this life of weirdness. Uh, and you're making it legal so there's no legal recourse. Some guy I've got fucked by some old dude when he was six. That's crazy. And that's real. Luckily I don't know anyone that, no, I don't. He like told me about that. I'm sure it's happening now.

Speaker 2:          02:59:01       If that's the law, how can, how the fuck is that? The law? How's that? The law. Hi. I'm no idea. Was good to me. Write it down. We started this podcast literally in haunted houses and I've come full circle to a problem. It's a problem. And also the gift it, it is, it's both things are, um, our guide. When Andy and I went to France, he was an all tell me about that story because that's an amazing story. It wasn't guys went to the French Alps, uh, on this bow hunting, unsuccessful bow hunting trip for tar and just even though it was on, it was fucking awesome. It was success without necessarily a harvest. So well is a beautiful experience problem. Right. It was awesome. Um, we actually went there and I think a kill cliff has a dock, a little short film on it.

Speaker 2:          02:59:56       Yeah. Called, I forget, I think it's called high ground, but andy and I, andy got into bow hunting because of you, um, you spur an interest to shooting a bow and then actually you texted me one time and said, hey, is it cool if I give you a friend of mine's number to, I want them to learn archery a little bit better? And so I said, yeah, of course. And actually you and I had met Andy and Vegas even though we don't totally remember most of it. Um, so I said, yeah, of course. And then Annie and I become, became friends and then we went to France. And then uh, we went on this epic hard, hard high altitude hunt. I was actually introduced to a andy bumper, front tait Fletcher. Tait Fletcher knows him from the crossfit world because Andy was a, he was in somehow or another responsible for something in the crosswalk. Some something important in the crossfit world, some sort of a liaison. Something I [inaudible] was there.

Speaker 5:          03:01:00       I don't really know cause I haven't asked him about that part but I know that he has background in it. I think he was there kind of towards the beginning of it. I didn't know that's how tate yeah, that's how I met Andy. I met Andy through tape cause that's crazy. Take knew him cause tate's big in the crossfit world. I saw sweet [inaudible] actually was following me on a post that I had made and I was like this is such a small world. He's a great dude. It really is. Yeah, he's awesome. It really is. He's the caveman coffee guy. He's one of the owners of Casey. Keith Jardeen. Yeah. Tate. Just so you know, Lacey Mackie, all of those are for the or Mexico or four nitrogens deadly for a normal sized person. Luckier goddamn giant. You'd be dead. Why? You wouldn't be able to shut the fuck up if you were like, uh, you know Duncan trussell size to be bouncing off the walls right now.

Speaker 5:          03:01:54       How big is Dunkin Buck? 50. Maybe. What? He's about a buck 55. The guests. Seriously? Yeah. He looks bigger than that now. He's um, maybe an inch taller than me. I think he's five, nine and I think he's more slender. Wow. You know, cameras powerful. Do you ever look at people and go, how much does that guy way can I carry him? How far can I count on you? Do you think that when you saw me, I said this fucking dude, if he blacks out, we better have an ambulance. Like get up to him. I'm not carrying this big ass. You would if it meant something I do. It's a real, what's the heaviest load you've ever carried on your back? Like when you, if you've been like packing out an animal, if you had a gas, definitely moose have a whole quarter. I think I had a quarter ahead.

Speaker 5:          03:02:48       Ooh. How much does that, I don't know. You have to have someone help you get it on. Get it up there to where you can get wait, you know, get that weight over the top of your legs due to Moose quarter is fucking heavy. Yup. I shot a young Moose. It was not a very big Morris who was a fork fork. Hud Moose. Um, yeah, it was a young, a young men, um, in British Columbia with a, um, a powerful Ben O'brian and my coffee guys. We're just, we're right where I bear hunt. Yeah. That's why when I met Ben Manel. Well, right, exactly. Which is right south of where I, where I was. We had to take a picture of me carrying that quarter on my shoulders. Magazine. Yeah. Heavy. I didn't have to walk with it though. I just had to carry it. Like how long did you have to carry a moose shoulder on your, on your back? How far when he far, how far did you pack it out? Three, 400 yards so that you know, um, remy warren ruined his body

Speaker 4:          03:03:58       carrying a moose out. It took, I think he said it took several days of going back and forth. There were many, many miles in and so they go miles in, grab like a hundred pounds of moose meat. A Moose, by the way, he might have 700 pounds of me seemed, if you bone it out, you have seven trips, you know however many people you have, you have seven individual packages of hundred pounds of meat. You got to get out through miles and miles and miles of dead falls and cliffy rocky fucking you might get cliffed out. You might take a wrong path. Yeah. Hey, hey crossfit. Um, what is it? 18.3 how about through 200 pounds on your back and literally go from one interview your town to the next. Yeah. When remy was telling you about it, I was like, that, that sounds crazy. But like what? Incredible mental fortitude. This guy had incredible mental fortitude that he figured out how to get through all the things that he said.

Speaker 4:          03:05:01       Fuck that meet. I'll leave it back there. Some coyotes will eat it. Who Cares? It's not going to waste. I'm not going back. It's not worth it. He went back. Oh yeah, and over and over again. I think, I want to say it was three or four days of packing out this Mousse. Yeah, I bet that's the, that's the real western hunting that people don't understand. They don't understand this. This is not elmer fudd with an orange jacket. The shooting at deer, you know, hates animals. This is not that. This is some crazy physical endeavor that's highly difficult. You need another one and another one. I got one more drive in today. It's two milligrams of caffeine. You've had more honestly, thousand milligrams caffeine. Perfect. I'm on par. That right there is why hunters are willing to, to argue with people that slam hunting and say that we're just killers.

Speaker 4:          03:05:59       Because if you had to put 800 packs of your ribeye steak on your back and walk it five miles home, would you feel more passionate about it? Well that would be ridiculous. I was still, it was just do eight trips. Jesus Christ, but it's trade a hundred pounds on your back. It seems excessive, but it's true. I mean if you have, you have a moose even enough, that's not even enough. I don't, I don't think to really complete the cycle. I think you'd have to be there. You either have to be the one who pulls the trigger or you have to be there when it happens. You have to see what the difference between a living animal and dead animal. Cause if you don't then you're, you're formulating your entire picture of the world based on information that you're only getting from a video. Right. It's like what we were talking about, the difference between watching porn and having sex. It's really similar. The difference between understanding this in terms of like it on video

Speaker 1:          03:06:56       and actually being there like, oh this is what it looks like when a cow dies. This is what it looks like. Me Hang Hangup by its ankles and gut it. This is how I feel about this now. I had one feeling about this before when I was nicely insulated by all the prides. Got a nice white styrofoam little tray with Saran wrap and a nice piece of rib eye. Oh look at that. I'm going to get the fucking briquettes out there and start the grill. Woo. You get all excited when it's not their fault. It's just we are. We're even through our entire developmental process. We're shielded through one of the most important parts of life. Where does your food come from? It should be like one of the number one things you think of. Where's your family? Are they safe? Where's your food come from? Those are question number one and question number two. Right?

Speaker 7:          03:07:40       Well it's a lot like that with the job too. I mean, and we've had people that have come to work for us are like, okay, this is what working for this business is going to be like, and then they come and then they realize, whoa, this is completely different. Whereas I've been the same. I've s I've worked for companies that I've really, really liked and I go there and then I realize, holy cow, this is a whole different thing. Yeah. Versus what it really, really is. So it gets tough. I mean, you know, it's hard to, and that's why he can't really judge anyone because unless you've been in those shoes, it's not really fair to build an assessment easy. Now

Speaker 1:          03:08:26       smart first one is my first bro. Relax. No, you're absolutely right. I mean it's nothing wrong with letting someone know that doing something wrong that's negatively affecting others. Yup. That's, that's, that's a good thing. But there's a, there's a bigger issue that's like did when people are like constantly going after other people and attacking and the most vicious way, most likely it's because they're trying to divert attention from, from how they are or, or that, that it could come back at them. You know, this is like a weird dance that people do with liking and disliking other people. It's sign always healthy. You know, and I've, I've been studying this for the longest time and I still don't understand it totally. I have my vague assessments of how it all sort of falling into place, but I don't know totally how it's working, but I know that's the people that are the most pleasant to be around are the people that are both the most friendly, the most understanding, the most objective in the, the most just just loving, just nice people, you know, and the, the friends that we all have that we know that are like that this is, this is the fun people to be around.

Speaker 1:          03:09:33       You know, you're going to have a good time. Yep. Every time I see you, I know I'm going to have a good time. We never have a bad time. We have fun times. Oh yeah, we definitely do. Well, isn't that a nice thing? Like how come that can't be replicated everywhere?

Speaker 7:          03:09:45       I wish it could. I totally wish it could. I feel like, I feel like people that haven't experienced hardship don't appreciate the good times as much. And I feel like for me anyway, the fact that I've experienced times where I've really struggled and I've had to either up my game or co or decided to quit, which, you know, that's your choices either either you step up and you work hard enough to where you achieve it and then at that point you really, really appreciate it. Um, which is something that I experienced when you talk to me about kettle bells. I thought, okay, well I'm not good at this, so either I'm not going to be able to relate to joe or I'm gonna learn to do it right. And I ended up going down to Austin because, um, I wanted to experience it a little bit more to where I can appreciate, okay, if Joe's doing a windmill with a fricking big foot, what is this? What is this real like? It looks easy when I watched a youtube video, but then when I grab a fricking chimp and do it and, uh, I'm struggling to do it without having my shoulder hit me in the side of the face. And then I'm thinking, okay, Joe's doing this now with a big foot. I think it's like 90 90 I don't know. Somewhere in the night. Let's just say it's a 90 pound 90 pound kettle bell. You begin to realize

Speaker 1:          03:11:15       started out with the 35 pound one. I struggled with it and then

Speaker 1:          03:11:20       it's also I'm, I've been doing flexibility exercises since I was a kid, so when males not as difficult for me is a lot of other people. It was actually pretty easy for me to pick up because my body's used to whipping like everything's kicking. Right. All that kicking and shit kicking is a lot of is with your hips, a lot of is with your waist and your hips. When you learn how to like really throw power and things, that's where it all comes from. So the windmill, it's like a natural movement of that. Like those muscles were already conditioned and strengthened.

Speaker 7:          03:11:47       I feel like I'm adding and totally inadequate. When I looked at you, I t I do, I mean I work out every day, but my physique, I feel like a lot of people look at my physique from a distance and they think, oh, that guy is in really good shape. But then like I look at you and sometimes your abdomen protrudes a little bit and then I've been rooms or joe takes his shirt off and he's like a Frickin, he's jacked. Don't let them fool you and work out. Yeah, he works out. I'm trying to fool people. Yeah. He has a little bit of an abdomen that goes out further than this tax. It's only honest with you. I can't even believe you have that skin because I've been in my life. Your six pack sticks out further than your Pec deck

Speaker 1:          03:12:44       versus my Pec deck. I'm going to show you some of the shit that I do out here. Uh, we'll, we'll do a little, uh, working out here. But one of the that I've really gotten into is, um, there's like a circuit of a glute ham machine that does your lower back. And then I do these elevated setups. And then I do compression machine or no, no, no, no. That's, that's the third one. That's the, I'm a reverse hyper. That's the third one. But I do this whole series of things that I'm doing for ABS. It's tremendous for abs and back. And I like the sturdiness of your core and just, I feel like if I just do these on a regular basis, it makes it just a giant difference in how my body moves and how stable I feel. I feel like that's why you were good at word tree is because core so solid.

Speaker 1:          03:13:30       I think it's a really, really good foundation and other foundations, those club bells, I'm really in those club bells. I do all the shield cast with those clubs. There's something about when you do that, when you're controlling like a 25 pound club, it doesn't seem like a lot of weight. But if you could slowly control that, when you get a bow in your hand and you're trying to level that bow, it's like you're, you have more control of your body. You have better understanding of, you know, the, all the, the various uh, speeds that your muscles can move at. We could just slow it down, slow it down. There it is. There it is. There it is. And I feel like the more you strengthen those muscles, particularly stabilizing muscles of the shoulders with like reverse kettle bells, you know, kettle upside down kettlebells where the bottoms, I love those.

Speaker 1:          03:14:14       Those are great because those are even a lightweight, you're just do it slow and it's well wiggling and she is big time hammer curls too. So good to deltoid, full Schulte military shoulder press with the vertical kettle bell and then, but don't sleep on those windmills too cause it's the same thing. It's all shoulder stability actually. And flexibility. Being able to go to the floor is a big, big aspect. It's huge. It's huge. And it's just, I feel like if as long as you don't overdo it, I don't think there's any danger of injuring yourself. I think if you do it correctly, it's actually the opposite. I think it strengthens everything. Strengthens the whole chain from your arms, your shoulders to your court, your hips to your legs. The whole thing gets strengthened because everything has to move. Yup. I went to a on at academy, I think last summer. I'm, Sharon and I were down there for, actually, I think it was September,

Speaker 7:          03:15:08       we were down there for the hurricane harvey. We were down there.

Speaker 1:          03:15:13       We raised some newer, you're feeding people and everything too. Yeah. We raised this money. Cool. Have you, that was very cool.

Speaker 7:          03:15:20       Part of that was because of the house fire. I mean obviously when I was someone who lost everything, so I understand where that comes from. So when the, I was actually on a hunt with Andy up in Alberta when the hurricane happened and I was completely disconnected from the news. I got a text from Sharon that just said, you won't believe what's happening down in Houston. So we ended up coming in and I looked it up, uh, with Wifi while we were in town. And then I showed Annie and I said, man, this is terrible what's happening in, down in Texas. So He's like,

Speaker 7:          03:16:01       I wish we could do something. I said, well, I'm Gunna, so I just, I ended up going live and offering to auction off my bow during a live feed and we ended up raising, thankfully there were three bidders. I don't know if I can announce who they were, but there were three bidders that bid, um, about 15 grand, I think it was, think it was 20, let me think. It was about 2100 bucks or 22,000. And then we had one person that offered to match the other two. So it ended up getting to be 30,000 that we raised, uh, went down to Houston and then, um, crispy who was doing a lot of, um, a lot of really cool things for getting supplies into the Houston area. Crispy. The hunting boot company? No crispy. Uh, that's his instagram. I don't know. It was a dude. Yeah, he's a guy.

Speaker 7:          03:17:02       Crispy. I thought you meant crispy boots. No. Okay. Um, so we, we ended up raising a bunch of money. Got It down there. Went down. You saw a lot of people to man. Yup. I watched a lot of those, uh, instagram posts. I was really very, very cool. Crispy and archery country, filled a full trailer full of supplies in Sharon and I flew down to Houston or we'll first we flew to Austin, then we drove to Houston and went down to a church where we did, where we ended up feeding a lot of people and then delivering all the supplies that we raised with the money that we got from auctioning off this bow. Um, which I know what it's like to lose everything. So I was pretty adamant about it. That's awesome. Um, yeah, it was, it was dynamite. Super rewarding feeling. Um, I don't know where I'm going with that. Oh, well listen, man, it's a good story. It's just cool. And I, I remember watching it online, I'm like, wow, that's bad ass. You know? And I know how sincere you are about that stuff too, you know, I think, um, that's a great,

Speaker 7:          03:18:07       great expression, you know, great thing to do. You did the same thing for Vegas. I mean you're passionate about certain things and you know, we've, we've had a lot of doors open for us from different communities. Texas was a big one for me because I worked for an archery company for many years in Texas, was one of my states as a sales rep. Um, did, that's one of the few places I'd live if I didn't live in California because if you pay said live, I was an la, I think in northern California. I think of like San Diego. I like San Diego, Colorado, Montana. Yeah. Once I get out of cop once to get out of California, then I'm my Colorado, Montana. I, Texas, Texas, Texas is in the mix baby. Cause I like Texans, man.

Speaker 5:          03:18:48       I like, I, there's, there's a stereotype about the worst texans, but they're not the best Texans. So you never met the best tech since the best Texans. Like, Oh, you're like some cool combination of smart and old school. You know, you're a cool combination of like hip and, and progressive and toddler on a tiger. And also you have guns. You want a tiger? He could get a dye. Yeah. Oh, you remember, did you see my bed? Remember that bit? You saw the little bit that I used to do about Texas. It's legit though. It is legit. Texas has more tigers in captivity than all of the wild of the world.

Speaker 12:         03:19:27       Okay.

Speaker 5:          03:19:27       More in Texas. And my joke was like one dude was like going through the regulations, like she hit, I don't know, you get a tiger ordered up to order it up and then his neighbor found out, he goes, mom, I didn't know you get tired. His neighbors got to guy tires and he's like, man about ain't about to let this fag it out. Tiger me. And he opened up tiger world. It's fucking ridiculous joke. That's based on a true fact that there's more tigers in captivity in Texas than anywhere in the world. But Texas, the thing is Texas of 2018 is not Texas of even 2008 and definitely not Texas of 1,980 [inaudible] it's better and smarter and it's a, it's a good place to be. Men. Texas is a good place to be. It's one of my favorite spots. It is cool. I love it there, man. I liked the people. There's sort of, it's a weird combination. It's like a country. It's a kind of think it is. I think it is too. It's a completely different

Speaker 12:         03:20:20       okay.

Speaker 5:          03:20:20       Being it, everything about it's different, isn't it? True. Well, I always explained it on stage about buckeys. You're taking people that have never been a buckeys, which I went to the first buckeys on that heat on when I took supplies down to Houston for the hurricane.

Speaker 12:         03:20:35       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          03:20:37       That was my first time at a buckies and I thought, is this a Frickin Costco? But with fuel, it doesn't make any sense. The way I describe it on stage, I always say this is like if you were in the middle of a full on cocaine binge, well someone came up to you and said, dude, I want you to make me the ultimate gas station. It's a gas station with hundreds of pumps. Like you can't believe how many pumps there are. It doesn't make any sense. It's like God damn field of pumps. It doesn't make any sense. And then you go into this building and it is a fucking warehouse filled with pickled alligator Dick. So different kinds of jelly beans and chuck Norris action genes and camouflage and Yeti coolers and smokers. You're like, what the fuck is this? And it's huge. I mean it's like a fucking God damn football field sized room filled with jelly beans, different kinds of Cammo and real tree.

Speaker 5:          03:21:37       There's a buckeys right there. There you can see that's a mild bucky. Is that? That's a plug that's on the edge of the fucking Wyoming or some shit. Chuck Norris. Geez, there's so many pumps. It doesn't make any sense. Look at that right there. How many pumps is that? One, two, 345678910 1112 504010202122 jets into fortunate and double. It might be on double it. That might be a hundred right, and there's two on each one, so it literally might be 200 for fucking pumps. Well, that's crazy. Why doesn't Chuck Norris Make Jeans? Sears too. Awesome. He used to, he used to, I used to own a pair of what? Let's see these. I'm alive. Any, no, not anymore, but I used to put them on the lace up in the front. They did? Yeah. The laced up in the front and let you do sidekicks. There it is. Bam. It has a gusset.

Speaker 5:          03:22:29       Looks like Chris Irwin. They had a gusset in the crotch area. I like that. The lace up to the front, so I might be lying. That might be a little longer in scene there for that. That cowboy boot kick. Well, back in the day they didn't understand about barbell jeans. They didn't have the time. Top of fabric technology. I do have a pretty good kick distance. Have you ever seen mine? I'm sure it's very long. It is. We'll make a video it later at the top of a doorway. Ooh, look at that dress shirt. That gentleman right there will always have my respect. Him and Bruce Lee or the reason why I got into martial arts a hundred percent watch it. Chuck Norris movies. When I was a kid, one of my most proudest moments of my life was in Chuck Norris. Do who I was. I ran into him at a kickboxing event in New Jersey like way back in the day, and it gave me this big hug.

Speaker 5:          03:23:18       It was one of his events that he had. He had a world combat. He gave me a big hug. I was like, Holy Shit. Chuck Norris knows who I am. Damn right. It couldn't have been happier. No wonder you're unbreakable. Soccer was beeman. And then we'll later, uh, I took a picture of me and tate tate again. Um, it was a, a award show that they did for an old school karate master and Chuck Norris was there and a bunch of other, uh, old school, American black belt karate guys, and they're telling these awesome oldschool karate stories. They didn't ask me to be there and speak a little bit and I would wouldn't, I mean I do anything for Chuck Norris. Like, no bullshit. Go corny as you want for watches. Chuck Norris changed. He changed my life for real. If it wasn't for Chuck Norris movies, who knows, I might not ever got into martial arts.

Speaker 5:          03:24:05       I watched him and like lone wolf, mcquaid and shit. I was like, God damn, that might be the coolest guy that's ever lived. Did she laugh? Uh, the other night in Vegas when we were talking about what my wife, Sharon's name was supposed to be and when we're coming up with fake names for people know her, what she was saying at Debra? No, but that was the fake name. He goes the fake name. My wife's name. Her Dad actually wanted to name right. Bruce Lee. Oh, that's right. That was the crazy story of all time. I forgot about that dude. Share and vape pens. He knew making a rude if your mood, if you knew Sharon, you would laugh at this. But uh, her dad was in a nun chucks and all kinds of solar and wind to my wife. When my wife was born. They didn't know what she was going to be. So they had a, he really wanted her name to be Bruce Lee. But if you knew Sharon, you'd knew, you know, she is far from briefly. Do we have any more Alpha brain we need?

Speaker 5:          03:25:07       Um, I made a deal with my wife. I said, I'm not naming the kids. I'm like, I just have veto power. I mean, this is not fair. I go, I just, it's like that was a good story to, it grew in your body. I'm like, I'm not, I'm not telling you what to name them. I mean, I will. I will 100% be there, but I'm saying like this, let's not pretend this is an even proposition like you doing that like 99.99999% of the work. Like you just, as long as you don't call them fucking apple sauce or something crazy. This is my kid pixie. You're not going to torture them with your wacky bullshit, but KCC. I just gave my suggestions, my feelings, but I was like, there's no way it's fair for me to name the kid. You know? Actually, she did have some goofy ass name for dudes and I might've had to put the fucking stamp on.

Speaker 5:          03:25:55       I know how hard it is for guys. Like a guy like John or a guy like joe that's, those are good names there. Solid, solid. There is. You can't file ood your fucking named John. You'd be like, what are you talking about? I had to see but like a fool. I had a CB uh, in junior high and I actually, I've always loved frogs. I know you have a frog tattoo and you're okay. Jamie. Google a Pixie frog. What's a Pixie frog? So the real thing, I used to have several. I had a pixie frogs. I like Jamie's a little controversial, right? I got get shit for that a little bit because it's a girl's name was no other fuckers. Those motherfuckers who came first. Hello Kelly. Kelly's like always a back and forth. When came first though, it's pat was on. So like when I was like that a kid Saturday that Sammy Saturday night live fricking ruin and pat shelley's and other ones.

Speaker 5:          03:26:50       Shelley used to be a common name for a gentlemen was Shelly Finkel. Shelly Finkel. You see one of them? Mike Tyson is a financial managers. Yeah. Pixie frogs are pretty big. Shelly Shit. There's a bunch of shelley's, a bunch of old Jewish men. That was shelly's sheldon, right at the shelter. Yes. Shelly Kelly. Shelly. I know a dude named Kelly got a fucking tattoo on his neck. What's up bitch? A punch you in the face kick isn't used anymore except for like if someone's being a dick. Yeah, you're right. Back in the day. Here's the crazy thing about dick. Dick was from Richard and then how was that possible? Jack's from John. How has chuck from Charles?

Speaker 5:          03:27:33       I looked that one up. These are all like Jack thing. It's like the Irish. I think they would just learn how to talk fucking ape. Well, my dad's middle name is definitely straight on a page. My Dad's middle name is deloitte. Deloitte deal. Why like exactly like homer Simpson. No, homeless him. Look at that. Oh my God. My tank. What's happening to the show? Dude? I used to have to grow in life. No, this is a Pixie frog, but you're just not just pixie frog and fixie frog eating a fucking rat with it's poking out the camera. I would have to buy mice to feed my, to pete feed my pixie frog because he ate mice to look at the size of that. Go back to that one. Please look at the size of its body with the full mouse in his body. He just expands like a water balloon. That's crazy. That's such a crazy, she's like frogs. And I thought they were really cool. Especially pixie frogs. They were super aggressive. They would eat something up to their size. Holy Shit. Like you could put a mouse in their cage the same size as them and they would tackle it crick and smoke it. I had them have you never seen him? It's a little tiny monster, right? So my, yeah.

Speaker 5:          03:28:51       Oh my God. Oh my God. We go all the way up Joe. Oh my God. Take that picture and send it to me. Take a picture of that. Sends me, there might be the greatest picture I've ever seen in my life. Save image. So, so my shit out of me with that handle Pixie. And I didn't know that a Pixie wasn't cool until someone else like address me on it. But I always saw the rock. It's like a trick. It's like the most demonic ruthless thing. How many animals eat an animal their size? I Dunno. That sucker did not a whole lot. That sucker did.

Speaker 5:          03:29:30       Mine was the size of a dinner plate. Unless that kid is a pixie himself. No, we're looking at as a young man, my lips like was this big. That little fella looks like he's about seven years old. This is an African bull frog. What it is, it's a Pixie. This is how big my frog was. We're holding John Dudley's holding us a typical ice tray that you would get in a hotel room. I would call it ice buckets rather rabbit. Oh my God. Look at the size of that rabbit might be a small girl. No, it was a big rabbit. I could tell by his feet. Go to it doesn't look right. It took a second look at them all. Oh yeah. That's another one. Eating a rat to their monsters. I had a lot of videos in mine. Just smoke in mice. That's crazy to think that it can literally eat something at the same time.

Speaker 5:          03:30:17       They were so it was a full fucking python. They found in Florida, in the everglades, that Ada deer, 110% I think I saw that. What have you, assholes done? You fucking Leonard skinner, loving muscle car driving dip shits keep a pythons and a fucking terrarium in your bedroom with Motley crue posters on the wall and you'd do acid. Decided that that that they go in your yard. Now they're eating deer that are 111 pounds. They're fucking huge man. Leave that day. Jesus Christ. Oh my God, it's so big. This thing is so big. This guy's holding onto it is, is that a biologist that's got it?

Speaker 5:          03:31:04       He's holding on to the mouth and the head controlling the body and inside of it is this enormous lump that is apparently a deer that's bigger than it's a whole body in terms of his body weight. Do you ever see them one more one died because it was trying to eat an alligator. He received that one. I think so dude. This is how gangster pythons are. They are a gangster, alligators. Anything that can unlock its jaw is pretty gangster dude. They fuck with alligators. They look at an alligator and they go, I'm going to just try to eat you. I saw, I actually went to a comedy skit at Riviera memory where you're talking about that. Look at this thing, dude, I don't interrupt a little bit, but go, go to the upper left upper left corner. You get the best example. This is what happened. It died because the alligator blew out the side of his asshole. What? I try to eat this thing, I mean, this literally happened. It literally swallowed up this fucking hole alligator face first, and the alligator backed it's way out of its asshole and they both died in the everglades. But there's this fucking snake is so big, it's trying to eat an alligator that's bigger than it.

Speaker 7:          03:32:12       Yeah. It doesn't care. These

Speaker 5:          03:32:15       crazy fucks have let these things loose

Speaker 7:          03:32:18       in the United States of America. It's simple math that, uh, that comic that we saw at Riviera I saw in the late nineties, which I think you were there at that time. We're talking about, which is kind of crazy. Uh, but he, he has going on here. Jamie, cutting a person out of a snake. Oh, wonderful. Good Times. Timing is this some place, John,

Speaker 5:          03:32:43       the lead and fucking narrowly escaped my train set on my train is dead. Oh my God. It is a fucking person coming out of this is what you need to learn folks. Just because you watch nature doesn't mean do you know nature. Just like if you watch porn, you're not getting laid. It's the same thing. If you take anything from this podcast, take that nature is like where you go, where you go. We were talking about BC and you, you go bear hunting. Tell the people how crazy it is up there. You're in the forest filled with monsters.

Speaker 7:          03:33:18       Oh yeah. Well they don't, uh, they don't watch the news. It's all about they can't, can I eat you? Yeah. Well, pretty much like this. My mouth is this big. You're this big. I think you can fit in it. Yeah. That's as simple as it gets that comic at revere that time. Who Was it? Do we, I don't

Speaker 2:          03:33:37       know. I wish I knew because it was actually a good rules are a really good bid. He said. Yeah, he, he pretty much talked about uh, the fact that he, you know, he's so sick of people getting uh, complaining about how fast they get because he said, you know, literally it's simple math people. Your mouth is this big. Your butt holes this big. At some point there's a bottleneck. And he just said, he said between your mouth and you're in your asshole. It wasn't, it wasn't don my rare, well I don't know. It was so long ago. I mean it was 20 years ago at most. That sounds like something. Dot Marrero. Say he just said, listen, it's simple math. That's your mouth. Is this big butt holes this big? Yeah. Why are you complaining about being fat? Well, that's the real concept behind that.

Speaker 2:          03:34:28       Um, 16 hour fasting. You know, Eddie Bravo in your mouth. I was doing 14 for a while, but Eddie said that it's 16 is really where all the benefits happen. So all right, I'll give it a try. So I tried 16 and a I see it. There's definitely something to it. There's more alertness. Um, I processed food better. I think giving your body a smaller window to process food is really wise. I think it also, it aids you because it gives you discipline. Just even just a little discipline. It's just a baby baby amount of discipline. But it's a no, it's a lot. It's not, it's not really to me and you, it's not, but just some people that is seriously, but it's all relative. But I'm just being honest with them. If they just, they need to get past that. It's not really a lot, but the benefits of it, like how you feel when you finally have your first meal.

Speaker 2:          03:35:13       When you cross over the line, like you feel better and your body works better and you have more energy. That's a fact I have for you. Absorb it faster. You and I both are big. Fasters I th I mean I fast. Um, I normally eat last maybe about seven o'clock at night and then I normally eating in about 10 or so in the morning. So I mean it's, it's quite a bit of time. And when I eat, I legitimately feel like I can feel my body absorbing everything that I'm consuming. Right. Like it's processed. Everything else. That's how it's supposed to be. I mean that's really what fat is all about, right? Fat Is all about you just keep stockpiling. Even though your body hasn't processed is like, I don't even want to put, I'll put it over here and your body's like stacking up fat over your body instead of utilizing it for fuel.

Speaker 2:          03:36:02       You're just not burning off enough calories. Yup. You know that is, that's what this whole fasting thing sort of normalize this for me at least. It just gives you this opportunity where your body says, let's just digest everything we got here. Let's just do this, and then when there's dude wakes up in the morning, would it be burning fats is the way to go and then you feel good. You have more energy. Body is using ketones, especially if you're like someone like myself that I'm not eating a lot of bread. If I eat bread once every two or three weeks, it's a big deal for the pasta. Once every two or three weeks, it's a big deal. Do you feel like dog shit when you do? No. No, but I don't go crazy. I don't go crazy if I don't go crazy. I don't feel bad.

Speaker 2:          03:36:40       But if I do go crazy, if I eat like a big piece of chocolate cake and some ice cream, I feel it way more now. Way more now. I think you're more in tune if you're, if you're conscious about it, I think you have a better understanding of what it actually does to you. That's a problem with people that are in the lifestyle of doing every single day is they don't really realize what it's doing to them. I think there's that. But I think there's also obviously a tolerance that you develop. Just like people develop a tolerance for alcohol. People develop a tolerance for weed. People definitely I think develop a tolerance for sugar. And when I don't have it, then I feel the full brunt of sugar. And it's like I remember, um, I took my family to get cheeseburgers and milkshakes and I had a big ass fucking vanilla milkshake and it was so good.

Speaker 2:          03:37:28       Oh my God, I was drinking this big ass like 20 ounce vanilla milkshake and I was eating this cheeseburger and I hit the wall so hard after it was over I had a sit down like a bike. What kind of bitch in mind that I'm, I'm getting taken out. I get like hamstring buy a cheeseburger and a milkshake, but it was just clearly that I've been eating clean for so long. My body had no idea what to do with that giant dump of sugar. How much sugar do you think is in 20 ounces or 18 and I don't know how much it was like one of those, you know those Sunday drink things that give you a where it's a big ass. Oh God. Glass fill. Which ice cream milkshake today I was in the airport in De Moines and I got a coffee hundred grams. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          03:38:16       20 ounce chocolate shake. Nutrition information. How many tablespoons is that? 100. How many tablespoons is a hundred oh my god, it's so crazy. It was in de Moines airport this morning. I got a coffee and a guy behind me getting a coffee. He was like, I think he was a baggage handler for one of the airlines. I literally came up and I poured nothing but half and half in my coffee. I'm a big, I actually feel like I thrive off fat now, right, because that's what my body wants. He unscrewed the top of the jar of meth? No. Yeah, pretty much. He unscrewed the top off the sugar and he started, I was actually like, God, dude, can you do that again so I can video this? He unscrewed the top off the sugar and started pouring his coffee and he poured and I was like, oh my God, is that a lot? And then he kept going and kept going and kept going and then he tipped the thing down, put the top back on the sugar and then poured in fricking creamer and I was, I was sitting there like, dude, that is, it's rich. It's literally like two or three times what you're saying and the problem

Speaker 5:          03:39:34       is this guy that was half my size needed that to feel like he could get the day going or it's a big, that's a big problem. His job so bad. They just wanted to go into a diabetic coma in the middle of the fucking middle of the work floor. He's just like, look, fuck this insulin. I'm just eating about a half a pound of sugar. Let's do this. Okay. I love it. It's got myself wet. What's that? No, it's okay. It's just my pants. It's just this. Nothing about jeans. My barbell jeans are wet. Look, embarrassment. Listen, this is for your own good ladies and gentlemen. It's for comedy. It is. We're okay though. No computer. No. How many tablespoons of sugars in a hundred grants. When I think of a hundred grams, I'm thinking like a baseball of sugar. That's what I think. It's a lot. A major league baseball of sugar.

Speaker 5:          03:40:31       Does that make sense? Yeah, for sure. Is that legit? Can I see like a physical representation of 100 grams of sugar? One tablespoon equals 12 grams. That's eight. Eight and a half. That's so crazy. What does that look like? Quite a baseball. It's a baseball because in baseball, Huh? Eight and a half. Eight and a half is bigger than a golf ball. That's, I'm just being conservative. How many golf balls? One Kiwi. Two. Three. I bet it's two golf balls, Jamie. Whoa, that's a lot. If you got damn fault nor did that, you'd be on cloud. Nine seconds. Look at that corridor just to get proportion. That's crazy. Holy Nuggets. That's all are you fucking know? No wonder why it hits a wall. Cups. Paris. There's a hundred grams right here. I think it's comparing a hundred grams. Two Cups. Oh, there's two gaps. So it's one cup, one cup the size of the hundred grams. That's nuts. That's so much sugar. And that's what's in a milkshake. I got to go to the doctor 10 years ago, but I still have to go to the doctor today because of it. Um, let's wrap this up. I going to pee again. It's already four o'clock. Let's shoot some arrows.
