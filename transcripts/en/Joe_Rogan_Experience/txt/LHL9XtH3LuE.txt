Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Oh you dirty freaks.

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       It is Monday April 22nd. Two days after 420 and I'm here with my man Tony Hinchcliffe. He has never been an individual guest on the podcast for but we've done podcast before under the Icehouse Chronicles which by the way is available on the desk one label on iTunes as well as the whole areas. KEVIN PEREIRA As podcast called pointless muff said if you want to hear chicks talk about sucking decks and stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:00:36       Oh that's video games and comic books. Well how about we just give him a little false advertising. Brian maybe.

Speaker 4:          00:00:46       Maybe you get more people don't you know what this country runs on son. No I'm upset with what's right. Ryan killed Ryan Kelly.

Speaker 5:          00:00:53       Very very funny and talented Ryan Keeling and Brian also does a gang of shows and he's doing some soon in San Francisco and Sacramento at the punch line in Sacramento. And with this man Tony Hinchcliffe you'll be there as well. And what were we doing the apples here. Yeah I was talking about this. Tony. Tony it's because finance. I was Tony road. It's great. He cries when you fuck him. But.

Speaker 6:          00:01:19       Here here here here.

Speaker 5:          00:01:22       But tell that to legendary comedy clubs Sam Tripoli as well our boy Sam Tripoli who's one of my very good friends in comedy for many many years. He's a fucking beautiful human being I love that guy and very funny as well. And so they are at Cobb's on Sunday May 5th and May 3rd and 4th they're at the punch line in Sacramento. And if you've never been to the punch line in Sacramento I've never been to a comedy club. The punch line in Sacramento is like one of the perfect comedy clubs to go to because it's been around for ever. This as well as places like I don't remember the first time I worked there. But it was well over a decade ago it's a bad ass old school comedy club and some great great great comedy has been done on that stage perfectly set out really intimate seating.

Speaker 5:          00:02:05       So it's a bad ass place to see three very funny guy. So May 3rd and 4th at the punch line in Sacramento and May 5th at Cobb's and in San Francisco and there might be a surprise guest there might not be though too there might not be may be AIDS get stronger maybe World War Z is for real but maybe there's gonna be a big guest maybe there's a lot a lot of times you can't say because the reason being I'd say if you're doing a show like this like we might have a friend that's in town it says hey I want to do the show but they don't want to advertise because they have a committed gig within X amount of miles with an X amount of months and sometimes not supposed to say that you're doing a gig like that's why.

Speaker 2:          00:02:46       Like if you go to like some some guys you don't have a hard time with the Comedy Store for putting your name up there because they would have like a gig they were doing in a big place or try to sell tickets for. So we'd have an arrangement. So that's why I can't say but it might be someone very funny.

Speaker 7:          00:03:01       It might be somebody that hardly ever leaves L.A. and hardly ever leaves the Comedy Store. Mm hmm.

Speaker 8:          00:03:08       Wow this is exciting. I want to know who it is.

Speaker 5:          00:03:11       Okay. I don't even know who the fuck it is yet. I think I do. If if it is I think it is he's awesome. Yeah they're the comedy stores that means 80 percent awesome. You know even the 20 percent mediocre it's probably better than what you got in your town anyway.

Speaker 9:          00:03:23       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:03:25       So you're a powerful Ryan Keeley mob said All right you guys. We. This podcast is brought to you by Tang. I'm so glad that when when we we pick up a podcast sponsor you're always like oh what if these kinds of douche bags you know like what if that's like a big fear you know when you take on a sponsor because you know I'm on network I don't have a channel I'm just you know I'm just doing this thing and I'm trying to like navigate all this stuff by myself.

Speaker 10:         00:03:53       So my attitude with the whole thing was I looked and I said the most important thing first of all is that I don't feel duty like whatever we're selling and everybody's like then it's too late for you know for brain do she.

Speaker 4:          00:04:14       You know I just want to make sure that what we're selling is a good product. So I get all these emails and tweets tweets especially sometimes about talking about people saying how much money they're saving on Tang and guy one guy talked about it a couple of weeks ago. He wrote to me. He chopped his bill down from 90 bucks to like 18. I don't know how the fuck he did I know what he's doing. That sound sounded completely outrageous.

Speaker 7:          00:04:39       Well my bill has been that guy about twenty five dollars a month. I mean and I have to say that this is my second phone and this is you know my massage parlor phone. Dan would you say that you use it 50 percent as much as you earlier your other phone or I'd probably say my other phone I use it 50 percent more maybe it's maybe a little bit a little bit higher maybe 60 maybe six.

Speaker 11:         00:04:57       So probably be the equivalent of sixty dollars someone like that would you say that.

Speaker 12:         00:05:02       Yeah that makes sense. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:05:03       So if that's still him it's still cheaper than then what like. Right now I have you know the iPhone through AT&T as my main phone and that's about one hundred and twenty two hundred ten dollars a month. You

Speaker 4:          00:05:12       know it's fucking very pricey. Yeah. What thing does is they first of all they use the Sprint network then have their own network these one of the major networks in this country one that you know it's it's got 4G it's it's excellent and they also have the highest level of the most technologically advanced Android phones all these new fucking killer Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the Samsung Galaxy Note They have the note 2 as well they're fucking incredibly things he used to be like you really lost something if you didn't get an iPhone like you really have you try to have one of those early Android they were dog shit. I had the first one was Oh you're so stupid those things are horrible that and those BlackBerry touch screens these to have eyes to have one of those the BlackBerry Storm.

Speaker 13:         00:06:00       Yeah fuckin storm of shit.

Speaker 4:          00:06:04       So that was diarrhea and that's stupid shit bag phone but these SAMs I have the Galaxy S3 it's fucking awesome it's great it's the coolest thing ever for like looking at websites. It's huge and it's very fast as well like the processor and it's not like clunky like like the droids of all. So anyway the waiting has it set up is they have no contracts so you buy a device set it up and go. You can go fuck yourself you could just cancel not only that they credit you on unused service if you if you use only a certain amount of your bill they actually like knock you down to the next level and your next bill and they credit you the difference it's it's beautiful it's everything you could ask for from a big company like a company that's dead I mean they're not one of the bigger cell phone companies.

Speaker 14:         00:06:53       I mean how many cell phone companies are there actually really stop thinking well there's like the big five or whenever you like T-Mobile Ryan Verizon AT&T it's like you generally thought of it's like this it's like a rise in powerful AT&T powerful T-Mobile you're on a budget yeah yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:07:11       Right now it is it's crazy because T-Mobile as you know they're new towers are pretty advanced and they don't have that fucking you know bandwidth hogs that you know AT&T and Verizon they're their bandwidth I mean so many people are on their network when something goes down half the people have Verizon or AT&T you know they're not gonna have cell phone service but then you have like T-Mobile guys they're like No I'm fine. That's a very good point. That's a very good point.

Speaker 5:          00:07:33       Yeah. And Sprint is a big one. Joey Diaz That's him forever. He loved it. I've never had it other than this but I've got no problems with it.

Speaker 2:          00:07:41       Yeah and the though the whole idea behind thing is that they're just going to offer you a service that's you know it's just it's reasonable. You don't have to get fucked over it doesn't have to be this idea that we all think that every company should try to squeeze every last dollar out of every last customer. I think that shit's stupid. I think most people rise up realizing that as well. So go to Rogan distinction and you can save yourself twenty five dollars off of either a phone or service from a very cool company were also brought to you by square space. So you have to ask yourself do you want to make a web site.

Speaker 10:         00:08:21       Bitch that's my question to you bitch. Do you want make a web site. And if you do let's get a real young guy learn no HMO OK. You're not going to use it. It's just not gonna happen. Okay let's be honest.

Speaker 15:         00:08:33       Another thing you don't need to begin to you to really learn how to put all that shit in and it's gonna be all fucked up and then you gonna try to what look at it unlike Windows Internet Explorer. It's going to shit. But look it works on safari.

Speaker 16:         00:08:53       You don't have to do that anymore.

Speaker 15:         00:08:54       What square space you can go there and you can create your own Web site.

Speaker 17:         00:08:58       It's so easy that you can setup a store just like that Bryant did it while we were doing the commercial Bryant registered a fucking thing on square space started. What was it called.

Speaker 7:          00:09:11       And it was all on the servers. Now that was a different looks. However you did for square space 2. No I made a web site but if you're thinking of I bought Digg party.

Speaker 18:         00:09:21       Oh you'd buy Digg party my mouth dot com dot com although and then didn't you. But didn't you build a website with square space. Yeah. I did a dolphin. Sex dolphin website. I tried to do it right now. It's Brian.

Speaker 19:         00:09:35       Look Brian is much more technically advanced than or aware than I'll ever be. He can throw one of these fucking things together very quickly and he did it through square space. You know why we're just all still doing a show as well. It's super easy if you go to square space dot com forward slash job.

Speaker 4:          00:09:53       You can sign up with no credit card needed and just try it out.

Speaker 14:         00:09:55       You just start building a website and if you decide to purchase use the offer code Joe 4 and Joe and 4 for April. That's all one word or one thing. Joe for. And then you get 10 percent off your first purchase on new accounts includes monthly and annual plans.

Speaker 10:         00:10:13       And again that square space dot com forward slash Joe. And if you're going to enter in the code use the code Joe for CSL some shekels sun on your fat juicy Web site. It's definitely I can create a Web site on this.

Speaker 20:         00:10:30       In a way that I never could in real life because I am just way too HDD for that shit.

Speaker 21:         00:10:37       I'm not going to learn and do that.

Speaker 9:          00:10:39       I had to. I have one where I'm trying to keep up with but this looks this looks even better.

Speaker 10:         00:10:44       It's dope pretty easy. Super easy. Yeah yeah it's good. Go get it. So delicious. We're also brought to you by Audible dot com. I was actually listening to. Do you know why I got hooked on man. I'm hooked on now. How dare you. I read super awesome Dan Carlin's Hardcore History. Oh yeah. Dude. God damn. Ever since we had a guy on the show we had on a podcast. Guy was great to talk to. Fascinating guy.

Speaker 17:         00:11:12       Really really interesting intelligent guy but when it comes to history he's been putting together like forever. He's been putting together these history podcasts and they're like a show. It's not like a podcast like this sloppy unorganized mass that I try to fucking serve up to Fox. Dan Carlin puts on a god damn show and he he puts it on in like this really entertaining way and gives you this thorough history of all these events but like really exciting stuff.

Speaker 22:         00:11:47       What are you doing. You chatting with Kara. I care. I'm single you.

Speaker 13:         00:11:50       Hey dude how dare you. How dare you even give people the idea to do that. No care is gonna be super upset with you and probably sue this show. Fine. I'll see what I'm here is like some super hardcore feminist and she's like enough Joe Rogan. What if she's in India fingering yourself.

Speaker 23:         00:12:07       Oh easy over here with the thing is I'm on hardcore history.

Speaker 17:         00:12:14       I'm on the. The Mongols. Now he's got this. I don't know how many parts it is. I mean part 3. It's fucking amazing. It's so great and it's available on audible dot com. He's got all the back episodes. I mean he's been doing it since I think he said 2005. So you know this guy's got a solid eight years of podcasts under him. It's crazy and they're awesome.

Speaker 24:         00:12:44       I listened to one on Germany in World War 2 the bombings of Europe. He's so fucking cool to listen to.

Speaker 14:         00:12:52       It's really bad ass if you go to all we've got Audible dot com Ford slash Joe. You can try audible free for 30 days and get a free audio book not just that they also have standup comedy on there they have a huge selection of audio entertainment not just books but podcasts like Hardcore History and and so many other really interesting things to listen to including our pals Opie and Anthony. You can you can get that on audible as well. It's a cool service and I've been a fan for years. I'm a huge fan of audio books this Hardcore History has been making my life like so much more interesting the last couple of days. Like when I get in my car I'm not like thinking oh you know you get my car and drove and probably stuck in traffic I'm going to go all let's hear more about the Mongols. That's what I'm thinking.

Speaker 24:         00:13:44       It's just Genghis Khan was a mother fucker. Yeah dude King Kong killed almost 70 million people by some counts. Some accounts say more than that. Some accounts say but as little as 10 million. Like He definitely killed 10 million. God damn it's unbelievable. That's the best. They're talking about armies that were coming towards China where the Mongols had been and in the distance they thought they saw snow covered mountains. But when they got close they realized there were mounds of bones. Oh my God. The Mongols had killed 10 million people in this one town they came to this gigantic state and just killed 10 million people. It was amazing. I mean horrific terrifying. Just the idea that that at one point in time just in the twelve hundred's relatively short amount of time ago there was a guy who brought a bunch of other dudes with him on horseback and just fucked up the whole world banded together took hostages took the hostages pushed them to the front lines so the hostages would literally lead the way and people would be defending their towns having to shoot arrows at their own friends who had been kidnapped their own loved ones their own children the Mongols were fucking terrifying.

Speaker 25:         00:15:09       It's terrifying to think that just a thousand years ago not even there was a dude who figured out a way to get hundreds of thousands of mass murderers to work together. Hundreds of thousands of serial killers. Hundreds of thousands of brutal rapists. Hundreds of thousands of ruthless remorseless murderers. And they got together on horseback. It takes one convincing leader. God damn Genghis Khan must have been a mother fucker because there was nobody like that before and nobody liked that since his sons tried to hang on to it for a little while but you know what.

Speaker 24:         00:15:47       The reign of power all really came through that one bad motherfucker.

Speaker 15:         00:15:53       They had a crazy saying that an armies of donkey led by a lion could conquer an army of lions led by a donkey. They were all about tactics and they would beat much larger armies with severe superior strategy and cunning and just ruthlessness. Just everybody was terrified of them. They just they killed everybody man men women children babies they didn't give a fuck. They killed everybody. They eight people. They hate each other. They got too hungry.

Speaker 10:         00:16:26       They would draw straws maybe or figure out how they would figure out you know if someone's gonna sacrifice themselves so that the army could go on and they would slaughter them and eat them and cook them.

Speaker 26:         00:16:37       Dude it's unbelievable. I was only a thousand years ago. What the fuck man.

Speaker 27:         00:16:44       You think it will ever anybody else ever pull that off again.

Speaker 24:         00:16:47       That kind of craziness that's terrifying to wonder.

Speaker 10:         00:16:50       I think if you had to worry about anything it would be worry about all this beautiful city shit shutting down. That's the real fear. The real fear is we have some massive disaster like a solar flare that knocks out our power grid and our ability to pump gas is gone. Our ability to drive back and forth to places is gone. Our ability to get food people's gone and then you realize how nutty we are spread out and how dangerous this is and how vulnerable we are living like this. I think you would take something like that to bring people to some place where you could get that many psychopaths all together again.

Speaker 9:          00:17:29       Yeah I think now that we have the internet if the Internet went down I think shit we get crazy really quick because everybody needs it and is used to it now. Everything down to the G.P.S. and just everything.

Speaker 17:         00:17:40       Yeah we're terrified. I'm terrified of leaving leaving the house that my fucking cell phone right.

Speaker 14:         00:17:45       I'm a little bitch. I'm a little bitch the machine. Speaking of machine we're talking about the human machine. Our last sponsor on it dot com.

Speaker 18:         00:19:49       How long. How long till you have like a health helmet.

Speaker 10:         00:19:53       If we if it comes out do we'll sell it. If there's a health element that comes out that puts you in a healthy state of mind. What if there was a helmet that came on that immediately felt like someone was sucking your dick. How. How quick before they would make that illegal. Like immediately like they found a spot on your brain where they can joke with electricity and it totally feels like someone's sucking your dick a helmet that helps your helmet a helmet for your helmet. Exactly how much do you think they would make that women would make that illegal.

Speaker 3:          00:20:21       Would it be men and maybe a little bitch about it a lot of men would make it illegal because they'd never get real blow jobs over again girls.

Speaker 28:         00:20:28       But just put the fucking helmet on kind of why do you want me to do this.

Speaker 9:          00:20:31       It'd be a tough situation for women if the helmet worked that well it came.

Speaker 29:         00:20:35       You think they would lose a little bit of their value. Is that what you're saying.

Speaker 9:          00:20:38       Oh yeah I think I should be walking her out these helmets on helmet. What's the normal thing.

Speaker 19:         00:20:44       How much time do you think it is before something like that is invented something that can recreate an artificial experience like almost almost exactly.

Speaker 9:          00:20:51       I'll bet you 15 20 years. I bet it's not that far away. The way things are moving and shaking there's probably a bigger team of scientists on that right now than there is on cancer research.

Speaker 30:         00:21:02       You're right. Everybody is building the helmet.

Speaker 31:         00:21:05       Everybody wants to get their dicks sucked and then wrote on it.

Speaker 11:         00:21:10       Thought Tom Ford slashed Joe. Cue the music Brian. Let's get this bitch started.

Speaker 32:         00:21:15       Boom son the will gain experience. We're full Tony.

Speaker 33:         00:21:30       George Clooney.

Speaker 5:          00:21:32       That's me. That's the song. That's the powerful Tony Hinchcliffe song. I say it like that. I sing like a woman. And then you go.

Speaker 34:         00:21:38       That's me like a little kid. Hey everybody. Somebody put that on a loop when you have your own podcast.

Speaker 35:         00:21:44       What are you guys going to do a podcast that once you guys where it are in the works it starts Oh okay Lucky. Two weeks. I think we sat in preproduction.

Speaker 10:         00:21:52       Yeah niceness niceness until he's gonna be with me on this Wednesday night at the icehouse went to the ice ones it. Sure. 10:00. OK. Brian's going to be there too as well as Tom Seger and Burt Krisha.

Speaker 18:         00:22:04       Oh shit bitches. That's right. You heard sweet. That's right.

Speaker 10:         00:22:12       Tony is an up and coming young standup. I love one of my favorite things in life for real. This really is absolutely true is when I don't know about someone and then I find out that they're funny. Like when I found out about it from Brian. Brian told me about you. And as a comedian like one of things that every comedian always loves is seeing a new comedian like some. Someone who knew who's funny like does another one say oh there's another one you know and different styles and different you know different takes but when they're funny like it's really it gives you a lot of hope. And I was I was in L.A. the entire time like you started comedy and you know and then started getting a little a name for yourself. And then eventually got to the point where you're you know regularly doing you know podcasts and comedy clubs and yeah. So that's that's a really cool thing to say. Yeah it's really so much fun. Pretty incredible. So few people pull it off. You know I love watching somebody who comes through like some new person is funny.

Speaker 9:          00:23:13       It's like because we to all the class thing and like you said everybody's a little bit different. Everybody has their you know their take on things. But when you find one there's nothing cooler it's sort of like when you love comedy it's like watching a baby being born like just like that. Wow. Yeah. Larson's hilarious and when.

Speaker 2:          00:23:31       You know like you when you run into someone and you you realize that you know they started out sucky and you probably saw them in like those during those first couple of months. And then within a couple of years they become competent and then boom they become really good and they like like Ari is my favorite example. Oh yeah. I was there when Ari first got on stage like one of his first sets one of the earliest sets. And you know I've watched him become like a real killer like Ari Shapiro is like a real killer. He did. Tom Seger is party of day top scorer had a benefit rather for his doggy. He got a sick dog. If you if you love dogs you love Tom Segura. I don't know how you would donate.

Speaker 36:         00:24:15       I think they have like a paper out there so don't go to your mom's house podcast on your mom's house podcast dot com.

Speaker 10:         00:24:20       Tom Sawyer is just one of the coolest guys ever. And he had the show and Ari went up and fucking destroyed destroyed with a bunch of shit that I hadn't heard before to those couple bits that were really funny that were new. He writes like a machine. Yeah he's awesome. He's isn't here. He's just coming up with so much content. Yeah. I think he also realizes at this time that he's like you know he's again he's like a real comic now. Now it's just a matter of doing the work. And he's a smart dude you know he knows how to he knows how to put it down. He knows what needs to be done and he can go get it done just as as a fan of comics. It's so cool and someone pops up.

Speaker 9:          00:25:00       There's another one I got really lucky with Ari because he was the first person I asked me to do a gig with him and Sam Tripoli. So was those two guys all of a sudden all at once I went to La Hoya with Sam first and then did a gig and like Irvine with Ari. What year was this. This is about 2008. That's so recently.

Speaker 37:         00:25:21       That's awesome.

Speaker 9:          00:25:24       Five years I don't think of it as being recently but you know there was like a year or so that I was doing it before you even get a road gig like that you're just building it. I was you know just riding my bicycle from open mike to open mike.

Speaker 4:          00:25:38       How many guys that started out with you.

Speaker 19:         00:25:41       You know we all have like kind of like groups of people that we sort of start off around a similar time and then you watch each other either fall off or give up or are some people get through the net. How many people that with your class do you think got through with my true class.

Speaker 9:          00:25:57       I'd probably say about good. It's a tough one because we're still pulling you know and I mean you still don't know who can make like a bit throw a right hook right at the end before they drop out and have a new 15 minutes the crushes and it's a breakthrough. But I probably guess about seven or ten right around there. That's a good number. Like still doing I mean you know I'm counting my original starting classes like a good you know 60 70 80 90 right people because I know the I mean I stayed in Hollywood and built in Hollywood like Los Angeles because I feel like a lot of people start somewhere and then come to L.A. I'm like You know what I'm going to. I wanted to just have a like an NBA style perspective like Chappelle once said and he was doing a spot on stage one night and the LR really late crushing making it look like I mean it was just unbelievable.

Speaker 9:          00:26:48       And the three or four hours and he goes the back Laramie goes hey how many guys are L.A. comics and a lot of people clapping. But how many of you are like work here at the Comedy Store and started here at the Comedy Store. That was just two or three of us that clap. He goes You guys are insane. He's performing to a lot of comedians right. So the thing with him coming back a few years ago was like the audience that got to be there was there but the back of the room filled up to the gills. Right. And he said that it's like learning how to dribble in the NBA starting comedy at the Comedy Store. And it's so true. But but if you think about that start learning how to dribble in the NBA and you're you and you're just used to the motion of a thousand miles an hour. Yeah then that works out.

Speaker 11:         00:27:33       I think it's like anything else. You know it's a more difficult but also more rewarding pursuit pursuit.

Speaker 14:         00:27:41       You know you can take an easy route through life or you can you know I mean it's not as hard as being a Navy SEAL. Let's be honest you know even though doing comedy is hard and a lot of people don't ever figured out it's not nearly as hard as doing something you hate and being stuck working 40 hours a week at this job for the rest of your life until your heart stops beating because you have no passion right.

Speaker 9:          00:28:02       And I mean it was a real struggle for a few years I really threw myself to the wolves. I didn't have sure I didn't have money saved up. I was just I was just doing it and then I got the job working at the Comedy Store a couple of months and like as a door guy. So I started getting spots a lot there which is what I wanted.

Speaker 10:         00:28:17       You know the problem the story like yours is that it worked. So there's a lot of the dudes out there that will try that same thing but they're not fucking funny at all.

Speaker 9:          00:28:27       You know what's tough is it is I noticed that a lot a lot of people come up to me and say I'm thinking about starting standup Tony. You know what do you what do you think and sometimes they don't they just sometimes I wonder out of all the times I get asked this from somebody that wants to start standup it's like you have to really have a crazy mind ingrained in you it's not something you start and learn like. I was in trouble. Every class in school not once a day at school like every class every teacher hated me. I never touched and I was never like spilled milk on somebody I never did anything physical but verbally I was just. It's the it's what I did is pretty crazy. And I mean you know like so you just always talk to Russia totally to the extreme all the time.

Speaker 9:          00:29:18       And that's that's like Kid energy you know I'm talking about the fun even now. Now I'm like I'll even. I'm still young it's like I'm not half of the quick wit that I used to be before I realized I wasn't now I overthinking is a defense thing you learned it from your parents like I learned of you Dad. It's really an interesting situation is the way I raised I was raised with so weird that I know it has something to do with that because I have these four older brothers and sisters that are much older than me. So it's like I mean it's 12 years between me and my closest sibling and they're all much older.

Speaker 15:         00:29:52       Oh wow yeah. So you probably exposed to like they probably give you a hard time and pretty fucked with you really they were absolutely all super cool.

Speaker 9:          00:30:02       They were actually super cool. That's how I and that's sometimes I wonder how it didn't end up like that. I mean there were times you know there was the old you know you were adopted. Why do you think you're.

Speaker 10:         00:30:11       Well you know what. When they're 12 years apart I don't think you're actually going to get them because they're gonna be sweet to you you're like happy for a little brother and sister. It's when you two years apart you know. Yeah I've I've known a lot of brothers beat the fuck out of each other. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:30:24       Obviously that album Luckily with the age gap like they were in college when I was you know in kindergarten and stuff. What was interesting about that is I definitely think it played a role because I was hanging out with 20 year olds when I was a little kid and they probably thought I was really funny when you talk shit too. Totally. This whole thing.

Speaker 30:         00:30:42       That's what I would do I would talk shit and I would put on terrible magic shows in which the whole ongoing joke was that you can clearly see you know I had not seen comedian magicians right yet. I was just trying to do magic but I was bad at it but I could just the way I like that and well it started I had to get good at doing it on purpose because it was happening accidentally and I would just try to follow through with it. So you started off trying to be good.

Speaker 38:         00:31:08       Yeah right. But then I just got good at being that magic.

Speaker 11:         00:31:14       Yeah it's a funny thing when you see someone who grew up like in a weird spot like that. I think all of us like every comic I know grew up in some sort of a weird situation where some basic need wasn't fulfilled. So that creates like this weird personality. Totally.

Speaker 10:         00:31:31       I even though I love comics when that when it doesn't create that weird personality it just creates fucked up people you know like if you don't put it to use like creating something that weird energy that comes out of a weird life. If you did that shit will haunt you like that can that can wreck your life if you're one of those really creative people or more impulsive people and doesn't do anything about it don't doesn't focus in on something yeah.

Speaker 38:         00:31:57       And it's just that's an interesting point because with me I didn't have any creative outlet until like after high school because the theater woman always wanted me to join theater. Yeah but I never did. And I mean the only outlet other than doing it in front of people all the time and just you know being me I had nothing. So then I spent a few years like what am I. Because you don't know if you're just a kid that loves making people laugh that you can be a standup comedian right. When you're in Ohio there's no people in L.A. are really lucky or in New York around those areas because there's comedy there at least you can stumble across a comedy club and go and wonder what's going on there. I might go in there tonight just one time. First time I was ever at a comedy club was at the Comedy Store and I had signed up for the open mike and gotten on. So it's very grandiose. I mean you know it's like my heart was beating out of my chest. I knew that it was something I was gonna be doing forever no matter what how you knew it.

Speaker 20:         00:33:00       You know it was something I definitely didn't know the first time I went on stage I was I was scared shitless to the waist. More scared than I thought I was going to be.

Speaker 9:          00:33:10       Oh I never I It is unbelievable. It is so creepy because what ended up happening was is I've blanked out and forgot everything that I'd been and that was the one time that I was I had a couple months to prepare for three minutes.

Speaker 31:         00:33:25       Did you bring notes on stage with you.

Speaker 38:         00:33:27       No I never liked. I've never liked having notes onstage with me.

Speaker 10:         00:33:31       That was a big thing man getting rid of your notes. I was a big thing back in the day. Going on stage with notes still. Yeah. Because in the beginning I definitely went on stage with notes when I first started doing it but I saw like really good guys go on stage with notes when they were working on new shit. Yeah it became like part of the act that they let you know they were trying stuff out by looking down at the paper. But you try to do the first one free ball.

Speaker 38:         00:33:55       Yeah like really bad in a I somehow was just digging myself out by calling out how terrible it was. I just I was basically saying Wow I just blanked out. And I've been getting ready for this for so long and so I just ended up doing what actually ended up sort of becoming my style which is like calling out whatever's happening in the room except I was just joking about me bombing.

Speaker 10:         00:34:22       You kind of have to call out what's happened in the room right. Oh yeah. And that's that's one. Another good thing rather that the comedy store provides no crowd control. Right. None. That place is madness. There's something I could be madness.

Speaker 38:         00:34:37       That's why I like it was so modern. Anything can happen at the Comedy Store. So like for example like when we did that show in Indianapolis and I came out and I'm looking at the masses of people but the first thing that I notice to my left is this lady lit up next to the stage that's doing sign language to the to the audience. And I just couldn't help but the start like I always say you know it started just with I've never performed in front of one of these people before. I've always wondered what that would be like. And I'm noticing that she has to keep up with everything that I'm saying. So like I went off on this whole run about it that it's just so much fun for me and I could trust my instinct and just keep going with it because I even though like I wouldn't have known to do that if I was just trying to just put on like an act.

Speaker 5:          00:35:24       Right. Right. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:35:26       Which is also great. But I got to go off on a run there and I could trust that instinct you know by the end I have her doing blow job motions to her face because I realized that if I said the word blow job she has to do that jerk off that is on her face or off on the face is the that's the sign language for that. Yeah. This is blow job or at least that's what she was doing.

Speaker 10:         00:35:45       Actually was he because they switched halfway through the whole thing but they switched the trick was like enough tone handling so I think so I just quit. I don't I don't know what happened how did you have a backup so close that you they get tired I guess so signing maybe you need like really good hand cardio but not being crazy.

Speaker 9:          00:36:03       I had you know crazy a ton of tweets. Indianapolis was so much fun and everybody was like hash tagging sign language because I couldn't even believe what was going on.

Speaker 17:         00:36:12       Yeah I did that once in San Francisco a guy brought his own remember that. Yeah. And he sat right in the front.

Speaker 10:         00:36:19       Yeah. Guy brought his own sign person. I was like wow that's pretty gangster. Guy was deaf. You want to go see some comedies like I'm tell you they're saying Yeah you look really nice guys. That was a fun show. He did.

Speaker 39:         00:36:32       I forget what he did because it was a I was obviously timing things he didn't talk. It was really funny. It was really funny like you could tell the guy like really enjoyed standup comedy. And even though he was deaf he still understood. Like what. You know he understood jokes. It's got to be weird because he's only getting it like two dimensional. Right. You don't if you don't hear it. Yeah man you're missing so much.

Speaker 17:         00:36:56       Like there's a lot of guys like Joey Díaz perfect example of you half of what's funny is how he sounds like you know the way sounds is the fucking intensity of his voice.

Speaker 10:         00:37:07       Well it's like when he when he hits those six when he starts screaming about something like he was screaming about it's blue cheese with buffalo wings or go fuck your mother it was just fucking ranch dressing. He went on his rant about ranch dressing and on paper it's like there's nothing funny about that at all. But if you hear him if you hear Joe and you see him do it. It was one of the finest fucking things I've seen with other passion the arms from deep but I mean maybe this guy had like a deep sense of his own timing.

Speaker 19:         00:37:37       You know he can interpret it in the finest way because he was obviously a fan of stand up comedy enough to hire his own sign language person. Yeah I've been at a college show once were they they made them have a sign language it was like a part of the rules. Like if someone spoke they had to have someone there. That's a I was wondered how complicated is that sign language.

Speaker 9:          00:37:58       I mean it seems like it seemed really I was watching some parts of it because at one point when you were on I walked around and sort of was watching from the side ledge area and I noticed that when you said the word at one point polite cock this guy had to do this thing where it was this giant like right.

Speaker 5:          00:38:20       Well that's the strap on bit. Right.

Speaker 9:          00:38:22       Well it was it was something. It was when you were taking questions at the end it was like you were talking about Dennis Rodman's cock or something like that.

Speaker 40:         00:38:30       He was like oh very improvised. Oh the Kim Jong Il thing I was noticing this guy has to do this thing like that black cock and sign language. Is this. It's like so stereotypical like it's just giant and his hands were so far apart it is like he was describing a tree stump or something like that. Like this hand climbing. I'm like that's black cock and sign language.

Speaker 22:         00:38:51       Isn't that hilarious. That's what they would come up with. That's the move.

Speaker 12:         00:38:58       Yeah. So blow job is this. I don't know why it's down. Why does it go down. It seems that you're always on your knees. But that's an awkward angle tells us to do your blog. That is why it would be I see a blond giant.

Speaker 3:          00:39:11       Like a child made sign me.

Speaker 10:         00:39:14       You know if so get on a chair. That's ridiculous angle to have that standard angle to suck a dick and doesn't make any sense at all. I'm not going to fire it.

Speaker 34:         00:39:28       You almost killed. So the first time may say laugh just thinks it was brilliant at the time was absolutely brilliant.

Speaker 30:         00:39:35       It was the perfect time if at first you don't succeed. Phi Phi again.

Speaker 34:         00:39:39       To you guys get a room get a room. Yeah.

Speaker 41:         00:39:42       Fuck yeah. We're gonna have to share a room when we're in the same Sacramento.

Speaker 18:         00:39:50       I'm sharing a room.

Speaker 10:         00:39:51       And so why you sharing rooms. Because listen getting your own rooms you fucking weirdo. Grown men stop pretending like you're in high school. OK we're going to get up to her door we're gonna go fishing. Get a hotel room together. Shut the fuck up to get your own room. God damn it was thirty dollars and ninety cheap fuck thirty dollars a night.

Speaker 35:         00:40:12       Well have you seen the commercials.

Speaker 14:         00:40:14       We'll keep the light on for you.

Speaker 34:         00:40:16       Thirty dollars and thirty bucks.

Speaker 35:         00:40:18       Joe we were talking about it on a recent podcast. I think you're there Tony. I think it was Ari was saying it was he was talking about how funny it was going to the grocery store with you because like you'd be like you know how much is macaroni or pasta sauce like you know 20 dollars whatever it was.

Speaker 18:         00:40:34       What is toothpaste. Two dollars. I don't know what I think. I haven't forever. Eddie Bravo always makes fun of it says that I would be the worst person ever on the price is right now because I literally don't know anything costs. So far there's only room enough my fucking hand for so much show against it.

Speaker 17:         00:40:52       There's no room for that. I just got no room for as long as people aren't riding the streets over the price of toothpaste. If they are then I'll start paying attention. It's like I've got shit to do. I can't be worrying about what shit costs as long as it's fairly reasonable. But I have friends that are like wealthy and you hear them go a steak for thirty nine dollars. Are you telling me that the state cost thirty nine dollars. Why is this steak three. Hey just what are you What are you doing. What do you do it's a number. So what does it even mean. What the fuck is it even based on. Just shut your mouth. You're not broke. Spend the thirty nine bucks you cheap fuck you whining asshole you yammering fucking perspective lapping douche bag.

Speaker 36:         00:41:31       You know we'll get it together you fuck. I went something a real person. Oh what's that Morton's Steakhouse is a wonderful place.

Speaker 35:         00:41:36       Yeah I love it and I was just in that it was the only place near me that had crab legs and it cause I was just since Vegas I've been thinking about those crab legs from Vegas and I'm 9 yeah from 9 which is most amazing place ever so I went there to get on and a half pound was sixty like sixty five dollars and I was like That's a lot. You get a lot. Four legs is what it was.

Speaker 10:         00:41:58       But did you watch that show with the dudes die. Get on those fucking crab boats. No I didn't. That's that's why it's so much it's because it's really hard to get. That's what world Deadliest Catch with.

Speaker 35:         00:42:08       This is what I was getting at. Then the two days later I was thinking like that didn't I want wanted more. Know I wanted to eat right. Right. Right. You know what I mean. So then I went to Olive Garden and they had a weight. So I went to the place next door and stay which is like Outback Steakhouse and they had them there and they they had a pound for 40 dollars and then you can add another half pound for 15 bucks. So I cut a pound and a half for the fries and it tasted pretty much exactly the same. You could tell that it came out like when you pulled it out it was like a little sweet little harder. I guess. Nice buttery mushy as the plate but still tastes exactly the same.

Speaker 18:         00:42:45       So you think they just overcooked it. Maybe. I think they're frozen obviously you know that you could try to tell they did well I think they're all frozen quite honestly because they're coming from Alaska. Well I was thinking that's why when the morning sucks I was like Oh that place probably gets it. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:42:57       Well they just know how to fucking do everything right. There's certain places like you know Morton's there's that other one Flemings you ever heard of Flemings. Yeah. There's a whole chain of those things they just know what the fuck they're doing.

Speaker 9:          00:43:07       You know they sexually work at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.

Speaker 10:         00:43:10       Wait a minute hold on a second. I. I know what you said but I thought I sexually worked at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. That's why I heard you say that stuff.

Speaker 18:         00:43:22       I was like. I mean what the fuck did he say.

Speaker 17:         00:43:24       And that places and then I realized there was a slurring or a I used actually I sexually. So I say I used to actually sing as well you know if you ever heard someone speak in another language and there was a little there's they're just rattling off and you if you don't know what they're saying you could never discern that there's more than one word going on that you don't know when one stops at another one ends. That was a classic example that I used to actually you know that's what does that.

Speaker 10:         00:43:52       That's not a word. It's like a Jeff Dunham bit or something. No not Jeff Dunham. What's his name. I might be a redneck guy Fox or Foxworthy. Jeff Foxworthy doesn't have a dad like dark here like like things he would write down like D G E 80s DG. It's.

Speaker 34:         00:44:15       Like you know there is like red and a redneck vocabulary.

Speaker 10:         00:44:19       Have you ever seen that show Swamp People. Well they just alligator hunting. Holy fuck man. I'm only going to buy alligator shit anymore. I buy like alligators so I buy like alligator skin things. When I was a little kid an alligator he displayed his dog and I'll never forget that I lived there. I lived in Gainesville Florida and there was a place called Lake Alice and there's alligators. You see him all the time. And I didn't think nothing of it because nobody was scared until one of them at this lady's dog I was like Oh you motherfucker but when you watch these people on these shows these these alligator hunting shows first of all you realize how many fucking alligators there are because they're killing a shitload of them. You know they have like a tag that they can fill. I don't remember what the guy was saying but it was like Oh. I think it was like 500 or something.

Speaker 22:         00:45:08       Let's find out. Alligator tag limits in Florida.

Speaker 42:         00:45:13       We didn't talk. How was it being in Texas during all that fucking bomb shit and raised fertilizer things and crazy crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       We we we will miss the fertilizer thing cause I was only there for one day but that the bomb shit all of it is just the whole thing is when it was something like that happens. It's so fuckin scary you know Katie waitress Katie from the Comedy Store.

Speaker 36:         00:45:38       Yeah. Her cousin's like look at this photo right here. Here's the terrorist guy right here in the hat. This is him dropping off the bomb. Yeah. Because this is the restaurant and he's walking the opposite way to the he must just dropped it off right there right. Here's supposedly the kid that died. Oh God. Here's her cousins all right over here and they all lost their limbs. Oh God.

Speaker 43:         00:46:00       And so they're gonna have like a benefit show soon but that's just a crazy picture though because it has it all and all together. What the fuck man.

Speaker 19:         00:46:11       No one knows what any motive yet. Where we're at now in the news.

Speaker 2:          00:46:16       It's all purely speculation because the brother's dead and the youngest brother is he got shot in the throat Apparently kneeling ways communicating is writing things down. Here's something I just understand. And of course there's a million people online that are shouting out false flag false flag the government trying to take out our weapons away and tight down security and that's why that's why this is happening.

Speaker 35:         00:46:40       Did you read the kid's Twitter like I stayed up all night. Sure yeah.

Speaker 19:         00:46:44       Twitter was spooky. I didn't see it. Yeah. His to his Twitter was really spooky it was weird.

Speaker 42:         00:46:48       It seemed normal day but then he would throw in like little things like fuck the police and then or something like Mohammed something.

Speaker 34:         00:46:54       Well I think if you're going to paraphrase a guy he's a fucking murder or the least he could do is go to his Twitter page you lazy and actually read the night.

Speaker 43:         00:47:04       I'm not my greatest guy. That's what he said. That was one of his tweets. Yeah.

Speaker 19:         00:47:10       He goes on mostly kind of a stress free guy. This is after he had blown people up. Yeah allegedly. Of course this is the kid that survived the one that's dead. There's all these disputes about what happened to him. Some people are saying the cops ran over him. He's saying his brother ran over him the whole thing sounds like and people are crying out conspiracy. One thing you have to realize about information whenever there's a tragedy or whenever there's anything that's like really scary like this you know there's a terrorist bombing. It's people panic and you get a whole bunch different versions of the truth. And it's not a conspiracy a lot of times it's just. No one knows what the fuck is going on. Everybody's terrified and stories spread very quickly like they thought at one point in time that one of the suspects was a missing University student from Brown.

Speaker 19:         00:47:58       And he was believes an Indian young man and his family had been looking for him for like a month and they distributed this video and people are saying this is one of the suspects. This is really what happened. You become like a jihadist and left. But that wasn't true at all. By the morning we found out it was a totally different person. So this is not. This isn't like a conspiracy to like hide that information. And I think that's really important when when people are looking at events like this we'll wait till the dust settles don't just start fucking calling out conspiracy and calling out red flags and false flags saying that it's some you know nefarious thing going on. Whatever it is is horrific. But jumping on the immediate conspiracy bandwagon is like Man that is one of the worst things for the cause of questioning things. And if you ever wanted to be a good disinformation agent what you do is the moment that anything happens. Start yelling and screaming it's a conspiracy and expose every single aspect of it. That you you feel is corrupt. That would be the best way for the government to protect themselves from any thoughts of being labeled you know as being a part of a conspiracy because there's so many nutty people that do that with every single event that it's like they've cried wolf you know.

Speaker 42:         00:49:25       Yeah I was so nervous with Greg Fitzsimmons that night because he was actually down there doing shows and I texted him and he said that the shows were canceled he uses in his bed watching movies. Yeah shows your accounts. Oh that one night don't know if it was. Was it Friday night. That was he flew all the way down there. Yeah that was it was crazy man. Friday night I was what was even crazier is how horrible CNN was. There were like an hour and a half behind but then you'd like Look was it has to have Watertown that jam gave me. It was just like guys throwing grenades. This happening this happened like it was so insane reading that. And it was also. It was amazing how censored everything was or delayed it was on the news. It's like you think you know that shit's you know people are getting grenades thrown and that would be on the news immediately you know. But they were just like talking like oh you know we're still looking for this guy.

Speaker 9:          00:50:12       It's incredible everybody's a witness now and everybody's a cameraman now. Like what. What's happening is you know people on the streets can beat the news. Yeah because they're right there too.

Speaker 11:         00:50:24       You also don't get a filter meaning you don't get anyone correcting it either. So it's interesting because you get you get instantaneous news but you don't get it vetted. No it doesn't. People don't make sure that everything that's coming through is kosher. Not to the news always get it gets it right.

Speaker 10:         00:50:41       They don't. And I guess it's better to do it that way where it eventually sorts itself out but the people that would step in and sabotage that process and create disinformation like a government agency could be pretty fucking successful at doing that I think and there's probably a bunch of people that are hired to do that shit all the time.

Speaker 44:         00:51:01       I've been accused of it myself but I will tell you that is incorrect and that I think like in those Starsky and Hutch movies like when someone would say one or TV show or any any cop show these to have to remember in the old days like someone would say if you're a copy of tell me like when someone's an undercover cop.

Speaker 13:         00:51:20       Oh yeah and mirrors like a secret password. Yeah. You got to ask him Are you a cop. I think Oh shit. Yeah I'm a cop. Yeah and I'm too smart for you Jack. You can't buy this heroin.

Speaker 10:         00:51:29       You know there was like some magic word I think that was a creation of fiction. Yeah yeah I think they changed that.

Speaker 45:         00:51:36       Yeah but people always thought that.

Speaker 29:         00:51:42       But you know that's that's probably some disinformation the cops put out there.

Speaker 14:         00:51:49       There was an accusation recently that the DEA put out a false paper about them not being able to track people by using a message because I messages over the Internet. And so there was like an article like and I'm like a tech site like if you're planning to sell drugs like do it through I message why.

Speaker 17:         00:52:07       Because the DEA says it can't read it. And then you know the DEA is pressuring Apple but it turned out that was fake. There's like the DEA made that just get a bunch of assholes that are drug dealers you know your dog just I message me I don't know what accent that is if that's your nationality.

Speaker 5:          00:52:22       I apologize. It was just a spur of the moment thing.

Speaker 29:         00:52:27       I mean no disrespect but you know like the DEA made a they put out fake news to trick dummies into using a message to sell drugs.

Speaker 10:         00:52:37       It's a good idea.

Speaker 46:         00:52:38       It is it's very crafty but it's one of those things where it gets to the point of you know when that's not total entrapment. That's just lying.

Speaker 14:         00:52:49       But what happens when you have undercover people when you have undercover people involved those undercover people sell you coke and then you arrest them.

Speaker 17:         00:52:56       That's crazy. You know why it's crazy because there's no real Coke. OK. You're not selling coke you're arresting them. So you're saying that they wanted to buy coke but you weren't even really selling coke. You just got them to act through the moments to get point and get out and talk through it. There was no coke to buy. There's no crime to commit. They might have thought they were going to commit a crime but there was no real Coke. They're not really buying anything. Not really selling anything. There was no real transaction to fake transaction. You're playing make believe. And that's fucked up because you're also trying to arrest people because the more b b arrest the better your career looks. So it becomes a quantifiable thing so you can talk someone into doing something illegal and then arrest them. And then it helps you.

Speaker 2:          00:53:39       But that's crazy because people talk people in the suck their dick. People talk people into doing all sorts of stupid shit they didn't really want to do. They just did because they got persuaded people could be persuasive. So if you're some crazy sociopathic Fuck that just so happens to be an undercover cop and you want to talk people into doing shit for you so you can arrest them. We need to put you in a cage OK.

Speaker 29:         00:54:02       You you crazy fuck yeah. Tony.

Speaker 30:         00:54:05       Yeah. You saying I'm an undercover cop. No. How do you guys find out about that.

Speaker 10:         00:54:09       Well the Internet is one of the first we had to vet it but we just figured we'd run it by first. See how you reacted.

Speaker 30:         00:54:17       Well you know I have to tell you once you bring it up it's true. I'm an undercover cop.

Speaker 10:         00:54:21       You know it's just the whole idea that they can pretend to buy drugs from you and then arrest you. It's like what are you doing with it. Why did you go get it. Stop. Stop that. You're selling fake drugs you're buying fakes drugs. Stop it. Just cut the shit. Stop trying to trick people. OK. Easy catch me. Don't stop playing games pretending you're criminals. If you catch me don't.

Speaker 2:          00:54:42       Jesus Christ can we be everybody be superhero superheroes dump tend to be undercover drug lords and sell your fucking illegal guns then arrest you.

Speaker 9:          00:54:51       Yeah I think with the drugs it's good. I think they should keep you on that predator thing now the drone. No. Get those guys to catch a predator like bust and the guys that are trying to hook up with kids and stuff.

Speaker 31:         00:55:01       Oh yeah. That's different.

Speaker 18:         00:55:03       Predator drones a couple of kids. Yeah. But even that. You know what.

Speaker 28:         00:55:07       Let's talk about that is like what have you got like a really weak dude.

Speaker 4:          00:55:11       And he's a pedophile and he's gone through like you know counselling and he's got like all this you know shit that's heavy in his head but he's gonna figure out a way to never abuse again like he got out of jail and he's trying to go through counselling he's trying to straighten himself out and then along comes the fucking to catch a predator show and they just troll his ass off.

Speaker 17:         00:55:35       I don't know how they get people to get into their site and chat with them.

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       Shit like I don't know what those people say back. I don't know what they get to say back but.

Speaker 9:          00:55:42       Well sometimes you know they have the kid being extra teasing it is sort of like Hey there's a party plugged up I'm having a party and making cookies.

Speaker 34:         00:55:51       Can you bring some sweet tea. Although a sweet tea house was sweet to southern most sweet tea.

Speaker 29:         00:55:59       Me too I suck dick. There's there's there's some cookies on the table I'll be right up and then that. What's his name. Chris Hansen. Powerful Chris Hansen. How many crazy people that guy I met. Do they still do that or not show. I don't think so. I think they got in trouble I think.

Speaker 10:         00:56:16       I don't see a lot of what they did. First of all I think you have to get people to sign releases to air that stuff. I don't know how they got anybody to sign a release.

Speaker 41:         00:56:25       I mean I haven't really considered news. Maybe it's like look I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:56:29       I mean how did they do that.

Speaker 8:          00:56:31       If you're audibly they probably cover their costs their lawyers everything.

Speaker 30:         00:56:37       What if they really. Oh yeah. Because it's worth it to them to have a helmet. We're just totally speculating all of and you know better than anyone.

Speaker 10:         00:56:44       So why don't we look that up real quick. Let's see how to catch a predator. Many thanks to Google. How did you catch a predator. Get them sign waivers. Sure.

Speaker 18:         00:56:51       Watch what what you Google man. You don't want that in your right. Yeah no kidding right. Hey what was up with you in the Google glasses man. I saw. I'll tell you.

Speaker 47:         00:57:00       Just call me honey. Honey honey sweetie pie.

Speaker 19:         00:57:03       How did kids get them to sign waivers yeah you could get in trouble for like looking too much into Catch predator like what he tried to avoid being busted.

Speaker 38:         00:57:18       You know I was thinking about that the other day like how do you even know what's going on if you can't do certain things like I was thinking of looking up like how to make a bomb. Just to see if that's out there. Like nobody knows if that's out there. If you don't google it and everybody's afraid to google it. Makes sense.

Speaker 36:         00:57:34       Yeah. Yeah. Did you do it. No I didn't.

Speaker 34:         00:57:37       I don't want anything to happen.

Speaker 9:          00:57:41       Which is why I think I left an impression. You know something. I was curious about. I wish there was a thing you could google where it's like I don't know.

Speaker 48:         00:57:48       I just don't get it but it seems like any crazy kid. I don't know the Internet's power.

Speaker 14:         00:57:55       The scariest thing about shows like catch predator is you see that these guys are like broken you know you see they're like horrified when they get caught. You see they know that it's fucked up. It's not like these remorseless cold insensitive unfeeling you know they're not scared when they get caught these guys fall apart.

Speaker 19:         00:58:13       You see they're horrified at who they are. It's really it's scary scary to say because it's like a glimpse into madness. You know that guy Chris Hansen. I guarantee you.

Speaker 14:         00:58:26       Now this sounds like some hippie bullshit but being around people that are that fucked up on a regular basis and broadcasting them and paying your bills based on broadcasting them and all and I mean like under the guise I guess you're pulling these people off the street and that's always a good thing.

Speaker 9:          00:58:46       Well you know what happened to him right. What was it. Was that he got caught cheating on his wife or something I got some big media thing.

Speaker 44:         00:58:53       Then he got investigated with a camera. He was out with another bomb. Me. Look I don't know what the fuck the guy's marriage was like. You know I don't want to. Crack on the guy for that. I think there's a big difference between that. And you know of course you know some. Pocket child some consensual. Shit he did with Secretary whoever. That freak is. Oh I hate him for that but being around all those people that were kid fuckers man.

Speaker 19:         00:59:24       That's gonna wear on your soul that's going to wear in your soul did you even see these people over and over again and being in their presence when you know most of them are probably I mean I guess this isn't their first time I would I would assume this isn't the first time they probably already had sex with young kids or any so you watch. It's just it's it's just it's really it's gonna be a really depressing view of the world and it's only so many different things you can expose yourself to in a 24 hour time period and you got you know 365 of those 24 hour time periods in a year and you got a hundred of those years if you keep your shit together but most likely no. And you're gonna spend time hanging around pedophiles all the time. And it's one thing if you're a guy and that's your job pull them off the street. But I don't I'm not exactly sure what good it does making a show out of that. You know I mean except scare the fuck out of everybody and make us aware.

Speaker 46:         01:00:18       But I feel like you know not that I mind them being outed because it's such a heinous crime against humanity.

Speaker 28:         01:00:26       But man it seems like a fucked up thing to broadcast. You know it's like what do we want to concentrate on. It's one thing to like work on cleaning that up but as a piece of entertainment programming you're gonna you're going to concentrate on someone who wants to victimize children and you're just gonna focus on that a lot.

Speaker 9:          01:00:43       I think it was a hit because you know they're the ultimate bad guys. Well you know you're looking at the villain of all villains right.

Speaker 19:         01:00:49       No matter how fucked up your own life is right. Right. Yeah. Nobody's lower than a child molester.

Speaker 17:         01:00:54       Everybody can go that fuckin piece of shit that fuckin p has to be on the couch picking your fat toes. Smoking a cigarette. You see they're just picking dry skin and your toes and just drop it on the floor of this motherfucker. That piece of shit I hope he writes I hope he writes in jail. Death is too good for him. I hope he rot in jail. You know what they do to child molesters.

Speaker 19:         01:01:16       They get him in their persons fucking wretched stupid human being is barely an ape. They get the shit on this child molester and feel better.

Speaker 36:         01:01:25       That voice grosses me out the bastard later.

Speaker 18:         01:01:28       I feel bad I and do it from Boston and Boston is in a bad position right now.

Speaker 20:         01:01:35       Oh just don't you know this Boston thing. When one of the things that is fascinating is that they like there was a thing about how they weren't going to read him his rights and then this you know this thing about how whether or not they were going to try him as an enemy combatant or try him as a civilian. It's really fascinating that that's becoming like a real issue. You know the way they decide to approach it like is this guy an American that we're gonna try as an American you know or someone who lets someone when someone commits any form of terrorism. Are they are they instantly just out of the club. Or do we try him as one of us you know. Is it or is it a war thing. Are we at war.

Speaker 19:         01:02:20       How we gonna how we're going to go forward in this Yeah it's interesting. It's once it's interesting the way we label things. You know and it's interesting. OK. Any conspiracy theory aside that all these nutty ideas that are floating around.

Speaker 14:         01:02:37       One thing we know for sure there was bombs that a person put in place that killed a bunch of people that didn't do anything wrong. And we have to figure out how the fuck that happens and I know that sounds super simplistic but as a human as a species that's evolving clearly as we were talking about the Mongols earlier and like what they used to do a thousand years ago like our most heinous acts pale in comparison to those of our ancestors.

Speaker 46:         01:03:10       But when something like this happens you realize that people are still capable of such embarrassing ruthless stupidity arrogance and just horrific insensitivity towards their fellow man.

Speaker 22:         01:03:32       The idea that you could just take a bunch of people you don't know and kill them and maim home and just you just were in the wrong spot at the wrong time and I got a message and there's only one thing that gets people to do that Fox by the way and that's an ideology right.

Speaker 19:         01:03:48       It could either be a religion or could be a cult. Or it can be you know some group that you belong to that sworn allegiance to a certain code or set of rules. But that's the only way you get people to do shit like that if they don't have an ideology. They just don't do that. Doesn't make sense.

Speaker 46:         01:04:04       There's no evolutionary benefit to doing that other than pleasing a group of other like minded psychopaths someone you have to be amongst a group of people that have very specific beliefs that above all else take precedent. So that you're willing to put your humanity aside for your crazy beliefs in a completely irrational display of destructive power and that you can kill innocents. That only comes from ideology and we get really lost.

Speaker 14:         01:04:41       When we start talking about religious freedom and religion and you know an atheists are guilty of this just as much as really religious people are because whether you call it being a Muslim whether you call it being a Buddhist whether you call it being a vegan whether you call it being a Christian whether you call it being a Republican whether you call it being a Democrat whether you call it being a progressive when you lock yourself in anything you become a part of something that's almost been decided for you.

Speaker 24:         01:05:18       You you you you you lock into a pre arranged set of opinions on things and some of them are bat shit fucking crazy and just like the Mongols got a hundred thousand mother fuckers to roam across Russia and Europe and China and slaughter millions of people. You can't do that unless you've got a cause you can't do that unless you're part of a group.

Speaker 20:         01:05:45       You can't do that unless your group is separate from the other groups. And the only way that ever works is someone's got to talk you into that shit. You've got to be a part of something. And with this kid apparently was or he was you know the one they're saying did it he was a pretty radical religious young man. Now whether or not that's true. Who knows science.

Speaker 9:          01:06:06       It has to be it seems to be the one thing that all these people have in common.

Speaker 20:         01:06:09       Yeah well I think the false flag people are thinking that like somebody gave them all this stuff and that they were talked into doing it and then it was a plan to erode civil liberties that they would sacrifice a few Americans and clamp down on laws.

Speaker 28:         01:06:24       And this is this really is classically what military leaders have been doing since the beginning of time. You know like we're talking about armies in the past would actually sacrifice soldiers and slaughter them so that the rest of the people could eat you know they would cannibalize themselves. That was they. They had to talk somebody into doing something like that. You know I mean the first time somebody says that's super awkward Yeah. It's fuckin you know it's hard to believe that in this day and age with the like if you look at like how amazing humans are capable of being you know.

Speaker 16:         01:07:00       Like here's a perfect example Oprah now I know Brian doesn't like my love for Oprah.

Speaker 35:         01:07:08       I love that you're I Oprah I think it's Brian.

Speaker 44:         01:07:12       He goofs on me but it's an honest appreciation for what she does because Oprah like you know I have a friend who worked for and is like man she's like super yuppie bitch. Barely an hour and how the fuck are you going to try to be a standup comedian you can't even go two hours without paying. My friend was like he worked for and he was like pow. She's like intense you know. You know she's like really. She has an idea what she wants and she gets done and you know he was like I think he's been intimidated by too because he was working for but like stop and think about how much nice that lady does like that lady is like so nice. All those women that come to her show they feel great. Everybody leaves positive. I was reading this thing the other day on negative energy and that there was some sort of a study that actually showed that negative energy is contagious.

Speaker 44:         01:08:03       If you find out you know if you if you're hanging around people that are negative it doesn't just affect you when you communicate with them and becomes a part of the way you communicate as well. It becomes contagious and one like super aggressive contagious negative person can actually infect like a company. I think that's why it's important that I mean companies have been really focused on that. I think ones that are really aware of the social structure within the organization they want to make sure that you don't get like a really negative Downer type person in any sort of a role because if you get them you know that they can really infect. Like if they're especially if you had some guy like you work on a big project you got some one guy who's leading and he's a douche bag and everybody shows up work like oh it's there's very few things in life worse than being stuck like working in a job it sucks with a boss who's an asshole. Right.

Speaker 7:          01:08:55       Why do why are all bosses mostly assholes to me making my list. I look back at all the jobs I've ever had you know and it's the majority like they were always the assholes they were never the people you hung out with or wanted to hang out with you know they're always there I was always a terrible employee.

Speaker 44:         01:09:11       So I think anytime a boss got mad at me I totally deserved it.

Speaker 11:         01:09:15       There was a shitty. I did a shit job mowing lawns when I was a you know a lot landscaper.

Speaker 10:         01:09:23       I remember the guy hired me to fuckin scalped this law and I did not work a lot more. I lied just like you get the job like my friend did. And you said you could do it easy so often it's not hard but it was hard. The first time I did it was kind of hard to figure out. These are old shitty lawnmowers you know and I sculpt the shit out his lawn.

Speaker 35:         01:09:40       You fucking hate most don't you hate it. That used to be torture. It's not it's it's not easy.

Speaker 10:         01:09:45       Oh yeah but when I was in high school my friend Chris he one of the things about Boston about growing up in Boston. Boston is like a really in G. They have a lot of ingenuity. There's a lot of like people get shit done. So like it's a strong work ethic. They're like clearly way stronger work ethic than I ever experienced here in California. Like people are so used to getting up in the morning shoveling their car out from the snow they're used to shit like it's a different kind of like there's a different kind of like mentality there.

Speaker 19:         01:10:19       You know if you grow up there you go and figure out what we're talking about.

Speaker 49:         01:10:23       I had an example where we talked about just before that Boston yes fuck I had a point and I completely lost it and trying to figure out why it is S.A. after burying it.

Speaker 50:         01:10:42       I didn't. I took it but not until right before the show. Fuck mowing lawns. Oprah.

Speaker 10:         01:10:50       No no no I was passed over dude. It was the the mowing lawns things about oh my friend Chris. Okay. When I was in high school this is what it was when everybody else was like you know I had a job like Poppa Gino's and shit I was like making spaghetti and I was like pretty easy boring job.

Speaker 24:         01:11:07       This kid had a lawn mower empire. He had a landscaping empire.

Speaker 14:         01:11:12       He had a brand new car. He had people working for him. He had lawns that were going while he was at school. He had guys working farm. They were cutting lawns wise at school and he would come home and he would go and work till nighttime and they'd show up for work the next day. He always have new sneakers on. He was like a grown man. By the time we were 17 this fucking kid I had never been around more people. That made me feel like a lazy bitch. There was so many dudes like my friend Jimmy that I used to love Jimmy to tell yo this guy. Like he had from the time he was in high school he had his own electrical business. He worked for a guy for a little while.

Speaker 2:          01:11:47       Started doing work on the same time he got at a high school just got his own business bus and asked 10 12 hours a day drive it all out ran like a maniac. It was you while you're around people like that like you you develop that sort of you know that sort of tenacity that exists. Like not a lot of spots in this country you know. And I think that dealing with like environmental conditions there's something about that. It's why people from New York tend to be funnier. You know people from Boston tend to be funnier because they're dealing with so much bullshit all the time.

Speaker 9:          01:12:20       Definitely and controls. I definitely think where you're coming up with that raised has a lot to do with that type of crazy factor of your communication skills really. I think it's down to like you know small talk if it's the city that you're raised in. It rains a lot. You're going to end up having to talk with your friends more or if it snows a lot if it rains a lot if it's a windy city. Things like that. It's true. And I think to be indoors or really apply.

Speaker 10:         01:12:48       Yeah. Socially for sure. Right yeah. In California you could sleep outside and live right.

Speaker 36:         01:12:54       I drank I drank. Tom Hardy didn't talk on the porch was smoking cigarettes.

Speaker 11:         01:13:00       That's a Don't you think that Ohio of today growing up in the same place where you grew up would be very different because the Internet because kids growing up with the Internet be a lot more tolerable.

Speaker 18:         01:13:10       That's for sure. Yeah right. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:13:12       Yeah. That's a totally different world now. The whole world also got lights turned on everywhere lights turned on and the news started showing up all the information started flowing whereas before you relied on local newspapers and fuckin TV news.

Speaker 29:         01:13:25       Bitch how the fuck did you know what was going on anybody know what was going on then man. How did anybody know.

Speaker 11:         01:13:36       So I think they're saying that there's like certain laws that apply to pedophiles. That's why these guys were allowed to be put on that show.

Speaker 36:         01:13:43       And there's a reason why they quit. The guy killed himself while filming it. One of the suspects somebody tweeted.

Speaker 11:         01:13:50       Well if they were being honest when they say good riddance.

Speaker 13:         01:13:54       See you next week. Yeah. Show it. I mean are they trying to get rid of predators and trying to catch him.

Speaker 4:          01:13:59       It's not. It's bad if they commit suicide. Well we're all God's creatures even the ones that fuck kids. What I mean what is that. That's ridiculous.

Speaker 51:         01:14:10       Well they got sued for one hundred and five million dollars.

Speaker 31:         01:14:13       Why don't they just come clean and give the guys have gone on the show and go listen sir there's a bullet in that gun put it up to your head. Fuck this trial. And that would be we'll pay for your funeral.

Speaker 9:          01:14:26       Well you know they'd be the most watched reality.

Speaker 3:          01:14:29       And then as soon as he blows his brains I go sigh. Film it. Get a close up on him or we're out.

Speaker 29:         01:14:37       Get out of there. Just leave him there. Put it on TV no one's gonna know.

Speaker 10:         01:14:45       What are they gonna do. They are the cops gonna sue NBC. They're gonna bring him in for questioning. Look you saw what happened. God fucks kids we gave him a gun. Okay we're cool. We're good here right here.

Speaker 49:         01:14:55       Would that be illegal I would say yes especially if the guy didn't have a gun permit.

Speaker 8:          01:15:01       Yeah I guess it really depends on the gun law.

Speaker 4:          01:15:04       Yeah well maybe you could do it if you gave me a gun and said Whatever you do do not shoot yourself in the head right now on TV.

Speaker 45:         01:15:14       You will smile a wink huh.

Speaker 41:         01:15:17       There was this weird comic at the at the store last night. Do you remember this Tony. There was some Norwegian comic that I did something about Michael Jackson or something. But he had this huge Wikipedia that just goes off about how brilliant this guy is and how much money how did he write his own Wikipedia is with me.

Speaker 52:         01:15:36       But I mean he is connected to it like a lot of these TV shows and stuff. But anyways his wife comes up to me goes Hey Fat Man come you fat man. And I was right in front of my target. And she was trying to tell me that she wanted that. That he has a nice house up here and he pretty much she was trying to get me to come back to them how their house for an origin for what it seemed like and she wanted you.

Speaker 10:         01:15:59       Well it's probably what they feel like Hollywood's about right. Yeah. And he's like if I am going to make it here you have to give up the pussy. Listen we need orgies all of the time. Norway only way to make it as comedians so weird. Yeah that's that's a pretty odd story there fellow.

Speaker 52:         01:16:15       And then and then she's showing me these photos and her phone. She's like look at the parties we have. And it's just like her and this other girl like know women she's a comedian. No no no she's the wife of the one she's just like going around the whole place like bragging about her husband how many million.

Speaker 9:          01:16:30       Yeah she was she was very cute but this guy looked like a bear and you know he's a bigger guy with a suit that's like four sizes too small we're probably both CIA guys you got slowly worked there is slowly gonna make it into the organization.

Speaker 10:         01:16:43       DAVE There were looking into this whole death squad thing. You know like with his death squad we have to worry about them. We'll see.

Speaker 27:         01:16:51       See you you're the guy that they wanted to take up there and show them. Yeah. Sure.

Speaker 11:         01:16:55       You're going to drug you and hit you with some fucking some hypnosis.

Speaker 9:          01:17:00       Europeans just they just don't have like normal sex.

Speaker 44:         01:17:03       He's going to be some Manchurian Candidate type 2 that's going to happen. CIA do is going to drop a nano pill in his drink. That's silly bitch. He'll be hammered. He'll drink anything to send his way.

Speaker 52:         01:17:14       You know with all the waiters that lady that drives around in that pink Corvette that's all yesterday. This was my night Yes sir excuse me last week. This was my point that I see her maybe once a week and it's always random places like I'll see her in Hollywood once I hear a lot around here. But like that you just need to tell people what she is. She used to be like a rich wife I guess that would post photos or these billboards like all over. Just kind of promoting her and I don't think she really had. Well that's one way to describe. Yeah. I don't think she really had anything going. She just had a lot of money to play with and so she pretty much made her seem like she was a big deal when she really wasn't used as a rich wife.

Speaker 11:         01:17:53       Yeah well the billboards were these giant billboards. See Angelina on them in like big letters like whoa it's Angelina. And she's this really pale lady with giant tits. Yeah and she looks a little odd like she looks like. Like really like photo shopped. Like really like brightly lit like it's really hard to discern like key features because she's apparently she's very old. And when I came to L.A. in 94 she had big billboards all around town. Like several of them that said Angelina it was just her and then her management's number. It was her in her underwear. It was really high. Yeah it was kind of crazy because you know she was. She had a really nice body I guess.

Speaker 41:         01:18:32       Yeah. Back in the day. I do that. Yeah. And that's like. What's her face. Dolly Parton.

Speaker 11:         01:18:38       Yeah. But by the time she was doing this I mean who knows how old she was in that picture but the the one that you see today bears no resemblance.

Speaker 9:          01:18:48       Yeah. I had no idea who she was. And we were shooting something at Hollywood Highland one night and that crazy like area and all of a sudden she pulls up and people were like Oh my God there's Angelina. And it took I had no idea who this was and it took it like four people 20 minutes to be able to explain to me what the big thing was there. Well I think she's in L.A. she's like a.. Like an icon.

Speaker 18:         01:19:14       Yeah she's probably 60 years old at least. She still dresses like she's like 75. I've seen her several.

Speaker 9:          01:19:20       I wonder what she wanted if she wanted to be an actress or like what. Oh that's a good question. Interesting marketing campaign.

Speaker 7:          01:19:27       But what's really weird is is that how much I sear and jump in. That's like one of the only cars where you're like Oh that's her. That's her. That's her. Like how many times you actually drive by people you probably know right and drive around the same cars. It's just so weird how small Los Angeles actually is.

Speaker 10:         01:19:43       At that point you will in that sense and you know it's also like the spots that she hits the spots you're at like I said I just saw the coffee being there. That's what she looks like now. Yeah yeah yeah man.

Speaker 43:         01:19:56       All right. I'm sure she's a nice lady. I mean you know I don't know hate but you wouldn't do that. No I mean look man.

Speaker 14:         01:20:04       Nothing wrong with being that you know that's who she is she's fabulous.

Speaker 43:         01:20:10       Let her go get it. Fuck this look. Look that Brian put that away all the way. She's your grandmother man. Show some respect.

Speaker 19:         01:20:22       I don't know if she's a mother or a grandmother but you know that that whole wanting to be famous thing is a strange thing. She was like one of the original reality stars. She created her own reality show by just putting up billboards. A reality show became her life you know no one was filming it but her life was a reality show. You know I know she was I knew she was a couple of years after living here. So I've known who she was since 96 ish 97 ish. Wow.

Speaker 9:          01:20:52       I remember when she pulled up she had her face covered with like some kind of like one of those Asian aliens. Yeah and shoot.

Speaker 29:         01:20:58       She was mysterious. Yeah well yeah. That's uh that's a strange strange world we live in my friends man.

Speaker 7:          01:21:07       If I was a porn star hot chick porn star I would buy a pink Corvette and be her new competition.

Speaker 13:         01:21:12       I'd be so rude. You can call yourself Anzalone.

Speaker 42:         01:21:15       Yeah or Angelina.

Speaker 10:         01:21:18       That's a good idea though because I mean that's how she got her attention to seeing that you know pink Corvette the money girl Angelina maybe you could have like your whole thing was about like how you get a rich husband who allows you to freelance in your porn career and that you know that will be the whole thing. So the husband has no idea what's going on he comes home. What is happening in here. Who are these guys.

Speaker 22:         01:21:42       And you explain while they were tag team and you I'm got to say you know it was all so I could get better with you honey I just. They're they're not tag team me. They're teaching me this is it's very controversial. I should been.

Speaker 53:         01:22:01       Not going anywhere.

Speaker 41:         01:22:04       Have you ever been with a girl that you're just completely haunted about like that you think about like even after it happened it was like Why the fuck did I do that. That's part of being truck son.

Speaker 2:          01:22:14       That's a whole part of being drunk. That's a beauty of life. If you didn't have those stories then you wouldn't have those awkward moments. And if you didn't have those awkward moments you wouldn't have some really hilarious shit to talk about when everyone else is drunk as well. I can understand what you're saying here. That's what drunks have the best stories. The being drunk drunk stories when they could just really cut loose and be free and not worried about it. I have friends from back in the Boston days of the best stories when they're drunk and then somewhere along the line those folks become alcoholics anonymous people and all the stories stop. Yeah.

Speaker 41:         01:22:47       I feel like I'm going to start getting into alcoholics anonymous soon. Speaking at the Comedy Store. Going at comedy clubs so much you just have to fucking during me and Tony battle with this almost every single night where we're like have you got a drink. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:22:59       Because you know I mean it's just you know what's interesting about you know it's like either the night's going great and you want to drink to celebrate or it's a fucking boring night. You want to drink to have more fun. It's like there's never ever a time where I'm just like in the middle like you know.

Speaker 30:         01:23:17       I just said yeah we're going to do it every night.

Speaker 4:          01:23:22       Have a show though man it really can wear on you.

Speaker 9:          01:23:25       Well you know I'm very lucky because on my end of it I'll sometimes only have a half a drink or one drink because I'm very little and I'm very reactive.

Speaker 29:         01:23:36       And so how many beers does it take to get you fucked up. Two and a half probably. Yeah two and a half beers and fucked up. Three I'm fucked up.

Speaker 6:          01:23:48       Great.

Speaker 4:          01:23:50       Yeah. Three and I just decide to tell a story that I wasn't sure if I was gonna tell.

Speaker 9:          01:23:55       Yeah I normally don't get to my third during Ken till pretty late. Oh really that's funny.

Speaker 10:         01:23:59       Yeah that's weird. How much you weigh. Probably about 127 right around there.

Speaker 54:         01:24:08       And if you think about a beer is what a pound right.

Speaker 36:         01:24:14       Yeah I guess so.

Speaker 19:         01:24:16       I'd say subtle of Jack Daniels fucks me up essentially you get to like one percent of your body weight fairly quickly 1 percent by weight in beer.

Speaker 29:         01:24:24       Oh that's interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 41:         01:24:30       Would you say what about Jack Daniels.

Speaker 13:         01:24:31       I've gotten to the point where I think one bottle of Jack Daniels would fuck me shut up son you fucking start slurring when you open the cap. Larry slurring in and then alive.

Speaker 10:         01:24:42       Sometimes I feel like I'm talking about like bleeding from the liver until I expire. Yeah it's interesting that no one's figured out a way to create the effect of alcohol without the horrific effects to your fucking body.

Speaker 38:         01:24:59       Well gee you know my way works. You could just get down to one hundred and twenty seven and just sip on a drink all night long.

Speaker 31:         01:25:05       Feel great or black out every night because you keep forgetting nearly one sex sounds now right. Like you imagine it like a guy like Tate would take could. Well he doesn't drink but in his prime. Big guy you know the guys can put away more like Joey. Joey could put away some fuckin booze at the wedding. Joey

Speaker 41:         01:25:24       Joey barely ever drinks but when he does he always gets the most. He said so cute that you'll get like I got an orange cream sickle. He was a good man.

Speaker 29:         01:25:34       That's why you know people like pina coladas and shit. Yeah yeah. Fucked up and some folks only allow them that on when they're on vacation. But men. Well when men are drinking they weren't manly shit. They want something that is mixing up.

Speaker 22:         01:25:52       Oh yeah right. Talking about here's one drink right now.

Speaker 41:         01:25:56       I have a long night of drinking. Don't be a pussy. You're saying you rather drink with them than drink with us. No I mean how would you have you. How dare you let me know what you have because I'm pretty hung over right now.

Speaker 29:         01:26:07       Well I'm about to go watch a fucking UFO documentary. So I'm fixing you're fucked up if only I can watch today. I'm not really big on watching UFO documentaries while sober there's a spray something's gonna go wrong.

Speaker 36:         01:26:18       This jam van just showed me there's a spray that gets you instantly drunk for a few seconds.

Speaker 18:         01:26:24       Well that sounds awesome. Seems super healthy. You should give give that to yourself right before you leave the house.

Speaker 41:         01:26:32       How long does it last.

Speaker 55:         01:26:35       It doesn't say just a few 5 seconds.

Speaker 39:         01:26:37       Is it like some limpets type shit. Yes.

Speaker 55:         01:26:39       No. I don't know what it is. It's one spray releases. Point 0 0 7 5 0 0 0 gets you drunk legally 0 legally drunk.

Speaker 18:         01:26:51       How would you show me that they got some sportscaster some sportscaster got pulled over for.

Speaker 14:         01:26:57       Is it Al Michaels. I got pulled over and he was on the limit.

Speaker 31:         01:27:01       It was absent at the limit 0 8 and 0 9. What happens then when you're out.

Speaker 51:         01:27:07       Here's a link. Don't you first have to do the drug test.

Speaker 42:         01:27:11       You know like you walk around like a buffoon and then if you fail that then you have to do it. He obviously I guess showed signs that he can't do. You know balance on one foot. You know so.

Speaker 10:         01:27:20       Well not necessarily. They might have just asked him and he said he would take the test cause you only had one drink. That's what he's saying. Saying he only had one drink. I think that I read that note. You know what. That's what the I'm sorry. That's what Reese Witherspoon's husband said. You got the wrong drunk. He said he only had one job but the Al Michaels guy he tested on the limit. And he's a fuckin man's man. He's a fuckin sportscaster. He told me that guy doesn't know how to drive when he's a little tipsy. He's an 0 8. Let him go. You pussy don't you appreciate a good game of hockey being called by the maestro and he let him go. It's not like you're letting go of criminal 0 8.

Speaker 9:          01:27:57       Not something pro drinker that's a pro socialized. Like I've known him since he was a baby.

Speaker 10:         01:28:02       Yeah. 0 8. The fuck out of here. What a pussy society we have. That's not drunk. OK if he's drunk. Yeah for sure. Arrest him asshole. That's ridiculous. People driving around drunk are assholes but people driving around that are barely buzzed at 0 8. Come on. How do I know that your body functions as good as mine does when I'm drunk. How about that. Your reaction time. How good is your outlook. How do I know you're not a dullard without with a slow right foot.

Speaker 3:          01:28:31       You just can't get to that burger on time.

Speaker 29:         01:28:34       You know maybe Al Michaels could still even eat whatever he is 70 and still do a solid two step hits that break like a champ. Not saying he should drive drunk. I'm saying what's 0 8. Looks like a drink right. Yeah pretty close yeah. I would like to see what a 0 8 guy looks like performing stuff. You know I wouldn't like to see him go through that. I would like to.

Speaker 9:          01:28:59       I'm sure he's always nowhere when he's calling the Super Bowl.

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       You know what I mean bright you know. You know one that doesn't count though here's the thing though is the adrenaline that you get when you get pulled over. I would imagine that would have some sort of a recuperative effect. Like if you're a little a little driving a little shitty cause you're kind of hammered and you get pulled over and it might jolt you into a position where you could possibly perform the test a little better than you could be but it's not going to make you less drunk right.

Speaker 29:         01:29:24       So 0 8 is still in 0 8. She blew it.

Speaker 56:         01:29:28       Yeah I think it's just entirely too low to blanket that that's considered a DUI. Because I mean you know if you go out to dinner and you have a drink like a margarita and a bartender like cause it's stronger than normal. Are you saying that just having one margarita with dinner you should go to jail and you know get all these things on your license that you think you know that you're gonna run into a pile into a school of children. Like I don't buy that. I think that's I think that's it. I don't know I'm not a big fan. I think aging needs to change.

Speaker 10:         01:29:58       I think that's a dosage issue where you're talking about the dosage issue and that they really should get in trouble if they're doing that. I mean people don't want to get in trouble you go you go. This proves the good the stiffest drinks.

Speaker 5:          01:30:10       You really should let people know what the fuck you serve them and if you're serving them some margaritas It's got twice the alcohol in it you're trying to get customers that way you could fuck somebody up if they know exactly how they usually rocket you know they have this thing I'm good for one margarita and then I back the fuck off and then I get home and I'm fine. And then also the guys hand driving on. He doesn't know what happens because you you say saying essentially like doubled his dose.

Speaker 51:         01:30:33       Yeah I'm just saying it's way too low I think.

Speaker 17:         01:30:36       Yeah but not to you. I guess I see your point.

Speaker 29:         01:30:39       Definitely. But I'm not convinced. I don't have any data I want to see a guy who's at a weight go through all that shit.

Speaker 18:         01:30:46       Is it based on what percentage you are. Your fine too. You know I want to do it. I want to. I want not to get you guys together. No. No I don't want to.

Speaker 2:          01:30:55       That's one thing I've been really careful about my entire life. I think it's really important to be safe when you're operating a vehicle. I mean the idea that you would operate a vehicle with your body all fuck in half there. That's so scary to me it's so scary to be the driver it's so scary thinking that so many people out there that are doing it.

Speaker 46:         01:31:15       It's so selfish and stupid but I think that I would like to find out what it feels like to be at 0 8.

Speaker 10:         01:31:24       And do you know any of those tests any of those lean. I wouldn't know. What is it like if they say like you know I'm not gonna drive but get me to the limit. Give me a breathalyzer. OK you're at 0 8 now. Like whether it's three drinks or two drinks and now make me do your stuff. I want to know what it feels like.

Speaker 12:         01:31:41       Buy you can buy a breathalyzer on Amazon you should do it. I don't want to do it because I don't want to. I definitely don't want to drive by but I would like to drive on a course I would like to go on a course and see like get me to 0 9 and let me see what I can do.

Speaker 56:         01:31:53       I think you're gonna be surprised how exactly normal you're gonna be feeling.

Speaker 10:         01:31:57       I wonder why I wonder because I've been drunk and as of you I wonder. I wonder what it's like to do that.

Speaker 14:         01:32:05       Well I would but then again like telling people that 0 8 or 0 9 is the limit means that's probably where most people who are not in the best shape or don't have the best talents for alcohol where they start to falter.

Speaker 44:         01:32:19       So if you make it a public policy that's probably a good idea to do it on the conservative side you know ethnic humor you had a fun funny thing was talking about like it should really be based on your tolerance and they should you should have like a license that indicate their tolerance but that shit changes too. Because dudes start falling apart.

Speaker 36:         01:32:37       Yeah. You have to just take a license test Sara tolerance test once a year.

Speaker 3:          01:32:41       It's so incredibly irresponsible to tell people they can drink more. Right. You know they tell people that the legal limit as is that you could drink a little more.

Speaker 53:         01:32:52       Fuck just fucking green light. I love that.

Speaker 5:          01:32:56       Yeah and God dance like me boy. I got tolerance like. I mean think about like that my friend Justin. Here's a perfect example. You know my friend Justin said that seven foot tall did not find Justin's like a legitimate giant. He's enormous. And if you go drink for drink with him you're gonna die. If you're going to die you're not the same species as him. He's a completely different human being. So it's like a dog next to a cat.

Speaker 9:          01:33:17       It's not the same time. Pretty sure it's Andre the Giant actually has a drinking record. I'm serious. I think he has some. There's a drinking record I think it's a crazy night. And lawyers. Wow. Wow. But he was you know he's like he's like seven foot something.

Speaker 31:         01:33:34       He was enormous. Yeah. There's been a few giants since then that gotten mixed martial arts. This is Guy giant Silva. He was like a legit giant. And he fought in pride. And then there's Antonio Big Foot Silva and that guy. I think I'm seeing I think I'm saying giant silver I think that's his name. If not I apologize. It's a big giant go crazy shaggy hair. And then there's another guy semi shell. He's like seven feet tall. I think he's just a huge guy. I don't think he has gigantism I think he's just an enormous regular human but you would just imagine a guy like conjure the giant those little tiny you ever see a picture of a little tiny beer can in his hand. Yeah. To Tracy to trip he would hold a beer in his hand. I was like you hold on when those little kids apple juices you know the ones that come in lunchboxes.

Speaker 41:         01:34:23       Well this is that they estimated that he drank over 7000 calories every day and booze alone.

Speaker 9:          01:34:31       I wouldn't do that. Do they have the sat there the number with. I know it's like a decisive thing.

Speaker 29:         01:34:36       Well I want to see the picture of his hand because it's so silly.

Speaker 9:          01:34:40       You know Rowdy Roddy Piper started coming by the comedy store a couple of years ago and once in a while he'll swing in and he's friends with a few of us there. And man he's so great at hanging out and telling stories. And one of the stories that he told us was about Andre the Giant. Somebody was guys you know because they did the road together for a decade or right. Right. And he talks about how one time they were at a bar and there were these college kids like you know fuck you Andre the Giant that they're drinking beers at that one time a kid drinks a beer throws the empty can at the back Andre the Giant said and he goes. Don't do that again. And then later on he takes an empty can and he throws it at the back onto the giant's head and they do that and they all sure. Oh my God. And they all run outside. Running away from Andre the Giant who got up and is now chasing them and they all got in their car all at once but Andre caught up to the car before it drove away and he just flipped. He he picked up the coin as you hear the story. Rowdy Roddy Piper. Really. Yeah. It's got to be a true story too even if it's not.

Speaker 34:         01:35:46       Let's let him tell it.

Speaker 4:          01:35:48       Isn't that picture hilarious though him holding the beer can. I mean it's like a little bait. It's like you ever see like a little kids refrigerators that they would fake refrigerator. That's what looks like.

Speaker 41:         01:35:57       One hundred and nineteen beers in six hours.

Speaker 43:         01:35:59       God that's what they're trying. Yeah that's what he drank. Yeah yeah. How big was that guy.

Speaker 49:         01:36:05       What was his height and weight 7 1 7 foot 1.

Speaker 17:         01:36:13       And he wasn't just tall. He was enormous. Oh yeah.

Speaker 49:         01:36:16       God damn between 6 and 7 5 and over 5 some between 6 7 7 5 and over 500 pounds.

Speaker 10:         01:36:25       And then I also saw some that's a very whole fucking they measure him right.

Speaker 53:         01:36:28       You know what the problem with that is wrestling they lie you know six foot eleven 3000 pound twisted steel you know they lie just to make guys look bigger.

Speaker 31:         01:36:40       But that guy was like legitimately enormous like in a real wrestling match he would beat everybody.

Speaker 9:          01:36:45       I also heard a thing that that big body slam that was like from the big wrestle mania to where Hulk Hogan body slams the ultimate bad guy Andre the Giant. Right. And it's like you could tell Andre the Giant jumps into it with all his might and Hogan's just trying to. Yeah. All he needs to do is go like that. It's amazing that he can even hold them up. And he said that when he did that he could feel every disc in his back just go up up up up up up up up. Hulk Hogan. Yeah. And then he laid down Andre the Giant and he was just so glad that that was the end of the match because he he ruined his back.

Speaker 10:         01:37:18       Yeah. His back is fucked up now right. He's had surgery.

Speaker 8:          01:37:23       All these guys are. Those guys are unbelievable warriors because they were doing it every night and sold out arenas. You don't realize. Right. They had to put on a show. They were going non-stop. And like even Piper just like six or seven months ago he was by the store. He would come in like once in a while every few days for you know just then. Anyway he could. He kept going Oh my shoulder saw my shoulder so I'm going to the doctor on Wednesday. It's still worked out for four hours today. Well my shoulder saw Hannah finding out that he had a technically broken his neck. A broken neck and the doctor's like it's not your shoulder it's your neck and it's broken.

Speaker 10:         01:38:00       So it was like pinching a nerve and Ryder was hurting his shoulder right.

Speaker 9:          01:38:03       But he he's just. These guys are so tough in real life. That is to hit on a sore shoulder.

Speaker 10:         01:38:11       Yeah. What does people give a fuck about wrestling anymore. Oh yeah they're still there. It's still very popular. Unbelievable.

Speaker 9:          01:38:17       I keep seeing like C.M. Punk and all these people and all the pictures and been crazy is that you know most people don't know this but like Monday night raw for example which is the premiere weekly show someone's a wrestling fan. Yeah but it's been number one on one. It's held Monday nights forever. Do you know this and why the fuck do you know this. I said I'm saying let's go on. When I was saying when I was a kid I was in a wrestling like that.

Speaker 18:         01:38:41       And then I grew up and go oh my gosh. Yeah I can't believe you went there.

Speaker 30:         01:38:45       Me too and I still like wrestling I'm still has pubic hair. Dude stop being an asshole. I don't. I haven't watched wrestling. What you're doing is cyberbullying right now.

Speaker 38:         01:38:53       No I'm just I've been giving him a hard time because they all had like a wrestling party and I was there wasn't we our buddy you got wrestling mania and he has a giant screen and it's funny too.

Speaker 18:         01:39:03       You know we all do you guys take our clothes off. Yes. Right. Did you reenact the moves with lube. Yes. Hey what do you think about this CSPAN thing. The bill that passed the House it's fucked up crazy scary.

Speaker 2:          01:39:16       If you guys don't know about the House of Representatives passed Cisco which is the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act by a 288 to 127 vote and it's the ideas supposedly that it's meant to enhance national security by facilitating sharing of electronic information between like this quote between say a private company and the government this is a story from media dot com and the way they describe it is that if the government like say if a private company in the government deemed threatening the bill's opponents maintain it will make sharing of personal private information far too easy so I guess the idea is what is it what is the main the main idea about behind this bill is that they're going to be able to see every website you've ever visited every Web site will have a bill to share the information of different people who have gone to them that would just you know I have no idea what the exact specific thing is but yeah it seems like that's what I was talking about.

Speaker 57:         01:40:29       But it isn't going to be vetoed by Obama.

Speaker 2:          01:40:33       I don't know because he didn't have but he didn't veto the NDAA. You know I mean Obama is a hilarious kind of situation because he's super intelligent he's half black he's you know from a single parent household but he's still like votes just like the Republicans do. He still does stuff that the Republicans do like it's really strange. It's like if he was a white guy people would be fuckin furious if he was a white guy of privileged background and he made the choices that he's made as far as like bailing out the banks as far as passing the NDAA not vetoing in all these different things that have happened the drones all these different things that have happened while he was in office. If he was a white guy of privilege he would be getting crucified. It's fascinating. It's almost like the perfect plan like if you were a military strategist and you're trying to take over the company you would do it with a situation like that you wouldn't just go get some super elite rich guy you'd get some guy who you would associate automatically with progressive liberal sensibilities and then you do all that creepy shit right under his nose.

Speaker 9:          01:41:45       It's really interesting. His big slogan was change yeah.

Speaker 22:         01:41:49       And looking back on it now it's like well he changed a little you know drone attacks went from 50 up to like 300 changed a lot in Pakistan. It's not funny but fuck man. I don't know it's uh it's it's just seems like it if if he really could change things.

Speaker 21:         01:42:10       If you really could like influence this society and how is the time to do something you know instead of just these speeches sort of reactionary speeches dealing with each and every issue whether it's Sandy Hook or whether it's whether it's this Boston thing like wonder what if anything could be done to sort of enact a a change in a culture a plea for for a change in a culture. And if anybody could do that it's got to be the president. You know and the president addresses. He does these national speeches where he addresses policies and he addresses not national affairs as far as security affairs and then threats and various things along those lines. But what this country's really fucking needs they need of a different not not a different person but a different mantra. We need a new way of looking at things. We need a speech. We need something that gets people believe and we need an I have a dream that I have a dream Martin Luther King's speech to this day. That shit resonates. No one's doing the I Have A Dream today. Everyone's doing the. We're all gonna get along and change and hope and you know and make it more affordable and healthcare for everyone.

Speaker 58:         01:43:40       And gay marriage.

Speaker 21:         01:43:43       But no one has a speech about uniting humanity and getting us to understand that our lives really are truly only better when people around us lives are better as well and that United there's enough resources for everybody there's enough love everybody is enough nuff health for everybody. There really is. It's just the current system in the current ideology that we have is not based on the reality that we're an expiring lifeform. And then we have a temporary time here on this planet and to waste it not being aware of the full reality of the situation is a shame and a guy like Obama has the opportunity to do that but he doesn't ever say anything like that. He never says anything that really inspires people to look at it in a completely different way. He never says anything like I think you have to. If you're in a position to be the fucking President of the United States that's a position with very few human beings ever get to reach.

Speaker 15:         01:44:48       I mean maybe he will when he's leaving. Maybe we will once he leaves. Maybe you can't when you're there. I mean who knows. I mean maybe it really is an incredibly restrictive environment.

Speaker 21:         01:44:58       And he has no room to free ball and no room to go outside of what they want him to distribute as policy. I don't know. Mean I don't know what the fuck the situation's like but if this world ever needed someone to speak up and someone to just make some fucking sense someone to make some sense and not talk politics you know not talk religion just talk humanity not talk nationalistic not talk conflict just make some sense.

Speaker 36:         01:45:29       Well I guess this is the you know this the same bill was vetoed last year by the White House and it looks like you know it just it's one of those things that's just poorly written and everyone knows that type thing.

Speaker 39:         01:45:43       So so is the India.

Speaker 9:          01:45:44       Unfortunately pass really hard through Congress. The thing is it didn't pass as hard in Congress the first time. Well I think that I read something about it this morning.

Speaker 2:          01:45:54       A lot of the way the government set up and I'm obviously not an expert on government but I know that a lot of the the way it's set up is that you know we have representatives and you know we can't all be there while policy is being dictated so our representatives go there and they make sure that everything represents their constituents but clearly a better way to do all that is the internet.

Speaker 17:         01:46:15       If anybody had to be phased out. Oh it's the majority of politicians they're involved in making laws. You could face those guys can get all new jobs you know.

Speaker 9:          01:46:26       Have you seen House of Cards. No. She is awesome. This show shows you what's actually happening in Washington following a real TV show.

Speaker 14:         01:46:34       Oh somebody made up.

Speaker 9:          01:46:36       Oh it's unbelievable. No shows you. You realize what they're what they're dealing with. What they're actually doing and it's all just it's. Is it awesome. It's all just deals. The show's unbelievable I mean Kevin Spacey already is a bad mother breaks the third wall or whatever and just start flicking at the camera telling you what he's thinking in the middle of scenes. It's pretty. It's really great.

Speaker 14:         01:46:55       Oh it's the there's everyone else freeze in the background freeze like they're playing the game sort of pretty much. There's

Speaker 9:          01:47:01       still still the you know they blur out but then it's just him just know it'll be a cross meeting table from somebody like here's what I'm about to do and they don't know it but here's how I'm going to do it. Watch this. Oh and it's amazing it's really just politicking. You learn a lot about you know even show business and networking overall from how these politicians operate because that's all that they're doing is playing gossip games and texting and it's a broken system and they're all criminals keeping us from the Internet.

Speaker 14:         01:47:28       That's what it is. They're trying to tighten down on this fuckin system and what they don't want to do is admit that this could all be handled way better with voting online. Let's do it that way. Every person has an I.D. every I.D. is just like your fucking social security card. Yet only do it once boom and you vote online.

Speaker 8:          01:47:45       Yep. And when that happens that's when things get good.

Speaker 14:         01:47:49       You can't control that bitch. You can't you can't control that. They'll deal. They'll never allow something like that. They will fight it till death. That literally might be where the revolution lies. I is getting people to vote online because they would essentially be giving up all of their tricks but they've been using over the past decades to manipulate how ah ah ah. People are picked how our presidents picked how laws are passed and all that shit has been manipulated everything should be done the popular vote now.

Speaker 2:          01:48:14       Yeah. Isn't it a fascinating idea that there would so try hard. They would try so fucking hard to avoid. Yeah that would be like a real tipping point. This country will really realize we're being run by vampires. Oh yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:48:27       Like how quickly they would fuckin shriek into the dark corners of the room when you open the drapes and take a good look at the real scenario. Then I try to like give the people what they want. They're trying to profit off the current system. The current corrupt system as in place got. Tony you need to write your clean young man you can run for president.

Speaker 39:         01:48:45       You're very likeable could probably pull it off.

Speaker 27:         01:48:49       You think you could. There was a period of time when I was a kid and I wanted to but you wanted to be president at one point.

Speaker 10:         01:48:53       Time for a little moment. Did you fall on your head or something. What made you want to be president. How do you get sick. We deliver now.

Speaker 9:          01:49:00       I thought it was just very very young. I thought it was going. Did you have the fever. Yeah. The president's fever. He had the president's fever. You know when we all go through that score and sixteen you're lying in your bed dying. Yeah I got obsessed with. There was a period where as a kid I was obsessed with like the Declaration of Independence and how it came to be in like a hole. I read it. I remember reading a whole book about John Hancock when I started practicing my signature all the time. I was obsessed with John and I thought that was so cool that this guy had the balls to be like here you go here I am and I did this. Who would be the first person to be president that doesn't have the fake president voice who'll be the first person that just talks to everybody a person who changes the world who doesn't have a way of speaking with long vague pauses when I believe what I believe for you.

Speaker 10:         01:49:51       And for me and for our great nation is that we must unite. Imagine if it is it's so bizarre that fucking guy was over your house bitch why are you talking like that. Why are you talking this fake stupid voice but you get away with that when it's a big group of people and you're a politician.

Speaker 15:         01:50:09       We know that you're talking in the fake us most old school way possible. You might as well be in the theater you dummy.

Speaker 17:         01:50:15       It might as well be in the theater back when they didn't have microphones when they just have to shout out their stupid lines.

Speaker 35:         01:50:20       Imagine a strip club deejay being the president just shook up deejay with no microphones coming up to the main stage.

Speaker 28:         01:50:29       It's time and then a bunch of banjo players behind have the music because you don't have electricity do they.

Speaker 35:         01:50:37       I country at a bomb threat.

Speaker 14:         01:50:41       I got more information or more evidence to the poor people that think that I'm in league with the devil. I wore this t shirt on Fox. It was the Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia. They when I ordered the DVD they found out we talked about on the podcast so the people that make it they sent me these cool T-shirts and one of them was that famous picture of Nixon meeting Elvis leather shaking hands but they replaced Elvis's head with Jessica White and Nixon with the devil himself and says like the devil and so just go and I wore nuts on Fox and I got like a hundred tweets go.

Speaker 10:         01:51:17       What the fuck are you wearing on TV. I didn't even think about it but for a good portion of this knucklehead country. If you have a shirt on that has a devil's face it says the devil like these dummies actually think that you like you're you're down with the devil like the devil and that's what that's where we draw the line in this kooky country even even you know even religious people like you can say that you believe in God you're allowed to say that you even want to say that God talk to me. You know I saw a guy say that the other day didn't even bother me. There was a guy that was in Austin Texas. There was a guy that was at a red light.

Speaker 14:         01:51:55       He was begging. He had a cardboard thing. And the guy in the car rolled down the window said Hey man. God just talk to me and told me I should give you this. And he gave the guy 20 bucks.

Speaker 10:         01:52:05       That doesn't bother me but if the guys roll down that window it Hey man I was just speaking to Satan and he thought you could use this to party with me. You're not talking to Satan anybody believes in Satan as an asshole like you're allowed to believe in God. But if you say you believe in Satan everybody tells you to go fuck yourself.

Speaker 46:         01:52:22       You have to be like way deep in cuckoo for cocoa pops.

Speaker 9:          01:52:26       Oh you actually believe in Satan to believe in to believe in the bad guy.

Speaker 37:         01:52:31       Yeah.

Speaker 14:         01:52:33       Have you ever met someone who actually believed in Satan and you didn't know that they believed in Satan until you got to know them. I mean you know like shit I feel like I've met a couple of people that really wanted to be different.

Speaker 9:          01:52:43       And I couldn't pull it off though.

Speaker 2:          01:52:45       You know they don't have the commitment I met a girl once and she was with her sister and it was total innocent conversation. You know nothing nothing crazy. God said it was totally normal and she brought up something I think it had to do with gay marriage. I think it had to do with that and it was something about a bill being passed and it was many many years ago so my memory's a little foggy but I do remember this whenever the controversy was. She said she goes it's not God's way. And I said I remember like stopping and like all the sudden going whoa what would happen with this conversation. Like what did you just say. It's not it's not God's way. How do you know what God's way is. Do you do you really talk to God. Like where are you getting this from.

Speaker 2:          01:53:28       And she goes Oh that's Satan's his scales have covered your eyes. She actually said that to me his scales have cut and I'll never forget me looking at her and her sister and god damn you crazy bitches. Yeah. And the girl was. She was so pretty too. Oh my God she's beautiful. She was like Latin or something like Donald's like oh crazy bitches. Well you guys take care. Just guys I was like we can't even talk. You really think they're like Satanist scales and he puts it over your eyes. We have so much work to do here. I'm not taking on this project like to just just to communicate with you and get you to a point of rational objective thinking. We take three for mushroom trips right.

Speaker 36:         01:54:07       Have you heard of a guy named Pier Popoff. He's a pastor. He's televangelist guys. What did he do.

Speaker 51:         01:54:13       Blow some money. I saw him the other day I watched I was sleeping on the couch and I woke up in his head when the shows are not paid shows commercials and I was amazed what woke me up because I was kind of like half listening to while sleeping. What was amazing how the things that they sang it just seemed illegal like they were like you like oh you know we're gonna sing you some miracle water. This water is you know miracle water you're going to open up these envelopes. And then they start showing Mike testimonials like a people and they're like You know I sent in my or I read the letters. And then just a week later I got a new house in a car and then the next person was like I got two hundred thousand dollars. And then his other one like a guy just walked up and gave me a check for 15 million dollars and it was it was like the most fake shit ever.

Speaker 51:         01:54:58       And so then I started really researching this guy and there's all these videos about him online. I guess he's been ripping people off for a long time and one of the best videos is one where he just goes up and he goes where's where so-and-so so-and-so is here. Let's let's say Tina. Tina Fey. Where are you. Where are you. And then she comes up because I heard you have arthritis and you're here because you wanna get rid of this arthritis and stuff like that. Oh the whole time his wife is just pumping the whole show. Yeah.

Speaker 17:         01:55:26       She had a thing on it was on one of those 20 20 Yeah I don't like that. Yeah I know we talked about this in the past. I'm pretty sure maybe he's on another podcast but I was amazed that he's still allowed to do that.

Speaker 43:         01:55:36       Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Speaker 24:         01:55:37       Well that guy. Well name one is not. It's almost like it's. That's so ridiculous. It's like the most ridiculous hustle ever. It's like Who are they. Tricking the LNP with a trick and are like they're almost like mentally challenged.

Speaker 9:          01:55:52       Oh yeah. People with no hope. When you're when you're just robots when you're down to being convinced that there's a miracle water out there that is going to come in the mail via the postal service and it's going to it's going to change your fortune right.

Speaker 15:         01:56:04       Yeah that's the one. One of these things. Somewhere along the line they used to ask for donations but then somewhere along the line they they realized that they could sell things and they started like selling like holy water and selling like prayer services and and telling people that you would plant a seed.

Speaker 10:         01:56:25       So if you spend ninety dollars you Jill asked ninety dollars. He would come back to you and tenfold. The Bible says that would come out with some crazy fucking was that the guy Creflo Dollar. He's my favorite because he's got a dollar in his name. I mean you're a pastor and your fucking name is dollar. What's your read.

Speaker 9:          01:56:45       They all have weird names like that. Okay I guess it Good Peter Popoff. Have you ever met any other pop ups before.

Speaker 22:         01:56:52       This guy's got to have a different real name now. He must have a real name what's his real name. Wow his real name is Creflo Augustus dollar Junior. Wow this is real fucking name. Can a Bachelor of Science and Education Center talking shit smack in people.

Speaker 2:          01:57:10       My favorite Robert Tilden. You know he is. You've probably seen him. There's a viral video of him farting. Like he's like he talks in tongues a lot on a show to Hugo.

Speaker 40:         01:57:21       Some like a chuckle love of my life my life you know my you know my level.

Speaker 17:         01:57:26       It's hilarious. See if you could pull up Robert Tilton talking in tongues because it's some of the most ridiculous shit ever. But one I'll never forget this one thing he said he said every time you write a check to me Satan gets a black eye. Wow. But it doesn't part of you think that if you're dumb enough to send him that money like so what. So a guy got you with the dumbest trick of all time like you really thought that money was going to gone. You really thought that money is gonna give the devil a black eye. If you really thought that you're fucking stupid or not looking after you right.

Speaker 51:         01:57:58       One of the Scott things that this Peter Popoff does. He also sends you a barley cake from the Bible where it's like kind of like that little bread you eat. And he goes he goes in this commercial he goes and we make it with the exact ingredients that they say in the Bible and blah blah blah. Well then if you look up Ezekiel 412 in the Bible it says and you should eat it as barley cakes and bake it using fuel of human waste.

Speaker 43:         01:58:25       So the human way. So. So wait a minute wait a minute wait. No it doesn't.

Speaker 35:         01:58:29       You want that typing in a for 412. OK easy. That's a Larry. Hey I.

Speaker 39:         01:58:35       Hold on hold on.

Speaker 36:         01:58:36       Easy E K E L E for twenty four to twelve for twelve. Yeah. You're thinking about the we love but he kill for twelve a long time since I read up on my good old days he kills.

Speaker 14:         01:58:49       This is all new to me baking with Don that comes out of man in their sight.

Speaker 18:         01:58:57       Hold it. So he's saying hold on. I can see our cooked fish. Oh my God. And thou shalt bake it with dung and that comes out of man in their sight.

Speaker 53:         01:59:09       Well it's in the Bible it's in the Bible. Why do you need to study the Bible and cook you by hand with shit. Have you ever tried my poo poo barley cake.

Speaker 10:         01:59:19       Fucking imagine how dumb people are. That really hurts my brain. Do you know Ezekiel Zeke might have been tripper because his ego was also where the first depictions of UFOs came from. He only pulled out. Yeah Zeke Hill was known for. There's there's a Bible quote that people bring up all the time was a UFO.

Speaker 9:          01:59:39       But people were seeing a lot of things after eating a shit.

Speaker 34:         01:59:42       Mainly they're eaten fucking shit cakes all day throwing out almost dying. It was a wheel within a wheel. It was God sharing it.

Speaker 42:         01:59:50       There was guys with boats they had all the animals.

Speaker 9:          01:59:53       You think we should prepare the barley cake in a different way.

Speaker 18:         01:59:56       No no it's great. I'm trying to find Jesus. What a stupid fucking culture. I cook it with shit. Okay Dad should I write that down on paper.

Speaker 52:         02:00:05       I put something in for violent my son because I got so obsessed with this minister that so when I found that out I had tweeted something like Olive Garden was like executive for 12 or something like that and all these people got pissed off that I was due to doing Bible scriptures.

Speaker 18:         02:00:20       Oh that's hilarious. Well they read that though. Yeah they figured it out.

Speaker 10:         02:00:23       How do you not read that and just start laughing. Told me to cook shit cakes. Fuck the Bible says Cook shit cakes. That's just one more dumb thing in the Bible. God damn it I'm so tired of people pretending that books are awesome. I'm so tired you stop that shit stupid.

Speaker 15:         02:00:39       Okay here here's a here's a quote and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and a fire in folding itself in brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of Amber out of the midst of the fire OK.

Speaker 22:         02:00:58       House audio file hmm.

Speaker 36:         02:01:01       That's somebody putting two points together.

Speaker 15:         02:01:04       They don't go together for oh wait a minute this hold up. And this also out of the midst there of came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance. They had the likeness of a man. Whoa. After everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and their feet were straight and the sole of their feet was like the soul of a calf's foot and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass. What a trippy book. People like Oh my God it's so real.

Speaker 17:         02:01:35       I hear God's words when you're saying these things. God is speaking to me through your words please read on and they had the hands of man under their wings on their four sides and they had and therefore had their faces in their ways.

Speaker 10:         02:01:47       Somebody might have just made all this up and me like an asshole is reading this fake Bible quote shitting all over the Bible and the aliens. But guess what. I don't care.

Speaker 39:         02:01:58       I'm not reading any further. It seems like if this is if this really is as it kills it says it is God damn it. I think it's all nuttiness.

Speaker 51:         02:02:07       They walked up with their four faces and they said Why are you guys cooking things in shit.

Speaker 15:         02:02:11       And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. Now as I behold the living creatures behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces. These guys were tripping hard eating shit. Kingsley yeah losing their mind. What grows on shit. Mushroom that's right. Leave your shit takes out the cover with mushrooms. Eat your shit cakes chip your balls off. Stop talking nutty man. When those went these went and when those stood still these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up. That guy is this glass all alien. That guy is just that's word salad. That guy's high as fuck. He just ramblin high as fuck.

Speaker 40:         02:02:53       I said the same thing in Joshua Tree one time and this is the stuff by the way that they kept in you know.

Speaker 10:         02:02:59       I mean think about that like especially in the New Testament the New Testament. They they had to like have like meetings inside Ed what's in there.

Speaker 18:         02:03:07       Yeah. Leave this if you look at two crazy if you look at that is it go for twelve quote. Now it's totally changed has nothing to do like really lately different.

Speaker 2:          02:03:15       Oh they've altered the quote Well you know it also it's probably so hard. You should talk to a linguist right. You know I talked to a language scholar the other day ironically enough for a Bigfoot show. And if you talked to a linguist they'll tell you that it started off it was a spoken story for the longest time before anyone even wrote it down. And the the bible must many of the stories in the Bible probably existed before language or before written language. So like like a lot of the stories in the Bible also they're like really similar to the same stories of ancient Mesopotamia. Oh yeah. Like somewhere and like the epic of Gilgamesh is like really close to the epic of Noah Noah's Ark. It's like it's really like a lot of similarities. Yeah in a lot of the stories. So they had to write it down the road down and probably let's say the first ship was the Sumerians so they wrote it down and I think it's called cuneiform or cuneiform. They wrote it down then and then eventually it became ancient Hebrew and then they're going to translate it ancient Hebrew to Latin and then as translated to Greek as translated to English like they had to fuck it up in a lot of ways along the way. When you deal with some wacky ass languages. Q Matt I mean how many people even exist and know how to convert all that shit.

Speaker 14:         02:04:32       Yeah I mean languages are lost. Yeah. And when they go over the the dead sea scrolls is the real trip factory. Read some of the shit that's in the dead sea scrolls the dead sea scrolls of the oldest version of the Bible by far by almost a thousand years I think it was found in a place called Kumbh Ron in these these caves in the side of a mountain like a side of a hill and these caves have these clay pots and in them with these they literally made out of animal skins and it's the oldest stories of the Bible and it's all trippy fucking shit it's all you read it and you go it makes Ezekiel sound normal right.

Speaker 39:         02:05:10       And it's so nutty that even though it's the oldest version of the Bible they're very resistant to release it. And I like to say oh we're going to revise the bible now according to the dead sea scrolls. They're like you know what. We've been reading this for a while. Maybe we need to fucking just bury this bitch because that's where that guy John Marco Allegro who's the the dead sea scrolls guy.

Speaker 11:         02:05:36       He was like the head translator for the dead sea scrolls. He said the whole thing was about mushrooms. He his he wrote a book called The Sacred mushroom in the cross. He was the only scholar on the whole dead sea scrolls committee that was agnostic. He was ordained minister but then studying theology realized it was horseshit leaving booboo.

Speaker 18:         02:05:55       Yeah. Say goodbye the people by guys.

Speaker 28:         02:05:57       We're gonna we're going to wrap this up soon anyway. We're gonna get out of here too.

Speaker 15:         02:06:00       I got to go see the premiere of serious. Dr. Steven Greer documentary where he reveals the truth about the tiny little alien baby and whether or not it came from the planet Uranus.

Speaker 51:         02:06:11       We please text me immediately or live tweet. Text me during it. You know what. What's going on.

Speaker 2:          02:06:18       I will text you but is a show only for you. I will save the rest of it for when we talk on air. So do not expect live tweets or spoilers.

Speaker 4:          02:06:29       I'm fascinated I actually talked to a really cool guy today at a video game company that saw it last night and he said is really interesting. So many get high as fuck and we'll see what's up later buddy. I see tomorrow man George S. Myanmar. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:06:44       So this dead sea scrolls. This guy John Marco Allegro said after like 14 years of study that the entire Christian religion was really about fertility rituals and mushrooms. It was about tripping balls on psychedelic mushrooms and it was about fertility treatments and fertility festivals and that they would fertility rituals and that like becoming pregnant was like the most important thing like keeping a baby alive is really difficult and becoming pregnant and having you know a child was like the most important thing to look forward to. Like there was a serious urgency to having children because people were fragile you know and they also knew a lot about the indigenous psychedelic plants and especially what they think the Amanita miscarry mushroom he thinks was one of the big ones that these people just didn't want anybody else to know about it so they hid their stories. They hit him in parables and you know they hid the how they know what their history of the use of this stuff. Really interesting stuff that I'm way too stupid to understand whether he's right or whether the other people are right. But the guy is a legit scholar you know he's not a stoner he's not like one of those guys is trying to justify mushroom use.

Speaker 8:          02:07:57       There is something the Times that I've tried mushrooms in which I know it sounds stereotypical but I really think there's something there. I mean there's like definitely beyond science and rationale and what I've been told to expect in this and that there's something there's something extra wild about him and you know nothing's really that great as when you can really enjoy that. Yeah and and it makes for everything I mean luckily you know they're finally coming out with these studies that are showing what it's doing for depression and anxiety and it's it's super natural cure at times for people even with what they called. What are they come when it's a lifelong diagnosis. Chronic depression.

Speaker 10:         02:08:48       I mean people have bounced out of it when they thought that they were going to be miserable for the rest of their lives it's like Oh thanks a real consciousness reset on a real life a real one not not not just like blowing on your hand and pretending you feel better it's it's real it's legit.

Speaker 19:         02:09:04       Listen to some of the shit that's in the dead sea scrolls by the way. There is people that are working really hard to try to turn that around as of the John Hopkins study and yeah my friend Aubrey was just at maps the psychedelic meaning whatever the hell it is I forget what the what it was I stand for maps.

Speaker 2:          02:09:22       Same map psychedelic I should know because they're doing a lot of really good work and letting people know it Intel multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies and you know they're they're hitting them with hard science over and over and over again and showing how many people it can be beneficial for which model and a lot of people that are trying to hold back those people that are trying to hold it back. It would be beneficial to them as well so people don't understand is that your desire for your resistance to psychedelics is the very reason you need psychedelics in the first place. If you really understood what you were resisting like you're really holding God back you really you really want to believe in God. Take 6 grams of mushrooms you'll see him. Yeah you really party with them. You'll hang out with them. Dude DMV you'll have you'll meet God for sure.

Speaker 2:          02:10:08       You say it sounds crazy it sounds like an idiot saying it and I agree it's I. It sounds like an idiot it's me. I agree with you but I think it's probably exactly what Zeke was talking about in that story. But he was tripping his balls off. Oh yeah. He had some crazy psychedelic experience you probably ate some mushrooms or or you know the Moses burning bush scholars to this day actively in in Jerusalem there. There's a movement for scholars to recognize the possibility that Moses was on psychedelic drugs. And that's one of the reasons why it's all a burning bush like one of the big bushes that they that they associate with that area as the acacia tree the acacia Bush rich and DMC.

Speaker 17:         02:10:50       And if that doesn't mean that if they figured out how to extract that shit and smoke it burning bush is right there. Yeah he met God. He found out the 10 you know it sounds like what God would say of your high end EMT all those ten commandments they sound pretty right. Yeah. Don't fuck your neighbor's wife. Don't kill him. Be nice. Yeah it sounds like would be empty with W like it literally is exactly what D.N.A. would tell you.

Speaker 2:          02:11:09       Translated to the filters of time thousands of years of various languages. But if some guy had some breakthrough experience back then I was trying to enlighten all the people around him. That's what he would say. I came back from God. God gave me this message and then over X amount of years of idiots talking about it would not know.

Speaker 24:         02:11:26       Wrote it on stone tablets. Well how did he know it was God's word. Well God gave him.

Speaker 28:         02:11:32       Giants don't mean when people exaggerate and tell stories of course good a thousand years of people explaining what happened they're going to fuck it up and butcher it just makes sense.

Speaker 9:          02:11:42       What was the name of that Mel Brooks movie. It's one of my favorite scenes in comedy history with Mel Brooks is playing Moses and he comes around the corner at three tablets. My Lord I give you these 15 and he drops the one these ten commandments. Yeah. So funny.

Speaker 39:         02:12:01       This is a this is a fucking fascinating. These quotes I mean again I can't tell you if these quotes are really from the actual dead sea scrolls but it's it's really wild crazy shit. It's it's it's hard to understand how you translate things to English because it's not. You're also trying to like display the intent with a completely different style of communicating. You know like this style of communicating that they had back then is probably so alien to us like socially and so they try to alter it to get it to fit and how we feel they would communicate if they lived today. Yeah. Many will attempt to steal your crown and rob you of your joy but they can never succeed because of my presence with you. What you have hidden in the deep recesses of your heart can never be removed by the enemy of your soul. Maintain a strong faith in me and my word and you shall never perish but enjoy life everlasting which I have provided you. That's sounds like a cult leader. It sounds like a dude is trying to get his dick sucked and he knows where all the gold is yeah life everlasting.

Speaker 40:         02:13:15       That's a hard promise to keep.

Speaker 39:         02:13:18       Who knows if that's what it's really said though. That's the really fascinating stuff about all this really ancient shit. It's like piecing together the past so fucking hard to figure out when anybody really said like this stuff that I've been telling you about this Dan Carlin's Hardcore History that I've been listening to for the past couple of months. They don't even know what gang is kind of looked like they don't only look like they don't know where they buried them. They don't they they don't have any direct quotes from him. They have quotes from like people that met with like Russian historians like emissaries and you know diplomats that met to like demand things before they you know for the Mongols descended upon them.

Speaker 27:         02:14:00       Shit I read I read a thing about that exactly that they hired like 50 people to bury gang is gone and then they hired 100 people to kill those 50 people so that nobody knew where he was buried and then they hired 500 people to kill those hundred people that killed the 50 people in case any of them told them a thing you know and they would just ambush these groups of people that were under their own command in order to protect the secret of gang is gone.

Speaker 19:         02:14:28       They're bad motherfuckers. They were willing to take it to a level that human beings today could never conceive of.

Speaker 8:          02:14:33       That's all I do now as I absorb all these these this is history is unbelievable to me. And now with the Internet you can go non stop tangent to tangent to tangent. You can forget what originally got you there. Next thing you could just be on the different scope of the universe.

Speaker 11:         02:14:50       But for some reason like tragic events of twelve A.D. don't bother me as much as like Boston of 2013.

Speaker 2:          02:14:59       Like I stopped reading about the Boston tragedy. Like I don't want to you know I'm hearing about this guy lost his legs and this people you know these people were permanently injured and this person died and it's you know it's so depressing. But for whatever reason I can read about gangs can't or listen to this audiotape bugging his car. It doesn't bother me. Yeah. Sweet don't know how.

Speaker 24:         02:15:20       People are terrible they're capable of such horrible horrible behavior.

Speaker 39:         02:15:25       We don't know. We're not used to or not around that often. You have to see something happen to just understand. Oh yeah there's some of us out there that are just fucking nuts right.

Speaker 9:          02:15:34       It's just in in in the evolution of things. It's hard to it's hard to get all the way clear after a thousand years ago the Mongol Lloyds were killing tens of thousands of Mongol Lloyd's great well with long goals whatever you can say whatever man they'll come they'll come get you.

Speaker 39:         02:15:52       The thing is China's like their hero. I mean imagine like that's that's a guy that's in your your past. You know we talk right. What did what did your ancestors do. Oh really. My answer was getting his fuck my ancestor killed everybody because King is Khan fucked so many people that he's responsible for a giant percentage of the DNA in that area like he's in something like 5 percent his DNA is in some I just made that number up. By

Speaker 17:         02:16:15       the way I'm going to google it okay because it's not another fucking important one of my historian. Go look for yourself you.

Speaker 37:         02:16:21       If you want to find out get get that Dan Carlin's Hardcore History I can't recommend it enough the guy puts a tremendous amount of work in these podcasts I really respect his work ethic I'm not I'm fuckin fascinated by man Genghis Khan motherfucker dude I'm saying Tony Hinchcliffe Oh yeah definitely.

Speaker 10:         02:16:39       So well what's next for you buddy. Except besides Wednesday night at the ice house. Can't wait for Wednesday Burt Chrysler and Tommy Segura and Bryan red band. Jesus Luisa's I love it. I'm very excited. We're gonna have some fun. Mm hmm mm hmm. What else is going on for you. Still working on Jeff Ross's show.

Speaker 8:          02:16:55       Yeah we're in between seasons right now. Hopefully Season 3 will be really soon. The burn on Comedy Central and you're one of the writers over there.

Speaker 14:         02:17:02       Yeah.

Speaker 37:         02:17:02       So if you see something really offensive most likely that guy wrote it you know who did it Tony Hinchcliffe. He doesn't give a fuck. Even if I didn't write for it I fought for it to be on the show. He's born gangster. Look at that look at him. It's true I not give a fuck.

Speaker 20:         02:17:19       Came out here from Ohio to make it in the dark world. It's true.

Speaker 9:          02:17:23       What you from Columbus originally from Youngstown and a town in Italian city between Chicago and New York.

Speaker 5:          02:17:28       I know where that is. I did comedy there. I did comedy in this club. The funny farm. Yeah. And they had theirs there's the stages in the bag and there's a disco in the front and the disco was like well it wasn't the highest end.

Speaker 28:         02:17:41       This guy you know not a holiday. Yeah yeah. Yeah. And there was like all this music was playing every time the back door would open.

Speaker 59:         02:17:48       You would hear it and then it would close and then you'd go back to your act. It

Speaker 39:         02:17:55       would be like literally this quiet. And the door would open. So it's just constant open and shut into pee.

Speaker 37:         02:18:00       You had to go that way I think yeah I might have made that up to now. No it wasn't a good gig. That club was notoriously like. Not really. Did you ever do it. No. Never. Never.

Speaker 9:          02:18:14       Some areas started out here. So do you wanna go back to just let everybody know I went back a couple of times when I first started and did pretty big shows at a different bar. But I was at a bar.

Speaker 29:         02:18:25       Oh you just did like you got your own thing. Yeah. Looking you fuckin stud. Yeah. Would you do with you bring somebody.

Speaker 9:          02:18:30       It was just me actually just you by yourself. Yeah I have. You're a savage. Yeah I have a big a good great group of friends back in Youngstown.

Speaker 29:         02:18:39       How much time do you have altogether.

Speaker 8:          02:18:42       Well altogether it's weird because no matter what I'm trying to do I always go off on tangents and whatever so that's always I have to end up doing less than my goal anyway.

Speaker 37:         02:18:53       And you makes a good problem to have. Yeah yeah it is that you get that problem we do a lot of comedy. Yeah I do a lot of comedy on stage yeah. How many days a week are you going up every night.

Speaker 9:          02:19:05       That's how you do it. Some nights like last week I had a couple nights where it was three shows in one night flying around just doing it.

Speaker 28:         02:19:12       Isn't it amazing when you do that because coming home comes party DNA you know really gets in that groove. It's hard to do. Trying to do. Oh yeah. I find I balance. I like to do that. I never liked you every night. I like to do like three or four nights a week. Then I like to take nights a week off and not even think about comedy and just write where I don't I don't even I don't even entertain the idea of going onstage. I just go over ideas you know and I find that there's like for me I can't just always be going onstage. It's like a lot of time has to be spent especially now working on I don't know like my sixth or seventh hour or something like that and all the time I put out specials and shit. It's like I have to I have to figure out like new angles and new points of view and not even this whole new point of view.

Speaker 28:         02:19:56       But new subjects new new different things that interests me new points that I have. I feel like I don't I don't just get that I I just go on stage a lot. I have to spend a lot of time doing other shit you know and I think about that actively now whereas when I was younger than I really think about that actively like I would just try to like right you know I just try to come up with new bits but now I make myself do things. So the cool stuff will come out of my interesting stuff to talk about.

Speaker 8:          02:20:22       It was very soon after I started standup once and the first couple weeks I found a book that Stephen King wrote called on writing yeah great book unbelievable because it's a it's obviously you know it's not a fiction he's just talking about his work ethic of writing and he's like I don't think I'm a writer if I take a day off what am I that I'm just some guy. And so I started applying that during the day and I figured you know on top of writing my own standup if I keep up this habit of writing for a few hours every day during the day then then it will get better. And it did. Sure enough you know luckily I'm a member of the Writers Guild now. Yeah. Working on the show and everything. So the habit was really it was that book that gave me the confidence because you're listening to Stephen King. I mean yeah. One of the best at what he does.

Speaker 2:          02:21:14       So one of the best of all time. Yeah yeah. I mean I'm a huge fan of that guy and I just I can't have a thing about people that produce stuff. Yeah I find that like for me one of the most inspirational things is to be around a lot of other inspirational people you know like when I like when I go to a UFC I want to work out and after I come home I want to fucking work out like crazy when I go see comedy. I want to write and I think that's what's really important.

Speaker 8:          02:21:39       Oh totally. I do that all the time even with the music that I listen to. Going somewhere getting ready for something you know at night. I listen a big powerful music that'll get me you know sort of hyped and inspired a lot of live shows is that type of music that I listen to and you hear the crowd just yeah. Yeah. In these breaks or at the beginnings or at the end of the song and that's the stuff that takes every little bit of Mojo one can absorb to be able to kick it back out.

Speaker 10:         02:22:08       Yeah that's why I really like music as well. I think music is one of the cool things to see because it's like the energy is putting it but it's totally different from comedy. It's like some new facet of some new energy some new thing. And like when I listen to a song like some songs or suck something about it like like there's a lyrical quality to like writing in songs that I started to realize somewhere along the line is applicable to comedy as well. Like when a good joke is written correctly and a joke has a good economy of words and the right words to describe the right situations it has like a rhythmic quality to it. And I think that's sort of that's sort of underestimated or overlooked by a lot of comedians. The impact that that sort of rhythm to the delivery has the impact of it I think is pretty substantial. Oh totally. But we don't think about that we just think about what is funny but it's not just that it's like it's funny and it's also good and it's smooth and it's a lot of things to it to make it more enjoyable more interesting to listen to.

Speaker 8:          02:23:10       A perfect example of what you're talking about right now with the rhythm and like timing and everything. Last night I'm hosting at the Comedy Store it's like 40 comedians everybody that's new and employees after that and then paid regular whatever and in the middle of it a cook that the Mexican guy Aldo don't show who works the deep fryer at the Comedy Store. Hey man I want to go on stage and barely speaks English at all. I mean the impression I just did is making him sound much more American than he is. And he he wants to do comedy and I go you know what man. All right. But it's just gonna be two minutes okay. This way in case it's you know do whatever is right. But you know and he goes up. But it was hilarious because nobody could understand a single word but he was completely committed and then all of a sudden he's making this noise and you really you don't you don't know even know what the noise he was making was but his commitment and his beats with it just he crushed he crushed and all these other comedians that do it every night and look at going up in that room at the Comedy Store is like this is it.

Speaker 8:          02:24:12       I'm going to show them what I would do on The Tonight Show if I was on it tonight. Then you have the guy work in the frying pans who nobody understands a word. There's people that spend so much time writing and everything but there he is. And it sure it's a silly instance but it was extremely funny. If I'm cracking up and the audience is laughing and people are then it's funny.

Speaker 17:         02:24:34       And but you know it's really and he did it without a word.

Speaker 44:         02:24:36       How do you how do you recreate that could you recreate that with another audience. Maybe not. And make maybe that would only work in that sort of a really lose situation where it's a comedy store. Bunch comedians in the crowd right.

Speaker 10:         02:24:47       You want to go up you go up and like no expectations right. You know I mean it's like Could you recreate that and become a comedian. Right. It was yeah because you know how that that's a weird realization you have where just because a joke kills in one place it could bomb another place of total and you say it the exact same way. Yeah well what the fuck yeah. And then you realize well well there isn't like this isn't always work like this this weird idea I'm throwing out there yeah some people are gonna buy into it and some people are not. And sometimes it sounds like the greatest joke ever written. Sometimes it sounds like you're a fool.

Speaker 8:          02:25:18       Yeah because sometimes there's something that happened the first time you did it when it worked that you did before that you don't normally do that you forgot that you did and it worked because of that.

Speaker 28:         02:25:27       And I think a good thing for young comics to realize is that that's good. It's good. All those bombing and failing and not getting it right. It's good. Oh yeah totally. Because if you don't have it you're not going to appreciate when it goes well.

Speaker 27:         02:25:40       I remember in my first few weeks of doing it somebody went to a comedian came up to me who I won't say his name but he was terrible.

Speaker 8:          02:25:47       And he goes Hey man you know the trick is bomb as often as you can.

Speaker 9:          02:25:53       I'm thinking myself Oh yeah that's what you would do you'll lose there if that's what you're doing anyway. But mostly I got Americans to bomb. What was his rationale. Well he goes you know because now's the time to knock bombing out. Oh you know how to bomb now. It ended up making some sense Labor's terrible. So how did you have such wisdom. Right exactly. Somebody must have. Somebody must have told him that like hey you know look at it this way in a positive sense you're bombings. Good.

Speaker 31:         02:26:21       I don't think back means funny anymore makes me sad. It's funny to you right now. So close yeah.

Speaker 60:         02:26:26       Now just madness.

Speaker 31:         02:26:28       I look at it I just see madness this people that you know that are going to try for years and years and years and know it's never gonna happen right doesn't exist for them.

Speaker 9:          02:26:39       Yeah it is creepy and I've seen it with a few people but you with anything.

Speaker 44:         02:26:45       I mean you watch American Idol and people saying and you like how is this person think they've been saying they're crazy. How does this person think anything what anybody wants it must be that for if you're a literary agent.

Speaker 2:          02:26:54       I mean imagine how many people send you secret stories like Holy fuck are you reading this nuts fucking work. Read this. What what is that. Tony why why are some people so goddamn delusional. Is there a broad spectrum of human beings and the amount of voltage your battery puts out and some people are just designed to dig holes.

Speaker 8:          02:27:13       I think that the delusion is you know the delusion needs to be that with tons of work at something you can accomplish it. Not that the delusion is I can do this. It's you've got to everybody that has ever been good at anything worked at it you know and I mean a lot. So it's not and they wanted it.

Speaker 10:         02:27:34       And even if you work out it doesn't mean you gonna get it. Especially with things like talent things like talent is a weird thing.

Speaker 39:         02:27:41       Like these guys I've seen guys that like they train striking like for MDMA. They train it for years. They fucking trained for years. But then when it comes and actually fight they can't pull it off. They just they can't strike with people again. They don't move right. They're too slow for whatever reason it is they can never figure it out. And there's other guys who show em a couple of moves they lose like fucking pros like instantly and they crush you and knock you out with one punch.

Speaker 21:         02:28:04       It doesn't make any sense. It's like either. I mean it's like that guy clearly has a gift right. This guy clearly no matter how hard he works he's never going to get there. It's true.

Speaker 20:         02:28:13       The weird thing about this life boy must be a real curse led to a crazy feeling to be one of those guys.

Speaker 2:          02:28:18       It's like trying to pursue something and you having no success and you can't connect the dots and you can't move forward.

Speaker 8:          02:28:25       Man it's you know before anything was happening you know before when I was still not making money and before I was getting past at the clubs and Hollywood and everything it was extremely low. You know I was able to keep having fun by surrounding myself around funny friends and everything but man was it hard.

Speaker 10:         02:28:44       Yeah it's depressing Yeah pressing as fuck when you're not making it deck out there. It's hard but isn't it like a real character builder. Once you're through to the other side. Like oh yeah he must be so happy right now. Oh yeah. Yeah you're always smiling and shit. I'll totally you're like a professional comedian. Boom got through. It's wild. You made it. Yeah dude you you know you fucking killed in Indianapolis. There's a lot of goddamn people's 2000 people out there and you had to go up cold and we knew who the fuck you were.

Speaker 9:          02:29:08       I love it. Kill. That's right. That's the way I like it. Yeah. The audience loved you. I love love. A lot of positive tweets. Man I thought you're funny. Yeah it was a blast. I listened to the set the next day and I just couldn't even believe it. This was really wild. So we caught all those in the sound and the power of that one was that the biggest crowd you ever worked.

Speaker 8:          02:29:29       I think so right or right around there. I should know but it's it's been right around there with a couple of shows the quote that was sorry about this guy Phil Elmore.

Speaker 44:         02:29:37       He's a writer. He wrote this on his Twitter. So as a writer never has a vacation for a writer life consists of either writing or thinking about writing.

Speaker 29:         02:29:45       And that's Eugene you know sick go. He was a playwright.

Speaker 8:          02:29:50       That's so true. Psycho. I can't sleep at night if I didn't do something that day. It's not a vacation. I'm. I work my vacation. I think this is a blast. I would be uncomfortable for me is literally being on an island for a week with no internet and no. Yeah. Pen and paper.

Speaker 11:         02:30:11       Well people that don't stand that like you need to relax Tony.

Speaker 39:         02:30:14       You need to stop working so hard they understand that you're the only person that can make Tony Hinchcliffe jokes right.
