The black hat now you want me to do, I'm the lack of a white hat sort of a guy according to my record label. So the Jeremy Pivot down there at yelp. Oh, does he have a glass in his hand or his? No, that's something. Just know they changed outfits. There was a makeup lady, you know what I mean? It's just cute for Sutherland. Oh, what's this? No Cigar. Cute. There's no fucking cigar.

Speaker 1:          00:48          You know he's thinking when he's holding that cigar. I love black people. Yes. He's thinking he's thinking of saving. That word rhymes with bigger Danny Devito. He's got something going on. What is he doing? He's lighting it. Manny too many takes there. I know there was more than one take on it. I can pull it off. It's dead on the inside. I don't care. This is good for publicity. This is good for my image. When I smoke as their God gives you the feeling of prosperity. I live in a mansion in the palisades and I fucked my maid Dai gum inside them or don't give your woman with me. I come inside her as well. That's why his cover works. Adrian Brody, I'm just sitting here wondering what happened. You're right, arnold is the perfect person that sees to investors to loan. Seems fairly candid photos but I'm worried there was too many takes.

Speaker 1:          01:56          I'm worried they took several takes. Now you spitting into that thing. What's going on here? We got mom drinking Copenhagen. What does that shit? Yeah, Copenhagen. What's the deal with that? Explain that to me. What does that do for you? I've never been involved. I have no experience in this. I chewed tobacco once when I was a kid cause I read huckleberry Finn, they give you, they give you a head high threw up. I started extra salivating and I felt like shit, I don't know. It was it good. I like it. I'm gonna try something that give it a go. What do you do with it? Take a little bump. Put under your lip bump. A little pinch, like a cocaine style bump. Now we've never done that either. I'd go less is less than what you asked plenty for you. Is that too much?

Speaker 1:          02:42          That's good. Okay. Where do you put it? Anywhere you put any love you want. Okay. Yeah. It's going to start to burn a little bit bigger cancer immediately. I don't think so. I mean, now you shouldn't. That doesn't taste bad. No, it's like wintergreen done. It's been the right one because you do not, I repeat. Do not want to drink juice. Spit. That is a fucking day gone bad. Well, one of the guys who worked in UFC who was a, uh, Jamie's laughing cause of chewing, it looks ridiculous. Why does it look ridiculous? You're going to get a supervisee high. It's gonna be great. I get messages every day from people that lost a hundred pounds right there feeling healthy. The problem is we're dealing with propaganda and you can do one or two things. You could either just say, well, you know, this is this, this, I think I swallowed all that tobacco. Yeah. It's all gone. Oh yeah. I was wondering why I'm so high. You got Tobacco on it. It's gone. I don't have it. Yeah. Swallowed up. I had a boy, I don't know what I'm doing.

They arrested him and then the fuck out of them. Yeah. Uh, I don't know if they kept them, but I mean they went in and they booked him for assault with a deadly weapon or attempted assault with a deadly weapon. Is that what it is? How long until he's saying that the cops were roughing him up. I'm sure they have video footage of everything. They wouldn't be crazy. It'd be crazy not to. Yeah, something like that. Like Chris Brown, like fuck is under age cousin and then piss on somebody. No, that was our Kelly. You can find like three different black people. I don't know who fuck their cousin Kelly was peanut people didn't he used to put with this lately and molest them? No, that's the other guy. That's bill cosby. Oh, got it. Jesus Christ.
