Speaker 1:          00:00:01       No abandoned three, two

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       and we're live. What's up buddy? Hey, how are you? I'm very sorry about that. A sound of the thing in the background. Ladies and gentlemen here. That was wasn't.

Speaker 1:          00:00:17       That's annoying. We'll shut that off.

Speaker 2:          00:00:21       Sure, go ahead. Okay. Can you shut it off? Jamie? Um, dad is because there was, there was smoke in this room and the Godfather has a, uh, an issue with the smoke. How'd you get over your asthma? Uh, around puberty it often subsides, especially if you're quite athletic, which I was. And then it completely went away by about 13 and only came back by about 25, but now I'm not full blown asthmatic. Only when I get sick, if I, let's say, get a cold, it will migrate to my chest. Turned into bronchitis. And what will take you four days to fight? Might take me a month of whooping cough. That's why I'm really careful about not getting a quote. You know, you must be a hand washer. Well, that's why when I came out of the bathroom, my instinct was to tell Jamie as I was shaking his hand, I washed my hands because I'm always careful about checking other people's hands.

Speaker 2:          00:01:12       I'd like to extend them the same courtesy. Yeah, man. I shake some people's hands and it's like they just dumped it in the pool. It's some people like they get so sweaty and you shake their hand. You Go, well, okay, but what's going on with his hand? Like what kind of weird bacteria? I read this article that was saying that water bottles, when you reuse water bottle, they've tested them and they say that there's less bacteria on dog toys. It's pretty bad. Well, that's why by the way, I've resorted to fist bumping because I'm cool, but it just reduces the amount of germ transfer from one person to the other by just going like this, but don't you think that that compromises your immune system by not exposing it to a lot of different things? There is actually research on this right from an illusionary medicine.

Speaker 2:          00:01:55       Kids who grow up in very sterile environments end up suffering from greater respiratory ailments, precisely because their system hasn't been kicked up. Yeah, I believe that. I rarely get sick and I shake a lot of hands, but I know a lot of people that don't and they're kind of sick all the time. Like I don't want to get sick. I'm like, but maybe that's what's going on. Maybe with French kiss later after the other exciting. Don't you threatened me with a good time. It's, um, I think it's also really important. I don't know how much you partake of this, but uh, to consume probiotics, do you would eat acidophilus or yogurt or yogurt? I do like Kimchi. I don't do it by design. I think maybe just those preferences are healthy and so I'm, I'm happy to hear that they are good probiotics and for grapplers in particular, grapplers are very, um, particular about the consumption of probiotics because we get a lot of ringworm and I'm also a staph infections too. There's a lot of different infections that people can get from. Especially ringworm, know staph infections is really more for an, from an open cut. But uh, having healthy skin flora is very important. Why all

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       you kids listening don't use antibiotics. So it's not, it's not the right way to go. There's a lot of healthy soaps that are used like tea tree oil and eucalyptus that are really good for you that are probiotic. Right? Keep the idea of warm and mind because later I'd like to talk about brain worms and how it relates to a condition that is affecting the west. We can get into it now or you mean like Toxoplasma? That'll be one. There's other ones. There are many others. Do you want to get into that now? Sure. Okay. So that's the polsky on. I know know I should write to them because it was amazing. He is amazing. I wrote to him a while ago, maybe a year and a half or two years ago, but at the time he to come on my show. Uh, but he was very busy writing a few books, which I'm guessing he's probably done with now.

Speaker 3:          00:03:43       Yeah. Well he was busy then. We had a meet him in La, in his hotel room, and we had to film. We only had an hour. He literally landed, got into his hotel room. We went with him as he opened up the door to his hotel. We sat down with them and it's just a little table and chair there is fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. So basically I argued that in the same way that there are all sorts of animals that once they are infected with this brain warm and they are different instantiations of it, uh, they, they, they become zombified, right? I mean, just to give you another example, the spider wasp will sting the spider, which, which is much bigger than it rendering it. Zombified then carries it into its burrow, lays its eggs on the invivo spider, and then when the eggs hatch, they eat it in Vivo.

Speaker 3:          00:04:31       And I argued that the, the political correctness is akin to the spider wasps sting because it's zombifies us into walking quietly through the abyss of infinite darkness a while. Horrible things are happening around us, but why we think that we're doing the right thing. While we think that yet we know we're not, we're being not racist and good and progressive, uh, but, but to go back to the brain warm idea, so I coined the term not to be cute, but to actually name this collective condition. I called it ostrich per acidic syndrome. Yeah. We've talked about this before. We talk about. We know that that's a myth. Well, yeah, yeah. That the Boston. Because it's become just a metaphor for her. Yeah, absolutely. The Myth being folks that ostriches don't really stick their head in the exactly. Uh, and, and it's, it's really taken on a life of its own.

Speaker 3:          00:05:18       At this point. I'm actually thinking of studying this scientifically, not just as something that I talk about in my public engagement. What is it that causes some people to be more likely to be arrested enticed by the types of mindsets that would cause you to suffer from ostrich parasitic syndrome. So a classic example would be, which I guess we'll we'll get into how much evidence do you need to see around the world that there might be some religious ideology that is somewhat problematic and antithetical to secular liberal modern values. How much information or what is the type of information that you would need to see before you are able to arrive to such a conclusion. And so one

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       of the things I'm thinking of doing is to formally quantify a score of ops, how much somebody suffers from won't be as, as a type of mindset and what are some predictors that could help us understand who is more or less likely to be the afflicted by this mindset? Well, there's certain people that just never want to hurt anyone's feelings except when they think that it is within their rights to attack that person because that person is somehow or another victimizing someone else and then there'll be far more egregious than the original offense. Did you know about that guy that in Canada that's getting sued? Well, he, the Human Rights Council find him $12,000 because you walked into the apartment that he owned with shoes on because there was a Muslim family living there. Um, their lease was up and he was looking to rent the apartment. They stopped responding to his texts and so he opened up the apartment to show this, uh, this apartment that he owns and because he walked into a building that he owns with his shoes on, he has to pay them $12,000 for failing to accommodate their religious practices while showing their apartment to perspective tenants.

Speaker 2:          00:07:07       That's crazy. Welcome to Canada. We just had a thing called the motion and one. Oh, three. Are you familiar with this? Look at this. Look at this statement that, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but the human rights tribunal of Ontario also found that he harassed them and created a poisoned housing environment. It's right. There you go. Because he refused to remove issues. Some sensibilities are more equal than others, but that is just what, why is it that people are so. Especially in, particularly with Muslims, like you'll notice that there's a lot of people that are, they will accuse everyone of Islamophobia yet they'll shit on Christians. Yeah. It's really common like they don't, it's not that they believe in religious freedom, it's that they have like a pet cause and the pet causes almost like being a and to a lot of far right people who are really terrified of Muslims, like they're trying to like figure out how to, how to balance that out with their own ridiculous leftwing version of it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:06       Well, I think there are two elements to it. One is that they're just afraid to criticize because bumps, because they are greater repercussions to do so than to criticize seventh day adventist. So just from a very basic sort of survival instinct, but I think secondly, which is kind of part of the ostrich parasitics internal, not speaking of. There are all sort of erroneous ideas that people have been infected with. Uh, you know, the, the, the, the Muslim religion is a religion for the downtrodden, the Brown people, the exotic other and so to, to criticize them when they are a hapless exotic minority is simply racist and sexist and people believe that even though most of the countries that these people are coming from, when they come to the west, not only are they the majority, they're almost the exclusive majority like so, so they are out of I think 56 countries that constitute

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       the OIC, the Organization of Islamic cooperation, something like 29 or 30 countries that exclusively Islamic. They are no longer any religious minorities. It's in the order of 99 point nine something. So to argue that people who come from these countries are, you know, religious minorities, religious minorities when they come to the west, but they're all coming from countries where not nevermind that they're the majority. They've never interacted with someone who did not share their faith. I don't think people understand that if that happens here, like you can't turn back from that without violence. Right? Like if, if, I mean, I'm not saying that it would happen in the United States, but the fact that it can happen anywhere means it can happen everywhere. I mean, it really can. I mean it's, it's a, it's a big reach on my part to say that because there is no evidence whatsoever that it's going to happen here, but if you really look at some of the countries that are suffering under this really oppressive religious ideologies where women aren't allowed to drive, where they have to wear a covering all over their body, that signifies that they're a part of this religious sect.

Speaker 3:          00:09:59       Like if that, if someone tried to do that today, like if you had some blonde haired, blue eyed guy that made all women wear a certain outfit and they weren't allowed to drive and they weren't allowed to have the same rights, how many people would be standing up for them? That's incredible. Especially if it was a new thing. It, there's something about old things like old ideologies in legitimacy. So strange. What is that? Uh, while it's exactly what you said, you take an idea that someone holds. If he doesn't cloak cloak under the robe of religion, you commit them to a psychiatric institution. If he says, no, no, no, no, but this belief as part of my religion, suddenly you get a free pass. That's grotesque, but to speak to your point about, well that you are stretching about it happening in the United States. You're not stretching it at all.

Speaker 3:          00:10:44       As a matter of fact, I've argued at, for example, when the, when trump won, that if you look at a longterm view of the issue of Islamic immigration, if, if, if what you focus on is, uh, do we have the proper vetting processes to stop terrorists, isis terrorists from coming in. That's a very short term view of the problem. But if you recognize that societies will take often, very, very long time before they become islamized. It's not as though every single country that today is Islamic became instantaneously overnight Islamic. In some cases it wasn't very, very quick invasion. In other cases it took 500 years before the demographic reality shifted. And so yes, if you look at it from the perspective of 10, 20, 50, 100 years, the US stands no threat, but take a longterm view. I love this quote from I think it was who said it, that the United States have all the clocks and watches we have all the time in the world. In other words, in Shatila. Eventually God willing, we will conquer you. So this is the right way to look at this issue. Do you wish to have a society become more islamized or less? Let me draw

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       another analogy. Uh, at the end of every day, you can weigh yourself and one of three things is going to happen. You've either lost weight that they get a weight, did not change a single ounce or you've put on weight. So let's analogize this with Islam. When Islam comes into a place, either the society gets better, nothing changes, or it gets worse. Do we have enough data at this point, after 1400 years to suggest that we can try to bet what will happen to a society? The answer regrettably is yes. Again, I hate to have to preface, of course, most Muslims are lovely and peaceful and wish to simply raise their children, but Islam as an ideology when it comes into a new society, is that a good thing? If yes, let's alternate Islamic. If no, then maybe we should have an honest conversation about this and honest conversation is what's really important because these things get so emotionally charged like the infamous Ben Affleck, Sam Harris Debacle on Bill Maher show, but that to me is a perfect example because Sam speaks in such a measured tone and he's so educated about it.

Speaker 2:          00:13:00       He's not making these big gigantic leaps, but people love to jump on him and call racism. He sent me some video that I just watched the other day. We were a bunch of people are just taking complete out of context statements, attributing to him as being like, this is what he believes on. Things. When if you listen to the full extent of the conversation, he's literally saying like that. I'm going to say something here that could be taken out of context, but what I'm saying is imagine if someone was saying this right, how do you respond to that? And they use that as a statement. I mean there's. There's so much of that going on. There's so much, so dishonest. Well there's, there's this weird not me thing that they're doing. It's like they, they're, I'm not the racist. He's racist and they get very.

Speaker 2:          00:13:48       Your racist, like the Ben Affleck thing, like he was like, that is so gross that it's so racist. Like instead of just discussing this conversation, I'm discussing this especially on the bill Maher show because that shows all those shows is not to criticize that show, but all those shows, we have a panel of six people. What you see is a bunch of people waiting to say something and they have to jump in and it's almost like they have to be salacious or they have to be outrageous just to get heard. You know, like everyone. It's it. Those kinds of shows promote this sort of disingenuous communication because you have to. You can't be polite like you and I can be polite. It's just you and I, we can talk and we can have these long form conversations, but on that show, you don't have the time to unpack what's wrong with all ideologies, all things that tell you how to think.

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       Forget about whether or not you think it came from Jesus or the Prophet Muhammad or Joseph Smith. Anytime there's a doctrine that tells you how to think because of some mystical presence, some God or Deity or prophet who has gotten the wisdom of the universe and you met at must not question it, and women have to wear veils and dress up like beekeepers and I mean all that stuff is very, very problematic because people are prone for whatever reason. I mean some. I guess it's something that goes back to tribalism and Alpha male chimpanzee behavior. We're prone to follow, prone to follow leaders. I mean, it makes it easier and that's one of the things you're seeing here. Well, what's amazing is that it's one thing to attack Sam because of the game of identity politics. He scores really poorly, right? He's a southern California and white male who doesn't speak any of the languages that matter Arabic or so on.

Speaker 2:          00:15:32       And his parents had money. That's his parents had money. So I've loved that. So your parents had money, you her. Exactly. I only recently found out maybe a year or a year and a half ago when I met him last, that his mother is the creator of golden girls is, you know. No, I didn't even know that. And I actually, I, I just looked at one of the golden girls that was rerunning and uc, I think it's Susan Harris or something. But anyways, uh, someone like me who comes from the Middle East who escape that reality, someone like Ayaan Hirsi Ali and I had many people on my show. Uh, I don't know how much you followed, but a lot of people who've all escaped from this world, either they still considered themselves Muslim but know not, you know, Muslim light or ex Muslims. In many cases they will be attached.

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       So imagine, you know, so there was some woman who went to Wellesley college who doesn't know anything about Islam, short of whatever she learned in her bullshit progressive course. She would lecture to us what true Islam is, not the people who lived under it, not the people who ran away from it. She knows better because. So it's, it's, it's really, it's grotesque. It's infuriating. It's stunning. And it's also confusing because like when, when you see them do it, like anytime someone goes so far overboard that objective reasoning is out the window and you're, you know, you're so committed to whatever position that you're in that you can't look at both sides of it. I mean, I, I could see why a lot of religious traditions would be comforting to people remind them of where they came from, give them pride of their homeland and give them a personal good feeling.

Speaker 2:          00:17:04       They're connected to some sort of an ancient tradition, right? As long as it's not oppressing other human beings. And there's gotta be some. I mean I actually cultural patterns of behavior that people do, like celebrations like Oktoberfest or something like that. Those things promote some sort of pride like I guess a pride in Germany and their beer making and all that stuff without oppressing people, you know. But by the way, this is a good segue to what you're talking about is something that is upsetting me these days increasingly so. So some people are now trying to draw a distinction between Islam and Islamism. The reason why I mentioned this is because Islam has two elements. There's the spiritual part, right? Which is, you know, Kinda

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       like your October fest that prayed this way, believe in a god in a monotheistic God and so on. But then within Islam is a much larger component of politics, political Islam. So when you say something like, well, you know, we should be attacking Islam. Islam as if it's something that is outside of Islam, that's simply false Islam. Islam is Islam, right around the one, the prime minister of Turkey, and I can quote many other, uh, Islamic experts said Islam is Islam. The term moderate Islam, Islam, Islam, and all these other qualifiers are nonsensical. Now, the reason why that upsets me is because it grants people a false sense of security and hope. You know Islam is wonderful, but we need to attack this separate thing called Islamism. Well from day one, 1400 years ago, Islam was Islam, Islam. Now that doesn't mean that there isn't a spiritual element.

Speaker 3:          00:18:47       That doesn't mean that most Muslims just want to practice the spiritual part, but there is no set of doctrines and as separate book called radicalized Islam, Islam, it all comes from the same texts. It comes from the Koran, it comes from the Heidi's, and it comes from the CEO at the biography of Muhammad, so, so this kind of false narrative that people are promulgating so that they seem as though they're not frontally attacking religion while laudable, while Nice, I get that reflex, it's false and so again, to go back to our point of talking honestly, we need to talk. Honestly, there's only Islam. Some people choose to practice it fully. Some people choose to ignore the ugly parts, but there is no such thing as Islamism. Islam. Islam is part of Islam. Now you're a person that goes out of your way to say, no, we're not talking about the kind sweet Islamic people that just want to raise their children now.

Speaker 3:          00:19:44       So how do you sort of manage those two ideas that they're the same? Like when the term radical Islam gets thrown around, right? So radical Islam simply means I really take my Islam seriously, right? It's, let's draw a silly analogy. If I don't eat pork in my radical Jew or am I a Jew right now, I happen to be Jewish. I simply ignore the kosher edict that says, don't eat pork. That does. Why do you do that though? Because in my case, I simply identify as Jewish in the sense that at Judaism is a multi attribute identity. It includes a shared history, shared lineage, a shit kind of erase what some could argue it's array, so it's considered in a lot of people's ideas so I could still in the same way that you might identify as coming from Boston and there's a shared history from all people who grew up around the time that you grew up in Boston and there was a sense of affiliation and tribalism.

Speaker 3:          00:20:45       Would that reality being, as far as I'm concerned and for most Jews, is exactly that. We don't necessarily take the religious elements very seriously. Now. That doesn't mean that we are practicing a light Judaism or non-radical Judaism where simply ignoring those parts of Judaism that we choose to ignore, so there is no such thing as radical Islam. There are no books called radical Islam. There is a set of doctrines called Islam and then I could do what's called cafeteria Islam, which is I pick and choose the parts that I wished to adhere to. So again, the discourse as a false narrative. I understand the reason for it because people find it rather Gauche to attack frontally it religion at least to attack Islam. So they have to. I call this the, the, the ISM magic eucharistic rite. Your ad isn't to something. It makes it bad.

Speaker 3:          00:21:35       Islam is good. Islamism is bad for you. Um, I would like to defend you if there's a lot of people that are listening right now or offer up some, not, not even defend you, but offer up some information. Like if you grew up in a place where being Jewish was lethal, I mean you, your life was threatened. Started on the, when the civil war broke out, prior to that you could live in Lebanon as a do. People knew that we were Jewish, but know your place Jew. That by the way, is something that I explained when, when discussing on, I'm not sure if we've discussed this on the show, but it might be worth repeating as we discussed your past in Lebanon. How you so, but so do you know what a dummy is? Have you heard that term? Yeah, you explained it, but please do again just so dim.

Speaker 3:          00:22:20       Me As a third class citizen comes out of Koranic edicts that basically said that when when Islam comes into a society, you basically have three choices. If you're not a Muslim, you can either convert, you could either get killed or if you are people of the book, meaning Christians and Jews, meaning people of the book that you're also monotheistic here also from Abrahamic faith. Then you could live as a DM, me and then me as a protected class, protected and quotes we tolerate you and in order to tolerate, you were going to remind you repeatedly have your subservient position. Now at different points across the last 1400 years. That mechanism was either instituted very forcefully or more lightly so in the context of Lebanon, which is which was a very progressive and modern country in the Middle Eastern context. There wasn't somebody knocking on our door and loving the pay us or else we're going to rape your daughters, but you didn't wear a big star of David because that might be construed as inflammatory.

Speaker 3:          00:23:24       Just like the example that you started off the show, you're hurting our sensibilities by pushing your Judaism on us, right? So your your status did not always have been threatened in that my head is going to come off at any minute. Right? My parents grew up and lived there. They didn't die, but once the civil war broke out, then it became lethally dangerous to be Jewish. I mean we were going to be executed. We left so you never know when we're going to go from tolerating you to offload the heads and that's been the history for the past 1400 years and so again, when people think, but Islam is not that bad. Look and under lucier a Jews and Christians and Muslims use to walk around hand in hand and in Spain around the 15th, 16th century below me, yes. People were not being beheaded everyday, but you knew your place.

Speaker 3:          00:24:18       That's not equality and it's kind of interesting when you talk about this idea about how people are reluctant to criticize Islam because they're worried about the repercussions of this. It kind of speaks to how rare it is that people do violate those principles in those countries because if you do have a culture that's 99 percent Islamic, especially if they go by the book, like every step of the way, like there's not going to be a lot of people that are stepping on the line for fear of the horrific repercussions. Now psychologically in this country, you're seeing that for some strange reason emerging from the left and emerging from a lot of like really progressive colleges and universities where they want to be almost the first ones to step up and say, and don't criticize this one particular religion, which is, it's very odd because it's the most regressive.

Speaker 3:          00:25:19       It's unbelievable. It's very, it's a really strange position to be a progressive who's reinforcing the ideologies of a regressive culture that's very ancient. But what's incredible is that they'll come up with ways to defend this cognitive inconsistency. And hence, that's part of the ostrich parasitic syndrome that I was mentioning. What, what are some ways that they defend? So example. Uh, and it just gives you a few manifestations of ostrich logic. My friend Mohammed is a very nice guy and he drinks and he fornicated and he's very liberal. So the idea then becomes that as long as I can identify a single exemplar of a Islamic person who does not otherwise, uh, adhere to what Islam dictates, then it's not true that Islam is bad. Now this is, this is a manifestation of a more general cognitive bias which goes like this. If I walk into class and I say, look, a homo sapiens are sexually dimorphic, they are an eight sex differences between the two sexes.

Speaker 3:          00:26:18       Men are bigger than women. Someone will put up their hand and say, but my aunt Linda is taller than my uncle Joe. Oh Gee. Darwin is dead. Right? So they, they identify a singular exemplar that is supposed to falsify a statement that is only true at the population level. So here's. So that's one example why Muhammad is nice. Therefore Islam is nice. Here's a second example. They point to a particular historical context where Jews lived in Islamic countries and weren't killed, Hae but God's side. You lived in Lebanon and you still have your head. And the torque that I usually give as well until they were going to cut off my head. But secondly, Jeffrey Dahmer, if you take, I think he, he was guilty of 17 murders, if you take the number of days that he lived as an adult until he was caught as a percentage of the days that he killed somebody.

Speaker 3:          00:27:12       90 nine point whatever percent of the days. Jeffrey Dahmer is a lovely guy. So it's unfair for you to say that Jeffrey Dahmer is a mean guy given that 99 percent of the time, he's nice. So what you have to basically do is take each of these ostrich logic arguments and analogize how the Arctic they are, but it's very exhausting because the bent, as you said, of all these progressives, is to do what ever they can to protect the ideology. And so it becomes exhausting to consistently have to try to fight through all the clutter. And it's not a thought that it's not something that is structured with objective reasoning. It's something that's structured with their own particular ideology that does not want to criticize this one segment of the human population that they think is being persecuted and meanwhile, if you think about throughout currently in the world, which ideology persecutes the most number of other people.

Speaker 3:          00:28:11       So if you talk about bloody borders, right? Islam has fought with Buddhists, Islam fights with animists, Islam fights with Jews, Islam fights with Christians. Islam fights with the Beth and monks as right, so in other words, Islam doesn't necessarily make for very good neighbors. Why? Because again, not withstanding the fact that most Muslims are lovely and just want to raise their kids Islam as a supremacist ideology, it basically says that the world is meant to all be united under the flag of. Now. Some people take that seriously. Others don't, but the doctrines of Islam are very clear. We should all submit to Islam. So even if 95 percent of Muslims don't adhere to that tenant, if only five percent do, that means we're always going to have friction. In some cases it'll be like Lebanon. By the way, I've predicted that in Europe. This is on record, we can probably find that that in Europe within 15, 20, 25, 50 years, we're going to have Lebanon all over the place and now it's starting to happen.

Speaker 3:          00:29:13       Right? At one point we were having daily attacks all over Europe, so. So again, if you're going to increase Islamic immigration to the West, of course most people are nice and just want to escape through a better world, but are you willing to take the risks for what's about to happen? Are you willing to accept people whose cultural and religious values are perfectly antithetical to yours? So example, if you do pew surveys from around the Middle East or Islamic countries about your views on Jews while you'll get things like 95 to 99 percent Jew hatred. So if I am, if I am a Canadian Jew, right, and I see that 50,000 Syrians are going to come in, is it that I'm filled with hatred towards Syrians or am I simply someone who calculates statistical regularities and basically says that out of 50,000 people, if 95 percent have academic Jew hatred as part of their identity, do I have a right to be concerned about this?

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       I'm not worried about Haitians. They're black people. I'm not racist. I'm not worried about the Vietnamese. Right? I'm worried about the cultural and religious baggage that you bring in. What about your views towards cliteracy as or homosexuality or a religious minorities or black dogs? Darwin forbid, if you're a black dog, your dog, Muhammad hated dogs, but he particularly hated black dogs. Uh, so again, so what do they do with blocked on the go, go online and you'll see some pretty ugly, uh, animal cruelty, uh, they're not very tolerant towards dogs. Uh, if you touch a dog before you're heading to prayer, this is called [inaudible]. It's in pure, by the way, the Kuffar, the non Muslims are also nudges. They're there. They're there as impure as urine and blood and sperm and feces, so should I feel bad that there is an ideology that considers me an impure quality?

Speaker 3:          00:31:09       Now, does that mean that all Muslims are like that? Of course not. Ninety nine percent of the Muslims I've met have been lovely and many of them are my friends, but we should be able to talk about what's inside those books and those books are not radical Islam. They're Islam. Well, let me ask you this. What's the alternative like say for Syrian refugees, I mean any kind, caring person who has concern for our fellow human beings sees these people fleeing and sees the horrific conditions that they're. That they're confronted with their own country and they really don't have a lot of options and they're trying to escape to the west. What? What are the options? What do you do? There are no clear answers. I would certainly say you first place the people who are most at risk in those societies on the front of the queue.

Speaker 3:          00:31:54       So you bring the Yazidi women, you'll bring the Christians who are being persecuted women. But what about the father? If the dad is with the wife and the children, you can't just have the father stayed back behind the tent and you let the mom go to Toronto with the kid. No, fair enough. Uh, what I was saying though is that let people who are non Islamic who are fleeing those areas at the front of the queue first, but isn't that, isn't that religious persecution? I mean, or at the very least it's prejudice, right? I mean you're, you're, you're singling people out because of their ideology or because of what religion they're from, not because of their past behavior or any predictors whatsoever about their future behavior. But we do have some statistical irregularity about what types of values those guys are going to come with.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       So I'm not suggesting we closed the door. Wouldn't that in a way. I mean, just to play devil's advocate, wouldn't that in a way kind of put the Muslims in Toronto who do immigrant, which would have picked that city who tried to immigrate to Canada in the same sort of a position that your family was in in Lebanon where you were hiding the fact that you would choose. No one has an inalienable right to immigrate anywhere. Correct. So if you wish to immigrate to the West than leave every single syllable that constitutes a belief attitude, position, value that is contrary to ours at the door and then welcome in my brother. But man, isn't that a crazy thing to say to someone whose entire life and their ideology is a big part of their identity and who they are, like how they view the world.

Speaker 3:          00:33:31       So that's the structure for which they interface with other human beings. But if those values. So let's suppose that in a way I agree with you overall when I talk about the entire human population, that it would be wonderful if we did that, but from individual to individual, we know about the trials and tribulations that people go through. On a day to day life and religious freedom and a religious ideology in many cases helps people get through the pains of life. It helps them get through the struggles. I'm not saying that it's rational, but I am saying that in many ways it's a scaffolding for their own personal behavior. Got It. You would have to then ensure that your religious practice is exclusively practice privately. Never should there ever be an intrusion into the public sphere. No. Asking for prayer rooms at the university. The example that you gave is the slight creeping she had.

Speaker 3:          00:34:30       Right? It's the slow. It's, uh, so my next book is called tentatively might change death of the West by a thousand cuts, right? It's the idea that when you take, again, the parable of the frog, when you put it in boiling water and you do it very slowly, the frog, if you do it very, very slowly, if it falls below a just noticeable difference, it doesn't notice that the temperature is rising until it's too late and it boils to death. Right? So this idea of just noticeable difference is something that's very important in this conversation. We're not going to get Islam analyzed overnight, but Egypt before it became Islamic, used to be non Islamic. Once upon a time. Today it's about 10 percent. The Coptic Christians, Turkey is now 99 percent Islamic. One day. It wasn't Iran. The Great Persian empires were not Islamic today. It's almost exclusively Islamic. So the United States and Canada are not going to become, uh, Islamic, uh, you know, in the next 10 years. But give it enough time, have a long enough view of history and I worry about your grandchildren and mine. Uh, and so we, that's how you have an honest conversation. And I'm not sure what the answer is. One possibility which I've with folks on my

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       show who are trained lawyers, is that there are provisions in the law, at least in the United States, to the Claire and ideology as being suspicious, right? So in the same way that you could say that Nazi-ism is seditious to our values or communism, they are elements of Islam. The nonspiritual parts that it doesn't take Einstein to recognize that they are perfectly antithetical to every single value that you and I with the whole deer as Westerners. So like what? What would be some of those volumes? So take for example, Shetty, aloe, right, which is the Islamic law by which you organize society. The first premise of Islamic law is that the a crime, its severity and its punishment depends on the identity of the perpetrator and the victim. So imagine the idea and the American constitution that justice is blind. Well, that is already violated as the most fundamental tenets of Sharia law.

Speaker 4:          00:36:37       If a Muslim kills a Jew, it's very, very different crime than if a Jew kills a Muslim. You can just go, go look up reliance of the traveler, which is the English translation of shadow law. And you'll see all these things. So why should we tolerate this kind of stuff? Right? Come in my Muslim brothers, but keep the stuff that you yourself escaped from out of our country. We don't want it. And if you keep it out, come in and let's grow together and hug it out. But why should I be tolerant towards the intolerable? I,

Speaker 5:          00:37:10       I agree with you in theory, but I think the problem is as soon as you tell someone to not follow certain aspects of their ideology, those aspects become even more attractive and especially if they consider the west to be decadent and filled with sin and fornicating and drinking and all the, all the things that they think are disgusting. And then these people are the ones who are telling you that you can't follow the word of God has brought down by the profit from up on high. It becomes even more attractive to them. So what do we do? So what's your truck's psychedelic drugs? Everyone gets on mushrooms and I'm not kidding. I really. I really think you need transcendent experiences to escape from the day to day vibration of normal life. How about just the commitment to reason and science? It would be wonderful if we could do that, but people are so terrified of death and they're so terrified of the unknown and they're so terrified of not having structure. People love having ideological structure that they can govern their life by real clear, established rules. Man. People get mad at me when I wear a fanny pack and I'm not joking. One of the reasons why where it is because people think it's disgusting. Like you think it's disgusting that I will have a bag around my waist that I can keep my keys and phone in. It's, but we have structure. You know, men aren't supposed to wear sandals. You know, if you're a man and you're wearing high heels open toed, you will get

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       ridiculed. Why? Because we have a structure and this structure, we don't. I mean, that's a bad example, but it's not really because it's along the same lines of thinking that we would expect you to behave like we do so that we don't have to worry about your behavior. I like gentlemen, I like a man with a tie and a suit because I'm pretty sure that guy's not going to spit at me and stab me and rob me. We have these ideas about people that dress and behave a certain way. You know, if someone, if you're in a business meeting and the guy starts swearing, he'll like, Whoa, I all bets are off. This man's not establishing the gentleman's protocol. He's not following the standard business oriented, you know, I would just like to exchange numbers and funds with you protocol, and so I don't understand what his behavior is going to be.

Speaker 3:          00:39:22       He's unpredictable. He could be a random street thug with a hoodie. You know, that was a thing for awhile. People were scared of young black men with hoodies on because a gentleman would not wear a hoodie on the street. That's a dangerous person. By the way. Our brains have evolved to think this way. Right? And so this idea, you were asking me earlier, give me some examples of ostrich logic. So this kind of Hashtag not all right now. That again is idiotic. Why? Because when we think about it, let's not talk about Islam for a second. If you're going down a dark alley and you see for young men, forget about hoodies and pants down just for young men. So all you have described is the fact that they're young and they're men. If you see for young men versus four elderly women just because of your statistical regularity that you calculate, which is more which group is more likely to end violence on you, then you might avoid the alley with the four young men, even though not all young men, right?

Speaker 3:          00:40:20       Even though the probability that a young man is going to jump you and gang rape you and Mug you and stab you as a small one, but your brain has evolved to calculate those statistical regularities and to then be very careful, be very risk averse and putting yourself in harm's way. So again, even though most Muslims are very nice and very lovely, I think we have enough data right now. If we look at the last since 2000, 11, 2000, one nine slash 11, there's been over 30,000 terror attacks committed in the name of Islam, right? I challenge anybody in your comments section to list me another ideology that comes remotely close. If you added up every single other ideology since 2001, you wouldn't come up to 100. So what is the statistical numbers that you need to see before you're able to simply say, look, let's have an honest conversation.

Speaker 3:          00:41:12       Not withstanding that, not all Muslims and most are nice. Is there a problem with Islam? Yes. It's not radical Islam. It's not Islam Islam. It's not militant violent extremism. Let's stop with the bullshit euphemisms. There are inherent elements, contents within Islam that are problematic. It's not my job to find a way to get rid of them, but if you wish to be part of our western societies, then you need to find the way to expunge that stuff. If you do it, welcome my brother. We're all brothers. If you don't, then I should show preference to people who share similar cultural values. To me that's. That's called survival instinct. Now what about people that would say that there's inherent problems with the Jewish religion? There's inherent problems with subscribing to that ideology that there had been persecuting Islamic people in Palestine that they've been prosecuting and treating Islamic people as inferior to Jewish people.

Speaker 3:          00:42:08       That's not me. I know you're not necessarily saying it, but that's all part of ostrich logic. That's what I call the Crusades. Right. And it's not me who actually came up with the. Right. So every time we did, but more like, it's, it's a, it's, it's a way of saying like, but bro, but what about the Crusades, Amal? Huh? Where's that from? I think I first saw it and he'll be happy that I'm giving a shadow. I think a guy on youtube who goes by the name of t and crowds or Kraut and t, he's a German youtuber. Oh, I'm sorry. I meant like, that's not from a language or anything. Oh No, no, no, no. It's, it's like saying, Bro, let's Duh, Duh. Exactly. Okay. Wait a minute. Exactly. But the Crusades, as soon as you, as, as soon as you point to some Islamic ugly reality than someone points, but bro, what about Israel but isn't ended up valid comparison?

Speaker 3:          00:42:57       I mean really, but you're kind of claiming and ideology, right? Right. I mean, but when you're saying you're Jewish and I support you saying this 100 percent, especially considering of all people, you should be in some ways proud of who you are considering that you come from a line of oppressed people that escaped a horrible situation. A no one is arguing that there is a monopoly of ugliness that only stems from Islam. Jews can engage in ugliness, Christians, atheists. Why subscribed to any ideology then? Because in the case of a, you're talking about specifically Israel, any, any ideology, any. Not necessarily Israel, which is a land, but I reject all the religious elements of Judaism, so, so why are you a Jew? Because I am part of A. People are part of a shared history, so it's like I'm Italian, your attack kind of thing. You're a time, right?

Speaker 3:          00:43:50       I, I belong to the lineage. And the same way, by the way, I recently put up a clip on my channel where I talked about academic lineage. So in the same way that you could build a genealogy of your family tree or of a people's, you could do what's called an academic genealogy. So for example, my doctoral supervisor is my academic father and then I could look to see who was his academic supervisor and who was his academic supervisor and do the martial arts. Is that right? Yeah, there's a direct lineage. So I could literally go back to some of the founders and only three or four generations, um, with some of the pioneers of, of psychology. And so I belong to that particular tribe, right? It comes to academia when it comes to my ethnicity, to my religious heritage. I belong to a group called Jews.

Speaker 3:          00:44:36       Now that doesn't mean that all the Booga Booga bullshit in Judaism I buy into, I rejected. So it makes me already somewhat less dangerous. And that if there are any ugly elements within Judaism, they're simply not going to be instantiated because I'm openly rejecting all that shit. Right? I understand that you as an individual or me as an individual and most Jews in the west, I think would fit into my category by the way, later we should talk about four and a half hour talk I had with a Hasid, a very religious Jew. Let's do it flying ticket to California on a second. Now, if most Muslims said, look, there's tons of historical elements in Islamic societies that's beautiful. Islamic architecture, Islamic Science, Islamic, Islamic Science, some Islamic philosophy, uh, one of the first intellectuals and in modern history, big history, so so I could be Muslim and that I come from a shared lineage of people and I could be very proud of that, but I can also have the moral compass and the moral fortitude to say, but there is stuff in my book that is truly grotesque and no amount of obfuscation and re interpretive dancing could alter that ugliness, right?

Speaker 3:          00:45:51       There's no way to take kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, taken a suppressor outbreak, resume killing. There is no way to take that and reinterpreted using modern sensibilities to mean at killing with caresses, right? Let's not play this reform game, so be proud of your cultural identity if and if that incorporates an Islamic identity grade, but reject all the bullshit. Right? And so I think that's where Judaism and Christianity at this point is somewhat different from Islam. For most people who are Islamic, even if they don't necessarily believe it, they'll feel very reticent to openly admitted that they despise a lot of the ugliness they'll say it's not true. It doesn't exist. You didn't understand that. You misinterpreted that Reza Aslan Bullshit, right? No, be honest about it. Say it exists. Say you're rejected and let's move forward, but stop skating. Well then there's people like Majid Nawaz who has, he identifies as being a Muslim, but he does reject those things, but he says that you could reform them and measured, and I have had in case some of you viewers don't know this.

Speaker 3:          00:46:57       Uh, I invited at one point two four to chat and uh, uh, he refused because I think he refused and I, I can't put intent into his mind, but I'm analyzing his rejection to chat with me. I think it's because he sees that I'm going to call them out on a lot of his narrative. Well, no one knows why someone rejects. I'm sure. Did he openly rejected? Like he has no room for it in the future, whoever. Yeah, I mean, at this point I retract that invitation. So even if you want it to run, there's an expression in Arabic. I'm going to use this for a second. Imagine this is the pen. He's holding a pen. A. Oh, I'm holding the people at home listening. The vast majority of guys listening. Imagine that. This spend, we're a cork. The cork of a wine bottle. There's an expression in Arabic, which I'll say in Arabic.

Speaker 3:          00:47:46       Some people have heard, mentioned before. The expression is this guy to bill's bb. Discardable is bb is to get drunk simply by smelling the court. Right? So I look, I'm smelling it. I'm already getting drunk. That's what measured in there was his, he, he, he gets people drunk with his, uh, hopeful reform message. Sounds so liberal. That sounds so hopeful. Say the expression of this scheduled bills, baby. I can't even make that noise in my face, but that this schedule booths but like, but like Yanni. Oh, there you go. Now, do you want me to have the rest of this conversation in Arabic be fascinating. I wish I could speak. It sounds cool. Actually. What happens with a lot of the guests that I bring in on my show who are Arabic, we always start off the star of our show speaking only in Arabic because for most westerners it's fetishize.

Speaker 3:          00:48:41       It's so excited. Like, oh my goodness, that's so alien to the way you speak English. The sounds right, but so going back to magic, I think what maybe his heart is in the right place. I don't. I'm not. I'm not trying to infer or imply that he's diabolical are duplicitous. I think he probably truly believes that he's doing something worthwhile. The problem is that it's not as though until measured. The West came along. No one had ever thought about this idea of reforming Islam. Jesus really? We never thought of that in the last 1400 years, but the reality is that there are elements within the doctrines of Islam that simply don't permit for this reformation to take place and even if it could take place, we don't necessarily have the time to wait another 400 years while we deliberate how each syllable and each of the problematic passages should be reinterpreted while people spot are being stacked up all over the world and so therefore I think that there needs to be a much more direct intervention and what I mean by direct intervention, no, there doesn't need to be reformed, doesn't need to be interpreted.

Speaker 3:          00:49:48       It needs to be expunged. These types of ideas. If Judaism has certain ideas that are a belligerent to women's cliteracy, then I want those ideas and Judaism out. They don't belong in the public arena of ideas. That's it. Now, how did Christianity reform and Islam did not? How did that go about happening? Because at one point in time, Christianity, Christianity was a very repressive religion and the apostasy, the idea of it was much more oppressed than today. Right now, like Islam is the only religion that I'm aware of. I mean, maybe there's more that I'm just ignorant to where if you leave the religion they can kill you. Absolutely. I mean, that's like, that's what God wants. God wants you to die because you don't believe in them anymore. What? I've always said that Islam is the perfect meme of plex. So are you familiar with that term means?

Speaker 3:          00:50:43       No. So a meme is a term that Richard Dawkins coined in his book in 1976. Selfish, selfish gene. Thank you. Uh, where he was analogizing the idea of a gene. Gene's propagate, correct? Well, memes are packets of information that spread from one brain to another. And so means also spread. We are both a biological and a cultural animal, right? Both are gene spread and our ideas spread. So a meme is something that can go. So if you read my books, I am infecting your brain with my memes, with my ideas. Correct. A library is a collection of memes. So. And Mima. Plex is a collection of means that in this case falls under a religious idea. Ideology. Well, Islam is the perfect Mimo plex in what sense? And that it's contents are made to spread. For example, Judaism. You mentioned earlier Judaism, you don't have any Jews there are in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:51:41       John spot 12. What? No, I don't know. I'm still going to ask you what you want to just not to put you on the spot. How many, how many? Seven billion people in the world? I would guess there would be somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion Jews. A billion. Uh, Jamie, you want to take $500? Million maybe. I'm going to get. I'm going to take a very conservative guests. I'm gonna. Change it to 500 million. I'm so glad that we did this. You're going to be shocked how many there is somewhere between 13 to 15 million Jews. That is more than that in New York. Now you're out of your fucking mind. I'll just look it up. Shut the off. Skype talking crazy. He's an agent. Let let, let. I'm a Zionist shell. Let, let, let Jamie now do his little google magic. Thirteen to $15. Million. $50. Million.

Speaker 3:          00:52:24       There's more idiots in America than there are Jews and that's only an Arkansas. I'm sorry guys. I'm just going. Is that really it? Well, think about how many Nobel Prize winners are Jews and 25 to 30 percent. It's incredible, right? And that, that, by the way, some people will say there is a genetic element, but even if here we go, what do we got? Fourteen dollars million. 200,000. Between 30 and $50 million. That's perfectly accurate. What is the enlarged? What does that mean? The world most? The most. The largest number of possibles. 20 million. You know that's like given I've never seen 20 million. It's usually the highest I've seen is 16 million. It says core Jewish and and large Jewish. What does that like dudes will get converted because their wife makes him. I don't know, my uncle did that, but by, by, by strict, by strictly conversion allows that would not be allowed and not allowed to convert for ulterior motives.

Speaker 3:          00:53:20       What? Alternative motives? He wants to be spiritual. It's a spiritual awakening. Well, went through the whole process. He went to Hebrew school. The whole process has to be for no ulterior motive. It can't be because my wife would not marry me otherwise, but I think he did it because she wanted him to do and then he decided to do it because it was what, you know. I mean, I get it. But anyway, let's go back. So there are, there are about 13 to 15 million Jews. There are one point 6 billion Muslims, one fifth of humanity to every one Jew, there's 100 Muslim. Which ideology is more successful based on propagation, Islam, or Judaism. Right. Now, why is that? Well, take for example, conversion laws for, as you said about. Was it your cousin? No, my uncle, my uncle. Uh, in the way that he did it, as you said, it's a very assiduous process.

Speaker 3:          00:54:16       It takes a long time before and as a matter of fact, the rabbis are supposed to try to dissuade you from converting to Judaism because that in a sense tests your faith, your desire to change an Islam. Do you know what you have to do to convert? What? I won't say it because if I actually say it in Arabic, that converted converted and therefore if I leave it, but basically you just have to say the Shahada, which it's like the. I testify, wow. It's a once one sentence and then that's it. Boom ran. If you leave your dead in Judaism, there isn't that. How about laws? Laws for marriage. A Muslim man can marry up to four women including non Muslim women and convert them, but a Muslim woman cannot do the other way around, so the whole structure of Islam is built on the propagation of the belief system, so just by that, which one is going to be more dangerous?

Speaker 3:          00:55:10       One is a proselytizing religion. The other one you're not allowed to in Judaism to proselytize, you're not supposed to try to convert others and Islam is to proselytize. You have to now in different countries, they'll do it in different ways. In the West where they are in the minority, they'll do it through interfaith exchanges, but the interfaith exchanges are always the Muslim telling the non Muslim how great our religion is and why you should convert. It's never. It's never given. Take a. So just going back to your early point about Israel and so on. Yes, of course. Undoubtedly there are some Israelis that do very bad things to their non Jewish brothers. No question. But when we're talking about existential threats to our western ways, you and I probably don't stay up worrying about radical Jews. No, no, don't. Um, I wonder what it is about people that makes us so susceptible to ideological thinking and still, and whether or not it's ever expungeable you know, whether or not it's ever something that we can eradicate from the thought process. It just seems inherent to being a person. So much so that I recognize it in myself.

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       Like, here's a perfect example. I ran into a guy just a few days ago and he was, he said hello to me. And then he explained to me that he trains Jujitsu with the Machados and immediately we were like brothers because that's my lineage, right? So it's like, oh, what's up man? Like immediately. And I'm like, that is so weird. It's so weird. You know, like I, I understand like when I talk to someone like how long you train? Twelve years. Oh, okay. So you understand me and I understand you. Uh, where do you, where do you train Machado's Oh, we come from the same thing. Oh, we're like, Bro, this is a weird thing. Like I'd give that guy a ride. I don't even know him. You know what I mean? But that's, that's the case with religion. That's the case with, with many things. It's the case with ethnic ethnicities. Oftentimes with even with state pride, like we branch off into groups and we have micro groups and macro groups and it gets real weird when we do this, but we all do it.

Speaker 4:          00:57:23       So to speak exactly about this ever granular way to compare it to compartmentalize us versus them. Let me mention the Hasidic. Oh yeah, please do. Because the reason I, the reason that's a good segue is because I actually raised it with him on the plane. I used to live in an area in Montreal called Mall for the Montreal is out there. They'll know where it is, where there are a lot of acidic Jews, so now you would think that within this very small group of people called Jews within an even smaller group of people called Hasidic Orthodox Jews, once you're an Orthodox Jew, you're an Orthodox Jew. No, on this side of the street are the Polish Orthodox Jews on this side of the street are the Hungarian Orthodox Jews and I wouldn't be caught dead marrying my daughter to those heathen pigs from the other side of the street.

Speaker 4:          00:58:16       So in other words, our ability to create a US versus them distinctions, as you said is, is infinite. That's what, by the way, I hate most about religion and not only Islam, right? Certainly every abrahamic religion has a very clear delineation between us and them. Uh, if we are Christians, we're going to have in the rest of you who haven't accepted Jesus are going to hell if you are Jewish, they are the Jews and they are the goals, right? Then the gentiles. If you are Muslim, of course there are US Muslim believers and all of you could fought, right? And so it's an inherent part of Abrahamic faith to play on this very innate mechanism of tribalism. US versus them. It's grotesque. And it's also what happened in Iraq when we

Speaker 5:          00:59:01       got rid of Saddam Hussein, it created a civil war between two rival factions of Islam, Shia and the Sunni, which most people had no idea that was even a situation over there.

Speaker 4:          00:59:11       Exactly. Exactly. But should we, you want to talk? So I was very interested in asking him things that I actually thought about studying scientifically as part of my research. So one of the things that I study as you know, is, well, I apply evolutionary psychology, all sorts of things. One of which is mating preferences. You know, are there certain mating preferences that are universally true irrespective of culture. Right? And the answer of course is yes. So whether you go to the Animal Momo tribe in Brazil, a closed society, or you go walk around in La, they are certain things that men will look for in women and other things that women will look for. And men that tend to be universal's for clear evolutionary reasons. So I was interested at one point in studying the mating preferences of the Hasidic community. Again, the idea being that here you're taking a community that culturally and religiously is very close where the cultural and religious brainwashing is very, very strong.

Speaker 4:          01:00:08       And in this moment is movement that you're making with your hands. Does that represent the sheet with the hole in it as you're doing this thing? Keeps doing this thing with your hand? Must Be. It must be a subconscious thing. Yes. Is that a real. I don't know if it's real. I'm adding her. Might be the ostrich thing. It must be. Maybe it's a, it's a find out if we're talking about explaining what we're talking about, the idea, the idea is that when a hasidic couple has sex, they have a sheet between them where they make a hole where the genitalia goes and that's how you get it all. That's what I thought. Why you kept doing that. Maybe it was a freudian thing. Uh, and so my idea was at one point is to see if I can get access to the Hasidic community, which will probably not be easy to get into the Hasidic community and ask them about their mating preferences.

Speaker 4:          01:00:56       And so it was a small idea I had over an afternoon and then kind of dropped it and moved on to other things. But here I was sitting with a couple of hesitant couple and I thought, okay, I can't do a scientific study, but at least I could come up with some anecdotes to discuss. And so I actually asked them things like, uh, you know, can you, can we talk about some meeting preferences that take place within the Hasidic community? And there were some really incredible insights that came out. So for example, the Wa, the wife said that one of the attributes that she absolutely was looking for an it perspective made was that he be taller than her. Okay. And it turns out that this is the, this is called assortative mating. Birds of a feather flock together. So if you look at naturally occurring couples, it is almost never the case that the woman is taller than the man.

Speaker 4:          01:01:42       There was actually a study done with 720 couples as single couple. The woman was taller than the men. So here's an example of a very basic physical desire and this case, I just need the map not not to be tall, just taller than me. Right. That was replicating in a completely different context. And the Hasidic community, I even asked them about things like, well, we'll a hasidic woman ever look at a non Hasidic guy that's walking down the street of bad boy that has tattoos and greased back here and you know, the swimmer's body and desire him or has the cultural

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       and religious brainwashing been so great that her eyes are shut off to these possibilities? And she actually said that. No, I mean the bottom line as Eo Wilson said, the jeans hold culture on a leash. In other words, no matter how much cultural and religious brainwashing you have, if you scratch far enough, you'll get the same human nature. And that's what I basically got from my conversation with them. That's a fascinating way of describing it. The genes hold culture, lead shot, Mike. Well that's great. That's the o Wilson. That's a perfect way of saying it. That's a nice. Every now and then you hear a phrase and you're like, ah, yeah, yeah. He's, he's, you know, I wish you could get him on your show. I'm not sure if he's now probably 85. Do you know who Eo Wilson is? No, I do not. So eo Wilson is a very famous, a scientist at Harvard.

Speaker 3:          01:03:13       I've heard the name, I just don't know. Yeah, he's amazing. He's a by training. He's an entomologist, a insect scientist. He specifically studies, uh, the social social ants basically. And so he looks at things like reciprocal altruism, kin selection, all of these mechanisms of altruism in the context of b. here's another quote that he has that I love. Communism slash socialism, great system, wrong species. What he's basically saying is that that political system of we're all equal under communism is a great idea, but it applies to social ants that doesn't apply to humans. Yeah. So he's got these wonderful pithy quotes. I wish, I mean I know that Robert Sapolsky is great, but if Robert Sapolsky is great, you need to get Eo Wilson on this podcast and. Well if it's possible I'll look into it. Where did you say he is? He's at Harvard. Harvard. So I'd probably have to come to him.

Speaker 3:          01:04:10       Product Daddy travels a lot at this stage. It was probably, well I'd be willing. I'm going to be back there eventually, I'm sure. So how often do you go back to Boston? Well I haven't been in awhile. I'm going to try and get there in the spring. I'm thinking about filming my next Netflix special there was before I started. Right, okay. Trying to figure it out. It's either going to be there here. I think. Very nice. Those was my two options. Boston or California? Very nice. Seven figure either my current or former. Right, right. I don't know. But um, so when you talk to this guy for four plus hours, um, and my, my wife was pissed by the way. Why? Because you didn't talk to her because she felt ignored. She felt like she was getting bored and she have to take care of the kids while I was having this one is my fight.

Speaker 3:          01:04:56       I thought later winter it had been wonderful if we could have taped it and I could have released this conversation on my show. Oh yeah. Because it was so honest to keep in touch with this guy and so we, we exchange actually asked him permission. I'm, I didn't mention that. I mentioned. I said, would you mind, I'm going on this very popular showed would you? He goes, no, no, go ahead and feel free. And so it would be cool to get you guys together and moderate. Yeah, that'd be cool. That would be cool. Well, now, um, it was an amicable conversation and I really pushed him very politely. Um, so at one point I said to him, you know, what would be the evidence that you would need to see to have any questioning of your faith and his answer, which is a classic argument from the, I don't know if you know the term God of the gaps.

Speaker 3:          01:05:44       Are you familiar with that? So God of the gaps is basically at one point when we didn't know much in science, God could be found explaining everything right? Why does it happen? Well, God does it right now. We find out that there is a very clear material explanation for for a lightening. So now that's often how God goes and hide somewhere else and now he constantly finds the small gaps where science hasn't yet been able to uncover an explanation and he hides there. That's called the god of the gaps argument, and so he used the granddaddy of God, of the guy. He goes, if you take me back to the Big Bang and you show me that there was no god at that point, then I'm willing to renounce my faith to which I answered. Even if I were able to do that, you would still find a way to finagle your way into justifying your belief.

Speaker 3:          01:06:36       In other words, there is no amount of evidence that I could ever provide you that would shake your foundation. So we really got into some heavy stuff. By the way, that's one of the differences between, I think in his case he's an extremist Jew in the sense that he is the most practicing of Jews. Well, how come we could have this very, very difficult conversation and leave at the end shaking hands both richer for it and no one's heads come off. Well, you were also a Jew though. I mean, did it help? I mean, what if he had that conversation with a Muslim? Don't you think that maybe maybe there's more intention but nobody's head would be at least the John United Airlines. Right? My point is that I think part of Jewish tradition, even when you, for example, go to the yeshiva to study, say mood, is that there is this mechanism of we constantly argue about everything.

Speaker 3:          01:07:26       Nothing is settled. We have to debate over everything, so you have to have that openness of spirit to have your ideas question and I think that if already Islam we're open to that a bit more than maybe it would be in a better place. I've heard some of the most compelling arguments against the big bang from religious people and what? Give me some of those, the argument against it is you are not willing to believe that there is a creator, that there is some sort of a system that was put in place by a much higher power beyond what we can describe, but you're willing to believe that everything came out of nothing, right? Something smaller than the head of a pin for some reason that no one's ever figured out. And the only evidence that we have is the radio wave echoes of this event, right?

Speaker 3:          01:08:10       So this is A. I mean, I've heard similar arguments. I mean Thomas is an acquaintance, is the guy who always argued, I think in the twelfth century, but the first mover that you could always go back and say at time zero. What started that? What started the, uh, I don't think you could ever really a ultimately shake somebody foundations, right? There's no amount of money. Forget about the idea of shaking someone's belief system. It is odd that we're all willing to believe the most insane version of the creation of the universe ever without a doubt, like every person of science, people that believe in genes and atoms and subatomic particles and corks and glue ons, and they believe that at one point in time there was something that was smaller than the head of a pin that became the infinite space that we see in front of us that's constantly expanding and so infant that.

Speaker 3:          01:09:06       One of the things that Lawrence Krauss really, really fucked my mind up when he was here. He was explaining to me that when we're seeing the universe and we're talking about 13 point 7 billion years or whatever it is you're seeing as it was. Well, yes, not just seeing it as it was, but he said you're only seeing the observable universe because the universe itself is moving faster than the light that you see from it. So it's entirely possible that it goes back far further than that. You just can't see it. Right. And you'll listen to Richard Dawkins, the guy that we talked about earlier about selfish gene has a wonderful concept. It's called middle world. Have you heard this before? No, but I read it. Or jrr Tolkien's middle earth. Is that. Oh, that's a load of ranks. Okay. I'm not, I'm not too familiar with that stuff, but he talks about middle world.

Speaker 3:          01:10:00       The idea being that our brains evolved to understand phenomena at a level that our brain interacts with. Right. He caused that middle world so that which is that the cosmological level right at the Lawrence Krauss level of cosmology or at the national level, quantum, quantum physics. It's so esoteric that our brains haven't evolved to understand phenomena at that level. Right. So in a sense, it's counter intuitive for us to even do that. I mean, think about it when you and I are actually most physicists when they study things at those levels, they will tell you that this stuff is so esoteric. Right? Richard Fineman the very famous physicist, but I said, you know, if you, if you, if you think you understand quantum physics, you don't understand quantum physics or something to that effect, that it is so esoteric and difficult for human brains to understand things at that level, small or very big so, but that not withstanding, that doesn't mean that scientists succumb to belief just like religious people do because scientists have epistemic humility, which basically means what I'm always willing to see data if Rogan tomorrow

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       she comes to me with data showing that the mechanisms of evolution as an unstated starting with Darwin are wrong. Then I would be a dishonest scientist to not revise my beliefs in light of Joe Rogan's evidence. So in other words, scientists are always open. It's always provisional knowledge. It's, it's only the best that we have now. Whereas in religion it's revealed truth. It is true because it is true because it's in my book because it's true. So in a sense, religious people are epistemologically hottie they're arrogant because nothing could change their opinions. Whereas science has changed your opinions every day. So in that sense, I don't think we're both succumbing to belief systems now. I'm not necessarily saying that I'm not, and I'm not equating them, I'm not saying they're equal, but it is an odd belief and not necessarily even belief, for lack of a better word, but it's an odd, it's an odd concept that because we know that this exists and because we have some sort of residual trace of an explosion a long time ago, you can try and it's mind blowing.

Speaker 2:          01:12:20       I mean, I, I probably just as a layperson in physics, uh, probably one percent of what I see in a national geographic on physics I can even remotely understand, right? Because it just seems so. And it's not as though I'm not capable of complex thought, but it's just so difficult for human minds. You know, what does it mean? 16 dollars, billion light years away, right? I mean, for the light to travel for $16, billion light years, that's the envelope. I mean, how do you understand these kinds of. It's too big. And then the concept of life and death is also luck. Our physical limitations because we know that we live and die and we know that the sun is going to burn out and we know that life on earth lives and dies and things, so we, we impose these physical restrictions on the very universe itself when in fact it might be some constant process of expanding and contracting.

Speaker 2:          01:13:12       That's one of the most disturbing ideas is that the universe is gonna expand infinitely and then contract infinitely and then do it all over again. So that, I mean, I don't know if this is even a correct theory. I don't know if maybe it's been disputed, but I had read once that there was a theory that the universe contracts to some insanely infinite position and then retracts down to the head of a pin again. Right. And then the whole big bang is this continual process that might take, you know, a hundred trillion years or something insane. I don't know. I don't know if you understand one percent. I understand zero, zero, zero point one. I actually had this physicist on my show. He might be a fun guy to have on your show. Uh, his name is Lee Smolin a, he's a guy who produced. The way that I discovered his work is that I was looking for every possible field that I could think of where evolutionary theory has been infused into field. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       So for example, in my case, I apply evolutionary psychology and consumer behavior. You could study criminal criminality from an evolutionary perspective. You can study medicine. And so I was trying to come up with a table that listed all of the various scientific disciplines where evolutionary principles have made headway and the field at the highest level. Remember we were talking about middle world and the cosmos. He argued that the process of natural selection operates at the cosmological level where this grand set of universes are being selected. In other words, in the same way that we select genes, right? Some jeans get selected and others die out. That that mechanism, sort of a cosmological natural selection at the cosmological level. And so that's how I first this. It is so mind blowing. It is so esoteric. It's so difficult to so nonpalpable that it, it, it borders on taking mushrooms or psychedelics that that's how mind blowing.

Speaker 5:          01:15:12       So you should. Maybe you should check out our chat on my show is really cool guy. You might enjoy them. Well, it is fascinating. We think of how much the universe, how many possibilities exist in the universe, right? I mean how many different source systems? Just hundreds of billions just in this galaxy. One of hundreds of billions of gallons. It's almost like for our little tiny world, so when we try to look at it in terms of the big picture, we're not capable. We don't have enough processing power. We don't have enough hard drive space. We can't take all of these points of data and bring them into our head and consider them, but it's entirely possible that everything you see in the world in terms of competition, everything you see in the human world in terms of competition, natural selection, and the constant and never ending desire for innovation, for novelty, for new things.

Speaker 5:          01:16:07       We have this constant desire to improve upon every single thing that we've ever done. No one ever looks at like a car, I mean, and says this is the best car ever, will not be improved upon. We're done. We don't need to make cars anymore. Right? They always want to come up with something that has better airbags, faster, zero to 60, more protection for the passenger, automated controls, you know you can sit back and sleep while your car drives you to work. There's all these things that we just take for granted, but they're always moving in the direction of improvement and you could do that with life on earth. You go back to single celled organisms which become multi celled organisms and we always look at it like, oh, that's just a coincidence and it's dinosaurs, and then it becomes mammos and then it becomes humans. Then it becomes air plane riding, cell phone using video, having. You know what I mean? It just gets more and more complex, but we just, oh, that's just coincidence. Is it? Or is it moving in this constant state of improvement until we create an artificial

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       being that can accelerate things far, far faster than our biological limitations are capable of doing it. So I'm not sure if this is where you want to go, but as you, as you were describing this sort of quest for improvement, one of the, uh, one of the threats of that reflects, or one of the dangers of that reflex is precisely how totalitarian ideologies develop where they argued that our current state of the world is faulty. And if only you implement our ideology, the shoe, it could be communism. It could be, it could be perfect. Then it could be perfect socialism. Exactly. So, so there is a way by which we could reach that utopia if only you adhere to our ideology. So there's a real danger in sort of succumbing to that. And by the way, that's one of the. I'm reading right now, a book by William Gardner who might come on my show.

Speaker 4:          01:18:05       He's a, I think a political scientist. His book is called the great divide where he actually lays out some of the sort of fundamental, foundational differences between Liberals and conservatives in terms of their world views and how because of the starting positions being sold, different, having no overlap between them, the venn diagrams don't overlap. That's why you ended up speaking over each other without being able to find common grounds. So one of these differences is that an I, I described something similar using different terms. A lot of the quote, liberals and progressives view our brain as being blank slates, right? It's infinitely malleable and so if you see differences between people, it can't be because there was a starting point difference. Michael Jordan was not innately likely to be better than you in basketball. There were some environmental conditions that lead Michael Jordan to become who he is and not get sad to be the best nba player ever.

Speaker 4:          01:19:06       And if only we can find the appropriate social intervention strategies, then we could all have equality of outcomes. And so that is a faulty understanding of human nature because human nature, as you of course, you know, it's really an interaction of our biology and our environment. But so much of the welfare state is based on this idea that no, we need more of your tax money so that we could implement a social engineering program so that we could reach that utopia where we're all equal outcome. And frankly I think that that's complete nonsense. It is fascinating that people seek comfort in communism and socialism for that very reason. Like they almost are trying to slow down the competition that they can't win. Right? Exactly. Yeah, I see it by the way, by my university. So in Canada there's a very sort of social welfare states and Quebec, the province where I live is sort of socialist on welfare, on steroids.

Speaker 4:          01:20:03       And so in the context of the university's, every, all of the metrics of reward are removed so that we can have equality of outcomes. And the way that you instantiate that is through, uh, the unions, right? So there's a very powerful union that ensures that all professors are roughly treated equally because we're all social ads. There's a queen bee and then the rest of us are all equal, but of course humans are not equal. Some are smarter, some work harder, some are more apathetic, some are honest, some are cheaters. And so this idea of constantly having to have some external agent managed the process so that we could all be equal to me is grotesque. And it goes back to I think probably our first conversation you and I had when I was saying that, you know, I would love to eventually come through southern California because at least in the United States, the society has been less progressive dies by the social welfare idea.

Speaker 4:          01:20:56       Of course the Democrats are more so than the Republicans. But as a general rule, Canada is basically pure social welfare. We're all equal. And of course Justin Trudeau is certainly trying to push that idea even more. He's too handsome. That's that guy's problem he's trying to make up for the fact that it's beautiful and he's trying to be super sweet to everybody. That's what's going on up there. Did you hear about the. I just put up a clip a few days ago about the Ahmad. How their case do you know that is. No, actually a few people tweeted, oh, please talk to Joe Rogan about this. Uh, so all my, how that is, uh, uh, a Muslim guy whose family had become Canadian citizens, but the father had taken them away. I think the Pakistan at one point until Afghanistan in another. Uh, and at one point they were living in Bali bomb territory.

Speaker 4:          01:21:46       This is 2002 I think. And the US military had engaged in some firefight, a, at one point they even lived in the compound of bin Ladin. So these were really real apple Pie Canadian folks. And all my father who was 15 years old apparently threw a grenade engaged in a firefight, killed one a US soldier, and I think blind that his second one, he was taken to Guantanamo Bay as a 15 year old, spent many years there. He was a military tribunal. US Guantanamo tribunals gave him a symbolic sentence of 40 years. But it was symbolic in that I think it was only going to be a h here. They agreed on a plea deal of eight years. Okay. Then he was extradited to Canada very quickly after that he was released because you already served quite a few years in Guantanamo and then he filed a lawsuit against the Canadian government for not having protected his Canadian charter rights because he was a child soldier and so on.

Speaker 4:          01:22:50       And he just settled on a 10 point $5,000,000 settlement and an official apology by the Canadian government. Uh, and then some, most people were outraged. Most Canadians are outraged. But then you should see the comments and some of my, on my youtube channel, you know, what kind of pig are you talking to me that I would not understand that this was an innocent child soldier who. Yeah, because most of us are usually hanging around when we were 15 and the compound of the law than, and lobbing bombs at incoming marines. You know, it's a very Canadian apple pie thing to do. So again, the reflex is not to be outraged at my taxpayers are funding this guy now in a 10 point $5,000,000 settlement. I'm a pig. I'm a racist pig for not understanding that this was just an innocent child soldier at the wrong place at the wrong time.

Speaker 5:          01:23:41       Okay, let's look at two different things. One, the amount of money they gave him. Yeah. It's kind of crazy that your tax dollars go to that, but let's look at the 15 year old kid, right? What do you expect and what could possibly be done to dissuade him from following this path? He's living in bin Laden's compound. You're talking about someone who's vulnerable to ideology. Fifty year old men are vulnerable to ideology. What about a 15 year old child? Like I don't know how much blame you can put on a kid now when it comes to throwing a bomb at someone and taking the life of another human being. Well, there's gotta be a lot of circumstances involved in that. I would like to know what they are before I think about any judgment whatsoever because I don't know. Were they shooting at him? Were they shooting at someone he knew someone who knew getting murdered by a US soldier. Was he actively engaged in some sort of military training and considering becoming, becoming a militant? I don't know. 10 is a baby.

Speaker 4:          01:24:45       I mean yes and no. Right? I mean you can. You can drive a car at 16 and Quebec. You can start driving drivers. Yeah. At 15. Is that what is my team? Yeah, my, my, my mother and father, my mother, my father was 19. My mother was almost 16 when they got married. So you can procreate and have a child that you don't understand the.

Speaker 5:          01:25:05       Yeah, but let's be real about physiologically your frontal cortex isn't even formed until you're 25. When you're 15 years old, you're not capable of making like especially living in a war zone, you're not capable of making moral and ethical judgements above and beyond the ideology that you're being raised.

Speaker 4:          01:25:23       Fair enough. I mean, I, I, I agree that most of us in that situation may not have been able to extricate ourselves from that. And what I'm going to say next doesn't necessarily support the outrage, but it gives it greater context. He does come from a family if you later, if you check when we get off the air, the sort of the, the cues of this family, they don't seem as though they are assimilating very nicely within Canadian value system. In other words, for most Canadians, the reflex of taking this guy who seems to be quite resistant to liberty and modernity freedoms

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       and rewarding him with 10 point $5,000,000, by the way, this 10 point five Canadian. So it's probably $30 American at this point. The doctor thought we. You guys were real similar. We were a few years ago. We were at par and I think now we're at one point three. So we're about 20, 25, 30 percent less than you. So that's how it was when I was a. When I first used to go up to Montreal, like in the nineties at the par or, or different. Different the way it is. So you're saying now the American dollar went far longer up there. That's right, yeah. It's, it's heading back towards that now and not at, not not to the worst. The worst I've ever seen. It was when we lived in California in 2001 to 2003. At one point it was points 64 or 65. Now it's at about point 75, so it's not the worst that it's ever been, but we're heading in that direction.

Speaker 3:          01:26:55       But since we're talking about kind of the, maybe you'd like to talk about a, and I know that you've had Jordan Peterson on. Did you follow both of our respective, uh, uh, testimonies in front of the Canadian Senate regarding Bill 16 and you know, I've read a lot of Jordan stuff on that. I've seen him speak a lot and I've seen, I saw that one conversation that he had on television in Canada with some person who is a professor in gender studies who is ambiguously sexual. I don't know what they are, whether it's a guy or a girl or a transgender woman to man, this is what it seemed to be, right? Yes. And the one who was saying that there's no that gender, there was no biological difference between men and women. Yes. Which is just fucking horseshit. I mean that is just like one plus one is not too.

Speaker 3:          01:27:43       I mean it really is. There's obviously a broad spectrum of variation and both sexes and they kind of coalesce in the middle somewhere with some. Well, what's amazing is that I've been fighting this battle and academia precisely because of what I do, which is introduce evolutionary psychology and the social sciences. So these types of conversations, these ludicrous conversations I've been experiencing them for for much of my scientific career. What's extraordinary at this point is that some of this nonsense is now becoming law in Canada. So to kind of give you the background to what happened. So I was invited both speaking by the Canadian Senate, then also to give a talk in front of parliament on Parliament Hill, but the Canadian Senate, the part was built [inaudible], which is a bill that seeks to incorporate gender identity and gender expression under the rubric of hate crimes. Right? So in the same way that I can discriminate against you for your religion or your race or your ethnicity, I can't discriminate against you because of your gender identity or gender expression, because then that would be a hate crime. And so I appeared in front of the Canadian Senate to simply say that while of course everybody's person who should be respected and we're all equal under the law, the manner by which the bill was a table, the

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       way it was written, it was so vague as as it for it to be dangerous. And so I gave examples. So let me just mentioned a few here for your viewers. So I said, look, Harvard University, their lgbtq office, came out with a pamphlet that said that the idea of promulgating, and I'm going to quote fixed binaries and biological essentialism, close quote, fixed binaries, means male, female, biological, essentialism, is to argue that anything is biological. So the idea of a gay thing, fixed binaries and biological essentialism is a form of transphobic, systemic violence. This is not violence. Violence is, and it's not metaphorical. It's not allegorical. It's not bad. I mean violence in quotes, it is a form of Transphobia, but specifically systemic violence, transphobia know, how do they define violence because there's a very specific definition of violence. While I don't know how they defined it in the general sense, I think it's the desire to come up with ever broadening definitions of violence so that any, any trans question that you commit could fit under that rubric.

Speaker 4:          01:30:13       Even microaggression, microaggression is a form of violence, right? So, so then I went in front of the Canadian Senate. Not, I'm not you, you could watch this later. Uh, it's on my channel. I said, look, every single thing that I teach in my courses would constitute transphobic systemic violence based on that sort of standard, right? It sound scientific data. Exactly. So if I get up and say, here is how sexual selection works, right? Sexual selection is the mechanism that explains how sex specific traits evolve. Well, sex specific traits evolve. You recognize that there is male and there's female. Here's why. Human males are likely to have been sexually selected to be more risk takers. Right? Well, by engaging in that conversation, I would be promulgating fixed binaries and biological essentialism, transphobic, transphobic violence because a transgendered student can come up to me and say, look, professor, you've thought your core, I've listened to your course 13 weeks.

Speaker 4:          01:31:14       You talked about evolve mating preferences on. Not once did you talk about the non-gender, the non binary, that gender fluid, the other kid, and so on. Uh, that's marginalized me. That's excluded me. Uh, you're being biased, you're being prejudicial. So I tried to argue that most of the liberal senators either laughed and scoffed. One of them accused me of being pro genocide. This is on record and the Canadian Senate. So a scientist. What's this person's name? I think Senator Joel, but I, I started pushing the which has now become maybe a, an internet. You have a conversation with them and we did it in there. So we, the conversation we had was promoting genocide. Someone said, well, how do you respond to that when someone says that? So that my response, which you could, I'm paraphrasing, he says, well, I'm not sure that given the fact that I escape execution in Lebanon because of my Jewish heritage, that I need to be lectured about a genocide, and that sort of took them back.

Speaker 4:          01:32:13       Now apparently later and I didn't see this apparently later, he wanted to retract some of these comments and apologize for them. I don't know if you are not. How did they justify genocide? Like what? That's what happens when you have your brain parenthesized by ostrich parasitic syndrome. How does, how is it okay to study all of these behavior patterns in aunts and monkeys and dogs and what have you, but you can't with human beings because if you do with human being somehow or another, anything that you find about generalized behavior patterns or specific sexual preferences that somehow or another marginalizes or in some way diminishes how another person is living their life to the point where it becomes violence. So there's actually a term for what you just asked. It's called the human reticence effect and simply put, a lot of people are perfectly happy to use evolutionary arguments to explain the behavior of the salamander, the Hyena, the mosquito, the dog, but if you use the exact same evolutionary principle to explain human phenomena, then suddenly it's no go.

Speaker 4:          01:33:20       Why is that? Do you think? It's because we're aspiring to something better. I think it's because people succumb to wrongly, so to the idea of biological determinism, they think that if you. If you call up and explaining a phenomenon, a biological principle, that means you are doing to your biology. It's a fatalistic thing, which of course is nonsense because there's no such thing as biological determinism because most of the things that are triggered by our biology have to be triggered by interacting with the environment. Right? Genes are turned on or off as a function of environmental inputs and outputs, so the idea of biological determinism is false worry. Much of what we do, it's called the interaction as viewpoint. Much of who we are as an interaction of our genes and our environments, but for most people there is something vulgar about reducing the richness of the human condition to our biology.

Speaker 4:          01:34:16       It just feels wrong. This explains the behavior of the Hyena, but we are above that. We are cultural animals. We are prone to conditioning and socialization and higher order cognition. So you could even take evolutionary biologists. So these are people who are trained in evolutionary biology. They will commit this error. I mean that's breathtaking, right? So the classic example is a guy who is otherwise an utter buffoon. His name is Ed Meyers, a fifth through eighth academic. And I say this because not to denigrate him, but by zed. That's the letter z Canadian. So pz Myers in his claim to fame is he's got a very, and hats off to him. He's got an incredibly popular scientific, a blog called fire wrangler, which you know, gets $100, million views or something. So he's done very well for himself, but he's the guy who is perfectly happy to use evolutionary principles to explain the behavior of the mating behavior.

Speaker 4:          01:35:18       Of the salamander, but if I come along as an evolutionary psychologist and use the exact same principle, the exact same logical structure to explain human behavior, well, what's this guy doing with this bullshit evolutionary psychology stuff that's not set that pseudo science right, and the the reflex he has that is because to somehow explain it for the salamander, make sense? It's national geographic, but humans, they don't. They're not prone to biology and I'll just give you two other examples. Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Lewington, who were very, very famous. Harvard evolutionists also despised evolutionary psychology, but for other reasons they were avowed Marxists. They came sort of from the hippie generation is of the market. They're probably about 20 years older than me. Well, one of the announced passed away, Stephen Jay Gould is that, but they were guys who thought that if evolutionary psychology is right, then they're Marxists. Bullshit ideologies would be wrong.

Speaker 4:          01:36:14       So they were strong anti evolutionary psychology folks, even though all of their training suggested that they should be for it. So they are the guys, by the way, who used to Eo Wilson I mentioned earlier. So eo Wilson. The social ads guy wrote a book called a sociobiology in 1975 where he explained how evolutionary theory could explain behavior across all sorts of animals. Everybody was happy with the book and one of the last chapters, he applies all these principles to the human condition. He became persona non grata. He became a Nazi. He couldn't go anywhere to give a talk without being shouted down. Not unlike how you're seeing Milo today being shouted down. Well, Eo Wilson went through those culture wars 30 years ago because evolutionary psychology was attacking the pet political ideologies of his colleagues at Harvard.

Speaker 5:          01:37:06       I don't know if Milo's a valid comparison. I think Jordan Peterson better comparison. Fair enough. Because Milo is obviously a provocateur, 1 trillion on purpose. What do you put tea? Instead of pointing the finger at individuals? I wouldn't like to try to figure out. Obviously we're not going to, but let's discuss it. Sure. What? What is the motivation? Why do people resist these ideas of looking at the data of human interaction and genetics and sexual preference? Why do they resist examining these factors? Like what is it about and what is it about people that like that guy that you're talking about that wants to point at you for examining these factors and call you horrific names and just for looking at actual provable data data that you can mean you could show it, you

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       could do. It's reviewed. You can what? What is? What's the motivation is it's ultimately ego driven. So in the case of those Harvard folks, they are committed Marxists, right? If evolutionary psychology is right, therefore my pet political ideology is wrong, therefore I have to shoot it. That's one example. Let's, let's do a. suppose I am a overweight woman. Okay, and I don't. I don't get much action on the mating market. One of two things can happen. I could either believe that there is an evolved preference that men have for certain universal standards of beauty. Or I could go for the much more a comforting message, which is that these beauty standards are arbitrary, sexist, patriarchal standards, and if only men would stop being shallow and buying into these Hollywood images than myself, this beautiful 800 pound woman would be getting all the action in the world.

Speaker 4:          01:39:00       So it's nothing wrong with me. It's that there are outside forces that are causing these arbitrary preferences to arise. Right? Naomi Wolf wrote a book and the early nineties, uh, the beauty myth that sold millions of copies where she argued that there is no such thing as universal standards of beauty. It's all a beauty myth. It's the patriarchy that imposes these beauty myths on women to attack their sense of self. Well, if I'm a woman who doesn't score well, even if I'm, if I'm a man, for example, and we know that women prefer men of high status, well, I could do one of two things. I could get out there and shake my butt and get the status right Joe Rogan. Nobody gave him all this stuff that you have. You have to work hard for all your success so that you could then hopefully do well on the mating market, uh, or I could say, you know what, these are all arbitrary standards.

Speaker 4:          01:39:51       I mean, and adjust world. My being a lazy, apathetic Beta male would just be as worthy of love. And so I think ultimately there is an element to biological based explanations that's unhopeful to most people, right? The idea that we could all be anything is a lot more hopeful and the idea that we could all be anything unconstrained by biology only exists in the recesses of ideologues. The world is not made up like that. Beautiful. People are more symmetric. Now. That doesn't mean that if you're not symmetric, you're doomed to a life of celibacy. But no, the fact that Brad Pitt Brad Pitt is, is considered handsome because he exhibits certain cues that women all around the world agree are beautiful. So to answer your question, there is something very non hopeful about buying. The idea that we are biological beings. It's a lot more comforting to know we are infinitely malleable and filthy social bubble because

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       then any of us could be anything given the right conditions. I could be the next lionelle messy that's hopeful and therefore I'd like to subscribe to that. I think there's absolutely something to what you're saying, but I think there's also this very strange and vague possibility that we are aspiring to a higher standard because we recognize that human beings are evolving and that we're moving into some strange place where we're. We're no longer just creatures of flesh and that this need to put people on this. Even playing field is. This is a part of this aspiration. I definitely think there's these influences and I definitely think there are these. There's a lot of people that look at beautiful people and they get upset. I mean there's a. there's a way that they do it where they feel that they're justified in being prejudice. Like they can see a guy like the rock for example, who's as big, handsome man as big burly man and they think that guy's a fucking idiot.

Speaker 5:          01:41:55       Immediately me and while that guy probably reads a lot, he's probably smart as hell, right, and he's obviously very ambitious so he can control his mind. Charismatic, he's very disciplined. He controls his mind far better than a lot of overweight people that would criticize him and call him a fool, but meanwhile they let their body rot to the state of decay, which is not an intellectual thing to do if you're looking at your body and like a as a finite resource and how do you manage that resource? Well, very poorly for eating, ring dings, drinking fucking soda and smoking cigarettes and then talking about the rock being an idiot. Right? I mean that's. These are obviously strom and exemptions, but I wonder if what we're doing with what's going on in Canada and this, this liberal social justice warrior approach to everybody being equal and if they're not, let's try to make them equal and if there's anybody that's superior to try to push them down and bring the Brown people up and I wonder if we're trying to achieve some sort of equilibrium, some sort of balance, some sort of, some sort of state where we're no longer just monkeys were no longer just creatures of, you know, I want to fuck her because she's got big tits.

Speaker 5:          01:43:08       These are base ideas. These are base instincts that it's fine if we observe them in Benobos, but we don't want to see them in Harvard educated kids. Right? So the male gaze becomes problematic, right? A man staring at a woman becomes a microaggression. Meanwhile, she's wearing almost nothing. She's got a short skirt on and painted toes and you want to look. You can't help yourself. The jeans come firing up. You must suppress those because we were eventually moving past the flesh and you are of the new generation. The new generation that will someday be neutered and there'll be some non binary expression of your humanity that exists as an Avatar and some virtual reality world that you'll be forced to subscribe

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       to when you, when you joined Yale, but by the way, that's when you talk about the male gaze. I'm not sure if we've discussed this on this show before, but it's precisely this type of thinking that causes the western feminists to view the Burka is liberating and the bikini as a patriarchal oppression. It's. It's exactly that, right? The to the extent that the male gaze as a form of visual rape, right, and that should be condemned. That should be stopped because it is a type of assault in quotes, right? The Burka. By removing that male gaze becomes liberating. Now, this is not an argument that I'm making up. This is, I've heard this argument. On the other hand, when a woman wears the Brazilian a Thong and you and I look at her and have the exact same predictable response that most men would have because it's an evolved response.

Speaker 4:          01:44:45       Well, that's, that's bad because we are part of the Patriarchy and we are succumbing to this rape urge, right? So this is so when I talk about ostrich parasitic syndrome, I don't just use it as a metaphor, it's genuinely the case that people's minds are becoming infected with such garbage that they're incapable to rationalize, to think would reason. And that's what I ended up doing most of the time. That's what Jordan Peterson ends up doing most of the time, which is we are committed to truth unencumbered by political correctness. Earlier you were saying, what would be some, you know, how can we get ourselves out of succumbing to this tribalism and so on. I think the only way you could do it, and I'm not saying that anybody can reach that level, is to simply be dedicated to the pursuit of truth. When I was on Sam Harris Show, uh, you know, earlier this year, about six, seven months ago, he asked me, is there any, a research question that you would not tackle in your, in your, in your scientific career that is too taboo?

Speaker 4:          01:45:46       And my answer was no. Right? As long as you address the question honestly and objectively, there is nothing that should be off limits, right? Because then it becomes very easy to say, well, sex differences, we shouldn't study that because then it will marginalize one sex or the other race differences. We shouldn't study them for the same reason. So on. That becomes forbidden knowledge. No, the highest ideal that any honest person should pursue is the pursuit of truth and certainly an intellectual. So No, don't be encumbered by political correctness. Just pursue the truth. And I think one of the reasons for that Jordan Peterson's message and my message has resonated now with a lot of people is because at least they see that we are ascribing to that ideal to the best of our abilities. What if that truth hurts your feelings? Fuck you're feeling. Oh, I'm triggered. I believe I used the f word was this podcast. I was an effect on people. Yeah, I think it's, um, you know, it's a bunch of different things going on all at once and

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       there's obviously some tribalism going on even amongst these social justice warriors. He's a virtue signaling people who are trying to get as much credit as much social justice warrior street credit as they can, like what happened with Bret Weinstein up in Evergreen college and when I had him on, I just read some recent thing where they're doubling down on their hate of him and you know, they, they're, they're accusing him of all of this by simply going on the Tucker Carlson show. Now, here's what's fascinating. Huffington post, which is a really left leaning establishment, right? I mean if any website is left leaning, it's Huffington Post. I mean I think they have some great articles. Don't get me wrong. It's not like I'm not critical of all their stuff, but it's very left leaning, like openly regard. They had a piece breaking down how preposterous these students are and the faculty and the president and what they have done to Bret Weinstein and criticized each step of it by showing a transcription of his conversation on the Tucker Carlson show, which lasted like five minutes I think.

Speaker 5:          01:48:07       And you know, they called Tucker Carlson alt right. Okay. I don't know. You redefining outright now, by the way, I've been called. All right. Dave Rubin and I are leaders of the ultra. That's amazing. We're leaders. We the actual leaders of the alt right. I wrote a tweet about this, like the fact that they can call Dave Rubin, who is a gay man who's married to a man who used to be on the young Turks who's Jewish, who is Jewish and I mean I guess I called him a progressive, but it progressive in the idea that he, he wants progress. I mean the real broad term of progressive progress, meaning equality for all but honest, honest about the approach, but I would consider him probably more of a libertarian bent if you wanted to get like political, which I guess I'm sort of in this sort of progressive slash libertarian left leaning thing, but I also believe in a lot of right things as well.

Speaker 5:          01:49:01       Like, you know, the. I think that competition is probably ultimately good. Right? And I think that blaming other people for your lack of success is really easy and it's something that people do all the time. But when you do that, if you look at things in that way, then you're diminishing the struggles that downtrodden people and minorities and the oppressed and all these different, uh, you know, small groups that have been somehow another marginalized there. You're diminishing their struggle, which is absolutely not the case. But there have been people that have emerged from those groups and done amazing things. But Oh, those are outliers and you can't hold people up to the standards of those outliers. And you know, the real problem is that the is stacked

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       in the favor of these white men who experienced white privilege. And what we really need to do is squash white men. By the way, I have, I have a theory about all this stuff. Well, this. So I called it collective Munchhausen. Oh, you've said this before. Please go. Go again though. I'd like this to stand alone. Thank you. So remember how earlier I said that the highest ideal should be the pursuit of the truth. Yeah. So the currency that I operate in is pursuing truth. Wherever that leads me a banker cares about the bottom line. How much money, how many Zeros there are in his bank, right? And my case. It's truth. Now in the social justice warriors currency, it's how much eagle strokes he or she gets by proclaiming unique victimhood status. Now, why do I call this collective Munchhausen? So in 2010, I had published a paper in a medical journal where I was looking at a specific form of Munchhausen Syndrome as a psychiatric condition where someone feigns illness to get attention, to get empathy, to get sympathy.

Speaker 3:          01:50:54       It's a real psychiatric condition. I know a lady who's got it. Is that right? Oh yeah. Okay. Uh, I later I will write a Munchausen Syndrome by proxy is a different situation where you try to get your ego stroked by harming someone else and then getting the rewards. So what does that mean? You are, for example, at biological mother who, who has this condition, you will harm your child, your biological child, so that then you could take him to the hospital and people say, Oh, poor you, you've got a sick alien child and so on. And then you get your your or orgiastic orgasmic strokes by getting that attention and that empathy, right? Or You could do it if you have a pet or sometimes with elderly parents, but usually it's your biological child. So I was writing a paper trying to explain this from an evolutionary perspective, how this pathology could arise, and so that's how the psychiatric syndrome wasn't in my radar.

Speaker 3:          01:51:54       And then as I started seeing all these social justice warriors navigating the world through a game of oppression, Olympics, where the highest goal you can achieve is to be declared the winner of the oppression Olympics game, right? It's not the pursuit of truth. It's not making the most money. It's can I be anointed as the guy with the greatest. And I call this collective Munchhausen because it becomes a form of Munchhausen, but at the collective level. Right? Let me give you another example as voting for Donald Trump. When Donald Trump won the election, just on my facebook page, private personal facebook page, I would see people outdoing each other almost as if it were satirical in terms of their collective Munchausen. I am a brown woman who was attending this university now that Donald Trump

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       has won. I'm afraid to go to classes. I mean, just think about how outrageous that sounds. I mean you may like or dislike Donald Trump. Do you genuinely believe that your ability to take classes and your bullshit college and main is going to be affected? You're going to experience personal safety because Donald Trump is setting up roadblocks so that he could create internment camps for all women of color so that they get gang raped. What is the fear that you have that you are literally right, but they're testifying they're testifying to and so it becomes this collective psychosis where the way that I win is by demonstrating that I am the biggest victim, and so that's what social justice warriors do, is that they have to win that game. And so there is no. So the Bret Weinstein example is those guys seeking to win those Olympics. How dare you say that? You could come on campus. Don't you know what kinds of victims we are and so on. It's, it's a, it's a complete departure from reason. It's grotesque. It's a psychiatric condition, it's, it's weird

Speaker 5:          01:53:52       prevalent. It is though, and how it's almost one of those things that you as a professor are not really allowed to discuss with the people that are exhibiting that behavior because then you're diminishing their fear, right? You're diminishing or marginalizing their, their own personal issues that they feel that they have.

Speaker 4:          01:54:12       Except except because I always can pull out my victimology card which usually outranks all of them because they're screaming while sitting at Wellesley paying $60,000 that they are marginalized. Whereas I say I'm not sure if I can be sympathetic because let me tell you my personal history. Well that's what, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:54:33       Did with that guy and I'm in the meeting when he accused you of genocide. He's not. You've hit them with braces. Exactly. Like suck it stupid. Exactly. And so now

Speaker 4:          01:54:42       by the way, sit. The only way I could improve my score as I have jokingly said, is if I self identify as a woman,

Speaker 5:          01:54:50       I'm transgendered. Would you shave though? If you self identified as a woman, why do you have to assume the appearance of a woman? I mean, if really appearances don't matter. Exactly. I mean if, if a woman with a penis. Well yeah, I mean this whole idea that beauty standards are bullshit and that are constructed by the patriarchy. Why can't you grow a big old Santa Claus? Beard steel. Still identify with a woman. I'm, I'm with you. Why can't you? Well, let's, let's set the trend. But where do we draw the line though? Because I have no problem with someone identifying as a woman. If you want to be a woman, that's fine. I don't care. But. Well, where. Where do we draw the line though? Where are you allowed? Where are you? How, how out there can you get before I'm allowed to go. Well, that guy might be fucking crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:55:33       Have you heard about this new? There's this new, I think called I think cis sexism. Have you heard this? No, I think I covered it in one of my sad truth. It's

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       basically the idea that, so you, you, you're a heterosexual male and CIS gendered, right? Which is not real. That's not a real expression, but it is real. But we'll all expressions are created by humans, right? So very true. Some humans, except so you and I wish to mate with women, hence we are heterosexual. Do we? Okay. Right now, stay with me now at by you restricting your preference to this old antiquated term of women, meaning that they have vaginas. You're actually engaging in a form of CIS, CIS sexism because there are women who have nine inch penises who should also be privy to your attention. So by you saying, yes, I'm attracted to women, but only the women that are cis gendered, that have female genitalia, that's a form of CIS sexism. This idea is not being promulgated. So you even saying that you have a heterosexual orientation towards biological women as a form of Transphobia, not unlike by the way.

Speaker 3:          01:56:55       Here's another example of racialism. Have you heard of this? I said yes. Okay. I love this idea. Isn't it fantastic? It's wonderful. So how far can we take this? Like how we far? Okay. So you think that you think the fulcrum is not going to start swinging the other way at some point? For sure it will. And it has, and I think that's one of the reasons why Donald Trump got into office, is people are so upset with political correctness, they went with the exact opposite, which is buffoonery outrageous braggadocious male buffoonery. I mean, that's really what it is. I mean, he's a braggadocious buffoon and in a lot of respects, especially the way he talks about his ratings and ones talks about himself in the third person, you know, like he was describing Kanye west and Kanye loves trump mean, could you imagine saying that about yourself and describing yourself in third person, but a famous person loving you.

Speaker 3:          01:57:47       Right? It's so bizarre. You know, a lot of people who follow me think that I joked that, that they think that I have these trump posters in my room and you know, he's my big hero, which of course he's not. And by the way, I'm Canadian, so I truly don't have a dog in this fight. The reason why they think that is because I offered prior to the election being done, I offered some compelling reasons, psychological reasons why people might vote for Donald Trump. So most famously, perhaps in my chat with Sam Harris, I explained the psychological mechanisms that could lead to otherwise perfectly reasonable people to vote for trump, simply proposing these was complete unacceptable. I'm sure you're aware of what's going on with Scott Adams and Scott Adams is lost millions of dollars for simply stating that he believes that Donald trump

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       is a very persuasive person and correctly predicting that that power of persuasion would allow him to win the presidency. He doesn't even vote. Scott Adams says, because he talked so much about politics, he does not want to have a dog in the fight, so he doesn't vote. He told me that on the podcast. And so people think that he's a trump supporter. He's like, I'm absolutely not a trump supporter. He goes, I'm analyzing the human beings.

Speaker 4:          01:59:03       Exactly. And so here's. So just to kind of repeat what I told Sam. So they are different decision rules that one can use when they're making a choice between different competing alternative. So for example, if you're choosing between cars, each car is defined by many attributes, right? It's gas efficiency, it's the power of its engine. It's price and so on and so there are different ways that I could apply a decision rule and choosing between car a, car b, so here's one rule I could look at, take all the attributes, put them together, multiply them by the importance weight of each attribute, and pick the best product, so using that decision rule, maybe Hillary Clinton would have won because maybe if you put all the attributes together, she ends up scoring higher than Donald Trump, but here's another the decision rule. It's called the lexical graphic rule. Lexical graphical rule basically says, I simply look at my most important attribute.

Speaker 4:          01:59:53       What's the attribute that I care most when I'm making the choice within this category, and I simply choose the alternative that scores higher on that most important attribute. So for example, if it were a cars, I only care about the power of the engine, so I choose car a because it has a stronger power engine, right? And the case of Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton. Suppose that my lexical graphic rule is I care only about the position on immigration. That's my decision. That's the only thing I look at. Well, it's very reasonable for people to think that Donald trump had a more conservative view on immigration than Hillary Clinton. So if I use that decision rule, that psychological rule, I would choose Donald Trump. It wouldn't make me a guy who is sleeping with my sister and I'm a tooth tooth toothless sky and Arkansas and a hick. It simply means that I'm using a particular decision rule that causes me to choose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. So again, all I did, not unlike what Scott Adams did his own way, his offer, the different psychological processes by which a very reasonable person can end up choosing Donald trump rather than Hillary Clinton. And it's unbelievable. The kind of flack I got. It was crazy because it's, it's

Speaker 5:          02:01:07       your absolute area of expertise. I mean, it's what your education is it. It's what you teach. Exactly. It's so strange that if it doesn't jive with people's belief systems, they get upset at you for teaching something that's science. Right? Well, I call this by the way, the, the. I used to love. You got sad, but roof. So I used to love you got sat, but trump, I hate you, but I just love saying that though. They used to stay, love saying that they love to try to instill a seed of regret. Not just criticism but regret because it's more painful, right? Like to say, I just think you're a fool. It's like, all right, well fuck you. You're not my fan. I'm not into you. What's the number one source of flack that you receive from your gigantic fan base? Oh, the one issue that triggers the most animal to you.

Speaker 5:          02:01:58       Boy, I don't know. To me like personally, you know, Joel, I think you're a great guy, but my God, you're such an idiot because of x. what's x? There's so many things we did. We did a three hour podcasts just to name them all. I get a lot of facts wrong. A lot of things I remember incorrectly because a lot of these free form conversations, like we're having a. it's not planned out. The subjects aren't planned out in particular, like the divergent paths that we take. Sometimes we'll go down a path and I'll go to that. What was that story about that thing, and I'll get that shit wrong all the time because there's just, I mean, as good as my memory is and it's pretty good, there's just a certain amount of data that you could instantaneously call up to the. I mean if you ask me questions about certain things that are in my constant day to day existence, like maybe perhaps standup comedy or martial arts, I can, I can give you a staggering amount of information off the top of my head, but there's a lot of stuff that, you know, we talk about in these podcasts.

Speaker 5:          02:02:58       It's just people say, well, you should have prepared for it. Well, I didn't know we're going to talk about it because it's no, it's one of the things that makes the conversation so interesting. So in that sense I'm giving myself would get out of jail free pass. But um, I dunno. I mean getting things wrong is probably the big one. Okay. Yeah. Talking over people, being a meathead, all those things I'm guilty of. I think probably the number one thing for me over the past few months has been this trump thing where people simply can't understand. They think I'm his waterboy, which of course I'm not, but I'm simply saying, look, very, very reasonable. People could have converged to a trump decision, a vote, but don't you think that's like one of those 140 character criticisms? Like it's really like I've been called a trump supporter. I'm 100 percent not, but because of the fact that it's a cruel thing to say to someone, yeah, still loving trump.

Speaker 5:          02:03:46       No, you fucking idiot. Like loving trump. Right? What am I gonna have a seven minute long bit about him in my act, like loving them. Like what are you talking about it? But it doesn't matter because by saying that they could diminish you. Oh, you're a racist, you know? Oh, you're a sexist, right? You know, Oh, you're like the. One of the craziest ones is someone. If someone gets unfairly or unjustly or inaccurately accused of rape, right? Immediately that person's a rapist and they did it and it is incredibly difficult to exonerate yourself from that and people that had been accused of rape. I mean not people like bill cosby. We get accused of it 50 fucking times or something crazy, but I've known people that were accused of rape and it was all a lie and they were. It was done by an ex and it was just someone who is a scorned lover

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       and it was angry and they wanted to cast the worst possible light on this person in order to be. Give them some tastes of the pain that they feel from rejection or from whatever reason. And this is not uncommon. I mean I don't know what the statistics are as far as a false rape accusations versus actual rape versus people who were raped who don't talk about it, but either one does not invalidate the other. By saying that a lot of women actually have been raped, which neither you nor I would ever argue with. Of course, and it's a horrible crime and it's a terrible fucking thing to do to a person to take away their humanity in that way. That does not. That does not somehow or another make it okay. That people have false rape accusations. No, that's a horrific thing to. I mean we can quantify what's worse or what's better, you know, and I think we would all agree that it's probably worse to be physically raped than it is to be accused of rape when you didn't do it, but they're both gross.

Speaker 2:          02:05:38       But you have these things that I've actually written about this. Do you think that the punishments for false accusations of rape are too lax? Because I do. I think that they don't know what they are, but I would say that they should be pretty horrific, right? Almost to the. Almost the same amount of what he would have spent in prison. Yeah, I think maybe like 70 percent I think. I think false rape accusations, especially if you like really chase it down and try to give this person locked up. I mean there's so much wrong with that. It might be like 70 percent of rape, 70 percent, meaning like 70 percent. That's bad. I shouldn't say a number. I don't think it's as bad as physically raping someone, but it's in the neighborhood. But I mean think of it this way. Not to get too philosophical everyday that a guy spends in prison as a falsely accused rapist while you, the woman who falsely accused him is sitting in your house.

Speaker 2:          02:06:35       I mean you are a quote committing the crime every day of his life, every everyday that you don't step forward, punishing, punishing, right? Yeah. I mean again, not to diminish that one act of rape, but you are raping this guy metaphorically every if not literally because he probably is going to be raped in prison for having that accusation on top of his head. Right? Because that's a targeted person and positive person, so in a sense you're almost as diabolical as a true rapist because you are living with that false information and everyday you're going to buy your tomatoes and groceries. Unencumbered by the fact that there is a guy sitting in prison who was probably passing some very ugly moments because you are unwilling to correct the wrong that you've done, so I think it's a pretty diabolical person who does that. It's a definitely. It's definitely a diabolical person. The problem is whenever you bring up this diabolical person, you automatically get lumped in with someone who has some sort of an enabler, some cis gendered male

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       privileged piece of shit. It doesn't care about actual rape victims because you're more concerned with men who get falsely accused of rape. It's just another thing. It's not. It's not diminishing the actual crime of rape, which is one of the worst things in the world next to murder. It's just a horrific, terrifying aspect of human beings that we're even capable of doing that, but it doesn't mean that false rape accusations aren't also a horrific aspect of being a person. There's just a lot of shitty behavior that people exhibit and as soon as we lock ourselves into these, these little groups that will always blindly support. Like I have this bit I've been doing lately about a bumper sticker. I saw a girl's car, it said girls kick ass. Like you imagine if a guy had a bumper sticker that said boys kick ass. It's so you're signing off on $160 million people. That's so crazy. But it's one of those things where we'll allow that because we all agree that women have a harder go of it in this country in particular and other countries far more so. Right. And we could go back to ideology for the reasons for that. What we're talking to

Speaker 4:          02:08:45       about earlier, by the way, speaking of rape, I don't, I don't think we've mentioned this. Everyone on this show, a two of my colleagues, one of whom I know. Well, the other one, not so much if at all, wrote a book around 2000 or 2002, offering an adaptive evolutionary explanation for rape he had. There Ya go. You don't need to hear anything more than that. So. Yeah, exactly. So actually I'll tell you their names. So Randy Thornhill, who's a very, very serious scientists, and Craig Palmer, they wrote a book, I think it was in 2000 now. They weren't of course, justifying rape, condoning it. They were saying, look, if you wish to understand rape, then you better have a good scientific basis for why it happens, and therefore they offered something adaptive argument. Which by the way, that's one of the main things that people will hate. Evolution psychology commit as a fallacy. They think that when you explain a phenomenon, you are justifying it. So if you explain why men and women might cheat on one another and monogamous unions or you're offering a scientific justification for cheating, of course you're not. Usually. My rebuttal is the guy who studies cancer, an oncologist. Does that mean he is for pancreatic cancer? He's justifying. No, he's just trying to explain why pancreatic cancer happens. Is that across

Speaker 5:          02:10:01       the board though? I mean, what if you try to explain why people commit violent crimes or explain why people steal things from stores?

Speaker 4:          02:10:11       That's a great question. I think there are certain phenomena that triggered that response more than others and it's an open empirical question. What's the quality of the phenomenon that causes you to react that way or not?

Speaker 5:          02:10:22       Let's say that it's most likely the stronger person who seems to have the privilege victimizing the weaker person. Perhaps males versus females,

Speaker 4:          02:10:31       child abuse. That's another one. So actually feel. Yeah, right. So the book, so the book that got me into evolutionary psychology, I've, I've, I've mentioned this story before and maybe not on the show. It was my first semester as a doctoral student at Cornell and the professor, this was an advanced social psychology course and the professor assigned the book called homicide by two pioneers of evolutionary psychology, husband and wife team, Margo Wilson and Martin Daly where the book is about understanding patterns of criminality via an evolutionary lens. And one of the things in the book that had struck me as so powerful was looking at child abuse in the home and then the demonstration that there's a very clear evolutionary reason why that happens. So let me ask you that. I have. We discussed this before in this show. I don't think so. I don't recall. Can you guess at all?

Speaker 4:          02:11:22       Uh, what is the number one greatest predictor of there being a child abuse in the home? So for example, you might say, oh, it's poverty. You might say it's probably parents that were abused as children. No bigger than that. Bigger than that, much bigger. That one factor is 100 fold greater than. So in other words, typically when you say a what's called an odds, likelihood ratio one point two. So you have a 20 percent greater chance of getting cancer if you smoke. So just having one point, two greater odds is considered a big number here. I'm telling you a hundred fold greater. So it's something that's almost never seen in science. What does having a step parent in the home now think again here, another animal. And to get the people who don't like 100 times greater. This is this. So actually it's now been called the Cinderella effect because their Ela, right?

Speaker 4:          02:12:22       She shows the, the, the evil step mother loves her two biological daughters but hates the stepdaughter Cinderella. So that's okay. Now think about with lions, right? In a lion pride, you have a one or two dominant males who who control and protect the pride and who control sexual access to the females. There's constant testing of these males by bands of young males who are looking to take over and for awhile the resident males went out and then eventually they lose when they lose and they're either killed or banished from the pride. What's the first thing that the new incoming bosses do? They kill the boobies. Boom. They kill the babies. What happens to the females that the lionesses one, they killed him. They go into estrus, right? So instead of playing Barry White Music and the violin to get them in the mood, killed their children and they get in the mood, right? Nature is brutal, right? Well, in the context of humans, when you have a step parent who is not biologically linked

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       to the child, it simply increases the likelihood of there being abuse right. Now usually when you explain this, what is the first thing that people say, oh, well I grew up with a stepfather and he didn't do this to me. You're an asshole or, but, but what are you saying? That means it's okay to do it because you're explaining it. So look how they can flate explaining a phenomenon with justifying the phenomenon. So I think rape, child abuse and probably marital infidelity are the three evolutionary phenomena that when you explain using an evolutionary lens, people go completely Wacko. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, it's something that it's. You almost can't look at it. It's right. Forbidden in Islam village as per my conversation with Sam Harris, avoid that topic because you'll get too much flack and that's dangerous. Nothing should be forbidden. So these scientists that wrote this book, whether they were examining rape and the causes of rape, what was the repercussions?

Speaker 3:          02:14:30       So I, I was invited. So around the Thorn Hill is at the University of New Mexico and he's still there. Great Guy. When when he invited me to his group, invited me to give a talk at the university, him and I went out for a while and I asked him that question. He said at one point there had to be constant police patrols because of all the death threats and so on that he, that he was getting nih. I suspect that at this point in a subsided, this is 15, 16 years ago, but when the book first came out, it was dangerous to be around the thornhill. Well, this is so bizarre where people that you would think of the left, right? And as soon as you think of people that are liberal and progressive, you think these are nonviolent folks that just want peace and happiness and love. But look what happened in Evergreen.

Speaker 3:          02:15:15       I mean this is what Bret Weinstein talked about, the threats, and then all of a sudden you've got vigilante patrols with tasers and baseball bats and these are kids that are running around trying to justify using violence because someone doesn't agree with their thoughts. The whole idea of it was a day of absence, day of inclusion or does it day of presence. Right. That was the idea was that white people should stay home just once. He was like, that's fucking racist, like you can't do that. And He, as he self describes as a deeply progressive person in all my conversations with him indicate that in a huge way. I mean he's just a really open minded, progressive guy who he doesn't, but he doesn't want racism against white people to exist any more than he wants it against black people. But by the way, I was. So he came on my show too.

Speaker 3:          02:16:01       We had a great chat and second hiding. Now interrupted. Yeah. No, no problem. Uh, I, I don't know if full hiding, but he certainly not on campus, but that's what he said. He had to move his family. Yeah. Even know where. But maybe I shouldn't say weird. Yeah. Well, if you look at the comments section, I wonder if the same thing happened when he came on your show. I was amazed at the animus that he was being levied at him from people who were saying, Hey, that guy is part of the problem. He's a progressive who created the monster that is now biting his ass, and so let him let, let let the snake and so on. Charitable. You didn't get. No, I didn't get that, but I do understand why fools would think because he's not real true. Progressives like non ideologically based progressive.

Speaker 3:          02:16:51       It's a good thing. Exactly. It's a good thing to note until the think that, hey man, we should all be the same regardless of your dreadlocks or a shaved head or if you're white or black or. It's a weird thing like, like sexual preference. We were talking about this before, like if a man is only sexually attracted to. If he says I am sexually attractive, I prefer white women. You are a fucking racist. But if you say, I prefer black women. Like Ooh, spice it weird. By the way, this, this cuts both ways. So, and I actually commented on this, if you say I'm attracted to overweight women, you are objectifying and fetishizing are corpulent bodies or you know, that's what they'll say. That's what they'll sell the complainer's I should be happy. Somebody likes. If you say I don't like fat women because I'm not, then of course you're, you're so.

Speaker 3:          02:17:44       Same thing with, with black women, right? If you say, look, I just have a preference for black women. Oh yeah. It's the old stereotype of the sexual black woman with a beautiful behind. You're objectifying us, you're racist. If you say, you know, I really don't like the, the, the, the body types of black women. I prefer Asian women while you are racist. So all roads lead to you being an asshole. If you like them, it's bad. If you don't like them, it's bad. What if you just say you just enjoy dating black women because of the way the communicate. Some race, someone will probably accusing, listen at correcting somebody for their grammar. If it's part of their dialect is racist. Right? So Ebonics. I actually, I was, I was coming when we were coming here. I was listening to a song by a see Sierra Sierra general.

Speaker 3:          02:18:31       That is. No, she's a, she's a hip hop singer and at one point in one of the songs she goes, there you is. There you is. So I told my wife, I said, you know, it really pisses me off when they commit these grammatical errors. Yeah, but isn't that an art thing? I mean like I might say something grammatically incorrect on stage, everything. It's funnier than saying it correctly. Okay, fine. If you're doing it because it is part of the sort of the contextualized shtick, but isn't that what she's kind of doing a rap song? I don't know. I don't know. It's an open question. I don't know. Maybe it just rhymes better. There you are. Don't say there you, but what if it's. She's trying to run what rhymes with his fizz fizz. Yeah. I don't sit in champagne. Get my fears it. Look over there.

Speaker 3:          02:19:13       There you is. Should have been a rapper, dude, by the way, you said. You said that. I'm saying that you were attracted to black women. Might be racist or not. Did you hear the latest with the new, um, letter that was uncovered from Tupac Shakur to a white chicks that. No, no. That he broke up with her because she was a white woman. He broke up with Madonna. Madonna. Yeah. She was annoying. It was just trying to find an excuse. That's a good way like that. You can't ever change, right? You can't change the fact that you're white. That's a good move. But imagine that the other way around. Right. If, if, if, if she had written him a letter saying, hey, dear Tupac, I would have loved to continue this relationship, but given that you're a black guy, her career would be over. But him saying it to her, he actually said, he goes, he said, if you date me, it appears as though you're an exciting cool woman, but if I continue to date you, a lot of the people that made me who I am would, I would lose credit with the credit.

Speaker 3:          02:20:11       Taiwan, she was thrown that posted correctly. Probably still would have stuck around. She's probably annoying.

Speaker 3:          02:20:18       She probably talks too much. She probably talks about herself in the third person, like trump probably likes you. Right? I'm going to admit something now that's going to come back to the hotline. What? Nineteen 85. My cousin and I. I shouldn't be saying this. What did you do? Drove to Toronto to see Madonna. I would have done that. Nineteen 85. She was a fantastic performer. She was a huge superstar. Still kind of is. I'm just joking around about being her, her being annoying. It's just a funny thing to say. I was always big madonna fan when I was younger. I think, you know, is beautiful and interesting and bold and mean. You don't get that without a certain amount of ego. So to mock that ego is like, well, of course, you know, it's like, that's who she was. Yeah, true. You know, and then I'm with Tupac is doing this.

Speaker 3:          02:21:06       I mean he's kind of like locked into the identity politics of the 19 nineties. I mean, that's what, what, where he was, you know, is there, is there a, a person that you would love to have on your show who is a artist that you really love? Um, there's a lot of them. There's not one. There's one that's coming on my show. I'll tell you who it is, who, uh, I had announced this. I hope that he doesn't somehow back out, but I'll mention it doesn't matter if he doesn't end up coming. That's okay. Have you, do you know, have you heard of Newton the way? No, no. It's Ricky Martin. No, I'm kidding. No, it's. I live in Lavita logo. Do you know, do you know the group stylistics? No. The stylistics, we're a old soul group that's part of a genre called the philly sound.

Speaker 3:          02:21:53       So there's a type of black music that late sixties, early seventies that's is very soulful, sexy soul type of music sites, stylistics. We're probably the epitome of that, John. Now. This is a group that I grew up listening to all the way back in Lebanon when I was a kid and I've made contact with the representatives of the lead singer and he said that he will come on my show. It's like, oh, exciting. So all the people that I've had on my show, all of whom had been lovely and accomplished people I think, and I hope I'm not being insulting to anybody. I don't think I'm as excited to be speaking to anyone which shows, by the way, the power of music, right? As much as I am in speaking to this gentleman. Uh, you know, who in this area go there. That's actually not the singer, a set of bare chest under a suit coat. That's the guy that's rustled Thompkins Jr. Wow. Fro strong. He's got What's called the falsetto voice. She goes very, very high with his voice.

Speaker 3:          02:22:55       You are very good. And I've heard that song. Isn't it Funny how like people used to dance and move back then everyone waS like synchronized and there was like a thing they used to do together. I know that doesn't really happen anymore. I wonder what happened where people decided that synchronized singing like five men together stage. It's not cool anymore. Well, you do Have boy bands. You have backstreet boys or men is men. Yeah. These are men. These are. This is five men moving their arms and singing in synchronicity while people dance slowly, which no one does anymore. No one dances like that anymore. Who fucks things like that anymore? Who fucked dance that dances like that anymore? It's weird, right? I know someone needs to bring back the soul, train it in 2001. When we lived in southern California, I had the crazy idea of calling the representatives of the stylistics to see how much it would cost to hire them for private concert.

Speaker 3:          02:23:50       Somehow I thought that a professor had enough of a salary. The higher the stylistics for a private concert. How many people apparently, you know, I just had this fantasy that, you know, wouldn't it be amazing to invite people to apparently a much poorer than I think I am? Yeah. I think it's five dudes. It was actually. I can't remember the exact amount, but it was something in the order. this is 15, 16 years ago it was, I can't remember. Maybe half a million dollars. The cost of flying them in their fee, so I went to uc irvine was not paying me enough. I can't remember the exact number, but it was much more than I could afford. Wow. What were you hoping for? Like 10 grand, 50 thouSand, 50,000 you were hoping for? Yeah, that would seem like reasonable. That's like, you know, I thought I had joe rogan money, but I only have mere professor money that's even 50,000.

Speaker 3:          02:24:43       It's like I wouldn't spend that much money. It's christ. If you could. What's your favorite group? It's probably metallica. Metallica. I love me some metallic, especially when I'm working out and shit. I mean you did tell me prior to us starting how much you love share. you didn't say these tramps and thieves. That's what town. So who's your favorite? I'm not have a favorite. give me really don't led zepplin. Okay. Led zepplin you found out they steal music. Stairway to heaven story. I'd heard that hurts pretty bad, but then they get almond brothers. They got exonerated as they paid off some fucking. Is that true? Do you know how much money they would have to give back? How much the record

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       companies would have to give back? But it was established and it was stolen. Like in terms of the. You want to play it? You want to play here? Here. Let's play it. So we could just. Can we do it or would they were they? Fuck us. Youtube fargo's alright. So we'll, we'll do this and it won't be on youtube to the people listening right now on youtube. You're not going to hear shit, but this is what we'll do. We will synchronize. Jamie will tell you what this is and you can synchronize it doesn't even work like that. Can you open up to youtube windows? I'll put up the. I can put the video in the corner so you can see what we're up a 56 second video called led up verse spirit stairway to heaven comparison. So we'll have to kind of talk a little bit of it.

Speaker 2:          02:26:03       Otherwise, the people that are listening to this live streaming, you're going to get this, it's just going to be blank, dead air. So this is the originAl song. This is not the led zeppelIn version. This is the song that lead's up. Been fucking ripped off exactly. Like dude is 100 percent. It's not like 80 percent or 70 percent. That's 100 percent. They stole this. This band opened for them. Oh, it's only one of many. I mean there's a lot of influences that they had from old blues songs that they added to some of their songs, which is more forgivable, almost a kin to what they do today with rap music, with sampling, which I don't have any problem with it all. I mean I think it kind of enhances it and makes you think about the old song. But this is agregious. So what was their position? It just happened by fluke that we came up with the same notes, just hired the best lawyers. They got themselves some jews. Is that, is that nsma? That's awesome. At being lawyers. So here, did you play the okay as both of them. Okay. We'll play the play the second part of the first one. So the first one is stairway to heaven. Where does it go? There's a better version of it. Oh, that's the compare it. Okay. Well let's go back to it. See if you can. What? We'll see. Which one is a. Okay, here we go. This is.

Speaker 2:          02:27:29       This is the California bands psychedelic band spirit. This is a taurus. This is not sound. Now. This is different. Is that. That's not it. The taurus is the sound you're listening to right now. Hold on a second. It changes. Hold on a second here. Okay. Here. This part.

Speaker 2:          02:27:55       Yeah. okay. The court. That's not even a good question. There's a better system. That riff is the part that's in question. That's it. Yeah. Maybe it was one of the other songs. Yeah, there's other songs. Okay. So not, not, not. Not withstanding the potential for them having done some unsavory things. They're pretty bad ass. You couldn't. You wouldn't spend $50,000. You have as your guest of honor, the godfather at your house and you say, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, let's going. He's a closet led zeppelin fan. I get to. He's trying to. do we try to. First of all, you know how much money you'd have to pay. Like you always hear about these guys, like I'm in the middle east, some arabic brianna to go over there and perform. I think a million is like a bargain. Yeah. Like what didn't beyonce go and do some crazy concert for new year's and dubai for somebody for like 5 million bucks or something.

Speaker 2:          02:28:52       Yeah. That's pays to be super famous I guess. What do you think of Janet Jackson marrying some oil sha? She's full on burka. Burka, yeah. Well some of those videos need to be expunged from our collective memory. When she pulled the tid out at the superbowl, jay z and kanye paid $6,000,000 to perform in dubai, which is hilarious. This. Is there a place that you would be invited for a very large sum of money that you would refuse because you disagree politically or ideologically would whatever that person was inviting you stands for sure. Yeah, for sure. Certainly they didn't. They didn't know they were bought for some price. Well, it's a little bit different what they do because they would go over there and they, I guess they would know like what their material would be, you know, like if they went over there to perform 99 problems like jay z's, his lyrics are out there, you know, they say like, hey, we would like you going to give you 6 million bucks.

Speaker 2:          02:29:55       We want you to sing 99 problems and all these different songs. The lyrics are clearly established. Right. But if someone like me went over there and did comedy, like, oh, who was it? Was it who? One of the guests I had in the past? Um, house parks, I think it was house parks that went over to dubai and he, he had did a bit and he was told by one of the people in the audience that he was going to be arrested because he referred to one of the royal family by the wrong name. Call them sir instead of your highness. And so they were going to arrest him. Wow. But then some other member of the royal family stepped in and stopped it because they said no, he was respectful and he just didn't understand the traditional protocol, but they were ready to lock him up in a fucking cage because he used the wrong term.

Speaker 2:          02:30:45       Not even in a disrespectful manner. Right? Yeah. Just just called him sir. You know? Yeah. Like that's not the place that I'm going. I'm, I'm just, I'm not interested in any place. Look man, there's a real problem with Canada right now and know. I know. You know what happened in vancouver. We're a comic. Was heckled by these lesbians. Yes. And shit all over them. And then they sued him and won because he had done something to violate their human rights because they were heckling, not just him, but people before him. They were disrupting a live performance. So do you think

Speaker 4:          02:31:19       this trend of famous comics refusing to perform at universities is only going to continue to increase or again, have we reached the maximum and now there's going to be blow back? Because I know jerry seinfeld doesn't do it. Chris rock doesn't do it right.

Speaker 5:          02:31:37       I haven't done it since 2003, maybe it was the last time I did a show it as a cost center set. Yeah. I don't think they have enough life experience. You know, I like to talk to people that have lived. When I, when I talked to people I want to talk to someone who has had affairs, love affairs and uh, has, had jobs and been fired, has had education and as I want someone with life experience, not there's anything wrong with being 18 or whatever, 19, but I want someone who's got some living under their belt so they know what the fuck I'm talking about. Right? I don't want to have to explain everything I don't want. I did a concert once, a concert, but did a show once in the university and I was talking about something sexual and I saw this bewildered, looks in the audience.

Speaker 5:          02:32:20       How many people are virgins? I go, don't, don't even raise your hand because I don't incriminate you. I go, just blink real fast. And they started laughing, but it got real uncomfortable. I go, would you again? I go, I'm not gonna even look at you. I go, I'm going to look at the sky. Would you say that I would be out of line if I said 10 percent of you were virgins and the place went? They went, no, no, that's good. It's probably about right. People like yelling. I'm like, that's crazy. Ten percent of you are virgins. That's like if there's 200 people, each one of you are fucking virgin is really. That's a lot of people and it's probably more than that. They're probably being modest or not being honest about it. I just, it's not nothing wrong with being college obviously, but as far as like where I want to perform, I don't have a lot of, you know, if I have a day, there's 24 hours in that day.

Speaker 5:          02:33:07       I don't have a lot of hours to perform at night. If I'm performing at night, I get a couple of hours. you know, I'd like, I like doing actual comedy, like doing what I do and then one of the things about comedy is it's, it's different than any other art form in that. Like say if you go to see music, like you know what you're going to go see, you don't usually just say, oh, live music. Like, well, let's hope that it's something I'm interested in. You know, we're going to see jay z followed by Johnny Cash followed by loretta lynn. No, It's not going to be that way. You're gonna go to a rock and roll club. You go to the viper room, most likely gonna hear some rock and roll and he'd go to a country western bar. You know, you get to see that.

Speaker 5:          02:33:45       I think with standup comedy, people get upset if you're not doing like what appeals to them and their sensibility. So I like to go to nightclubs. That's where I like, I like, I don't even do corporate gigs. I get a lot of offers to do these corporate gigs and they'll, they'll pay you a lot of money. There'll be to tame the audience. They won't know. It's not a, it's not a real comedy show. It's like you guys are paying. It's like your gad sad paying 50 grand to have these guys singing your backyard. Some weird ego thing, right? I saw my friend dana white, who is the. He's head of the ufc. He had a birthday party years back and stone temple pilots played for that dude died of an overdose. RIght. And man, nobody was fucking paying attention. It was weird. Stone temple pilots mean they kinda got everybody to pay attention.

Speaker 5:          02:34:32       Got everybody moved towards the stage, but people a didn't know to expect stone temple pilots who was a big surprise and when I even introduced them, when I introduce stone temple pilots, people didn't even think that it was really going to be stone temple pilots. Like I said, happy birthday to dana, thanked him for everything and then I said, and I'm going to blow your mind right now. Ladies and gentlemen, stone temple pilots, and they came out and it was really stone temple pilots. They went hard. They did there. It was really, really impressive stuff because they did their full on concert, like a 100 percent all out. it was intense. It was really amazing, but it wasn't a lot of people paying attention. And while I was, while I was sitting there watching it, I was like, you know what? Yeah, never again. I'm never doing. I mean I'd already decided I wasn't going to do it. I wasn't going to do that anyway, but I remember

Speaker 4:          02:35:20       that you said, I think in our first chat several years ago, which has resonated and stuck with me, you were comparing your career as a standup comic or in fighting to the truth that comes in science, that you're comparing that to acting, which is very ephemera and fuzzy and you were saying basically, look, when you're a scientist, you have to present stuff and it's either right or wrong and people are going to judge you and you analogized it to comedy. You get up in front of a crowd, you either know you're either funny or you're going to bomb. You get up to fight. You either are ready or are you going to get pummeled. And I thought that was a really good analogy because there's truth and honesty in that, right? There is no way to wing it. As a comic. You get up and you better be funny,

Speaker 5:          02:36:04       right? Yeah, but it's very subjective, like one thing to make might make you laugh is different. Someone might think is terrible. I mean there's a lot of people that are fans of certain comedians that other people think or how awful it just like music, you know, there's certain types of. It's all subjective. It's, it's like when you consider art, what's really like fighting even it's like who's not necessarily even who's necessarily better. SometImes it's like what happened in the moment. Sometimes dudes collide heads and it changes the course of a fight and it's not because of skill. It's because in the moment something happened chaotic or someone got poked in the eye and they couldn't see well, and then they got knocked out. Are they the worst fighter? Not necessarily. It's like sometimes there's a. There's all sorts of unpredictable variables that come into place.

Speaker 4:          02:36:56       Here's a guy that I recently discovered. He's an italian comedian Who had an hbo special. I thought,

Speaker 5:          02:37:04       sebastian sebastian maniscalco. He's a buddy of mine. He's been on the podcast. No kidding. Hilarious.

Speaker 4:          02:37:09       I, I live it. Usually when I watch standup comics, I mean, I'll laugh a bit. I think this is funny that, but that guy in that

Speaker 2:          02:37:15       show, I've probably watched shows on showtime. Showtime. Yeah. I literally could not stop laughing because somehow his humor very much resonated with some of our sort of middle eastern italian. Yeah. And I just get so gravitate towards him just this guy's fantastic. He really is. He's a great guy too. He's, he's like, nobody hates that guy. Like that guy is loved in the comedy community, but does he, is he. Has he been known for a long. He's been doing it for a long time and he's an interesting case because when he first started out he wasn't doing that good, you know, he had a really work hard at it to become who he is, but he stuck with it and chipped away at it and got better and better and better. And I didn't see him for a long time because I had taken mY hiatus from the comedy store and um, I saw him on showtime when I wasn't at the comedy store anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:38:07       And I thought it was so fucking funny. I met, I remember tweeting at them. Then I got ahold of him, I said, dude, that was amazing. It's so good. And I had heard that he was doing really well, but I hadn't seen him perform and it was probably like six years, five or six years at least. And um, he just had gotten so much better. That's an eighth right. You agree that much of our humor. I mean, it's not something that you could teach and a workshop. Right? How to be funny one. Oh, one. right. It's just, you either have that delivery, you know, how to. I would say you have an ember. okay. And you, if your lungs, you have an ember, you could become really funny. But I've met a lot of people that sucked in the beginning and they just got really good.

Speaker 2:          02:38:47       They because they really worked hard at it. And here's the most important thing, and this is like, it's, this relates to what we've been talking about, being objective about the actual root cause of why people like you or don't like you try to figure out what, what it is about what you're doing that people don't like and correct it. Right. Get better, improve, and the onlY way to improve is not blame the audience. Oh, you're a bunch of sTupid, but people do do that. And the people that do make those excuses and don't instead look internally, you know, like sometimes you can have a bad side and you got to say, well, you know what man, I fucked that up. I jusT wasn't tuned in. I gotta I gotta I gotta readjust. I got, you know, maybe I was sick that day and there's always reasons necessarily, um, not, not necessarily excuses rather, but you got to examine those uncomfortable moments and some people excuse themselves by that by saying that audience sucked or you know, these people are assholes or you know, these people are stupid.

Speaker 2:          02:39:47       There's a bunch of excuses that people make and it's super critical that you don't do that. You've got to look at data, look at the whole thing. Do you juke in terms of actionable feedback? Do you look for it from other professional comics because you trust their opinions more? Or are you looking for the civilians in the audience to give you that feedback? What? Which one is more actionable from your perspective as you're trying to improve your craft is very problematic to play for the comedians because comedians like weird shit, like we might like something completely obscure that we don't see common, you know, but an audience might not be laughing and you might hear one comment in the back of their own fucking ridiculous and the audience doesn't think it's funny and then there's a trap that the comedians will fall into with a start playing for their peers specifically.

Speaker 2:          02:40:38       There's a bunch of guys that have, I don't want to call anybody out, but there's people that have ruined their career because they essentially became the comic place to the back of the room and the audience didn't think they were funny and essentially they're making fun of people who try to be funny and instead exonerating themselves for many real pressure to be funny because hey, I'm here to make comics laugh. I'm a comic's comic. Right? Well, the real comics are comics comp, like dave chappelle's a comic's comic, but he kills the audience too because he's real. He's got the full package where there's a lot of comics that bomb in front of the audience, but you'll have 20 guys in the back of the room that think it's cool to chuckle at obscure references and very bizarre words that get used in some sort of strange weather would be sort of like that, right.

Speaker 2:          02:41:27       Because he, just to follow his references takes you like a flow chart of 20 pages long. Right. I talked to norm mcdonald about him once. It was really funny. It was. Yeah. You know, uh, he's not really that smart. Has really know those words. Like a one. Yeah, that's crazy. He just, he just finds out words that people don't know and he uses them and uh, people laugh even though they don't know what he's talking about. So someone played a joke on him once where they use some reference. They use some refereNce on Dennis Miller that they made up. oh, it was dom. I rera used a reference on Dennis Miller that he's fade up and dennis started laughing at it even though it wasn't real because it was like something that you had to be like, cool to know tom to remember that door. But he was like his, like, he goes, I fucked him with his own thing.

Speaker 2:          02:42:16       I tricked him with his own trick. I, he just used a reference that isn't real and he just can't, you know, because people don't like to be on the outside. Like people don't like to say what the fuck does that mean? I'm a big fan of saying what does that mean? Yeah. Because I look, I've had 900 plus podcast with 700 people wave fucking smarter than me. So like I have to say, I don't knoW what that means. Like you got to be mean. But there's a weird thing where people don't like to, they equate not having information with somehow and they're being less intelligent, which is a really bizarre thing because like, it's okay if you're talking to someone about something that you couldn't possibly have data on, like a, you know, whatever. A video game, right, that you don't play, like what's it about?

Speaker 2:          02:43:04       Like how's it go? Like that's okay, that's fine, but as soon as it's something about like some sort of cultural reference or perhaps a book that maybe you should have initiatives you to admit that you don't know. That's a weird damn. You know, it's a weird thing to be somehow or another, you feel diminished by information or a lack of it. It's so funny that you say this because in my classes students will oftentimes ask me a question and that has me stumped and I will usually answer it. You know what? I actually don't know the answer. Could you send me an email so I could look it up? That's beautiful. And they are really impressed by that. Honesty Was impressive. Yeah. Yeah. So I hear you. Yeah. It's about the military I guess. But on the other hand, when I know something, I come out with the bravado of I know my shit, right?

Speaker 2:          02:43:49       So have the, have the humility to know what you know and what you don't know as the old saying says, you know, well you have um, the, that, what you would say bravado. It's like a pride of hard work. I mean you've accumulated a massive amount of knowledge of from seeking this knowledge and studying very hard. So it's something that you should be proud of, but it's not something that you look at. Like when you're proud of it, you're not diminishing other people that don't have that information. You're just saying like, this is what I know to be true and this is a fact. This is undeniable. But that's a beautiful thing that you could also say, I don't know about something that you don't know, right? That will give the people that are listening, that will give them so much more of a sense of respect for you venture than horse shooting around and pretending that's such a weird thing that people do.

Speaker 2:          02:44:34       And by the way, the media, oftentimes they want you to weigh in on things as a scientist, which you don't feel that your area of expertise would allow you to and they get frustrated because then they feel as though you're equivocating. But I said, look, I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to make that statement. Would that level of certainty, but they want it because that's what the headline has to say. And then they get frustrated that you're tippy toeing, but I'm just being humble about what is true and what I don't think I'm knowledgeable enough to say it's true. Yeah. I've had people get upset at me about. I'm talking about a upcoming martial arts fights because a, I don't give predictions. I very, very, very rarely give predictions unless there's some gross mismatch. It really shouldn't be happening in the first place because you really have no idea what's going to happen.

Speaker 2:          02:45:21       There's a high likelihood that something might happen. If I look at the way one guy moves versus another guy moves and I go into my database of experiences of seeing a lot of live competition and knowing what one person is capable of, I can make. I can make a statement with reasonable certainty, but I don't know if they were injured in training. I don't know if they come into the fight sick. I don't know if they're breaking up with their girlfriend. I don't know if they got staph infection two weeks before the fight and run ended up biotics. There's so many variables. I don't know if they might get headbutted like we've talked about earlier or they might have an injury like in the middle of the fight, like something goes wrong and their knee blows out. There's so many variables. Has the thing between the boxer and the mma guy happened yet?

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       See, thIs is. I love when someone. I know. I love that though. I know I'm not. I'm not criticizing you, but I love when someone is so far removed, but they're still aware of something that's like a big cultural event. No, it takes place August 26th. I think even I, I'm an unbelievable novice when it comes to this stuff. I think I could make a prediction here in front of your huge podcast that the mma guys going to get trashed. Correct. Um, I would imagine that most likely he is going to lose a boxing match to the boxer that has every little. What's the point of this fight? Just for, for my name thIng, if you wanted to see a figure skater play hockey against wayne gretzky. okay. So why would the mma guy put himself up for that potential humiliation, money, dollar dollar bills. Y'all been on your show?

Speaker 2:          02:47:02       No, he has not. I fucked up. I should have had them on back before he blew up. He's too big now. I refer to him as a conrad last time or something. Right? Something like that. His name's connor. Connor mcgregor. Yeah. Um, I, uh, he's a, a real meteoric, a entity and like the most media or can all of combat sports. He became so famous so quick and for [inaudible], he's a, he's a real unicorn in a lot of ways. Get so many different things going for him. Handsome guy, brutal knockout artists, predicts outcomes and pulls them off and, and uh, has been incredibly successful in a short period of time. One, two world titles in two different weight classes and is arguably the greatest trash talker ever. He trashed talks better than anybody because that right there is actually a big thing that's going on today, right?

Speaker 2:          02:47:54       The press conference or actually I'm reading the thing, they're scalping tickets outside of it for 40 bucks right now to my 40. It's a free. It was free. Oh, my nephew is probably all over that stuff, right? Probably. Yeah. Yeah. It's um, it's um, it's the press conference itself will be a show because this guy is so good at getting people riled up and talk and shit. And that's half the fun. Like I was too young to appreciate the mohammed ali days, but I would imagine that when muhammad ali was challenging sonny liston, like half of the fun was mohammed ali talk and shit. Like, this guy's crazy. That's exactly the mechanism When I take on some random person online and I just have fun with it. Sometimes people miss understand this to be. I'm getting pissed. I'm just happy. I'm just doing bantering. I'm usually doing this with a smile on my face, but they think of it as though I'm.

Speaker 2:          02:48:47       But I'm just trash talking about. Yeah. Yeah. It's a weird thing, man. It's like engaging with people you don't know. Like sometimes that person's insane and then they'll make it a career to go after god sat all day long. It's like it's interacting with people in text form is very problematic. Right? It's just like a lot of issues. You don't, you don't get social cues. You can adjust. You can't, you know, like in our conversation we're kind of going back and forth and you say something and I react to it and we laugh and we see eaCh other. all that's missing. When you're writing things, you know, especially if someone like writes a blog about you. If somebody listens to what you've said on this podcast and they write a blog about you defining you, he Is a man that does this. His whole career is this and you read it.

Speaker 2:          02:49:35       Like sam harris was just explaining something to me that someone did about him and uh, I read it and I was like, wow, this is such a weird way to describe and interact with the person that you've never even met credible to write a one sided thing where you don't even know the guy. You don't really know him, like really know him. Like, you know, you've, you've seen some videos, maybe the excuse me to interrupt and that you would muster such animus towards a person that you haven't met. Right? I mean, I, I'm, I'm fortunate enough to not have too many of these haters and trolls, but there is one or two guys that have come to my attention that it seems as though they spend 90 percent of their day doing. He trashed stuff about me and you think, what could it be that I could so trigger in them that they would construe it as a valuable use of their time to take on someone whom they've never even met.

Speaker 2:          02:50:25       But somehow they're pissed at you and they think it's a worthwhile cause to trash talk you all that. Well, that's a weird thing, like even if they have a valid point, there becomes some sort of weird symbiotic slash parasitic relationship with the person that you're criticized, like you are inexorably connected to them. They are your enemy. You think about them all the time and by virtue that you become part of them or they become part of you. That's the weird thing about thinking, right? like when you're on stage and you are giving a lecture, one of the more amazing things that happens when someone is on stage talking about something is you allow them to kind of think for you in the sense that when you are, and that's one of the reasons why it's so important to be articulate and so important to be very aware of what you're going to say in advance.

Speaker 2:          02:51:13       the point where it comes out smoothly and there's good entertainment value to it, is that it's pleasing to listen to it for you. You're aware of how annoying certain speech patterns can be and you avoid those. you're aware of how compelling are the speech patterns can be new. Embrace those and so it makes it pleasing for the person to listen to so they can just sit back and listen to you talk about evolutionary psychology. Whereas when a person sucks at it, it's like grading. It's painful. It gets in your head. You're not connected with them, you're not allowing them to think about for you. Right. There's, there's, that happens with comedy too, like when someone is really good, like you see it like a great comic, like a louis c care, someone like that. when he's on stage and he's, he's really in the groove.

Speaker 2:          02:51:58       You're kind of allowing him to think for you. You're like letting him take the reins of your imagination and your mind and your visualization. But boy, it must be a tough job because I always think, what if you just had a fight with your wife? I've had that before piss right? But in 10 minutes I don't give a shit about your fight. You have to perform. Right. What kind of comedy you have? Like if you're sam kennison, it's probably better because your ankle onstage, you fuck. Like he would go onstage probably angry, pumped. I mean, it really depends on what you're trying to do and it also depends on like what the fight was about whether or not you were wrong or she was wrong. I would be way better off going onstage if someone wronged me versus if I'm wrong. Deb, you have I wrong.

Speaker 2:          02:52:43       Someone. Yeah. that's intrusive. Thoughts in your head. Okay. Yeah. Remorse. Yeah. Just in, in reexamining your own behavior patterns and finding fault. Numb and just fine. That's, that's the last thing I ever want to do is treat someone wrong and then go on stage. But if someone treated me like shit and then went on stage, I probably feel exonerated. You know, I'd feel like I'd feel I'd probably be energized, you know? Interesting. Very interesting. I'm not sure what, how much time we have left. We're done. It's too. We did three hours. Is crazy. Unbelievable. Next time we'll talk about, because you mentioned red. I guess it's related to regret. Yeah. We'll talk about the pSychology of regret. Psychology of regret. Old. Smart. All right. Always a pleasure, my friend. Thank you. Really, really enjoyed this conversation. Thank you so much.
