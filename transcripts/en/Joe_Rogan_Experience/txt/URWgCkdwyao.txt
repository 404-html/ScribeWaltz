Speaker 1:          00:00:02       I think we sold so many flashlights that does. It was impossible for them to sell more because everyone who listens to the show is a pervert. No way they'd tap the market. So what? I mean, you can only advertise with someone for so long. I mean, everybody listens to this show has heard about the fleshlight by now. It makes sense that they wouldn't be a spot or the relationship. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's not that they backed out. It says we ended it. We did it for a long time. So this is totally amicable. Cool. They're very nice guy. Coca Cola is, but you keep advertising, Jack. I don't, I don't. Not at run in any companies, man. I don't give a fuck. I tweet them still. I still talk to them. They're great guys. Good video that they just posted. That's crazy. I just couldn't keep up with the first product ever where they stopped advertising because that people, they couldn't keep up with the demand.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       That's true. I'm just joking around about that. I mean, it makes sense. The only, the only product ever is a fake vagina. That's the only one that they'd have to, they'd run out of materials. I don't understand what you're saying. That skin is rare. You know how they make that skin? Yeah. It's actually a food based, um, uh, product. I'm chewing on one right now. It's like, it's not really like a plastic, it's almost like you could almost like digest it with your body. It's really weird. You got to check out the, they just posted a video. Just go, what the fuck that I walked in? What did we walk it? Let's not, this isn't even a real sponsor. We're actually sponsored by on at.com makers of a Alpha brain, shroom tech, shroom tech, sports room, tech immune. And uh, also we recently got hacked, ladies and gentlemen, we got hacked.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       They got in, got ahold of some encrypted data and um, that you could, it's all explained it. ana.com forward slash breach. Uh, and because of that, they're offering an 18% discount off of everything for the next couple of days. So you just use the code name, got your back. People are, uh, very bummed out over there that someone hacked into the system. But that's just the way it goes, man. If you're, if you're online, someone can get you those little script kitties, those bad motherfuckers. Apparently it wasn't the best setup at on it. They've radically improved it because of that and they feel terrible about it. She said they just didn't know. It's a fairly new company, but I've been hacked three times. Just a gas station this year and you know, I mean I've had to change my, all my shit gas stations all the time. Something happens when you run your card through that thing and they can, they need to stick.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       Yeah. When you slide it through the, and when you run your card through and then you put in your, your zip code, apparently some of them are rigged and some of them just copy your information like, and then they have to figure out which gas station it was, where were you when it happened, which machine did you use? And then they find out and go in the machine and find out who rigged it so they can be Rick. Bye. Yeah, it could be that. It could be a third party that transmits that data. It's really pretty sophisticated. It's, it's really nuts really. But there's a lot of money in organized crime and stealing credit cards is a big part of it. And so it's just fucking super common. If you're online, people are going to go after you. That's that discount also works on kettle bells and battle ropes. So all shit to become manly. Go get some. All right. And thanks to Alienware MMA for hooking us up with some dope laptops and go death squad.tv and pick yourself up some, some cat shirts.

Speaker 2:          00:03:26       So that's the kind of shirts that I like. Are you going to keep selling the first one? Uh, no, but I do have like a box of the old ones leftover that I may eventually put on sale. There's only like it like a hundred of them lot. The old one's dope. I like the new one. The old one. I would love it if you had that for sale as well cause I just think it's the shit that, that cat though was awesome. That cat is the future. Alright, you dirty pitches. Kat Von d is here. Buckled the fuck up. The real cat play the music Brian. So it can be official

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       experience. Joe Rogan podcast. There's a lot of shit over it on and talk, comment he about, I don't have to talk about all the products. Get it. Sometimes it just, I just half for a while there dude. I was very impressed with your enthusiasm and your passion during those commercials when the passion is still every time. Well it's just based on reality. It's based on the last me all the time. Dude is that shit for real people to ask me that all the time. I'm like dude, Joe would not be involved in some shit that didn't work. He's only involved in shit that works. Trust me, you don't take it every day at mine. If you, if you're interested in nootropics, there's a lot of stuff that you can get on your own and just buy it in bulk and it's way cheaper than doing this like what we've done.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       But just go Google it. It's, it's fascinating shit. It's vitamins for your brain. It works. You don't need that. You clever woman. No, you're on top of shit already. Imagine the tattoos on shroom tech. My friend Eddie Bravo is here with Kat von d because Kat von d actually wrote on Eddie browse chest, pull it up. I haven't shaved my chest in a long time, so it's kind of a Paul Stanley false tail leash. That's my grandmother. Wow. I love that Tattoo. That was three years ago, something like that. That is uh, my, what I think is the most impressive style of artwork. That reproduction of portraits.

Speaker 2:          00:05:33       Yeah. I saw this, I saw this girl last night that had her father on her arm as a child though. And instead just as this little child on her arm, and I'm like, has anyone ever tried to like it? Does it, is it messy? Is it weird when people are like, you know, like I tried to make him blink, you know, like as a baby and like fucker whipped the face and it's like, is that weird to you? She goes, no, this guy's cummed on it before and I made him lick it off and I'm like, what? Like that's just crazy. Like there's realistic tattoos.

Speaker 2:          00:06:04       I don't know what the hell he just said. I think Brian like you need to go take some medicine for a second. Then I'm like, damn, I smoke too much with too much. We get no, I think Brian did. You just went too deep. Right? You just got ran up a ramp covered in Vaseline. Definitely too much weight on my house. I have to deal with him by myself sometimes. I was trying to remember this crazy. I was trying to remember the story that happened last night, but then I was too stoned to remember it. So then I was like trying to stumble what telling his daughter just got a slow down side and the crazy it's going to be okay.

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       The crazy thing about how this tattoo came about was her shop is one was one block away from old legends. Remember that? Yeah. I pass by

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       legends is a, an MMA gym that I was in Hollywood. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:06:47       It was a kickbox. I'm just right down the street from your shop. So I would pass by to go home. I lived in north Hollywood. I would pass by to and from work all the time. It always your tech. I never saw your show, but I knew who you were from the billboards around Hollywood and shit. But I never, ever, not once thought about ever getting a tattoo for me. I just didn't think about it. I haven't, I know what happened. My Guy, Carson Hill, you know, I just, I have this tattoo artist who's awesome name, name is Carson Hill is an La fucking amazing, but I was, I'm cool with them. I'm only going to let him fuck with my shit now. That's what I was thinking. But then after like a year of just passing by your shop, I ended up in the u at the UFC in Dallas.

Speaker 3:          00:07:28       We were in Dallas and there wasn't shit to do. And I used to work for the UFC and I'm sitting here in my hotel room and to all my show comes up at Alma awards. It's like, oh, I was there. My mom, it's like one. Yeah. So I'm watching this, the Alma awards, is that the Latino celebrity awards or whatever, and I'm watching that, you know, meet, be being Latin, you know, I'm like, Oh shit, I didn't know that white dude was fucking half Mexican, like actors are coming up and rock stars. You're talking about me. I'm like, oh no, no, no. And then, and then, and then Kat von d comes up and I'm like, Oh shit, she's Mexican. Holy Shit. I didn't know I was born in Mexico, but my family's from Argentina. So I am Latino, but I'm on mic. Yeah. So at that point, your family's from Argentina.

Speaker 3:          00:08:05       Yeah. Wow. That's cool. Yeah. So at that point, let me, let me finish this real quick. So at that point, now she's in my head, I might think, oh, she's Mexican. So that was Friday afternoon, Monday, first class after class. It's 11 o'clock at night. I'm driving pastor shop. It's closed up and I'm thinking, oh, wild hair. Just delusional thought. Hey, maybe I could get her to do a tattoo on me and film it and put it on my show. They can like, like she would actually do it. I'm thinking for 10 seconds. I'm thinking that's a good idea. But then as I made a right on Santa Monica Boulevard, I'm like, she's so famous. She would never do that. I'm like, what a crazy dumb thought. I go home, take a shower to get a late night bite to eat at kitchen 24 by myself. I just walked in. I'm quite good. Yeah. Sat there

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       and this girl comes up to me that I knew from a long time with Jason's ex-girlfriend, Jason Chambers. Ex girlfriend comes up to us, Eddie, what's up and she gives me hugs. Oh Shit. And she looks at me and goes, you should let Kat von d tattoo you. I'm like, that is crazy. Because I was just thinking that an hour and a half ago. That's insane or whatever. I'm like, that's a pretty crazy. You're like, tell us what happened. And then she goes, no, but I'm serious. I could actually get you on the show. I'm like, what? He goes, yeah I work on the show. They hired me. That shit ain't real. Just interesting that you came in writing on that vehicle because we wasn't really, honestly would have probably worked more against you than for you but somehow you want eat it. But she was bros with the casting director and she goes to casting director loves USC. Well she did. She did get me on the shot and for that I am grateful for you all. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          00:09:49       So she's funny. Winship worksite Wayne when you have some weird ideas and all that stuff here it becomes reality.

Speaker 4:          00:09:53       The next morning I meet the casting director and he said let's do it cause he's a big UFC fan and I was just right there on the show and you know what they originally she got, they go, cat is very picky on who she does tattoos, what's true. So she doesn't pick you. Will you go with the other two? And I said No. You on the fence at all? Um, well, you know, it's when we would film the show if there was like a screening process, so like I would get these lists of different ideas and peep, peep requests I guess. And so I would, based on the artwork, I would filter through and do the ones that I knew that I was capable of or I'd be excited about. Um, but they wouldn't really tell me much about the person come in because they want it to be all natural on camera and stuff. So I didn't know. I don't, I think a new, very minimal other than your name. I didn't know. She didn't know. She just for, they said no. Very strange. Yeah. I said I wouldn't do it. I felt that was so crazy that I thought of it that night and an hour and a half later, some chick makes it happen. I thought it was so crazy that I said, no, I won't do it unless cat does it. I'm not interested. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:10:52       Yeah. That is really odd when things like that happen because there's no denying it that like statistically put that shit on paper. How crazy the thought you'll store into your head on paper and then meeting. Well, what are the odds of that? That's like fucking millions to one. It's almost like they're, the story of your life is like the DA. The writers are working on it last and it's just getting shittier and easier for things to happen. It's like instead of big, some complicated fucking Warren peace, epic have, you know, a complicated, I do 20 personalities. No, I just think about some shit and the next day you get a phone call. It's like an hour, hour and a half late. Imagine if you had, imagine if you had like a bunch of magic gifts and you did know about them and you would just use it. I'm on tattoos and shit. When you could even maybe fly or breathe under water or something, you know, like you might've had a magic gift and you, you made it happen. You're like, maybe get a handful of those in your life. I told him. And you just decided to do it on make it happen. Yeah. It's crazy actually when you think it, it

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       would even if you had like a little magic, like the ability to make something happen, a few gifts like that in your life, you're really not gonna be able to do anything that's truly supernatural. I mean it would have already been done already. So like when you look at someone who's got like a tattoo is actually one of the best things you can do. You know, get something that's permanent artwork on s on your skin. That to you, I know means an incredible amount. And to get it from someone like her and to get it all in like one bit, that's really is better than like most magic tricks

Speaker 4:          00:12:21       that you know. Right. It's fucking incredible. I was trying to tell the stories, the producers, they didn't want to hear that shit cause they didn't want to hear that. One of the chicks that worked on the show like pulled the string, they didn't want it to make that part of the show. And the second is breaks the halls of reality. Yeah. They, so they, I was telling that story. I'm like, I got an incredible story, but they got it. We don't want hear that story. Oh, that's a great story. Why wouldn't they tell that story? Because then it shows that someone got dragged in and pulled strings. I think it's smarter on the, I mean, you know, the, the reliability on that in comparison to your, your actual story, you know, like what you do and what it took to get you there and the meaning behind the tattoos a lot more, I guess.

Speaker 4:          00:13:00       Um, you know, it resonates with the viewer much more than saying, oh, this is a Hollywood moment. I was at fucking, you know, cafe. Think of it as a Hollywood moment though. I think for him it's just a crazy piece of synchronicities. Yeah. And I think we ended up actually talking about that kind of stuff anyway, like throughout the, yeah, I was, I may have told you that story before we file for you. A big fan of synchronicity. Do, do a experience in your life. Yeah. Oh, I'm a big fan of being the master of your own reality. I think, you know, it's not so much about wishing your way through something or manifesting it, but you know, I think certain mental attitudes and mentalities that are, are more productive than others.

Speaker 1:          00:13:38       Well, we know that certain attitudes, I mean you, you've talked about it like that John Sarno back thing. Like if you have like some sort of, uh, like you, you could be upset or angry at things and have a bad back and think that you're bad back is actually like an injury. So it's not even an injury. It literally is your own brain causing your body to not up and some sort of a crazy way that's painted deprives, I don't know the exact science behind it, but when you have some serious stress in your life somehow, this is a theory that I heard. I didn't make this up. Your body, the pain is real. Your body will suffocate your, or deprive oxygen to the, your back muscles and then they get really sore and tight. That's what happens when you get nervous or stressful. That's the theory, you know, it Kinda makes sense because I have, I have, uh, a backstory as well, but I don't want to get into that.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       But I believe it, that's a long story. We got to, we're here to talk about, my thinking was that, you know, you really do change a lot of shit with your mind. I mean your, your mind just in the things that you come up with, like your artwork. Do you mean it doesn't, it doesn't ever feel like sometimes like where were the fuck is this coming from? This is almost like, like it's coming out of nowhere. It's coming into your creativity, you know, it's coming out of this weird place in your mind. Then all of a sudden it's manifested itself in this beauty. These, is it ever like freak you out?

Speaker 4:          00:15:01       Um, I don't know if it freaks me out. I just get excited about things, you know? And I mean, I dunno, I'm in love with my job. I love, I mean, I can't even call it my job. That'd be so weird to say that, you know, or I guess I'm the luckiest person on the planet. But yeah, I think it's just more, um, perspective really. I think for year, well, you know, I've been tattooed since I was 14 years old and I got into my first hat two shot when I was 16. Um, illegal. We obviously, and I never went through like a traditional apprenticeship or anything like that, but then, um, this, this funny idea for a TV show happened when I was like 21, 22 and it changed the dynamics of things. You know, at the time I was drinking and partying a lot.

Speaker 4:          00:15:36       And so I'm sober now, but, um, it was like, I almost had resentment towards people, uh, you know, after doing like a lot of the same stuff over and over again, and the expectations that come in and kind of like rapes the art at times, you know, because you just want to, I mean, for me, I just wanted to create, I just wanted to draw her tattoo and do my best and then, you know, the story behind the Tattoo and all that. It just, it, it gets pretty heavy after a while, but then, uh, you know, something flipped and I saw each opportunity or each tattoo as an opportunity to connect with people, you know? And I think, I think I'm always looking for that. You know, I, I sound like a Hippie, but like, I like making people feel good about things and about life, whether it's about death or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:16:18       It does sound like a Hippie, but it's beautiful. But you know, it's like, it's, it's a weird thing that we, we mock stuff like that. I don't, I mean, I just, I'm, I'm locking myself more than anything because I catch myself sounding that way. I do as well. Yeah. I catch myself sounding like a retard. I'm like, what are you talking about? Idealistic fool or ethnicity, but that would be the best way to live if we all could figure out how to tune in like that and everybody could, I feel like I'm always at my most creative when I'm being generous and kind and nice to as many people as possible. Yeah. Experienced, uh, you know, a, a good connectivity with all the human beings interact with. Totally. You feel better. You feel like it's working better. Why don't you recognize your power as it? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:57       Individual, you know, and I think like intentions are really important. You know, there's like this, this little thing that I do and I think I've only told like, uh, like one person about it. At the end of every tattoo, I put this paper towel on the Tattoo and I, I put like witch Hazel, which is like a natural astringent and stuff. And it's like, I always like hold my hands over it for a minute and I do think that the client, most of the time thinks I'm just like cleaning it off or something. But in my mind I'm thinking like several words then, and this is really going to sound like a crazy, I dunno, like Voodoo hippie thing, but I just think these three words and um, and it's like a transfer of energy and whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       Well, the three words, oh, I'm telling you, you can't tell me the three words really where they secret. Yeah, I'm on. They're just words. Why would you know it's impossible. The color matching, it's impossible to collection. It's like Rainbow Chicken Salad.

Speaker 6:          00:17:52       No, I want to hear it. Why can't you tell us? It's just words. Just words. Just kidding. Well, I mean, I think that would help people. You fire them up whenever they started doing that with their life.

Speaker 4:          00:18:04       Well, I mean [inaudible] mantras and stuff and you know, whatever works for you. If they want to try the Kat von d mantra, it's so successful shirts, then forget it when maybe you have some magic. She like, you have it up. Do you have magic? We all have magic. But, um, no, the purpose of being is that there's like intention behind every, every everything you do. And um, and I think that's really important because there is like a physical aspect of energy, you know, when people are like, oh, like vibes and all that stuff, there's actual energy that you're putting out into the world. So,

Speaker 6:          00:18:31       and focus, I mean, we all know when someone's not focusing on us, when you're having a conversation, when they're looking at their phone or doing something else. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:18:38       Meet people and they're just like, they're just dickheads or they're angry or they're having a bad day or it's hot or whatever. And I have like witnessed it before where I can like bring presence or positivity into a situation, you know? Or it's like, uh, I recognize my power to do that. And it's like, I remember one time I was driving down the brand, like I got a, the chick behind me wasn't paying attention and she totally crashed into my car. And then the guy behind her wasn't paying attention and he crashed into her and his airbags went off and all this shit, you know? And I'm like, my car is like pretty stealth is not going to get, I don't even think I got a ding on it, you know? And the cars behind me were just like tin cans and I just remember going to getting out of the car. I mean I'm wearing like full leather and just like you can just like, you know, and that could be pretty intimidating and I'm like, oh, okay, I'm going to consciously like make these people feel okay. You know? And like she rolled down her window, she's like, oh. And I remember going, Hey, are you okay? And just like looking at her and I, and like asking her if she's okay and she, she just like softened and after like what kill me.

Speaker 6:          00:19:33       Yeah. By the end of the crazy gang banger check ham damage. Yeah. If I was a check I'd be so bummed out if I remember when did you and the and to know afterwards we were all laughing about it. I think that we have the power to do that. Most people get all like up in arms about things and I just realized I wrote something and when I was a kid that the nothing has any meaning other than the meaning that you give it. Yeah, just totally and you could force things to be positive. If you can force all negative situations to be opportunities for growth, you know you can, you can, you can live your life like that. Totally. Where it can be a fuckhead just slam it into walls everywhere and, and live in misery. Never figure it out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You forgot your first tattoo when you were 16

Speaker 4:          00:20:14       I got my first to one was 14 actually. Holy was it good? Yeah. I still have it. It's like a little j on my ankle. It was for my first love ever and we did it for like three years and wow, that's intense. Yeah. Run, ran away. Like, who does the cross the country in a greyhound bus. How old were you when you did that? Uh, but then I was 15 when I'm all across and then I was already tattooing and stuff. So Jesus Christ, yeah, you got now you could put a z under it and, and put 99 problems in quotes and I don't know that, but I just tell people it stands for Jesus or just kidding.

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       Just kidding. That's funny. Yeah. Wow. That's a really young age to be

Speaker 4:          00:20:55       traveling. I know my portrait Aaron's man and I had a hard time, like, uh, I think forgiving myself for a long time because I'm really close with my dad and stuff. He actually like lived with me up until recently and um, he got his own place and I was pretty bummed about that. But yeah, at the time I was like, Oh, you know, I never want to hurt anybody's feelings. I just really felt like the need to do this, this thing that my family didn't understand, you know, and they're from a different culture, like I said, and stuff. So they weren't really prepared for it. You know, they just seem like tattooing, oh my God, you're like a hoodlum or gangster, a drug addict or a hooker or whatever. Yeah, I was none of the above.

Speaker 5:          00:21:27       So they never put in their head, you're doing tattoos. Boom, you're going to be some crazy famous check.

Speaker 4:          00:21:33       No, I mean, you know, and we were, we lived a really isolated world. Like you know, the way we were brought up was not very Americanized. It also like, which, which I'm glad because I feel like that that's really honestly the one things I credit to like being able to do all things I've done is just like the discipline. And you know, the three of us, my brother, sister and I, we were all like classically trained on the piano since I was six. And um, you know, two hours a day we had a practice and when we would rather be like hanging out and stuff and we were like waiting for it to like afford like video games and shit like that. So, so I drew all the time and spent time with my family and stuff and so for that I'm grateful. I feel like that discipline really plays into like executing ideas. You know, I have do millions of ideas at all times, you know, and just like, I think a lot of people have ideas and they just think it's, I don't, they've been programmed to think it's not like a table or something, which is silly to me.

Speaker 5:          00:22:21       Yeah. Well there's that Hump that you have to get over in associating pleasure with getting things done.

Speaker 4:          00:22:26       Yeah. And also I think too, it's like people's idea of success is so warped, you know, it's like they base it on money or status or fame and, and, and to be honest with you, when I started tattooing, I didn't even know it was a job. I just knew it felt organic and it felt like natural, not, not, it didn't come to me naturally. I worked really hard for it, but it felt like this is where I was supposed to be. You know, and ever, and this is granted before like a television show and stuff. It was, you know, I just came from Disneyland. It was like if I were to have gotten to design back then like, you know, you don't get happy smiles and stuff, you know, I had so many Julia Roberts moments going into stores. It's like, can we help you? You know? And I'm just like, oh, like I could buy this place. Like I bet no.

Speaker 5:          00:23:04       So they just immediately judge you. That's our common theme

Speaker 4:          00:23:08       when I was younger. Yeah. I mean nowadays it's so like embraced, you know, I mean if my dad who was super anti tattoos and it doesn't have any or anything, um, you know, it took 10 years of me tattooed cause I, I started tattooing on that TV show when not after 10 years of tattooing. So it took a television show for my dad to actually, um, you know, acknowledge the fact that I wasn't like not a loser, but you know, like that I wasn't throwing my life away. Then he's like, oh, and sometimes it takes that. I don't hold that against my dad. I mean, I don't blame them. Really.

Speaker 5:          00:23:37       Yeah. You've influenced a lot of checks and like how they look like you've, you was our first one that like pop

Speaker 7:          00:23:46       through and boys, Joe the first one who was like a really hot chick who just tattooed herself the fuck up. It's like, Whoa, this check went for it. And, and, and, and guys were like, I like it. I like it. And then boom. Then there was a wave of them. It was you. And then it was like everywhere you look, there's this crazy tattooed up girls. Like the percentage of it, I don't know what, I don't know. I'll, I'll put a number on it. Increase by like 30, 40, 50%.

Speaker 4:          00:24:12       It went from however minimal amount of women tattooed to like one out of three women had, have tattoos in America and that was like back at sea. Uh, I remember that stat when I did the Ellen degeneres show, which was like years ago.

Speaker 7:          00:24:24       That's hilarious. Do you look at the stats? Like we're winning, we're taking over them? No, no, no, no, because I never, I,

Speaker 4:          00:24:29       well, you know, I mean, I have friends that have no tattoos and they're like, feel the need to get one. I'm like, I don't know. Like, you are where you are, you know? It's good. I mean, I get tattooed for myself personally. You know, it's, um, if anything, it's kind of, it's kind of a drag some to, I don't really feel like, you know, always talking about my tattoos I get when I'm going out and stuff, but it's also a positive thing, so I can't complain. You know? I love art, so.

Speaker 7:          00:24:52       Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a weird thing with people if either they either have them when they don't have them. If they don't have, they could never imagine. Oh, can never imagined, never imagined drunk something. It's just a tiny forever aside girls, they owe you big time. You blew that, that company up. Right. Well, that whole look, yeah, they need a worship. You

Speaker 4:          00:25:11       Dude, the, the, the guy who came up with that whole concept, but a while ago.

Speaker 7:          00:25:16       Do you feel weird about that? And like that you've, I mean, that's gotta be a strange thing to have so much influence.

Speaker 4:          00:25:22       Um, you know, I think, uh, I may not have recognized it when I first started, um, you know, being in the public eye or whatever, it's as, as that until I got sober, I think I really started recognizing that and it became important to me. You know, I'm pretty PG 13, just by nature, you know, I'm pretty squeaky clean. I don't, you could take my phone and go through it and find pictures of my cat and stuff and probably not anything incriminating. But, um, um, I, I like the idea of like, uh, putting that good, good stuff out there. You know, like all my books and everything, I, it's, it's really easy for me to talk about my downfalls or like my issues are not struggles cause that sounds like a murder or something. But like, you know, the, the, the Shit I've experienced it in hopes that, I dunno, people would feel less alone because I know what it's like to feel that way. So, you know, I dunno.

Speaker 7:          00:26:13       That's what a lot of people say about people that are covered in tattoos. And if you'd never, I have two sleeves, if you in case you think I'm being an asshole, they, they feel like a lot of people don't have tattoos. Feel like you're covering something up.

Speaker 4:          00:26:26       Oh yeah. I remember doctor drew and I had a conversation about that cause he, um, I love this book that he wrote. Um, and in it talked about how tattooing is like a, a form of narcissism, not unlike a level of uh, oh, I think I'm awesome, but the opposite, which is narcissism just the same. But um, you know, like it's, it's a reflection of what it's a on the inside and I don't really necessarily see it that way because that to me, yeah, there's some tattoos that hold meaning. Like I love my dad, I got a portrait of my arm that's self explanatory. But there's other stuff I like my friends who don't know how to draw, like tattoo me. It looks like a drunk in three year old did something. And I love it because it's just fun and it's cool. And I don't really care.

Speaker 4:          00:27:04       You know, you let your friends draw on you. I let them tell to me, which is bigger, like a bigger deal. Yeah. But I'm done to Drew's is silly bitch. I love him too, but he's a silly bitch. I need to get him on the podcast. I saw him the other day at the gas station. Get them on, I'll get them on. I, you know, he's been involved in that scandal for influencing the idea that people bought some certain drugs off label, like saying touting their sexual benefits and stuff and then we'll talk crap about marijuana or people smoke pot and it, he'll say silly things like that. The horribly addictive it is. And it's all just nonsense. I don't, you know, I haven't, like I said earlier, I haven't known to television and it was 16 years in March and I'm pretty adamant about not watching television.

Speaker 4:          00:27:50       Um, my point, I don't know, but, but, but you know, I get what you're saying that I can't tell you why you're getting, you can't say that. You're just not enjoying the art. He can't, I know people love their tattoos and love it for the person and you know, yeah. Like I do. I of course we all have issues and stuff. I have no problem like wearing my heart on my sleeve. And I mean, I've actually gotten a lot of shit for that, you know what I mean? In the past and stuff with relationships and I just don't, I don't really live in that world of regret or really giving a fuck. So, you know, I just hate absolutes like that, like, and how you have to be the up, you have to be this, you have to do that. It's, it gets silly with certain things.

Speaker 4:          00:28:25       I mean, I think no one's perfect either, so I feel like, you know, I can see the goodness in everything. Even the stuff I don't necessarily agree with, you know, I guess I tried to at least, right. Yeah. Yeah. I just, I would, I would like to look at things that way. I would like to look at people with tattoos and just, you know, I don't know why anybody got him, but I look at them and go, wow, I hope you like it. I hope it's something that means something. You would hope. It's something everybody had for whatever reason, wants to immediately try to figure out what was fucked up with you that made you get to the place where you enjoy that like totally corporate and working in a cubicle that's miserable. And there's like suppression of like, of creativity. Like, man, that's such a waste of life energy.

Speaker 4:          00:29:08       You know, like imagine if everybody was free to do things like, um, as they, you know, like, like I was talking about earlier, people's idea of success. It's like, imagine if you didn't, you weren't bound by like everybody else's idea of that, you know, like if you could settle for a job that paid less but you were completely happy. I mean, my dad and I, we used to argue about this all the time because he's like, you know, you didn't go to high school. And then it's like, yeah, I know dad. I know, but check it out. Like you went two years of school and you don't like what you do and you're struggling so hard. And my dad comes from a medical background and stuff, but um, and I was on

Speaker 7:          00:29:42       my way to work every day and I walked down like the tarnished fucking Hollywood stars, you know, like just walking. I'm like, oh my God, there's like a bunch of punk rockers there. And it's like, ah, it's just, life is good. Like I love it. I don't, you know, and, and if I wasn't getting paid, I'd still be happy. There's a documentary that Warner Herzog just put out. It's called the happy people a year in the taiga. It's these people that live up in Siberia and how happy they are. And there's like no depression. Everybody just does their work and all their whole life is struggle. Their whole life is all they live off the land almost completely any entirely trapping hunting. And uh, they're, they're in fucking Siberia. There's only one way to get there. You have a couple of months we could take a boat. That's it. Otherwise you've got to get flown in.

Speaker 7:          00:30:26       There's no roads to get up there and these people are happy as fuck. They're just up there, you know, like shooting animals, living off the land, growing their own vegetables. They have to work hard in the spring and summer to prepare for the winter and then they prepare for the winter like smoking fish. I mean every day no one has a job every day they're working like securing food for their families and storing it up so they can make it through the next winter. I mean, it's amazing. It's not really that different than living in Hollywood and people who do that in their own ways. It's just, yeah, it's just more, I feel like it's more than what that, yeah, it sounds so much more simple and like less thought about like here it's like the stress of getting to work and fighting three hours of traffic to get to a job that I don't respect her love and you know, it's there, you're still suffering or whatever for something.

Speaker 7:          00:31:14       You know what I mean? Well, something happened somewhere along the line somewhere along the way. And Society and our culture moved way faster than the human body did. And all of a sudden jobs required you to sit still. They required you to stare at fucking unnatural light. They required you to enter in things and you're fucking backwards and you're doing it all day every day. Like the body's not designed for that. The body's designed to do with these fucking people in Siberia are doing, it's designed to go out and kill Caribou and, and you know, have dogs chained to trees and they keep the bears away. I mean that's, these guys are happy as fuck and this is the real way we're supposed to live. It's crazy. They hate it. Well they don't though. See what I'm saying is that like we all have our little receptors I think are set up for road to reward us for certain experiences.

Speaker 7:          00:32:02       I don't think we're set up any different than the people that lived when you had to live like that. So I think the only way to really not feel lost is there's no fucking movie star status when you're in Siberia. There's no front of the line of the club generated. There's no bullshit. There's no nothing. There's no head of 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu. There's no standup comedian. There's no nothing. There's get a fish. You got to get a fish because we're going to fucking die in the winter if you don't, and everybody does that, but yet they're all happy and shit. They, there's, even when you were a kid and you like you like thought of like where you were like, well, we'll never, I'll never live there. I'm never going to move there. I'm not. I'm never going to out of this class

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       and they're never going to get out of this situation. This is where I'm at. Well, for them it's a reality where they're surrounded by nature and woods like there really is no alternatives, so they have no delusions is no ridiculousness in their life and the truly in the moment living like people were living 10,000 plus years ago. Yeah, that's how we're supposed to live. So we're fucking ourselves up. If they had TV bullshit. How long do you think it would take one generator TV? They'd be out of there in a minute. The kids were like, what are we doing out here? Yeah, going to MTV, Kat von d would change the way they all look mommy. And one month they'd all want tattoos. They'd be a make it homemade tattoos of beaver teeth and shit. They would start that dude the Siberia.

Speaker 1:          00:33:24       We were at the, uh, the coffee place and uh, we're having small talk with the Nice lady behind the counter and she said, oh, I had a house sit this weekend. It was terrible. They didn't even have cable, no Internet. And me and Eddie were like, well, but we were being serious. Whoa, whoa. No cable. What the fuck? So what do you use antenna? That sucks. And then Eddie goes, well, at least he got the Internet. And she's like, no, no, they didn't even have the Internet. He's, what is thought TV? You can just get on the Internet. These guys don't even have, they don't even have electricity in. They're happy. They don't have electricity, man. They just don't know. They get a little bit of gasoline that they use for their snowmobiles and their chainsaws and that's a wrap. That's it. They probably think they're bawling like the lower class of them who lived in the hills and there's no class man.

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       That's what's crazy. They all live in the exact same houses. They don't even use windows man. They don't use windows because windows are too hard to carry around. So they build these houses at a log and then they cut holes in the logs and put plastic and nail plastic in place. It bears, bears rip them apart so often those damn bears, I swear. What are they going to get class anyway? What's hard to transport? They could bring shit. They got of chainsaws. They did. Then I'm making their own chain saws. They somehow or another got chainsaws either taking them on a boat or flown in. Somebody gave them a few tools, but they like make, they make boats with, with a fucking big piece of wood. It, just drop it down and hollow it out and make this canoe and let's like it's, that's how they live every year.

Speaker 1:          00:34:56       It does never change and yet their happiest fuck. It's really weird because to us it would be hell to the lady who works at the coffee place, she was bumming out that she didn't have cable. You know these motherfuckers are fighting them on the ski. Those like you've never seen because of mosquitoes are only alive for like a couple of months. They only got a couple months of Siberia to live. So they go gangster Chung. It swarms like you'll never seen anything like that. And they don't have any raid or any shit like that. So they have to the off, they have to cover themselves in tar. They make a tar with bark, they cook the bark down to a tar and then rub it all over their face with like oil. Fuck that. Fuck that Nigga. Fuck that shit. You've never seen mosquitoes like this. That's horror. Well that's one of the beautiful things about La. Say we're not supposed to be here, so life doesn't like it here either.

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       There's not that much here without without us. Some of the much water. There's very few bugs. Yeah, there's very few bugs. Like in the summers in, in the east coast, it was fucking terrible. You know? Especially like in, uh, in Boston, if you lived anywhere near a lake, anywhere near a body of water, oh, the mosquitoes were horrendous, man. They would fuck you up. Nothing like Siberia, Dude. Shit. Get, they're so happy. Yeah. But then again, you wouldn't be happy that way. You wouldn't be having, no, you wouldn't, not. If you know your life now, you love tattooing, you love, you know, you love them to find me. I mean, that's true. You could adapt. Yeah, of course you can. Do you think you could be a Siberian princess? I don't know if I'm wanting to be a princess, but be up there beaver trapping and shit. A warrior. Yeah. That'd be cool for the first couple of months a year. Fuck it. We go live with them until you realize they have no cigarettes. You're like, shit, I want a cigarette so bad. You're like that for two days and someone will give you some rolled up bullshit that tries to claims a cigarette, one issue of inked magazine would destroy that culture. Oh, anything would destroy it. Access to

Speaker 7:          00:36:52       some of things would destroy it. The idea is that it takes the body somewhere between 10 and maybe even possibly 20,000 or more years to completely change, like to completely change as far as like, um, uh, if for you to have a like a, like a genetic response to a and to adaptation to change to like 10,000 years for us is not a long, long time to a human being. But to species it's really not that much. So in order for things to like decide that they're moving in a certain directions, then they start changing. And that's one of the things that like the really controversial ideas behind autism is that autism is not necessarily a benefit, but that autism might be a new possible way that the brain can operate. You know, with some like really high functioning autistics. It's like what they're showing is like even though it's coming through in a disease and even know it, it beings with it debilitating social issues and shit like that. The positive aspects of it, like a kid that can look out a window and then draw the whole fucking skyline. Yeah. That what that is is representing the next stage of human evolution and that all the information that we're getting from sit in front of computers from interacting with each other in a way that no one has ever been able to do before. The brain is just going,

Speaker 1:          00:38:08       we're just red line in that motherfucker. Be able to buy that upgrade can imagine that just being like, oh, I was going to be available Bryan Hill. It's to be a pill. It's just going to be like, oh, we're going to fuck up your brain a little. Mostly most likely if you listen to like the real futurists, it's going to be some sort of a hybrid between a human and a computer. It'll be something where you'd be long gone by then, so, but I don't know about that unless I'm autism pills. I don't think so. I don't think you'll be long gone. I think you might experience

Speaker 7:          00:38:35       that and I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing. I think everybody's worried about every new possible technological thing as being something that separates us from each other or something

Speaker 4:          00:38:46       I'm worried about it is, it's just seems like a lot of, a lot of energy to waste on thinking about. I don't know. I mean, I then again, you know, I'm not like a big fan of like reading fiction, you know? I guess, I mean, you're not a fan of fiction. You don't, you don't even have a television, right? No. I mean I have like a movie screen that can watch movies. You watch movies but no cheese. Yes. I like documentaries and stuff like that. But you try to avoid TV? No, I do avoid TV. I don't like forced advertisement and it don't like, um, well, no, I don't want to complain. I just think that I will tell you what is you're on it. No, I mean I can, no, I come to you could, you can get, wait you mean, I mean I could easily, I could more.

Speaker 4:          00:39:26       It's easier for me to talk shit about like point out all the downfalls of my television show versus anyone else. So like in vague terms I think that my problem with it or my, the reason that I stay away from it, aside from just being, I got too many ideas that I want to do and I don't have time but like is that I am too sensitive. So like I, I get like I get heartbroken by billboards. Like seriously, there was like a movie, I remember there was like a movie and had billboards everywhere. I don't remember the movie. It was like, you know, Ashton Kutcher and some like hot chick or whatever and like, and, and, and he's like putting on buttoning up his shirt. She's like buttoning up and she's wearing his shirt and she's like getting out of bed and it says something about like no strings attached or like friends with benefits or some shit.

Speaker 4:          00:40:08       And I was like, like that's so sad to me. Like it's like the opposite. Like you guys just like have sex with each other and there's no like I could never, I, wow. And you almost kill fried looking at a billboard. I mean if I think about it too much. Yeah I do. So it's like I watch if I were to sit there and watch these television shows where the premise is to like, you know, there's a rich guy and a bunch of girls are fighting over this guy and they're using like their tits and ass too as, as qualities. It's, it's, it's disheartening. So I mean I sound like an old lady because no you don't. I get it. Good city. I feel that way. Like an banded circuit city. It's depressing to me and I get sad. There's just an absence of true love. And then I guess the romantic and we get saddened by that. Same with music. I can't listen to music. That's too, yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:40:55       you can definitely get affected by some shit. Especially if you don't know. It's common, like any flipping through the channels, there's some intense fucking movies on like that you, you know, you're just flipping through. Like, I want Straw dogs last night. Do you know what Straw dogs out? I haven't seen it. This is insane rape scene in this movie where I turned on the movie right when it was going on. I was like, what fucking movie is this? But for the rest of the night I was all fucked up. I mean it becomes a, I don't want to say anything about the moment. The movie's very good. Um, but it's, it gets really fucking intense. Whereas like the rest of the night it was fucked up and I ordinarily wouldn't have watched it, but I didn't know what it was. I was just pressing buttons and then boom, it came on and fuck my head for the rest of the night.

Speaker 4:          00:41:40       Yeah. And it's weird. I don't think it's like, we just kind of like tea we, and I think it's like people become so desensitized and I guess that's the part that I have a problem with. You know, like people, you can see it on Twitter you said on Instagram. So every so negative in me and, and take any opportunity to like knock people down. I've never been from that like train of thought, you know, cause my parents just raised this a lot differently and stuff and so it like I get like I get butthurt really easily. That's better.

Speaker 7:          00:42:05       No, you'll, you'll attract better people that way and you'll figure out a way to get away from the people that

Speaker 4:          00:42:10       Oh yeah. I mean it's, it's like giving that any values just as bad I think. But I just want people to be nice. That's all.

Speaker 7:          00:42:18       Oh, almost all really expressive people. Anybody who's a artistic or very expressive, there's always some extreme sensitivity. And the other side of it is just, is just, you're intense about everything. You're probably intense about love. You probably tense about, yeah. I mean that's why he cry when he seen Ashton Kutcher thing. It's your intensity, your, your, your you, you take shit up to a higher level quicker than most.

Speaker 4:          00:42:39       Well that's probably one of the, everything's a symbol. And then I get sad about that. So, yeah. But I've been sad. I've cried during previews, depressing movies like good burger. What? I Dunno, here's funny over some sad thank you. Don't encourage them. Sorry, I'm just doing it. How can you say that? After all he's done it. But you know, then there's like those like moments of brilliance and people are inspiring and great and do awesome shit. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:43:08       well that's a, that's what we get off each other the most. That's the most beautiful thing that people get from each other as we, we, you know, we were inspired by each other. They're like, yeah, I love going to the music because I'm not musical. I can't do anything. So I love going and watching cause I feel, I feel like it, it fires me up again.

Speaker 4:          00:43:23       Oh, you go to musicals. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'd love to see music. I love to see people are forming, bands perform. I love to see dem. I love to see people do things that I have zero skill in that I was impressed with with our last exchange of emails with when we were like going back and forth on band recommendations and stuff. Cause I had no idea that you were into this, that kind of stuff. Well the funny thing is he, he emailed me and he's like, Hey, I want to know like what are your, what are you listening to you nowadays? I want to get some new music. And I'm like, oh man. Like where do you start? Give me a genre, you know? And so that turned me on to so many good stuff. And I was like, all right here, here's like 10 and then tell me which ones you like and then I'll know what kinds of I'll be, you're like genius playlist or another.

Speaker 4:          00:44:03       Oh Wow. That's cool. And then you're using Kat von d for use genius playlist. I love, she's got some great shit. Yeah. I'm going to tell you my, my Kat von d music story. Most people, well, most people don't know that. She has an amazing voice. She can sing her ass off and she's really shy about it. She's crazy. Shout about it. We have the true, well let, let me, let me tell you this. She doesn't like talking about it. No doubt about it. I just can't say like, Oh yeah, it is true. We're both working with the same producer, which is also her best friend. Danny is producing my stuff and he's messing with her to musically as well. So I'm at Danny's and we're working on some stuff and he goes, me and uh, me and Kat and Wes Borland from [inaudible], he's a guitar player for West.

Speaker 4:          00:44:45       It goes me and West, you're going to do a little benefit. So kind of, he really helped me out. Like last minute, I had a last minute they put together this, they're putting together this song lasts minutes, a cover and she's going to perform at this gay benefit, right? Yeah. It was for the, for uh, Linda Perry's, um, evening. We women. It's like awesome. Yeah. So Dan is telling me and Danny, he's like, man, we're trying to put together the songs because it was like less than 48 hours to learn the song. It was like that Bronski beat I Lebron TV and like, and I mean I ended up just like reading it from my iPad as I was turning until we fucked it up. But it was fun and it was great and stuff. But then I think I had been recording that night at Linda's and you were at Danny's and I was really excited because I had um, cause I had like gnarly stage fright issues like for the last year and stuff, just whatever.

Speaker 4:          00:45:30       And so I finally read the balls I guess to get over them and, and so obviously Danny is my best friend and I'm gonna be working on music. So I was like, Oh hey, I want to come over. It was late. I think it was like what, like almost midnight or something. Yeah, me and Danny are working on a set that, and Linda Perry, for those who don't know, she was the lead singer for four non blondes. She produced pinks second album, which went fucking skyrocket. So Linda Perry is a massive, like Christina Aguilera to the big APP. You're so beautiful. She did all the first thing I want to hear this

Speaker 8:          00:46:02       Linda Paris, right, right. Yeah. So she's working with cat now. They're writing some shit together. I'm at Danny's, she's all excited.

Speaker 4:          00:46:13       Quarter a song. They brought it over and then Dan, he's like, text me. Is it cool if Eddie Bravo is, I'm like, yeah, I don't care. I've just, just don't say anything about it. And then, but of course I had to be in the other room cause I was like, I'm not going to sit there and go, oh, you know how and where do you think or whatever. But yeah, she had to go to the next room. It's just like vocal. There wasn't like a produce track or anything. And then, um, Danny was all stoked, but he, he texts me, he's like, man, he's still talking about it. He liked, loved it. Then I'm like, aw, that makes me, has that. Danny said, yeah. So what, what ended up have you and told the story. I've told this story a bunch cause like the next day at school

Speaker 8:          00:46:45       do you can't tell you. Most of you guys don't know this,

Speaker 4:          00:46:49       but I was so impressed with her voice and the actual song, her and Linda Perry together. I feel with the right marketing. Of course it could. It could. It could. It could.

Speaker 8:          00:46:59       I think it could be huge. Could it be bigger than Paris Hilton? Single. I like that song a lot. I bet you did. Did she get that shit tattooed on your Dick and I will. Anyways, the song, the song they burn, Linda Perry did together. The first one that she bought over is amazing. What's it called? I'm talking about it yet. It's too, it's, you can't talk about it so she's just trying to send you hit. The bottom line is she's actually a great singer. Her voice is amazing. When I see your artwork, I think you'd be good at anything you wanted to be. You'd be amazing

Speaker 7:          00:47:30       at you if you can. If you can draw that well, I mean that's like some really high level shit. You could do that with anything. I really believe that. I believe that with anybody who's super awesome and anything.

Speaker 2:          00:47:40       How many bad tattoos do you see a day of people just coming in with? Like, I mean, do you, have you, have you ever seen one that you're just like, wow, that's the worst tattoo I've ever,

Speaker 4:          00:47:47       well, I mean it's a, there's such a big difference in like, um, like personal preference versus technical aspect of things. So like, I mean, there's some stuff that's not necessarily technically it's a, it's like everything else, like music, it's like technically might not be the best singer, but the Christmas behind it and, you know, blah, blah, blah. I mean, well, there's that style that, um, the, the, the what, what was the teacher Ed Hardy, that Ed hardy sort of style fit 1950s traditional stuff, which not that artistic, but that's all it is. A Sky like that loner art, you know, and I didn't understand it for a long time. My ex husband was like really into doing that kind of artwork and he's really great at it. There's an art behind the, you know, I personally am not inclined to do that kind of stuff, but I, but I appreciate it for what it is. So I don't know what I mean. I think I see a lot of great ideas, you know, and people often, and then you just see kind of a poor execution or, or, uh, an inexperienced execution as it. But yeah, I mean, I don't know. I'd see so many amazing things now that like, blow me out of the water. It's like, fuck, there's so many great artists nowadays. So

Speaker 2:          00:48:51       I'm permanently scarred from ever getting a tattoo again because of my tattoo. Because it was a free tattoo. Was somebody practicing for their first time? It took seven hours. You should have take one hour. God, I remember. I used to be that slow too. Yeah. And then I found out it's not even supposed to, it's like supposed to be an r for my last name and I found out it means waterfalls and now, so now it's like the ugliest tattoo ever with this Chinese letter. That means waterfalls, but it's probably smiling. Covered up easy. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:49:14       That's great. Yeah. You just get the shit lasered off son. They could do that pretty easy now. Especially like um, like it's not red. Red is apparently the most difficult. Coke Cola.

Speaker 4:          00:49:22       Yeah, it's got red. It's got red in it. Have you got oh is it? Yeah, it does it. Yeah. They could work that right. Easiest to count flu. I thought that was blue for some reason. It's written with the red is the easiest to get out. Yeah, red and black and then purples and greens. I think Greens are a little harder but it all depends on like how have you done it yet? Have you done the lasering off anything? Yeah, these are a couple of like this whole arm lasered. It used to be I got this tattoo and I was like 15 or 16. It was like the New York dolls, like cowgirl with a gun and then there's like a flag coming out of his, his bang and at the time I thought it was cool. I'm like, man, I have the Word Bang on my arm.

Speaker 4:          00:49:59       Get rid of it. That's better than waterfall. How long did it take? Well with like laser, you have to go for sessions. It's like super painful and stuff, but more painful than tattooing. Fuck yeah. Wow. Well I'm a woosie so I dunno, I can't handle it. Did you just, yeah. Yeah. You have tattoos all over your body and you're telling me that you're woman ask anybody at my short like 15 minutes, then I tap out like candy. Those are all 15 minutes after. No, this was all, a lot of them was under the influence of alcohol. So easier. But now that like back the day

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       does a Taser easier? Remember that one time where I drank too much or do I remember you saying that? It's hilarious cause I can just go through a Rolodex in my head of any moment that sentence could apply to I, he wrote a blog about my alcohol problem. No, no, I don't have an alcohol. I'm not an alcoholic, but I will drink a lot on special occasions and when I pass a certain point, the Indian comes out as Joey Dia says. And when the Indian comes out, for sure, I'm not going to remember any of the night. He's he blacks out. It's like, oh no. There's like, Ooh, I love you man. He's a great, he's a great guy. The problem is he completely checks out and he doesn't know where he is and he's, I mean literally is like a third of a mind controlled by like a demon from another galaxy.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       One Third Eddie and two thirds, some a demonic alcohol sucking demon from another planet, but weird. But you can always like, oh no, no, never even, I don't mean that. I mean demonic. I mean like possessed by the alcohol, just wandering around it. He doesn't know what happens until the next day when he sobers up and you have to tell them what happens. Like I, I can't, I, I've had to like get his hotel door opened by security banging door in Germany when we were supposed to leave bang on his door. Finally the door opens. Okay, we get the door open. Eddie is lying in bed with his cowboy boots on and the light is on and the smile, the light is on. It's completely, I just completely out cold Eddie. We got to go to the fucking airport. He's like, what's up? He just looks at me and the security. I was, hey, what's up? Yeah. Like I'm trying to find it out.

Speaker 1:          00:52:13       It was the worst story. That's not even the worst story. The car one car one is the worst. I talked to him, it was like I was having breakfast, it was like seven o'clock in the morning and the car was going to come at nine and he calls me while we were having breakfast. He still fucked up. I mean, he is fucked up, was to drink all night and walk onto the airplane and then sleep all the way back to like stay up all night. So, so, uh, you know, I go, uh, are you fucked up? Did you stay up on, I said, yeah, fuck yeah man, I'm a power through. I will power through. And so I go, okay, well we're leaving at eight 30. All right, you gotta, you gotta be down there for the car at eight 30. No, no problem. No problem. So I eat breakfast.

Speaker 1:          00:52:52       An hour and a half later I go out for, you know, wait for him. I don't want him, you know, I want to have sitting here 10 minutes later I'm like, okay, what the fuck is going on? So I talked to the guy was the valet. I go, Hey, is my car here? And the guy says, what's your name? I should Rogan. He goes, oh, Rogan already left. I go, no, no, no. Rogan is me. He goes, no Rogan already left. I go, what did he look like? Yeah. He said, well, he had long hair at the time, so long hair, tattoos. I'm like, that motherfucker. So I called him up and first of all, he answers the phone that just hangs up. It's like, realize this car and then then the phone, Wah, Wah. I didn't even know what he did. Wake up and I see you. It's Joe calling.

Speaker 1:          00:53:29       I'm like, what? I go, what's up? He goes, you took my car and I hung up and I were on the Autobahn and I tell the drag of, where are we going? Let's we'll go to the airport. I'm like, Oh shit. Then he keeps calling him that. That was the autobon. I don't know what it was, but we're flying us a regular, Huh? Well, it sounds like a good time. Yeah. It was handed to us. Yes. So then I woke up and I kept cards, sending it to my message, a am I answering service or whatever, and I had to figure out what the hell was going on. And then I finally answered. He's so fucking mad. I'm like, Holy Shit. I'm sorry. I have no idea what happened. I just woke up in the back of the car. I don't remember the whole night. I must have passed and just just jumped in, jumped in his car. This was like, it's like total, like if Eddie, there's a certain number of drinks where he gets over will just disappear and he's gone. The, the Aubrey story, the Texas was,

Speaker 4:          00:54:22       I brought that up. I wasn't, I was just going to bring up the end. He would also have to know, you know what else I found out? I found out my cat in Japanese means waterfalls, and then I'm like thinking something's fucked up with waterfall. Hecky in Japanese means waterfalls. I found out the other day then you should, you should be celebrating your tattoo. I didn't want to go chasing waterfalls this mind for some no. Need to know why. What's that song from? What was that? Bam, Tlc. TLC. There was a sweet song. I'm never going to walk in the ocean cause I might come out of Blob. Brian, you need to go outside and get some air. So what are your plans for your music? What's the plan? Well, you know, I've it, the coolest thing I think with Linda is like, we're just kind of, we're, we're moving forward without any, uh, deadlines. No, it was on the deadlines. We have goals obviously, but it's a, you know, like by summertime I think it should be done out, which is exciting. But I think it's like we not really congesting our thoughts with anything right now. We're just writing music without outside voices. No reference. Just, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:55:25       So you said you got over your stage fright, you're going to start doing live performances. Oh, Yay. Yeah. Yeah. I'm putting a band together. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to go on tour? Yeah. Yeah. Holy Shit. Wow. She's going to be a rock star watch. You're going to be a rockstar.

Speaker 4:          00:55:38       The term is so weird to me.

Speaker 1:          00:55:40       It seems like you can sneak it through from the back door just from just from having talent and being on TV. It's like you just went through.

Speaker 4:          00:55:49       I Dunno. I just, I want to do everything with even small things with a lot of quality. And so I think like with the music stuff, I just want to make it as, you know, uh, as good as possible for lack of a better description. But, um, yeah, so I think people will probably be pleasantly surprised in the sense that they're expecting me to fail as usual. So, yeah, I like it. People are expecting you to fail. I think people always expect you to feel like, you know, I think grilling. Yeah. I mean other than your friends, Avi, I'm talking about like, you know, yeah, I think so. Especially me. Cause I was on TV, so it's like, oh, you're just doing the, that's definitely true. But you have some success. They want it to be at. It's hard to get into music after you

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       already famous with for something else. It's tough. Yeah. So, oh, hello. Has Anybody ever done it? Well, Jamie Foxx, Steve Martin, sort of Steve Martin is bands pretty, pretty big for a certain kind of music. Oh, he does like just playing music shows, right? Yeah. Yeah, he does. He plays the Banjo and stuff. A bunch of like, you know, it's a certain style of music, but he's doing six. He's successful in that, you know. Hmm. Anybody Audie Murphy. Oh, that's right. And that's kind of like what my stuff sounds like. What kind of shit to you sound like? What does it, Linda and I both have like tried figuring it out and the dark Sarah McLaughlin kind of stopped it. Don't say that kind of stuff. I could never compare myself to anybody, but uh, yeah, no, it's just, she just calls it, uh, uh, powerfully put that x, which is, which is good power, powerfully put that egg. I think it's tragic and romantic, but there's like elements of classical music and and stuff and some electronic element. There won't be any show cro type. All I want to do is have some fun.

Speaker 6:          00:57:29       You don't know that song. [inaudible] stuff and listen, we're so mainly we take in the other direction. We're not scared to talk. Sheryl crow. That's a great song. It's a great fucking song. You don't like that kind of music? I just don't, I don't know. What do you listen to personally? Oh Man. Kent, Kent, Kansas. One of my favorite bands was a Swedish tea. I like a lot of Scandinavian music. I like a lot of metal and I like a lot of love, Depeche mode in the cure, shit like that. So a lot of obscure shit that people wouldn't be aware of. And then a lot of like classic shit like Susie and the banshees. I don't even listen to anything that's made before 1980 anymore of giving black sabbath black. I listened, I listened to some black keys. That's the only modern shit I'll listen to. And then everything else is old stuff. I've been listening. He's like Allman brothers. Oh, okay. I see what you're saying. I said before, sorry, anything after 1980 I'm like done. I'm done. Except the black keys. The black keys seem to have kept the soul like honey and honey, honey. Yeah, that's right there. My friends.

Speaker 6:          00:58:37       Oh yeah, sure. I go to some of the best shit ever. But I mean like modern bands that like you hear on the radio that are like big hits. Like I can't get into, I couldn't even tell you supermarket. Every now and then, that's the only time I hear music. I'm just shopping and I'm like, what the fuck is this? Is this something new? Just some weird, no, it would be some weird fucking auto tuned bullshit. And it's repeating itself over and over again. And I'm like, is this the new shit? Is this, is this like, is this popular right now? I feel like I'm some dude who's like an outlier like comes into town every now and then to find out what the folks are up to. That's what it feels like. And as I get older and older, it becomes more and more apparent. I can understand like especially like, I mean I like some like pop music I guess, but I, it's, it's,

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       it's hard for me to wrap my mind around certain things. Like how does that resonate with people? Because for me, I'm always, I love poetry and I love things that are so much more profound and uh, and I think people are hungry for that. You know? I think like, even though like a lot of stuff that's like really big right now is very superficial and whatever. But like I feel like there's definitely like, um, I think people are hurting and they want to relate somehow. So I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       Well, I, yeah, I definitely think that, but I also think there's like a lot of music to it. Some people just aren't even aware of. Of course, there's a lot of young kids today that don't even know what a whole lot of love sounds like when you hear it through like really good speakers. Yeah. But the, the day man

Speaker 4:          01:00:00       driving down a Hollywood and I seen these awesome fucking metal heads and they were like, Karen skateboards is like young kids. And they had like one at like a death shirt on and then we had like a motor head shirt on and I was just like, they literally rolled my window down and my friend Allison was and I'm like, Hey, I love you guys. And they were like, I love you too. Fucking long hair

Speaker 1:          01:00:20       does metal will never die. So cool. Yeah. I thought metal was gone in the 80s I thought I should do like obscure black metal

Speaker 4:          01:00:27       stuff that's like, you know it's, I dunno, it's cool.

Speaker 1:          01:00:29       It'll will never die. It won't. That feeling will never die because there's always going to be shitty parenting. You're never going to get rid of metal because you're never going to make people become good parents. You're always going to have people just up. Fuck yeah, they just want to pound on the wall, fucking scream and curse their circumstances and turn cross is upside down. Yeah. You're always going to have shitty parenting, so you're always gonna have back it. All that shit. I bet that shit is on a computer. I wrote Satanic lyrics like every song had. It either had to be about when I was in 14 1516 all the songs I wrote were nuclear war, anti religion, abs, demons, killing priests, love songs. Nothing about Lo. No, no, not until like I was 19 or it's in your defense though, when we were kids, we were growing up.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       You know, we're older than you. Probably don't recognize that Soviet Union threat feeling. Did you ever have that threat when you were a kid? Did you ever feel that? See, when we, when Eddie and I grew up, we were really worried that we're going to get an a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Everybody, oh yeah, Brad, bro, everybody did so close. So close. Dinosaurs roamed the earth. How dare you look. It's possible today. But back then it was, it was not just possible. It seemed probable seventies late seventies late seventies early eighties everybody thought we were going to war with Russia. That was a fact until Ronald Reagan and Chernobyl affected, effectively bankrupted the Soviet Union. That's one of the big things that brought it down. But when the Soviet Union fell apart, then everybody took a deep breath and relax. But until that happened, there was always this constant thread that they were going to take a solo war three were going to go. Yeah, they were great. They were in Cuba. I mean they were 90 miles from our border setting up missile silos. I mean there was a lot

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       of shit that went down during the Kennedy administration, so there was that feeling as, especially as technology increased, and then there was that star wars program that came on when they were developing these fucking things to shoot missiles out of the sky. They'd be like satellites that were launched up with lasers to zap missiles at a sky. That's like a significant part of the budget and significant part of like what Ronald Reagan was talking about when they were talking about national defense. So we were worried about going to war with Russia. It was constant work, kids, very popular song topic. It seems fucked up, right? It doesn't even make sense to you. It was a band called nuclear assault is bad. The song's called nuclear death, nuclear death. Just nuclear Dick Suck. Yeah. Nuclear Wild. Oh, there's a crazy, I'll have new holocaust off to put it up later.

Speaker 7:          01:03:04       Did you, have you seen that video Brian, that the Holocaust survivor or excuse me, the um, uh, the Hiroshima survivor made, he made a, a cartoon. You got to pull it up. Um, I forget the guy's name something. Ben, is he going to put it sad? Oh, it's crazy. Well, it's a cartoon that was written by a survivor from Hiroshima and it depicting how it was like, what the experience was like for the people on the ground. It's fucked up man. Cause even though it's just a cartoon, I mean just to watch it when, uh, after the, he can't handle it, you know, when to wash in front of us. The less I know better about really bad sometimes I dunno, I'll get sad. It's kind of crazy. And there's like 10 different countries or more that has nuclear weapons. I mean, how many have them?

Speaker 7:          01:03:50       Seven? I don't know. You just taking guesses over there. So, yeah, I mean, and then we know Pakistan, India, the UK, certainly, you know, in the Korean War, we don't think 18 Korean cities disappear. We did 18 that's why they fucking hate us, man. They're like, no more, no more of this bullshit. They just shut the shut themselves off from the world. Can you imagine that 18 cities disappear and it was no nuclear. It was all like what? Hydrogen bombs and Shannon, I dunno the bombs they is, but they made 18 they leveled 18 cities in Korea during the Korean War. She's crying. Shit, we don't, they don't talk about that too much. Yeah. Wrap your head around that. Try thinking about 18 American cities just disappearing. Yeah. Yeah. It's the whole game changed when you can fly, when you can fly and shoot shit from the sky. That's the game changer.

Speaker 7:          01:04:37       And it all happened all at once. Fly, shoot things from the sky and then almost right after that nuclear bombs, it's pretty nutty when you think about that because there was no fucking airport or airplane wars just a hundred years ago in the, in the early 19 hundreds were there. They weren't fucking flying everywhere and dropping bombs on each other. They started doing that in the 30s and the forties that's when like they started getting better at rocketry and then boom, 47 nuclear bomb, complete game changer. The whole thing takes less than a hundred years to go from the airplane. Being fucking invented to dropping nuclear bombs on people is a hundred years. That's nuts. Have you ever tatted a nuclear missile? I even thought of that. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       I think I have. I've really never even thought of that until just now. That is a crazy number that the invention of the airplane, it goes invention of the airplane all the way to nuclear bombs and it's in less than a hundred years. So essentially one lifetime we go from people stuck on the ground or in boats to someone who could drop a fucking nuclear bomb on your country. That's amazing. What a fucking weird jump in history that is. That might be the biggest jump in history that's ever been recorded. That, and I never even thought about it. And there's nowhere to go. Is there? Oh, I mean, I went crazy. We were crazy. Knowing where to go and move into Finland, Finland, a lot of death metal there. What do you love about them and it's easier to go to Alaska probably isn't so much cooler. Alaska is gorgeous though. We can make Alaska cool chef to have more cool people move up there. You're friends with the singer from him, right? Yeah. It's totally into that mother or that there. Are they from Finland? Finnish. They're like a, it's almost like a satanic love metal band. Right? How would you describe him? It means his infernal majesty. Oh Geez.

Speaker 8:          01:06:31       Jesus Christ. Someone needs to hold that Duke down. [inaudible] I think it was taken from my gun. Hold that down and make him take his pills. He spotted all over my couch. Poppy metal, like satanic. Love suicide. That's crazy. Yeah. Get them to do hill sprints. Maybe a sandbag workout. Be Good. Dig a hole for today. I want you to be, I want you to be happy. You're alive. I want you to dig a hole and then when you're done, when we can give you a cold drink, I'm going to feel awesome.

Speaker 6:          01:07:04       That's not bad. Why Finland? Why would you escape to Finland? Finland, Ace, go there once a year. If the shit hit the fan in America. Is that what you would do? I would say it's like there's not really anywhere to go really. What do you think about it? I think Canada is and move. At least you would find out what the fuck is going on for a little bit. Maybe a couple of years of safety before you had escape to an article. Back to the Siberians. Like do they even know about it? No. I'm guess what? They're just happy. They are happy, but you wouldn't be happy doing it. You mean you say you might be adaptive, but man, you would remember the internet, you'd remember driving around your bad ass. Carla's favorite songs on my book tour last year, halfway through my house burned down and demolished. You know, just gone down the street from Danny and I remember I went, I went on the rest of the book tour, you know, it was like a month or two after and went through Canada and I just didn't tell anybody. Just kind of, you know, hey, I'm here. And I literally had like what I was wearing and that was it. And then when I came back, you know, I had told cat the other cat, my assistant, like, I don't really want anything when I get back, I'm just going to live at, I have a gallery next door to my tattoo shop, it's like an gallery. And we

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       had like an upstairs area that was for stock, you know, and like probably the size of your bathroom or something. And like she, she went and got like a air mattress from target, which I was like, oh no, it's too much. It's too much, you know? But it was so weird having to, or it's too much. Yeah. It just, it was, it was easier to just being as simple as possible, you know? And you don't even want to air mattress, you're going, oh, sure. Got It. So I got it. So then I, I slept on an air mattress and uh, yeah, it was, it was fun. It was just like an exercise for you, like letting things go and, no, I mean I didn't, I never struggled with it like the from the minute I got the news, but um, but I mean I was in a clear place

Speaker 7:          01:08:52       even when I say exercise, I don't mean necessarily like a strain, but like a direct path that you chose to take a direct path of a minimum minimalist. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:09:01       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And let me know. I've done it like in other ways too. It's not a matter of depriving myself of punishing myself, you know, like, right. I was like celibate for a year. Like, oh Geez.

Speaker 8:          01:09:14       Oh my God. I'm glad for that. I'm just saying it's like being as he leaves, he's going to go beat off. No.

Speaker 7:          01:09:24       Oh, you don't know him. He's crazy. He's quick with it to be back in before we even need them. Yeah. That's ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          01:09:31       I love how we had it when I was at the time they were like, or like on purpose. I'm like,

Speaker 7:          01:09:35       well, first of all, I think that's way easier for a woman to do. Not just physically but psychologically cause there's more dickhead dude's a dickhead. Dudes are dangerous. Whereas girls that are paying the assay data, they're not, they're very rarely dangerous. It's not like the weird feeling of intimidation. Much more emotional and annoying. If they can get emotional, that's for sure. But it's not a, it's not like, like you, you've been beat up or anything. Like I know women who've been hit by men and then they're done with men for years. I mean that, that makes sense though to me. Whereas a guy taking a year off a sec

Speaker 4:          01:10:06       am I wasn't, you can't find a nice check. It wasn't about being reactive like to something like, well I got hurt. It was just more as making a conscious decision at the time match. If you had just like one year yeast infection, that was our mother wouldn't even go out.

Speaker 8:          01:10:22       Daddy's not even pay attention. I know we've looked everybody we lost. We lost you. Totally, man.

Speaker 4:          01:10:27       No, but you know, it was just, it's just like, uh, I dunno. Celibacy bores me.

Speaker 8:          01:10:32       Yeah. It just shows like he just checked out totally. He's thinking of his new songs, working on working on Jujitsu moves,

Speaker 4:          01:10:41       naughty show thing. As I've been looking at that girl's boob this entire, yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:10:45       Pretty Nice, right? It's pretty nice for Monica. I'm a mannequin. It's about as hot as it gets. She's pretty sexy. She's Brian's. All this stuff is Brian's. This has nothing to do with me. I, uh, I don't want to be judged by this. He's a silly guy. He's got a lot of weird shit really leave because I said no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He just has to probably smoke a cigarette or something. Oh, he's an odd duck. But we make an interesting combination. It's good. He's just trained fucking dude. It's hard finding someone that's strange, that also is kind of funny and knows how to run things. So we've got a weird little relationship. Me and that guy. Yeah. But going back to the Siberians like that, what about nuclear war? We're going to pass right on with that. I think I'm just fucking, I think a barrier.

Speaker 7:          01:11:32       It's like we were saying, I think they're only happy because they don't know about all the groovy shit. They don't know about iPhone. Iphone five iPhone five is going to be out in a week. They didn't know about that shit. I never drove. I never drove it. Yeah. See, you're all excited. You're thinking, I'm going to get my assistant to go get me one. You know, fucking Siberian dude's. They'd never drove a nice car. Never listened to a good stereo. They're only the only think they're happy about and they're chasing down beat pelts. That shit's ridiculous. I think it can be way more happy today, like in a way higher peaky or sort of a way, but there's a lot of crashes today. There's a lot of, what does it all mean? But then there's like the most awesome time because we're not ready for that yet.

Speaker 7:          01:12:13       It's too much work. Well, it's an amazing amount of work. The whole species, it's that and they're also busy. You know, people have to feed themselves and pay their bills and you get caught up in that sort of a work cycle where you're doing something with your time every day just in order to stay alive. And it's real hard to get on another path once you're on that path because you sort of bad habits, I guess, right? It's not even bad habits. It's almost just necessity. If you want to get by in life and you're a person who you know, you, you have a degree and then all of a sudden you have a job and then all of a sudden you have a mortgage and you have a family or whatever the fuck it is that you have. Is it x, Y, or z the beginning, or is it the full morning Mani?

Speaker 7:          01:12:52       What? What do you have that's holding you back? But when you get to a certain point, when you've accumulated like a mortgage and accumulated a car lease and insurance and all this different shit that you have to pay for constantly, it's very, very hard to break free and get your shit together. It's very hard to do what you're doing right now. You got on the right path from you on this like hell bent for leather thing. Like it's either gonna work or it's not going to work, but it's pretty good. Boom. It just, you just went out there and it worked. It worked fantastic and amazing. But the reality is for a lot of people when they got on the wrong track and then they got to change tracks, that's when shit gets hard. The key is you got to get on that right track from the get go.

Speaker 7:          01:13:30       Like doing repair work on your life. No, no. Back and the track. I think you think so? I think you can always, if you're willing to just go for it. Most people are not really financially able to do that. It's too hard. It's too hard. If you have obligations, it'd be hard to live a life that was dictated by it. I guess financials. Yeah. Sucks. It's nothing ever gets done that way, you know, especially creatively. That's like the worst possible reason you could be creating art as like just thinking I'm gonna get paid. Just just make you know all your illustrations to be about how much money can I make off of this? I wouldn't even work. No, they've come out clunky and shit. And insincere hat. Yeah, like music or bad comic book artists. Right. Why does he laugh? What I'm talking about? You don't even have your own mind. Could I have some comic book artists? Yeah. Do you remember when you were a kid and you'd get comic books and every now and then some new idiot was like drawing the hall, you know, like what is this guy doing? Like the hulk doesn't even look like,

Speaker 4:          01:14:32       I thought it was worse when like they, they like I remember Spiderman when used to draw it and it was like really cool. And then I guess McFarland one need to like leave or whatever and do his own thing. So they found somebody, they just copied his own style mcfarlane. The spawn guy? Yeah. Who wanted to do

Speaker 7:          01:14:48       well, we got to get Michael Jai white in here. Man I got to it. Yeah, I got a, I think I have his number, but let me check it with you. Yeah, make sure it's the same one. I ran into him at a pool hall recently. Yeah, he'd be great on that. I love that dude. And he was spawn, if you don't know who that was, that movie, he played Spa, which is a fucking bad ass movie, but those spawn comic books are a perfect example of, it's like, that's so outside the box, like in comparison to like the shit that was around just in the 1950s of the 1960s the really dark storylines and insane artwork. Now that guy, that guy did some wild shit and then it just went away. Whatever happened. That dude, I love it. She's going to get, well, I'm sure the guy's rich as fuck. I mean, I think if he's gone away, it's on purpose. You know? I don't think it's an awe. Yeah. Do you know what I'm talking about? The guy who made spawn, did you ever see the spawn comics

Speaker 4:          01:15:41       topic? We'll see. It's all before your time. Yeah, no, I know. It's, do you read comics? Um, I like Terry and the pirates. You're in it. You're in Tony Hawk's video game, aren't you guys are unlockable character Hawker gave me an ass cause I don't have an asset and I was like, I remember they sent me like the, the CGI whatever thing and it's like, because you go in and they do a little scan thing or whatever and I remember going like, Whoa, you guys give me like a [inaudible]. That's good. I usually played as your character because I like playing girl characters for some reason. Yeah. They gave me like my wristband. My hair is all ran and like, it's cool. You played me that they had that skateboard. Where'd you stepped on? I didn't know. It wasn't my favorite Tony Hawk game, but it was, that was cool seeing I and oh man. That's awesome. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:16:22       there's a weird emotional connection when you tattoo someone for like you're on them for life, you know? I know. Like for Eddie mean that that thing is, that's a very important to him. He's talked about meet tears up when he talks about his grandmother. What is that like for you to have all these people running around there, that you have this intense emotional connection with something that you've created on their body?

Speaker 4:          01:16:45       Oh man, it's awesome. I remember one time I was, um, driving to work and this guy was crossing the street and I just, he's really, really tall. And I remember he looked like a businessman with a button up shirt and he's just walking across the street and have that kind of curly hair. And I was like staring at him like, I don't want that guy's deal is, you know what I mean? Like what does he do? And I can totally dry him. He has, I was like interesting facial features. And then I go into tattoo that day and he was my appointment and I tattooed him. And it was the most, it was the most intense story of like living in fear and regret and just making closure with all these, with, with death, which is I think one of the harder subjects I think for people. And, um, and then I remember being done with it and driving back home and seeing him cross the street again to go to where his car was parked and I was like, oh, it's like every person could be that guy as I just always think about that people, especially people who piss me off or annoy me or whatever am I was like, ah, like you just don't know. You know? So it's, it's a cool connection. I think

Speaker 7:          01:17:46       you might be the crazy link to the other dimension. It might be you, it might've been your magic that you used on Eddie there. That's ridiculous. You're connected to another of course. Synchronicity like that. Yeah, all the time. That's so bizarre.

Speaker 4:          01:17:58       You tattooed you to talk into the mic, Bro. You covered a tattoo on site. You talked about this before in a different interview where you've covered a tattoo of a dude on his dick. Right. We're addicted. It was so funny because I think when the, it's true, when I first got on TV, you know, like they always ask you like the first like elementary questions. It's like, what was your first tattoo with the weirdest? How do you didn't, they're always like pussy foot around like that question. Like, so have you ever tattooed, you know, like a weird area. I'm just like, just say it, you know, but whole have you done by home? Oh that's very recent. Girls are starting to do the button. We'll talk to us. No, that's awful. That's awful. Yeah. I mean that's like sacred ground. No, it's physically uh, you know, take all the funny stuff. But it's like physically a very unhealthy thing to do. Like the amount of toxins and whatever. But anyways, maybe wipe, oh, so the actual, the, the, the more sensitive tissue. It probably give you hemorrhoids immediately, I would imagine. You know, he was going to have problems, dude. And then, you know, that area's really hard to keep clean for some reason. You know, I would have to go with a doctor drew one on this.

Speaker 8:          01:19:08       Yeah. I would think drew might be right about assholes out there. Are you crazy pitches of Kat von D is disgusting with asshole tattoos. That's just attention seeking and there's no art aspect behind that. Well maybe

Speaker 7:          01:19:26       beautiful job they made me, it's like, you know, some roses in the center of them all scrunchy and shit and maybe it's just done to be like the most amazing rose. Like your asshole looks like a row

Speaker 4:          01:19:35       now for the coq one. Did you have to have it hard the whole time when you're tattooing it or do you know what I mean? Like when you were talking to him,

Speaker 7:          01:19:40       a woman, you shouldn't make that jerk off

Speaker 8:          01:19:43       and I say it hard. You were, you were actually doing that. I can explain this situation

Speaker 4:          01:19:49       because it sounds so much more perverted than it was. But like it was, there's a guy who, um, you know, I had been through some times and had gotten a lot of ghetto gang tattoos and stuff at all, like homemade, like tad, you know, the guitar string tattoo collection yet. And so we went through over years and redid all of them, you know, and he had all these brand new tattoos, I'm covered and improved or whatever. And then I remember, I mean, we became, I become friends, friends with all my clients, cause you spend such intimate mo like times, like it's like three hours of intense. We're not talking about like a butthole tattoos are like talking about like, you know, life and death and stuff and, or whatever we talk about. And, um, I always, I'm always so heavy. I hate that. Um, but uh, he was cool. And then he came to me very respectfully with his wife and was like, you know, I have this one tattoo and now that I'm remarried and stuff, no longer with Linda and like, um, I was just, you know, I understand if you don't want to do it, it's fine. But it's just, you know, it kind of bothers them.

Speaker 1:          01:20:50       And she was like, name on the deck. The word Linda. Yeah. Linda. Linda is no,

Speaker 4:          01:20:58       said La. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What did you change it to? No. So he comes, I'm like, yeah man, it's cool. You know, and so like he can't, he comes with his wife. No, he goes with his wife and um, and so I was like, yeah, you know, like I'll put up like the partitioners you know, that you see at the hospital and stuff so that others can watch or whatever. And No, you don't get an erection during that time. Uh, I don't think you, unless you're willing to spread it out like a butterfly though. I had him lay down and then he whips this tremendous thing. It's so crazy. Like it was like, Oh, why? And a apostrophe s it was like, wow. Hours and hours, apostrophe s Linda's hours and hours of tattooing. And I was just basically saying it was quite a large tattoo cause large penis. You took your time on it as well, just to clarify the penis and the tattoo or both large. Yeah. I mean it would be like you talking to an ob Gyn about, you know, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:21:55       eight inches. She, you know, you, it might've been like talking to an ob Gyn to a dude who's got a girl touching his penis, even under such, in auspicious circumstances. And there's like hovering over, you know, he's whatever. And it's not that way. I mean, it's like, oh, that's so silly. It's always that way. There's not 90% of it. Maybe only 10% that way, but 10% is that way. They're probably gone. You go to your doctor and he touches your week. My doctor doesn't look like you. I, my doctor looked like you and touched my penis. I'm sure I'd have a problem. Yeah, I might have to beat off before it got to the office to have it. You wouldn't want to see it that way. He does that. Oh my God, you're so crazy, but why don't you go online and look up doctor, doctor porn like doctor, the female doctors who make out with the men and have sex with me. I know what you need. You don't need medicine. You need sugar. All of those that don't say no. It's not sad. It's just reality. It's nothing wrong with that. Dude's reality's very sad. It's not sad. Dudes would be massively attracted to this idea that a, a beautiful doctor is going to get intimate with them. I'm not going to get, but even just touching their intimate parts in some sort of a, uh, a doctor sort of a thing.

Speaker 8:          01:23:06       Like, so what's wrong with your penis, Johnny? I brought this up. I apologize. Don't be mad at me for all of them. Well, all I'm saying is you're a beautiful woman and I were a doctor. A certain amount of, of your patients would most certainly love it if you examine their penis. You know what? I don't think it's that way

Speaker 4:          01:23:24       much anymore in mind. You that this, I did that tattoo when I was like, you know, I dunno, like 19. Right

Speaker 8:          01:23:30       when you were even hotter. Oh, thanks. Oh, he's retarded today. Jesus Christ can help your point. It doesn't help your point. It was when I was 17. Like that makes it better. She's drunk back then and I was totally out of shape versus now. Yeah. What you're saying, you're saying she looks worse? No, I'm just so I can remember him saying that. I've never seen that to a girl. I wasn't saying that. Okay, so I have Polish. So what did you turn it in? I was trying to be funny and sad at the time. He just wanted to get the Linda's [inaudible] apostrophe s like Linda's Dick. Wow. She's, this is Linda's. If not anymore. Linda is still alive. Fuck yet she's alive. Linda's she took resell the Blanco's place in Columbia then does down there running shit cap and motherfuckers and drive around in a 10 speed.

Speaker 8:          01:24:19       So what did you turn it into? I think it was just like some tribal design or something like that. The Bible, it was like you don't, you don't have that much worse. You guys stop. Sorry. She did some biomech on that shit. Crazy. All My, all my, all my work goes down to this. Some Geiger Shit too. I want to get tower seven on my whole would not listen. We're definitely not saying that. It just did the portrait of his new wife on top of that shit with a chainsaw cutting Linda up like a chain saw hitting linen and blood splattered all over. So it's not Linda's fuck that bitch. Why didn't he ops to get the laser on the penis? I don't know. We know what I don't know. Back then, I don't think it was as, I'm like scanning my brain for any other tattoo. You reference like laser or needles. Are you, are you like, did you have to like pull on it and like how did you want your butterfly? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:25:19       no, I mean like if somebody was sitting, like if he was sitting here, then I would get dental bibs around all of it and then I would just, Oh God, this is awful. No, it's, no, no, no. There's no, there's no way is it sexual?

Speaker 8:          01:25:34       Oh, for sure. No, I'm not saying that. We're not saying you got off. Oh my God. The, the middle of saying, we're just saying, man, you got it. Is, it is a very extraordinary task. You guys take your knuckles and do that. I had to give him, what did he say? He just said, did you spit on it? Oh, come on, man. That's in the moment. It was, it was just one of those Daniel Tosh. Sorry. With the moment. It wasn't forever. He's ridiculous. Ah, yeah. Look, it's

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       certainly, it was not sexual. I mean it has to be insanely painful. You'd have to be like a really sick, but then there's a lot of sick fucks who were like really into pain, right? No, I think

Speaker 4:          01:26:12       more embarrassed than anything and he was really, again, like his wife was there and it was a very, you know, I think he was,

Speaker 1:          01:26:19       I would have made sure it allows them to have sex right before, just just in case. Do you think that's Linda's Goto Shit. The Linda just, you get a tattoo, my name on your Dick Damn Way. This kind of work. She's like, she's a Catholic. A headboard with like notches. And how many dudes have tattooed her name on their deck? Cic is what a gangster chick. That chick must be. Maybe it was his idea to get her back. Don't doubt it. We need another story. Numbers. Sorry. You guys are still friends, right? No, I mean, no, no. Hold on. Call that dude up. I'll email them. Know some things you don't know me, but I know about your day. Just curious. Yeah, that's just don't have the answer. Have you ever been in the middle of tattooing someone and Oh, well for whatever reason they just told them to get the fuck out of there. Like I can't do you, you're giving me bad energy. You're annoying your, you're crying too much or have you ever had like

Speaker 4:          01:27:13       to stop a tattoo? Um, probably because of stench a couple of times now or anything. No damn bad. Wiper guys are awful. Um, no, I dunno. Um, there was one tattoo that I fuck, these don't sound like interesting stories to me, but they probably are. Um, oh yeah. Um, twice. There's two different people that um, like their wife went into labor during their, their, uh, Tattoo. One of them was,

Speaker 1:          01:27:48       it's probably because they knew the wife knew that you were tattooing the husband and just awesome. Like I remember was like mirror survey. How Tattoo chick. All right. I'm not smart husband. No, no. I,

Speaker 4:          01:28:01       this is a great story because it was, it was very sweet actually. Um, it was Mira Sorvino is, has been, and she, he was getting a pinup girl version of her tattooed on his leg and then halfway through he got the phone call and we're like, oh, we'll just finish it another day. And sweet. I thought that was nice. Oh, Dennis Sweet. For sure. Yeah. Is there a moment that interest, does anybody ever come to you with some like crazy demonic shit and you're like, ah, I just don't want to get into this? I mean, I don't do any tattoos that really go against the navy. Like my moral, I mean, you know, the crazy thing is nowadays it's so different than it when it used to be like I used to, um, I just tattoo a lot of the people who are getting tattooed by me now or just more serious collectors.

Speaker 4:          01:28:39       So I'm not really dealing with a lot of riff raff for weirdness of, yeah. But in the past, I'm digging deep into the paths right now. So, yeah. I mean there's sometimes, uh, people would come in and wanting to get tattoos that I don't necessarily agree with or like I don't, I don't need the money, so I don't need to tattoo you if I don't feel good about it, you know, if it's something creepy. Yeah. Though it is my gift to the person. It's also a collaborative experience, so I have to feel good about it. So it also goes for like, things that I don't think I'm good at. You know, there's certain things that aren't, I'm not, I'm just not good at.

Speaker 7:          01:29:12       I would bet that you would be really good if you wanted to do like some fall booth type shit. I call my old stuffy evil shit. I like stuff like that. Do that kind of thing. Yeah. I like,

Speaker 4:          01:29:23       I just, all kinds of art, you know what I mean? I think some of the creepiest stuff is a lot of like the old Catholic artwork and it's the reason that it's so striking and it's so, um, you know, uh, it, it, it affects and moves people is because there's like, it's very, it gives you fear. It's amazing. It's powerful. So I love that stuff. Um, you know, I wear a lot of crosses and stuff and I may not be for the meanings that most people assume it would be. I just like what crosses,

Speaker 7:          01:29:47       well, a friend of mine went to Italy and a while he was there, he took a photo of the sealing of some religious place that the outside edge of the photo, the Center is Heaven, grace and the outside edge is all these demons and they're shoving like pitchforks up dudes asses crazy back then elite in 10.

Speaker 4:          01:30:08       The Hieronymus Bosch stuff. I mean, that's just like, I think faith in the 15, 16 hundreds isn't like the, the uh, date Danish. I think he was. Um, I mean that shit was so ahead of its time.

Speaker 7:          01:30:19       Oh yeah. It's crazy. Scary, weird. And back then mean they really believe that too. I mean, when you were drawing those paintings of the, the demons skewering dudes in their assholes, like, people really thought that that was going to happen to you if you died and you went to hell. Well, I think, uh, Caravaggios one of my favorite. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:30:36       Uh, you know, from that era, I think he was one of the first more influential, uh, painters of the time that started doing renditions of a biblical stories and stuff. But painting like Jesus and, um, painting Jesus more than like a, a very human like fashion. So it, it was even more real. Do you know what I mean? It wasn't like this, you know, golden era, like aura and raise and wings and all that stuff. It's like even made him look like you and I, and so you would see like crucifixion pieces and stuff that, I mean, you feel it. It's like

Speaker 7:          01:31:08       it's fucked up when you look crazy. All the old crucifixion images crucifixions are crazy just to begin with straight up. It's a crazy way to kill somebody. I mean, if you just wander around there, yeah, it's nuts. I mean, but, but in the old pictures, he was always like in pretty good shape except for the, the holes in his arms. I mean, he wasn't all fucked up. Some body fat, some selling. I meant what I meant was he was okay. He wasn't all fucked up, but like the Mel Gibson movie. Yeah, but you liked the interpretation of it. Now it's like if you go to see that and Mel Gibson movie, that's our version of what would have happened when he, but that was horrific. I mean it was really scary shit. Like the, the, the beatings that they did to him and then they had to have that fake body that was like bleeding and all these different areas. I mean it was like a fake robot. She was like the medieval torture devices that have been made. I mean, it's crazy that people even like invented or thought of things that you, the racks

Speaker 6:          01:32:00       and iron maiden's all that horrifying. No. Have you ever seen pictures of the cat piano they used to have? This is not the only like a hundred years ago where they had like a bunch of cats lined up and had these things that poke the cat and make them me out. And you played the piano, the keys. Well, yeah. They didn't give a fuck about cats back then. Yeah. The mortality rate for people. I do too. I love my cat marsh. She would stop peeing in my fucking house. How many cats do you have? A little bitch. I only have one. I'm not a crazy cat lady. I just love my cat. When another one hairless cause I have a hairless cat and they get kind of the opposite. He's got full Harry cause your cat would just kick his cuts. Asshole is cat's a fluff ball. Aw, that's cute. I can't stop my cat from peeing in my fucking house. She just likes to not Pete. Where the litter beer boxes he the most boring interview for you guys like talking about why? Well I dunno know. I know we always go there. We always go.

Speaker 6:          01:32:56       We might be talking about this seriously. No, no. It's not boring to us. You're not boring at all. Don't even say that. That's not what it is that we talk about anything and everything. There's a cat clock. You're the fucking thing goes off every hour at my house. Yeah. It ruins story. Arc has 10 minutes. You're going to hear me and you got to go. What the fuck? There's cats all over the desk. Clue who the guy is obsessed with cats. Oh yeah. You have something wrong with him. I don't know what it is. I just like the lucky count. I don't know what the fuck's wrong with them, but he's okay. Do you ever do this fucking Chad Tattoos? I've done done one. Yeah. Before a couple of times back in the day. Yeah. That's cool. What did you first start off practicing on Jews? Pigskin and I just had two people, but see how is, how was it? No, no, no. I was underage so I had a

Speaker 4:          01:33:37       plethora of friends that were under agent couldn't get tattooed, so they were just oh wow. See, tattooed them or did you get the needles? Um, well at the time I had a friend that believed in me and who worked at a shop. I mean, you know, I was, this was in the ghetto in San Bernardino, so it's like, things were a lot different than they are now. And so like my first shop that I worked at, I remember, uh, it was called Sin City Tattoo at the time. It was like on Highland and East street, which is like such a really gnarly apart out there. I don't know if it's cleaned up, but I know there's a jail right down the street. But um, that's never good. Yeah, there's like people getting robbed all the time except us. Cause I think we were tattooing all the thieves and stuff, but um, and, and back then, like the wars between tattoo shops are so different and it's all bikers.

Speaker 4:          01:34:15       You know, like my, my boss come to think of it like probably that probably wasn't even his real name. I mean, I don't, you know, like he was gnarly. I mean, there was wars between Tattoo show. Yeah. Like if you opened up a shop in a mile radius that you would get, I mean, we, I remember we'd get shot at, um, what are, what is it called? Something cocktails with the fire and Molotov cocktail. Get those through the window. Really? Oh yeah. It was crazy. Just, it's just, it was rough. You guys were working, this would happen or is it half the time? I mean, I think my first, yeah, I mean it was pretty brutal. There's reasons for my, I feel bad for my parents because they're like, oh my God. They had to like imagine all the things, and I was 16 when I first got into that shop and I remember going, hey man, I'm under age. And he's like, he looks at my shitty portfolio, Polaroids that were blurry and crappy. And he was like, Eh, and then, uh, I shouldn't have my drawings. And he goes, AH, okay. Yeah, you could do it. Um, and he, I remember he used to say, you're going to fly far, far away. What? I'm like, no, I'm going to stay here forever. Like, see you later. San Bernandino. But

Speaker 7:          01:35:12       wow, you sold them down the river.

Speaker 4:          01:35:14       No. You know, it was such a rough, it was such a rough place to, you know, it was just a rough place for a 16 year old girl to be at. But um, San Bernardino's refer your 60. Yeah, totally. It's rough for everybody. That's a, that's a tricky area. Yeah. And I lived right down the street with a prostitute. At the time and it was rough, you know, I mean she, it was, it was awful. He Buddies? No, no, I met her because I had been working at a movie theater before that passenger out popcorn and like she worked there and I needed a place to stay next to the shop and so, um, I would pretty much take care of her kids while she would go in and out of her drug. Comatose. So sad. It's very sad. Wow. Really hard. But I just knew that if I could be close to the shop, I could tattoo everyday in practice and I would literally go in and open the shop and stay until minute. Like, you know, it was like 11 to midnight every day. I tattooed

Speaker 7:          01:36:02       so much back then. How long did it take before you were comfortable with the medium of skin of like moving it around, pulling it to manipulate it? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:36:10       comfortable from the beginning with that was because when I was tattooing, I'm professionally outside of a shop, not, I didn't know what I was doing, so there was no bar to, I was like, oh cool. You want to get a misfit school, it's awesome. And like I would just tattoo it and it'd be like, Eh, it was like eight hours later like, but um, then once I got to my first job I had to unlearn a lot of things and I was like, what? There's more than one kind of tattoo machine and different needles and the cleanliness and the sterility aspect of it, all the important stuff. And so I'm just relearning it. But looking back, you know, is actually awesome that I was brought up in that ghetto upbringing because it definitely is the reason why I tattooed the style that I do because, um, you know, gangsters get cool tattoos, they all get all the fine line black and gray stuff and they, I did a lot of names and memory of his and all that stuff and um, old English lettering and lots of high nose and gestures and all this shit.

Speaker 7:          01:37:01       I wanted to be a comic book artist when I was a kid. So yeah, I drew a lot of really good different wild shit. One of the things that I did is I drew on my friends. I would just draw on them. Like I would draw fake tattoos on them, like really intense detailed fake tattoos. It would take like hours. Yeah. And I did that because I was thinking about getting a tattoo. Oh yeah. Yeah. I still draw you all the time to see it. Yeah. I'll show you this. I'll send you some shit. But my best stuff was when I did it every day and that's when I was in high school when I was in height. But I had one conti teacher in high school as an art teacher, it was so negative. We want to have anything to do with art anymore. I was like, this guy's just a downer. He's just, it was always negative. I've failed my art classes in school but in a lot of visitors cause I was too punk rock to follow instructions. But it's like I just, I want to draw it

Speaker 4:          01:37:46       the way they are. I don't, I don't, I mean yeah, let's learn about like the history of fucking cubism or whatever the fuck you know. But like when it comes to drawing stuff, I don't want to do two point perspective. I just want to do it as it is

Speaker 7:          01:37:56       and like I'd rather draw this stapler like as it is versus like you want to do what you want to do. Like you can't, you can't teach in like, you know what I mean? It's like you can teach technique, but anyways, I've failed. I would fail all this, these, these classes and I'm like, ah, I don't need this shit. Yeah. It's like you have an idea that you want to get out. You have your expression that you want to get out and the problem is when someone says, no, I don't want you to get that out. I want you to work on that. It's like you have these brief moments where these doors are open, where this creativity wants to run through and when you're sitting there, I mean in one sense it's good to be disciplined and it's good to be regimented and it's good to have good fundamentals, but it's also good to just let it go when you want to let it go.

Speaker 7:          01:38:34       Like you could learn all those things on your own time as far as like perspective and granted, I think there are some good art teachers out there, but I think that would be such a tricky thing to do because it's such a personal thing too. You know, it's, it would require a person that was, you know, Doug, Stan hope and I, we've talked about teaching comedy classes that you could never, first of all, you can never charge. Like there's a lot of people that have like this comedy classes where you're, you know, you, they charged this ridiculous amount of money. You go through all this crazy bullshit with them and they pretend attorney when the comedian and we're like, it should be free. You can't charge. And you really can't give him any fucking advice because there's almost nothing you can tell them. I mean, that should be what the comedy club last one over the last competition was like came to us right here.

Speaker 7:          01:39:13       Oh really? We're here all the time. As a matter of fact, we're here Wednesday night is a Joey Diaz, Brian Callan, Duncan Trussell and me. Maybe Brian if he can come on, sweetie. Long story deep story. Okay. We won't go into that, but um, yeah, it's um, it's awesome place. The Ice House comedy club has been around forever. It's been 1961. I think it's one of the first, uh, was opened 50 years. I did my first set here in 94. Really? Yeah. I want to first moved here from New York. Comedy's hard, man. I, there's like, there's a whole, well, I mean, I just think it's like, it's, it's not anybody can just go up there and tell a story. I mean, some people aren't really good storytellers, but I think there's like a whole thing to it, you know? Well, you know how [inaudible] for you when you sit down and you draw, you know, you're the, you know, it's like, you know, you know, you know how to fucking draw.

Speaker 7:          01:40:04       You've been doing it forever. But if you had never done it before, a practice it before really forced your hand to move. And the way that you want it to in order to create this image, it'd be almost alien, almost impossible for a lot of people. They look at the artwork that you do and it's almost incomprehensible to wrap their head around how much is how someone could recreate something like that. How can you do that? How can you do that? So same thing with comedy. You do it enough times or Jujitsu or music, you do it enough times and it just becomes, it becomes you. It becomes, yeah. But yeah, it's hard to get there, but not really. I mean it is and it isn't. It's like Joey Dia said it best. He said comedy is the hardest, easiest thing you'll ever do because it's fucking really hard to be good at it. Yeah. To get it to where it's easy. I just can't imagine drawing without an eraser for a tattoo artist. That's just seems to me like the scariest thing in the road. Cause I've never drawn something that I didn't erase something on or change or wish

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       I did something different. And it is, it is. There are times when you're tattooing. I'm like, Shit, I have to now work around this. Well, you also got to think about the time you're putting in as opposed to time she's putting it. Yeah, I mean she's doing like, you know, you probably tattooing eight, 10 hours a day, right? How many hours a day you're doing this?

Speaker 4:          01:41:08       Oh, nowadays? Or were you when you started? Oh yeah. I mean it was so, so many hours. I never, I didn't have a day off until my first days off. I started like three or four years ago I started taking Sundays off. Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:41:21       Did you ever have any idea that you could have some sort of reality show type success? Like Watch TV? I mean, but was there any idea that you could have this kind of success? I mean, did you ever think that, did you have this in your head that you would

Speaker 4:          01:41:34       see like things in the like, I see things differently. Some are, I don't know, I just see things like, uh, like, oh, there's an opportunity or oh that you can make this out of that. You know, and I think a lot of people, maybe you're just blind themselves to that. So I don't know. I never wanted that. It's not, I actually was, but it didn't exist before.

Speaker 5:          01:41:51       Well, it didn't exist. Celebrity tattooist didn't exist. I mean the ED hardy type dudes. There was a few names. Yeah. The polls. I never in a million years imagined. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:42:01       The staff. I mean if you knew like where I was born in, how would you know where I come from? It's like totally different than it's the opposite of this stuff, you know? But I don't know. It's not, I dunno, I'm not that impressed by that stuff. It's cool. It's cool and I'm very appreciative. It's like awesome. Like, Oh, I get to do more of this stuff, you know? But

Speaker 5:          01:42:17       well, when I talk about it and I'm not saying it in terms of like your, your, your common perception of how people view success and look at her, she's on TV. Yeah. It's not that. What I mean is how receptive people are and how much resonance your work is having on people. Never in a million years.

Speaker 4:          01:42:34       Yeah. I mean, I was like, you know, like that's like the weird girl here, whatever, you know, like the fact that, oh, maybe that's why I'm bad at compliments and stuff. So he knows and it's like I'm just not used to that still. Yeah, that's gotta be kind of awkward. Right. But it's a, it's a really fascinating but not done. But now that I'm not like how he thinks I used to be, I guess it's like,

Speaker 3:          01:42:56       yeah. Oh, that's when you were hotter back then. Oh, see dude, I told you she's still riding on that. We let that Joe, we let that joke fly over our hands, but she's still holding on to way like a hot lava rock and her arms burning or soul. Oh, no way. No Way. By the way, look how beautiful her shoes look today. Joe W, why do you like shoes or something? Because I'm just kidding. I sort of came from Disneyland, so I'm like, cool. There's such a stigma. Even I'm guilty of that too. I like shoes or something. No. Oh No. Oh, I'm not a fan. I love shoes. I'm a normal guy. Usually. Usually. Look growing up, you think tattoos? Like for me, tattoos. Look, my uncles had tattoos that, you know, I'm sure that influenced me. But you know, generally girls that got tattoos, they generally weren't hot. Right? Generally. Yeah. And I can imagine the, the, the amount of guys who thought like, damn, she's

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       so hot, she's ruining herself with the tattoos or something. And, and now look at her now. You know what I mean? Most guys wouldn't think that though. An illusion that girls have. I think, you know, most guys you'd be amazed at how little we give a fuck about like a lot of shit that you have more different generation. That's all you guys were in the body shape. You change the perception single handedly though. Oh yeah. Without a doubt. You'd definitely threw a monkey wrench into the whole idea of what's hot. And there was, there was one movie which he took a deep, there was a movie with Will Ferrell, I think it wasn't like a, an extreme comedy, but the love interest and they never really addressed it in the movie had a sleeve, you know what I'm talking about right? The love interest had a sleeve and I think it was fake or whatever, but they never talked about it. She was just a chick who worked at a bakery and will Ferrell. I think that's, it was like fell in love with her or whatever and that never existed.

Speaker 4:          01:44:39       Yeah. And all the movie offers, I haven't ever gotten her like a hooker drug dealer of an player. What else? Zombie random goth chick. Uh, other, yeah. It's never club scene. The Queue. It's will Ferrell or whatever. That's funny.

Speaker 6:          01:44:54       Yeah. It's weird how the perception of what tattoos are over the last couple of decades. But like when I was a kid, no one had sleeves. My, my friend's Dad's never had sleeves, you know, that's weird. But then, you know, uh, today it's so common. It's, I mean, what are the, how much more common is our tattoos today then when we were kids, she is huge and you got to talk into the thing, man. Victor are really good friends. A friend of ours has a son, his name is Tori and Victor has sleeps. He has a lot of tattoos and his son is 11 or 12 now. And the last time I hung out with him his son was drawing on himself for the whole night. He had like just marked, it felt like really cool cause he was like his dad. So that would be a key for sure.

Speaker 6:          01:45:39       He's going to get tapped days that it just seems like he is. Yeah. Kids are always more open minded and stuff cause they're not like painted by like he would get the tattoos because he thought it was cool cause his dad, cause him and his dad have an amazing relationship. There's, there's, there's no lack of love in that kid's life. Yeah. So you know, I'm just kidding. Oh no shit. She just hit you with the real son. It is true though. His, his dad's awesome. Oh yeah, Victor's got, yeah. Yeah that kid. Probably mom. It's a weird rite of passage thing too for young man. It's like when some young kids want to smoke and there's, you know, they're not around their parents. They want to have that cigarette so he can pretend to be an adult. They have friends that smoke, like older friends or something.

Speaker 6:          01:46:18       Yeah. That or if they see their parents do it and they sneak them out and they get them together, you know, that's what I did when I was a kid. We'd sneak out booze, saw our parents drinking so it's fine booze, my parents' house and sneaking out into the woods and we would do it cause we pretend to be like adults, you know, installing really like we wanted to get drunk. We're only gonna like 11 you know, the like, you know, kids do that. They, they, they, the hell is wrong with me, man. My parents were so square and like, it sounds like your parents are just super disciplined. Where did I get it from? Miami. It's just a reaction

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       to that. The fact that you had to practice all the time and you were very, very regimented and disciplined and, and you just became a, a wild sort of thing because of that, because of the fact that you were right. So a boxed in by a rigid sort of,

Speaker 4:          01:47:05       but it wasn't wild. I mean, no, I looked crazy, but I was, I just loved punk rock. It's probably just music then Flint and music. I think it was, it was like there's something, there's more out there. Yeah. If you're totally into punk, you're going to get some tattoos. Eventually you're going to get something, something. Yeah. If you're really into punk, that black flag thing you might get that's barely got those bars. Like last month I was like, can't believe I haven't black flag bars. They'll really just got them all. That's cool. Yeah. That's, you're like, oh my God, I forgot that one shit. No, it's like, how did I not have that already?

Speaker 5:          01:47:37       Do you, uh, I mean you said he covered up some that were under your left arm. Are you done covering own or do you look at your own

Speaker 4:          01:47:43       look? A few that like, oh, I have one on my leg that I started lasering would hurt so much analysis. I just, again, time consumption. It's harder for me to get tattooed cause I'm busy. They're doing them or doing all the other stuff I do. So it's like, but yeah, there's a few. I think I would, I mean, just for the sake of making more room or something like, yeah, like isn't that crazy though? Maybe just spend, doctors will become popular again. Do you have any

Speaker 5:          01:48:06       bands are just like totally whacked at a tattooed on, you know, I only listen to rap music, but I mean at one point in time you loved them and now you're like, I can't blame a tattooed those guys on me. I think I've always liked rap music. Always been cool. You've always had good taste. So with the ones that you were, you're thinking about laser and off, you just have some ideas that you need some space for it.

Speaker 4:          01:48:26       No, I mean, and there's just some that like, I, I don't have regrets. I can live with him or without him, you know? But I think like, I, it's not, I don't know, like I haven't had that many boyfriends in my entire life, you know, cause I'm always the cue that Violin Violet, I'm just saying that know you got to be quicker with that, Brian. Yeah. You gotta be ready with those on that's terrible. No, but like I've gotten tattoos for maybe the whole community walk away. Oh, that's what it was. Well that's a terrible, you know the end of the, yeah. Sorry, I'm just hearing you guys, I'm sorry this is so you don't have, you haven't had that many boyfriends and I mean I think I've gotten like some tattoos for um, whatever those relationships in Pasadena. Like my first tattoo was a j and whatever and I still love it, but I think there's like two portraits I'd like to get lasered off you. It seems like for you, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like at least if I had to guess,

Speaker 5:          01:49:28       it's probably very difficult for you to enter into a relationship because you seem to be like one of those all in sort of girls. Like you fall in love with someone and yeah. All or nothing. Yeah. Yeah. So you're ready right away, all an all or nothing and then it doesn't work. It's nothing. And then just like, it's hard to make that. It's hard to pull that

Speaker 4:          01:49:47       trigger. We, what do you mean? What score would you pull that all or nothing trigger? I don't know. Any other way. That's what I'm saying. I mean it seems that that's your style. Your, yeah. Is that bad? No, no it's, but it's hard. It's not bad. Which cause you look, if you find her to make a connection with people that are like true or true to themselves and see like most of the time people when you meet them, they're putting, uh, like putting out like a perception of themselves is how they would like to be seen. So you're already going through like two layers right there of what the person really is. Or sometimes it might even be bullshitting themselves. Yeah. So like, whereas I'm not by any means perfect, but I pretty much like I talk a lot, I've talked about the same stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:50:28       Like, oh, this is the same conversation I'd have with like my homie. It's like, you know what I mean? Like it's kind of what you see is what you get, you know? And I've only met very few people that are that way. And, and so I think that oftentimes you've tend to fall in love with this perception versus the person. And so in my case, sometimes I feel like it's all, it's, it tends to be intense in the beginnings. And then I'm good tenure being on fire and then maybe it's not so much that way, but I'm also a very emotional person. I'm gonna be like very, you know,

Speaker 7:          01:50:54       till the bitter end. Well, sometimes people can bullshit you for quite a long time before you really get used to what they're really like. Yeah, yeah. Totally. Three or four months in you like three, four minutes is so short of a time of day. It is a short amount of time. Yeah, it is. But you could find out everything about someone and three or four months of constantly being with them, they can only hide their character for so long, which is I think, but I always wonder about like, dudes like Paul Mccartney, Paul Mccartney is a bad motherfucker. But then you'd hear that ex wife talk about m. And. T. You ever heard of the one the woman who had lost her leg in a motorcycle accident? No. Cheese demonic. I mean, the way that lady would talk about Paul Mccartney was like the most terrifying thing. Like it was just, she's ridiculous.

Speaker 7:          01:51:34       I don't want to hear about that stuff. Yeah, you don't want to hear it. You super negative. I want to hear, well, super negative about if anything ever happened to her. She has information hidden secret places about him. I'm doing the best to protect my husband. She was like just a crazy evil person and wanted stacks of cash from him and his dumb ass didn't get a prenuptial and he got roped in by a woman pretending to be something she wasn't. And then once he had a kid with her, she just turned on the hooks and fucking ripped her chest open and a monster flew out. And that was her. And that was all the interviews. After that you would listen to the interviews and you go, how did he not see this common man? How do they not know that he was with a crazy person of this

Speaker 4:          01:52:09       does you want to believe in? I think people's ability to be something, you know?

Speaker 7:          01:52:13       Yeah, for sure. Also, he came out of a longterm relationship with Linda Mccartney, who was supposed to be an amazing person, like really nice sweet woman. By all accounts they got along great. So he's probably his ideas of what relationships were like. He really thought that's what you did. You know, you find someone, you just nice to them, they're nice to you. And this is just the way she really is. He didn't even look for all the clues of credit

Speaker 4:          01:52:33       maybe. I mean, who knows? You know what I mean? I always think it's like, unless you're in it, you're really don't know what's going on, you know?

Speaker 7:          01:52:39       Right. That's why you speculate it's fun and he talk shit at the same time. It's great. It's good times speculating and talking Shit and how Paul Mccartney got roped in. Yeah, I dunno. So you haven't had that many boyfriends because of that because,

Speaker 8:          01:52:51       no, no, no, no. I know. I think I haven't had that many boys cause I'm always in longterm relationships I think is what it is. He's like, so you haven't had any boyfriends. Damn man. You make me feel creepy. What did he come up with that? Thank you Brian. Thanks for [inaudible] but no, no. Anyway, so go get it. Come on or tattoo again. It's really important story ever been to the off guard

Speaker 7:          01:53:24       most ridiculous shit ever. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, love is a funny thing. It's hard as fuck, but you got to find the right person. That's what it is. I mean the right person for you might not be the right person for somebody else and finding that perfect interaction with people. It's almost impossible. It's so hard. It's so hard to line up, especially for a chick like you know, because you have to have some like some serious bad motherfucker. You can't just have like some regular tude pretty good. The heart related to be honest, when it comes to like the amount of like solidness that I, that I guess every, yeah, but for a dude to not be tweaked by you being all hot and famous, covered in tattoos and all wild, crazy famous tattoo lasers. That's a serious obstacle. Like a Braveheart dude, some Mallory warrior, he's like, it's just seems like I would just want to be with somebody who, who can get it, you know, and like I could relate to or understand, you know, Chubby as a comic or something.

Speaker 8:          01:54:24       He's putting himself out there. That's what he's doing. My creepiness. I like intelligence.

Speaker 7:          01:54:31       Jennifer Lopez, she's doomed to a life of Betas. She's going to have to date these Beta men and buy them cars and there'll be younger than her and that's it. That's just the way it goes from now on. This is no, it should be a batter motherfucker than Jennifer Lopez. Good luck. Good luck feller. Who the fuck is, it was like, this is what you got. Like Brad Pitt and a couple other dudes. The only people who can data. Her dating pool is down to like five people and most of them are married already. It's like good luck, but she'll, she's got to go the other way. I think you're going to have to have gone that way too. You're going to have to get some Beta, his man, servant type dudes.

Speaker 8:          01:55:06       I'm telling you. That's what I want to bring Brian into. Your Life. Shit will be perfect. Would worship you. He would set up, set up your website. It said he could really spice up your Twitter background. Right. Can Make Shit happen.

Speaker 7:          01:55:28       Yeah, I, I dunno. That's funny. Shit. Hey, it's, it's the fucking, that's the big mean. If there was one dilemma that people find in life that's most prevalent in our society, it's finding the right person. It's like probably the biggest dilemma that anybody ever faces when you're growing up.

Speaker 5:          01:55:43       Especially me. You're always like, man, if I could just find the right girl if I give is find the right guy for everybody. That's like the number one.

Speaker 4:          01:55:51       It's hard. It's like working on yourself first and then they, then you put yourself in a position, you know what I mean? Because I know that like in the past where, you know, it's kind of like the hippie stuff we talked about earlier. It's like, you know, water seeking its own level. And um, I feel like, like I look back at like my last, you know, the relationship that was an an an awful mass. It's like a part of me feels like, oh my God, I got duped or something. But then another part of me is like, I created this to a certain degree too. If it's like, if, if there's like, there's red flags that I failed to see because I wanted to believe that it was something else. I know people do that all the time, so it's more like, okay, well w at the end of the day, like, what's wrong with me? You know what I mean? Like what, what was my part in it? What could I have done to not, you know, obviously that does not discredit people's like shitty behavior. You know, obviously some people suck and stuff. And some people are really good liars and whatever, but like I think, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:56:44       do you have to grow as well?

Speaker 4:          01:56:47       Yeah, I think it's, I think it's more important to put yourself in a situation where you can be receptive to a healthy relationship. Like, you know, when I was depressed I like kind of gravitated towards other people that were also sad and, and that doesn't help. You know what I mean? So I think as far as like what you're saying is like finding somebody at a level or whatever. Yeah, there's that Nice understandability like, you know, I can talk about things that bug me that may not bug like a regular person or whatever, but it's more like the connection of the mind, you know? I want to be inspired by somebody who is equally as driven and equally like wanting to create and like that shit drives me crazy. Like when someone's into it, you know, whether you're a busboy or fucking famous. Yeah. What I'm saying is you're fucked.

Speaker 4:          01:57:25       You're never going to find a dude. Like, I read poetry and then why do you think it's better? That crazy thing is I said the c word earlier, Jesus, anybody dating like a Jessica Alba, that dude has to deal with the fact that she's really good friends with a lot of a list celebrities. Right. So that's what you want to throw a gun. This is the Siberia thing cause it's like all those things are mentally generated ideas of what's important or what's good. Like, like, like I don't see it that way. You know what I mean? Like I'm not saying I could fall in love with, with anybody, but like if it fits your mind or your soul, whatever you want to call it, like I could fall in love with that. It really does not have to do with um, what, what the world's perception of you is. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:58:07       Yeah. You say that, but you got to find out how much the gardener makes and was like, bitch can't even take me out to do

Speaker 4:          01:58:13       than shit we got going on here. It's not that way. It like is she with dudes paying for my stuff? Do you really? Yeah, I think it's probably because I was my own set of issues is like, you know, I'm not a feminist or like I don't consider myself anything but like I think,

Speaker 5:          01:58:29       you know, just growing up poor, I'm always like, oh, I can do it myself. Don't write a door for me. Like, yeah, no, that makes sense. I would hate to be a girl and have dudes buy me dinner and then expect something from, no,

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       it's a sincere gift. Is it a difference? You know? But I also like, um, I don't know. Yeah, you got to be single for a long time. Kid stuck in a workout downer. Damn, you're too much of a bad motherfucker. It's really going to be hard. Rock star friends, she's like really good. Close to, yeah, you get those guys alone. They all fall apart. But that would intimidate some guys. Guys would be like, damn, she's best friends with him. Him hitting her, you know? That would be the most, one of the saddest things, if you look really into a rock star and then you started dating him when he was just a whiny bitch, you'd be like, really, man, you stopped liking the music. Your fucking music was awesome. Imagine if you started dating Mick Jagger just found out he's a cunt. Just Mick Jagger's off fucking dumb con.

Speaker 1:          01:59:32       You're like, what? God dammit. That has to be the hardest for a girl. Did a rockstar fighter. He's a Dork. That would be the hardest shit ever. But the Rock Mick Jagger, that would crush the rock star. Fuck yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, that'd be devastating. Rockstars don't get broken up with. They do though. They get dumped, especially in this day and age. You know, I think in the protected days of the 60s and the 70s like I've read some shit about Hendrix, man. I got so bummed out because I'm a huge Hendrix fan and I was reading an expert, expert excerpt from this, a book about him, and one of them was like about Jimmy Hendrix beating the shit out of his girlfriend. They're like, Jimi Hendrix would just smack around. We weren't there. That's the thing. It's true. You're right. Standing up for women beaters. I like it. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:00:22       Jamie kills teen. No, no, you're absolutely right. You're the guy was a band member. He could have been a jealous bitch. He's the guys in the band with one of the greatest [inaudible] beating. It just cleans. That's what he likes. Lassen is coffee. No, but I mean who knows what really happened. But reading about that, it was like, wow, that's so like you read like some tweets that like Chris Brown makes and these fucking moron. He makes these tweets and everybody hates them and to go after him. Then he deletes these tweets. What does he say? Just really stupid shit about, oh he's, you know, after the whole Rihanna thing, he would like get in arguments with people about him beating up women and they were, they were like, really? He's a moron. So there were like really gross kind of tweets. But this, this, that didn't exist. Like in the, the led Zeppelin days, there was no Twitter. If they had a podcast or a Internet radio show, we got to hear them argue about chicks on the road who you know, and you'd be like, Oh, you guys are gross. It's like the mystery was so much better than, you know, it's like Robert Plant, the mystery of Robert Plant. I remember growing up being a huge Zeppelin fan. I mean I barely knew 10 words at plant said in

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       an interview, you know, I think I heard any interviews. I just knew, I just knew black dog was the shit, you know. I just knew whole lot of love is like the greatest song in the history of the world. That's all I knew. I didn't know anything about Robert Plant and it might be annoying as fuck and you, you've dated Robert Plant. It just turns out to be a total prima Donna knowing and stupid and always insecure and once everybody kisses ass like fuck. Really? It's like when Mel Gibson was screaming at that ex-girlfriend shot up, blow me and he's like yelling at her, answering so much. I'm sure she was. I'm sure she was. But it was like, we never got a chance to see someone so human before that was like a fucking Mel Gibson mean. He was brave heart and then all of a sudden he's screaming to some scammer, some Russian scammer chick who's robbing him and recording all of his phone calls.

Speaker 3:          02:02:36       Shut up and blow me. And I'm like, wow. Like this is Mel Gibson man. This is the lethal weapon dude. What the fuck? Kind of just like that character and lethal weapon. Wasn't he like a crazy, he would.

Speaker 5:          02:02:51       Yeah, but he was kind. He was crazy. But kind to women with the CRA the wrong. What was wrong with the crazy? What was wrong with the crazy first of all does he was scary as fuck to a woman who had his child. Like he couldn't even keep it together to this woman who had his child. That was the scariest thing. It's like he had a baby with this person. She's watching his baby and he's fucking screaming bloody murder at her. That's, he's a scary dude,

Speaker 3:          02:03:13       you know. Did that freak you out? The Mel Gibson Shit? I am known to give it a bad talk about Mel Gibson. No, no. I just, it's like, I don't know. You didn't hear that. That thing when it was in the news. I really don't watch television. I like knowing the human side of people. I love reality shows. I actually do mob wives and moms and Mama drama. Forget about a watch monitor wives, the one with the little girl, the Mama drama, they take, they take six sets of mothers and daughters like that party together. They were like 43 and 22 and they put six couples athlon black, half them white in a penthouse in Vegas and they get drunk everyday. It's hysterical. Wow. It's great. That's genius.

Speaker 5:          02:04:00       Yeah. There's some fun in reality shows, but you know it's, it's, it's really like mindless distraction. That's the problem. You don't get anything.

Speaker 3:          02:04:08       Sometimes you need that. Sometimes you need to do you like that? I like not thinking about shit and watching South Park or watching some mine. I W I want to be mindless. It's like meditation. I don't mind mindlessness of, it's in the form of comedy, like Southpark type. It's nice knowing how people really are like, Holy Shit, mob lives. Chicago. People aren't really like that. They're not. No. I mean I think you're putting a hyper it, it's such a, yeah, that's the alcohol they put, make them live together. It's edited and produced. I totally believe

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       that. Not really how, whatever. But really our people that are acting like that on camera and that's as fast as that. Yeah, I love it. I definitely doesn't inspire me though. That shit. Some days mob lives comes out. Are you kidding? So stupid. The, the real housewives of Beverly Hills. I watched the real housewives of Miami ad the other day, just the ad and I cringe and I just grabbed the remote controller, shut it off quick. Like just thinking that these women could enter into my life somehow or another through me watching them on TV, but somehow or another they can make their way into my life would be annoying and yapping at me and they were hitting each other and screaming at each other, you know, he and Miami, you got to do this and you're going to do that. Then. Oh, come on. I don't watch that show. Just, I don't watch all reality shows. Just a couple. We got, there's gotta be fighting and violence. If there's not fighting, I don't want to watch it. Is that a weird position for you to be in a reality show when you, you know, you, you're, you're, you've got a very different sort of a reality show because it's obviously a reality show about your artwork. I mean, it's about your expression. It's about originally

Speaker 4:          02:05:38       docu series. It was a very formatted show is like where you, you, the premise was like you would learn the story about the tat, the story behind each of the tattoos and the interaction between tattooer and client. And then that, and then like I was 80% of the show in the 20% of it was our own personal life stories. You know, that we're somehow connected to tattooing. And then as the show went on, I can't, man, I can't believe we were on for so long, you know? And um, how many seasons where you on for? It's, it's, it's weird because, uh, contractually it's different. It's different. We were basically on for, uh, seven years. Six or seven years. Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:06:16       That's incredible. Yeah. What's a great premise for a show? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:06:21       Two more. The it flipped, so it's like 20% are an 80% drama and most of it was produced. Hence, oh, that girl got on the show, which I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:06:31       Yeah. Well why do that? See that's, that's Hollywood idiots. Because I think first of all, I'm a fan of tattoos and ours of course, and just having a show where it was just, you produce it, you dictate what's going on. Just about the actors. It seems like you could do that though. Yeah. And people would enjoy it and it would be pure. I mean, I would watch a time lapse of, oh my God, that's the old footage. Why shouldn't it? Why should you do it that way? I mean, it seems like someone who would be an idiot to try to do it in any way other than your personality. Why would they not do that?

Speaker 4:          02:07:01       Really? It's the way it's not, it's not the, it's the demand. Do you know what I mean? It's, it's not the domain. It is the demand. Because what it is, it's like it's, it's all based on money and numbers for the network. So whatever situations and drama show peaks and they have these tests that they run, that's what they, and I don't believe it.

Speaker 1:          02:07:20       I can't disagree more with you. Hey listen, this is why

Speaker 4:          02:07:23       I would, I, I'm on your, I'm on your side. I know you are. I know you are. But the way that the network sees it is what's going to generate more money and it's going to be viewership. Cause they could sell advertisement that's wrong about that. I know they are of the wrong. That's why they've

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       killed. I mean it played it out. Well what they're doing is they just go with the box. They go with what's word with what's worked before. This is the formula, you know. Okay, here's the wacky neighbor. Go. You know, I mean that's the formula. I mean they don't, it doesn't have to be that. That's so silly. Wacky neighbor. He, you're whacking Eva. Brian, you want to be ever wacky neighbor. He would be awesome at it. Give you the work you've done. He's a breakthrough talent. I'm telling you, you can really knock you guys over the top, bring it, bring the ratings to the top. It's just people enjoy people who are really good at things. I mean that's really what it is. That people also enjoy train wrecks, which is why you love the house wide, but you don't only enjoy it.

Speaker 4:          02:08:15       They only do. But I think that there is definitely people and some people, not everybody, but some people get lost in, um, in, in that

Speaker 1:          02:08:24       they do. But it's not like, look, there's a lot of dumb shit on my DVR. There's plenty of dumb shit. I'm, I mean I do, I watch dumb shit both for escape and for material because there's some funny shit in it. Yeah. But it's also like a lot of like really intelligent shit on my DVR to like documentaries that Morgan Freeman show through the wormhole fucking amazing show. But it's like the same people watch both things and I think that a well produced version of your show that's, you decide what the fuck goes on. You decide you're the artists. Yeah. Of course you, you talk to these people about their, their ideas, you create their tattoos and stop fucking around with all that fake shit and it would be beautiful. That dumb mother fuckers I Kat Von d alone. You stupid fucks. No, I just think Hollywood hacks. You just got to cut out that middle man and cookie cutter cuts. You don't know what you're doing. Leave her alone.

Speaker 4:          02:09:12       Yeah. Yeah. That's it. You tell them. Yeah. Those fucks creating some fake nonsense. Silly, silly bitches. Yeah. I ended up just filming, like I secretly filmed the documentary. Oh. Uh, for the last three years now. We actually finally pretty much done with it. And, um, and it's, it's awesome. It's so freeing, you know, to be able to do it that way and having the control and stuff. I wish I could have given as, as much as I gave him my documentary to show, but I really couldn't because it wasn't mine, you know? And um,

Speaker 1:          02:09:38       you should totally have your own show for the Internet. It'd be fucking gigantic. Just, just film while you're working, you're going to do it anyway. Just film while you're working, loosely edited, you know, throw a little bumper in the beginning, throw that shit online and get a million views a day. Yeah. What he wants to see. Good stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:09:54       I know, but I want to create things with a lot of qualities. I'm not, I can't just like have fast edit stuff, you know, just slap that bitch together. I have to get like my friend who does, you know, Clyde butcher and did like to kind of a control freak too. No, no, no. I just have an excellent, I just having creative intention. Right. Right. So, uh, whatever, but I mean an excellence freak. You want it to be x. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, but yeah, I think now nowadays, just with everything I have going on and it just, it's so time consuming to do television.

Speaker 1:          02:10:24       Do you take on apprentices or do you have assistants or people who ever work with you want to learn how to Tattoo? Was that ever happened?

Speaker 4:          02:10:30       Don't, at our shop, you know, I have 20 guys that worked with me and I love, we're like, we're brothers and sisters with 20 guys. I mean, you know, this is includes like our shop managers and stuff like that, you know, and, and like Dennis, he's like my first guy ever hired. He's like still there. Everybody's and we're so close, like what you see on television. Those were, you know, like the, the cast members that they didn't work at the shop with the exception of Dan Smith. Like everybody else kind of just kind of, they weren't really the true Hvt crew, you know what I mean? Right. But, um, and we love each other. We love the way it is. And I feel like when you have an apprentice that changes the dynamic because it makes somebody better than somebody else. And the way that we work is that we're all good at what we do in different ways.

Speaker 4:          02:11:09       So we're all better and not as good as each other and we inspire each other and keep each other, you know what I mean? So it's a collective, it's like totally collective and it's awesome. That sounds bad ass. It is. I mean, it's, how does someone break into your fold? How someone, that's the hardest thing is like, we've, like, we've never, every time we've let anybody outside the circle and it's never really worked out the way we need it. So it's always a, you know, it's, it's basically just who we know and kind of comes through that way. Were there any people that you work

Speaker 5:          02:11:37       growing when you were growing up that you look towards for inspiration that, that inspire you and, and, and, and like just give you, gave you momentum to create or,

Speaker 4:          02:11:48       um, yeah, I mean, I think like when I was a kid, I used to look at Tattoo magazines and when I say kid, I mean like 16 and stuff. And like I remember looking up to Jack Rudy, he was like, oh yeah, the black and gray God father and all this stuff and amazing work. That guy. Yeah. Yeah. And so, uh, the day I turned 18 I had beforehand I made an appointment with him. And really it's an advanced. And I was so excited about it and I went and got this tattoo and um, and I sat there for the fucking six hours it took or whatever. And it's one of my favorite tattoos. It's so beautiful. I still love it. Um, but I remember him sitting there going like, ah, you know, you guys don't have any business in the business. And all of a sudden I was like an 18 year old kid back then and you know, he's very old school and like sees things a different way.

Speaker 4:          02:12:28       And at the time I was like, heartbroken, you know, it was like, oh, uh, my, uh, here, I don't know he's been a hero, but like he was somebody I admired his work just like shut me down. But then at the same time like, ah, it's cool. Like, I'll watch this. Like, you know what I mean? And then, and now, you know, fast forward now that mean we've, we know each other and you know, he's, did you tell him that story? Um, no. He knows it. He doesn't remember. Yeah, he, I bet he doesn't remember. You have, I mean, I remember like, uh, one of the coolest stories. Yeah. When I was tattooing unprofessionally, when it was like an amateur, like 16 year old I went into, I had heard that there was this girl who owned a shop in Culver city. It was like the only female artists, that own shop.

Speaker 4:          02:13:11       I was like, whoa. And her name was Erica Stanley. She was bad ass. And so I remember going down national and, and I go in there and I was like, oh my God, we're here. And it was just a tattoo shop, whatever. And I see her and she's like, really beautiful. And like, she's just like a power, like she's like a force of nature. And, um, she's like, can I help you? And I'm like, yeah, you know, and I was just probably being over over the cocky, you're thinking that I had gained a place in the tattoo industry when I was just a 16 year old little punk in with a, with a bullshit bang on my arm. And it's like, and, and I'm just like, oh man. So do you have any advice for me? And I remember, she's like, yeah, Ma, the best advice I could give you as a run while you can.

Speaker 4:          02:13:48       And I remember I was so pissed off like, oh yeah, well fuck you. You know, and I left and then years later I understood what she meant by it. You know, it wasn't that she was saying, Oh, you're not good enough. It's just like, ah, like if you got the eye of the tire, you're going to do it and you're figure out your yourself. There's nothing I could tell you. It's to make you better as you know, if I were to sit there and cuddle you, like good as that. And she, she, she saw tattooing a sacred, and I remember I went to, my first tattoo convention was 18. I was like, ink slinger is, I don't even know if it's still, it's still around, but um, and one of these guys that I tattooed a Vargas portrait on, entered it into the context of best black and gray.

Speaker 4:          02:14:22       And she was the judge. And, uh, you know, she never knew my name at the time when I was 16 and I got first place and she voted for me. And I remember going up to check, oh, congratulations. It was really beautiful. I'm like, Hey, you know what's funny? When I was 16, I went to your shop and you told me that I should go run while I can. And she goes, oh my God. No. I'm like, I just want to say thank you. It's cool, you know? And well, you accepted that inspiration. The right word. Yeah. Yeah. She's still bad ass. It was, it was, it was cool. You know, she's still, I think a pioneer as far as la goes, you know, and it's cool comics

Speaker 5:          02:14:52       and, um, tattoo artists have a lot in common in that it's a very much a, an outside chance of success. We're all fucked up. Yeah. We're all both of, yeah, we're, we're both fucked up. We both have too much expression and it's a, it's one of those things where like, you know, if you say, what does your daughter do? Oh, my daughter's a tattoo artists. Like, oh Jesus, your picture and fucking bikers

Speaker 4:          02:15:17       bars. And I'd be scared if you told me her daughter's a cheerleader.

Speaker 5:          02:15:19       Oh yeah. Around football players. Yeah. Ridiculous. But you know, you say, oh my daughter's Kat von d. It's like, oh, she's a famous celebrity. Tattooist I've seen that show. She's beautiful. Different sort of, you know, it's like as you, you tell you, if you try to tell your parents you want to be a comic, they look at you like good fucking luck. Like you need to get a job that's going to work. Like that's not what do you really want to do? Yeah, exactly. Well, you know, you need to have a backup plan and you know, I don't think anybody before you, that's the, the nuttiest thing about what you did is you became like mean Ami. I guess his famous too, but he's not famous in the same way. You know, that show was that the first show Miami ink was at the first of those ink shows. He, for whatever reason, it's just, it never, it wasn't the same thing.

Speaker 4:          02:16:04       Is that what it is? Yeah, I think so. I mean people, I mean a guy with the shirt off. And I'm not saying that he's not a, I don't know him anymore. I haven't seen him in years since those times. And back then I was a drunken mess. But um, you know, people can, I think your looks get you so far, you know, and after a while you have to actually care about what you're doing and, and you know what I mean? So I think at the time it was probably hard. I can only assume how difficult it would be for something new. Like

Speaker 6:          02:16:30       there's a sensation of a new tattoo show and being like the, the front man for that must be a sidetracking at times. Maybe. I'm not sure in the, you can make mistakes, but if you could go back and do it again, knowing the reaction to all those different things, how we do something a little different. Yeah, yeah. I know what you're talking about. So it's that, that, you know, sometimes it's hard when there's no one fucked up before you, no one fucked up before you that you could watch and learn from all the fuck ups and you get all the assholes in the world. And it'd be like, I don't want to be like them. There you go. They end, they, you know, and that is the case. I mean, you know, we, we don't live in a vacuum. We all need those assholes to show us.

Speaker 6:          02:17:07       What's what it feels like to watch someone be an asshole. I know. I think it just, as much as you need inspirational people, I guess we need them all. We need everybody, right? Prime. Oh yeah. What are you doing over there? Drinking coke. Sarah caught you off guard. Chugging. Well listen, Kathy has been a lot of really, really interesting. Anytime, anytime you know you, you're very easy to talk to. A really, really cool to talk to him. Fun have on your life. Do you have like three years or something crazy? Like would you be willing to draw a death squad cat on Brian's back draw or Tattoo Tattoo? I'm sorry. You know what I mean? I mean he did get mine fixed. Oh yeah, the one that's fucked up. Yeah. We'll pull that shit up. What could you do to that? What could you do that?

Speaker 6:          02:17:53       Would he have to go and get that lasered? The options are endless. Nah, you can do something. You got options. Really? We'll talk. Cool. Really? You think you could do a cover up on that? That's beautiful. Look at that Brian. We've got something going on here for you. It's beautiful.
