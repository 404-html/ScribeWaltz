Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Good morning everybody. It's morning, it's like a real job. This is like a regular, like a regular job. Uh, this episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you. Buy naturebox. Naturebox is a, a way that you can get delicious healthy snacks delivered to your home or your office. I haven't delivered to my house, but uh, they're the official snack of the Joe Rogan experience. Now official. Really yummy stuff and you can get it as good for you as you like. Meaning, you know, you could order pretzels or if you want to, you can go gluten free. Low Sugar. They have zero trans fats, zero high fructose corn syrup, nothing artificial. And they're great. They taste delicious. There's, there's the ones that you guys will never see this show. Raja cashews. They're not getting in here. They never make it. They get to my house. I opened the box, I pop it open.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       I said, where the cashews give me them bitches. I never, I'm never bringing them in here. I just tell you right now Jamie, never get any of them. Sriracha cashews. Unless they send like a triple order. They're too good, they're my favorite new snack, but naturebox has free shipping anywhere in the US and it's just an awesome. I'll alternative to vending machines. Snacks. If you're at work and you're looking for snacks all the time and you hit that vending machine and you're like, what can I eat here? That doesn't make me feel like a piece of shit. Usually the answer is nothing. You know, maybe might go with potato chips over candy bars are fucking cookies or something stupid. But you could, uh, you could eat fairly clean. Um, I mean, you could, you could get really clean where you could have like a, they have these spicy pistachios that are delicious.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       Or like I said, you can go with pretzels, but I recommend the Sriracha cashews. Oh, they're so good. They're so good. Dude. Trust me, it would be your favorite thing if I ever bought them in. They'd never make it an end here, son. Um, but naturebox, uh, just allows you to eat, eat healthy and have it delivered to you and cut out all the nonsense of that terrible feeling that you get when you eat crappy food. And just get angry at yourself. Um, but they have a south Pacific plantain chips are another one. Fantastic. That never make it in here. They just get devoured. But go to naturebox.com/Rogan and say 50 percent off your first box. That's naturebox.com. Forward Slash Rogen naturebox.com. Forward Slash rogen. Enjoy it. I enjoy it. And like I said, they're the official snack food of the Joe Rogan experience. Would you say enjoy it and enjoy it?

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       Brody, Stevens and joy. It. Uh, we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com. That is o n n I, t on it is a human optimization website. We sell you the tools that you can use to optimize your health, your life, your fitness. We sell things like strength and conditioning equipment like kettle bells and battle ropes and mace balls and these, all these things that we use for steel, maces, all these things that we use for strength and conditioning workouts as well as healthy foods like hemp force protein powder. I'm earth grown nutrients, which is an excellent supplement to your average diet. The average healthy diet. Most folks, the reality is you don't quite get enough nutrients. You don't quite get enough healthy protein, don't quite get enough good foods and you're in your diet. Most of us are too busy. Most of us have jobs.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       Most of us work well. There's, there's certain ways that you can add to your diet where you can give yourself the building blocks, give yourself the tools that just the healthy nutrients that your body needs, like earth grown nutrients in earth. Grown nutrients is an awesome new supplements that we have that's a combination of a bunch of different things and antioxidant Brent blend that is all food based based on things like Peruvian purple, corn, ice fruit, grape skin to a ton of different ingredients. And it has a jaw dropping, 75,000 ORAC score. The ORAC score is the antioxidant score. Um, all of that is explained on, on it far better than I'll be able to explain it to you. It also has a power green blend with Spirulina, Alfalfa, oat grass, Kale, barley, wheat grass, all these different things. You can add it to a smoothie, you can add it to just a glass of water and drink it, and what it does is it gives you a little cushioning.

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       It gives you just sort of a nice supplement to cover the distance between what most folks eat and what really your body actually needs and deserves and what on it is designed for and what were. What our goals are is to give you everything that you need to optimize your health and your fitness and just to sort of bridge the gap between what the average person takes in their life and that he has in their body and what you really could actually use and need. And when it comes to the strength and conditioning equipment, we just buy the best shit we can possibly find. Whether it's ab wheels or medicine balls or kettle bells. We try to find the highest quality stuff. We try to find the stuff that we find that is the most beneficial for strength and fitness and then we sell it to you at the most reasonable way. Rates that we can. If you use the Codeword Rogan, you will save 10 percent off any and supplements yet on it. That's o n n I t and use the codeword Rogan. Alright, Randall Carlson is here. It's early in the morning. Why fuck around Jamie. Cue The music,

Speaker 2:          00:06:12       the Joe Rogan experience podcast by night trying to get the old brain fired up in the am. It's very unusual that. Well, I usually get up around this last

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       time. So do a podcast around this time. Randall Carlson, ladies and gentlemen, uh, I first met Randall quite a few years back in Atlanta. He, any, it blew my brain open with a bunch of crazy talk about asteroids and just all kinds of crazy shit. Sacred geometry. And you're a very interesting cat and you, uh, you got a lot of cool stuff to talk about. So, uh, I'm glad we finally got you here on the podcast. You were a much requested guest on my online forum so folks know about you. They know about your work and your ear. Oh, all these years of, of uh, and on anonymity. And now I'm suddenly A. I don't know if I'm ready for this job. I think you're ready, dude. I, I feel it from you. It's, this is your time to shine. All right. Joe, Carmen from you. That's all it just altered requires.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       Well, we had a great conversation when we first met and we did. Ever since then I've been trying to figure out a way to, to repeat it online. There's videos of us actually having parts of the conversation, but it's, there's music in the background. We're at the comedy club and uh, yeah. So, uh, um, you, you, you first, uh, I don't remember what we first started talking about, but you blew my mind when you started talking to me about the Holocene crater and um, that this pretty distinct evidence that there's been more than one events on this earth besides the one that everybody knows about the 65 million year ago, one with a big chunk of rock hit the Yucatan and killed the dinosaurs, but there's been a series of those and that these things may very well be responsible for a lot of the cataclysmic stories that are in epic of Gilgamesh.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       The Noah's Ark Story, all these different fables and tales of ancient traditions may be based on these cataclysmic disasters and now since we've spoken science has started to validate a lot of your theories and ideas even more substantially the discovery of this nuclear glass that they find all throughout Europe and Asia. Tell me about all this stuff. Well, did you catch the thing about a month ago? Um, I think it was in the New York Times. Most of the major newspapers are a group of former NASA astronauts and scientists came out, said we were new evidence was showing it. We're probably somewhere between three and 10 times more likely to encounter

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       things than anybody had previously been estimating even five to 10 years ago. It was a pretty major article in most of the mainstream media. You mean by encounter things by getting hit by something? Yes, of course. You remember what happened on February 15th of 2013, right? What happened on February 15th? Was that very Russian? Yeah. In. What was really interesting about that is because everybody was at least people who are interested in this sort of thing. We're kind of looking to the sky anyway because this was the closest I'm pass of a of an asteroid. I'm coming within 17,000 miles of the earth at the same time. This object totally out of the blue came in and exploded over Chelyabinsk Siberia. So it was very interesting and coincidentally, if there are such things as coincidences that here when we're expecting this very close fly by of an asteroid, a near Earth asteroid coming actually within our geosynchronous satellites, within the orbit of those satellites at the same time that this object is coming within 17,000 miles of the earth, suddenly unexpectedly, here comes the second object and explodes with the force of about a, uh, I believe it was about a 50 kilo ton nuclear weapon.

Speaker 3:          00:10:14       And of course it had exploded. I'm quite high about 20, I believe, about 18 to 20 miles in the atmosphere. And so it didn't kill anybody. However, the thing to bear in mind is if that object had been just a little bit bigger or it had been a little bit dancer or the angle of approach had been a little steeper. Instead of 1600 injuries are probably could have been 1600 or more casualties at that point. I think the world would have really sat up and taken notice. But, um, it was basically just a warning shot. It seems to me that our knowledge of asteroids and meteor impacts and things of that nature, these are our actual experience on it is based on this short window that we call human history, which is for the earth, such a brief, tiny blink of an eye. It is, although I like to point out there that, you know, when you say human history, we're talking, you know, 4,500 to 5,000 years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:11:16       Generally, I think most historians of, of ancient history will usually say that the emergence of cuneiform writing in the Middle East marks the beginning of official recorded history. But you've got to bear in mind, we, modern humans have been around a lot longer than that right now as far as the hard evidence goes to switch, which is what I like to refer to. Um, which means skeletal remains, skeletal remains of humans. That as far as we know, are basically no different than than modern humans. If you put flesh on him and dressed him up in modern clothes and they walked down the street, you wouldn't think they were anything unusual. Modern skeletal skeletal remains with modern humans are now dating between $150, 180,000 years. So when you think about that, compared to what we actually have our have our record of history or record of history is one 20th, one slash 25th one 30th of the actual time that we humans have been here now.

Speaker 3:          00:12:22       Now it could be that modern humans have actually been here much longer than than 180,000 years. We have no way of knowing at what point we moderns first appeared on this planet. But when you think of 180,000 years compared to let's say in round numbers, 5,000 years, it means that there's a lot of the human story missing. And the thing that's always intrigued me is that given the assumption that they would have had the same intelligence as us, the same, they've got the same brain case size, the same cranial capacity. So one would assume that with brains as big as our modern brains, they were able to think they had four, thought they were able to plan ahead, presumably have a, uh, you know, have some kind of a tradition that could be passed on from generation to generation and accumulated learning. But what we see is that there's basically no record to speak of, of what people were doing culturally.

Speaker 3:          00:13:21       Um, and, and that has led a lot of scientists to assume that for all those tens of thousands of years and hundreds and hundreds of generations, that people were essentially living nothing more than a subsistence, a kind of a hunter gatherer existence. Right? But what they haven't taken into account is the extremity of some of the global changes that have occurred in, in the interval that we humans have been here. And as we go through our discussion today and it will pull up some images, I think you'll begin to get an idea of how extreme and how sweeping some of these changes have been and why in the aftermath of those changes, we wouldn't, shouldn't expect to find a whole lot of hard cultural evidence. Because what you'll hopefully begin to appreciate is that we're some of these events of the scale and magnitude that have happened probably a dozen or more times in the 150 or 200,000 years that we've been here.

Speaker 3:          00:14:23       Were those events to occur today. Ten thousand years from now I'm archeologists would be sifting through the, through the rubble looking for any kind of evidence that we had ever been here. And that's the thing we have to get into our consciousness, you know. And well I guess if there's any, any implication of the work that I've been doing is that we certainly can't take our president position for granted. It seems very difficult for us to put into perspective numbers like 10,000 or a hundred thousand or a million. We know that the universe has been around allegedly for 14 billion, so the earth is four point 6 billion. Those numbers are so weird to us. They don't register. They're just like, I know 4 billion is more than 400,000, but both of them are alien. You know what I mean? It's like, I don't think we could really wrap our head around the idea that 10,000 years is such an incredible length of time that if you left a car out for 10,000 years within, you know, three or 4,000, it would be absorbed completely by the Earth Joe within three or four centuries.

Speaker 3:          00:15:36       Really? Oh yeah. I mean, if you look at, I mean steel body cars I remember very well as a kid, not far from where we lived. There was a auto junk auto graveyard and um, all the teenagers around there who were racing cars back in the fifties and crashing them up and everything, they seem to end up there. And as a kid I used to like to go and kind of hang around there and play in some of the old cars, but they were already after sitting out there for 10 years, I mean already well underway to, to rusting away. I mean, once that process of oxidation begins to take place, it accelerates not far from where I live in Atlanta. There was an old iron bridge that had been built around the 18 nineties and it's no longer there, but by the, by the 19 eighties, it had almost rusted to nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:16:24       And within a century it almost rusted to nothing. Yeah, metal does not last long. When exposed to the elements. There was an interesting series of shows a few years ago. Um, I think it was, it had to do with the idea of if, what if humans just suddenly depart? What if we took humans out of the equation? What would happen to all of the infrastructure left behind just under normal kind of gradual listic change that we're used to within the last few centuries. The upshot of it was the 10,000 years from now, it's pretty much gone. You know, I mean if you look at the, the, the great buildings that make up all the metropolis metropolitan areas now of the world, most of them are steel frame structures and they're clothed in a skin that, that will keep the elements out maybe for a half a century. But without maintenance, I mean, you know, that the, that, the Golden Gate Bridge up in San Francisco is constantly ongoing, undergoing maintenance because if you stopped maintaining it immediately, it starts decaying immediately. It starts rusting and interesting. If you think about, if we suddenly, if humans left the planet 10,000 years from now, some, some, uh, interstellar anthropologists arrive, what would they see that would indicate that we had been here? What do you think would still be left after 10,000 years? There's actually two things that

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       they named in this particular program. I bet you can guess one of them out rushmore. Mount Rushmore. Good, good guests. Yes. That's one of them. And of course the great pyramid with the other one and that's it. You know, everything else has gone. Wow. Now, when you, when you now begin to factor in, the thing that I've been basically working with is the idea that we have these intermittent, I call them nonlinearities. A discontinuity is within the normal orderly progression of things. The catastrophes, if you will, superimpose a few of those in the process and basically 5,000, 10,000 years from now, you're not going to find much to show that we had been here. That's incredible. And when you see structures like a go, Beckley tapping, which is within the last couple of decades, been on earth in, in Turkey, which has really thrown a giant monkey wrench into the timeline of the hunter gatherer, a transition into the modern agricultural, a city.

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       We were in a weird state because people are starting to dig up these things and go. Beckley. Tempe was a completely unknown structure until this one farmer or hurt or had found a stone. And, uh, started to unearthing it and then realized it was these huge stone pillars of an unknown civilization carved with three dimensional shapes of these animals. Some of them weren't, aren't even native to the area. So it's incredibly confusing and purposely covered up 14 to 12 to 14,000 years ago, which means that who knows how long it was there before it could have been several thousand years old when they decided to cover it up, but it was purposely filled in and enormous area purposely filled in somewhere around 12,000 years ago. Could it have been purposely covered up in order to protect it and preserve it could be right that we were hoping or they were hoping rather than someone like us would come along, not us, like definitely not me.

Speaker 1:          00:19:52       Maybe you know, someone would come along and uncover it and then go, Whoa, what's, uh, what's this all about? Like maybe they knew that there were going to be moments in time where these things happen, these impacts these asteroidal impacts and that there needed to be some sort of, a way of keeping track or some sort of a way of preserving well that that would probably be one way of preserving it for sure. And the other thing would be just like you mentioned the two things, Mount Rushmore, integrate pyramid, of course, are both built of stone, which is obviously much more durable than steel or you know, the fabricated materials that we're, we're making today. Even plastics, plastics are gonna Degrade over a few millennium. But if you want to preserve something for Malania, make it out of stone and making monumental. Um, and you know,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       we're looking at at something like, you just made an interesting point about it. Could we, how much previous to, to the, to the burial edit actually been there. And you know, it's difficult to dates don't. The way you would dates known is, you know, you can use various, um, oh, cosmic magenic ways where when you expose stone to atmosphere, it's going to accumulate cosmic rays which caused changes within the stone that can actually be measured. But if it's buried, it's not going to be subject to cosmic rays so that you can't date it that way. Which you would probably have to do is date. Find some organic material within the soil matrix or matrix of material around it and date that material, but even there, see that's not going to tell. That's only going to give you a minimum date, so in other words, the structure's there for who knows how long they decided to bury it and they bring in the material and bury it, and if some organic material is in that soil, it's not necessarily going to be indicative of the age of the stone structure itself.

Speaker 3:          00:21:49       It's going to be indicative of the time at which it was buried and how did they determine that it was buried at 12,000 years ago. Was it the uniformity of the depth of. I would assume now I haven't made a study of Go Beckley tappy yet. I'm hoping that when I get a chance to hang out with Graham Hancock, I'm going to get filled in on all the details of that. I don't know specifically about that other monuments. I do suspect that, you know, name Pedang is probably very old. Seen Indonesia, a lot of the monumental stone work that we find like a bailed back where you have these monstrous, a megaliths probably go back to pleistocene times. And when I say Pleistocene, I'm talking about the period from like 10,000 years back about two and a half million years ago. The time during which there has been this succession of glacial ages and Interglacial Ages.

Speaker 3:          00:22:47       Um, and you know, you mentioned the term policy, we've talked about that. Holocene is essentially the modern geological epoch. We've been in this Holocene epoch for generally they say 10,000 years in rough numbers, although it's becoming much more precisely dated now. You'll find a lot of references in the scientific literature that says, gives the date 11 point six or 11,600 years as being the onset of the Holocene. Which is an interesting date for me because I don't know if you've ever read plato in his accounts of Atlantis. There's two of his dialogues, courteous and tomatoes in which he describes Atlantis and he gives the dating and near a, at least on three separate occasions. And he always places that you know, there's this whole success, the whole lineage of the story goes back to Solon, who was a historical character, unauthenticated historical character who lived at about 600 BC and he was a law giver and poet in Athens and due to political pressures and stuff, he went into a 10 year exile and during that 10 year exile he went to Egypt and it was there that he presumably would've heard the tale of Atlantis from elderly Egyptian priests.

Speaker 3:          00:24:02       And he was told and came back and then told the story to his grandson who told it again to, to several individuals before it actually got to socrates and Plato who presumably wrote it down. But what it's interesting is that in in Plato's account, he, he gives the dating for the demise of Atlantis as 9,000 years prior to solange exile to Egypt. Well, given that, that took place and give or take a decade or two, 600 BC, we go back, that's 2,600 years ago. Okay. Add that to the 9,000 years. And we've got 11,600 years ago now, according to Plato's account, he says that it was shortly after this great war between the Atlantic eons and to produce Athenians, that there was this tremendous cataclysm and Atlanta sunk beneath the waves. So he's giving that date at 11,600 years ago. We now know from the scientific record that at 11,000, 600 years ago, there was a major climate transition and there was a catastrophic warming spike that was associated with a, a mega scale meltdown event of the great ice sheets that were covering North America.

Speaker 3:          00:25:20       It was this event at 11,600, essentially jerked the planet out of the depths of this ice agent. It had been in for thousands and thousands of years with that melting. You had a rapid rise of sea level. Um, so it's very interesting that the date that he gives is precisely now the date that, um, that the scientists are giving for this transition from what's called the younger dryas. I think Graham has mentioned that, um, in, in some of your interviews with him that the younger dryas, which was this climate spasm that ended the last ice age. So if we look at the chronology of events around 26,000 years ago, we were in the later phases of a what appears to have been an interglacial period, not too much different from what we're in now around 26,000 years ago. The climate rapidly degenerated and these massive glaciers had expanded, um, during this, what they call the final phase or, or, or, um, the late Wisconsin, they refer to it because initially they were looking for this evidence into state of Wisconsin.

Speaker 3:          00:26:34       So they, they named the, this last final phase, the late Wisconsin. So around 26,000 years ago, we see the, the launching of this final phase of the ice age. The late Wisconsin then at around 13,000 years ago is the dates are now giving it. There was this enormous spasm of warming and this seemed to be associated with rapid melting and the first real rapid sea level rise. Okay. What happened is after a very short interval of time, the climate snap back into the full depths of glacial cold. Now what had happened was if you go back 18,000 years ago, this was the coldest part of the ice age. I mean, this was bitterly cold period of time. Um, where I live in, in Georgia was the forests that grew there were like the forest you find in Canada now you had Tundra up in Northern Kentucky and Southern Idaho Tundra in southern southern Ohio.

Speaker 3:          00:27:35       Excuse me. Um, so it was a really, really different climate. And once you got to northern Ohio and the northern United States where New York City is, Chicago, the Great Lakes, the Dakotas, all of that was under this massive ice sheet. Thousands of feet thick. When you go up into Canada over Canada, the ice was up to two miles thick. I mean, think about that two miles thick of ice. And it reached from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and from the northern United States as far south as the 45th parallel all the way up to the Arctic circle. Now that is a drastically different world, bare in mind too, that with that much ice piled up on the surface of the land, sea levels which contribute to dewater, that formed that ice had to go down and it's now well documented that sea levels during the depth of the ice were at least 400 feet lower than now, which, which means that the continental shelves of the planet, we're basically exposed now, um, where I live in Georgia.

Speaker 3:          00:28:38       If you go out and stand right now on the beach, like a Cumberland Island, which is beautiful wilderness preserve your stand there on the beach. If you were suddenly transported back to the depths of the ice age, you'd be in the middle of a boreal forest, meaning a northern forest with spruce trees, large trees, alder trees to kind of trees. You find now in the northern United States, Canada, that area and the beach wouldn't have been anywhere, anywhere close. It would have been another 50, 7,500 miles further to the east because as the sea level drops, what happens? It recedes, right? And so when this final phase of the ice age came on, sea levels begin to drop, and so what it did was it exposed all of the shallow marine ecologies that, that redeemed all of the continents to the atmosphere, and basically would have caused enormous ecological havoc.

Speaker 3:          00:29:31       Well then within a millennia or so, the forests had, had expanded and had now grown out. So now off the eastern seaboard of the United States, they constantly will find the remains of tree stumps and forests that had been growing. They're 14, 15, 16,000 years ago. Now the ice begins to melt. Sea level begins to rise. Now it's important to realize that if we look at the way modern civilization has evolved, what do we see is, where did the first city show up? Don't, aren't they mostly trading cities that show up up there? Port cities, they show up along the confluence of rivers. They show up where rivers meet the oceans, they show up on the, on the coastlines. Okay? So if you had major cities during the ice age, as Graham has pointed out, there are now 400 feet underwater. Wow. So you begin to appreciate when you begin to really look at the history of our planet, what you realize is that it's just almost unimaginably dynamic.

Speaker 3:          00:30:31       This an alteration from a, from an interglacial to a glacial age is an extreme process. And so I guess the upshot of it is, is that you know, when, when we look now at the climate record that we have in hand now, which has been pretty much reconstructed with a fair amount of accuracy back to about 400,000 years. And these are primarily based on ice cores extracted from Greenland, extracted from Antarctica, extracted from mountain glaciers, and and most mostly mostly Antarctic agreement. No, when you pull out that ice core, it's layered. You think, think, think of cutting down a tree and looking at the annual layers where you can actually count the number of layers in a, in a cross section of a tree log, and you'll know how old it is. Right? Well, it's very similar in a, in a nice court, you've got layers and layers because each year they're snow.

Speaker 3:          00:31:27       That falls, it gets compressed into Fern, F, r a n, which is the transitional phase between snow and glacial ice and it eventually gets compressed into glacial ice and when you look at a cross section of the ice core, you'll see these find layers in there, right? So they can go back and they can look at these layers. They can count the layers and there's a lot of things going on in these layers. Oxygen isotopes are are critical one for for ascertaining climate changes because oxygen isotopes are a function of temperature and we have a graph here. We'll pull up in a minute. We can actually look at that, but what we see is that the climate has constantly oscillated back and forth and when we look at the Holocene, going back 10,000 years and then we take that comparatively and we go back 250 to 400,000 years, we can now begin to reconstruct these intervals of glacial periods.

Speaker 3:          00:32:21       Interglacial. And here's the thing that should be sobering to, to everybody on the planet today as we think about climate change and all of this. Because obviously it's constantly in the news and all the longest interglacial period now on record for at least last quarter million years. The longest one, the longest unbroken period of interglacial warmth is the Holocene. The one we're in now, we've already exceeded by several millennia, the longest previous period of interglacial warmth. I don't hear them talking about that. I don't hear Al Gore talking about that. I don't hear anybody talking about that in mainstream media, but it's hard scientific fact. Yeah. We would be shitting our pants way more if it was a global cooling than if it was a global warming, and let me tell her under. We're going to pull up another graph will pull up a graph in a minute which shows you that even within the last couple of thousand years, periods of global cooling have not been pleasant times.

Speaker 3:          00:33:27       Periods of global warming is when we see human population expanding. When we see cultural advancement, when we see lifespans increasing, when we see infant mortality, decreasing periods of global cooling are when we see populations going into decline. When we see lifespans diminishing, you know, we had a period of global cooling that began between 5:36 and 5:40 a d. It was this period of global cooling that launched what we know of the dark ages, and this has now been well documented by dendrochronologist. Mike Bailey is one of the leaders of this who's been looking at the climate changes of the last couple thousand years as preserved in the tree ring record between 5:36 and about 5:44 a d. We find that forest growth in the northern hemisphere almost came to a stop and one of the consequences of that was this, it was associated with a global cooling and for multiple years running, there were agricultural collapses were because of the cold and damp that came on with this.

Speaker 3:          00:34:42       Um, you know, the, the historical record is interesting because you read some of these accounts that were preserved from that period. They talk about weeks at a time where they couldn't see the sun. They talk about when it did show up, it was just a feeble imitation of itself. They talk about, you know, years with no summer basically, so what you had was succession of crop failures that lead to people becoming malnourished once they become malnourished or immune systems became weakened and in 5:40 to add about six years after this well documented transition occurred. We had the onset of the justinian plague which wiped out a third of the population of Europe and it took 300 years to recover from that. And it didn't. We didn't recover from it until the climate shifted again and we went into what's known as the medieval warm period and the medieval warm period was the time when the scandinavians were farming on the west coast of Greenland, where now it's perennially frozen and for about the next couple of hundred years, the climate was according to some researchers and some scientists as much as two degrees warmer than now.

Speaker 3:          00:35:54       And do you think it had to have been warmer if, if they were farming in greenland where it is now? Frozen ground? It had to have been warmer and one of the things that happened with was with this warming, you had an expansion of the growing season and you also had the latitude belt at which viable farming or agriculture could be. Practice shifted three to 400 miles north of where it had been, which meant that for the first time, England actually had a flourishing wine industry which didn't exist previously and it has only existed until recent times because of genetically modified crops is now allowing them to grow grapes where they haven't been able to grow wine grapes until we go back to the medieval warm period. So what happened was now there was a lot of food for people to eat, right? People got healthier.

Speaker 3:          00:36:49       A human population began to increase, right? We begin to accumulate wealth. We begin to, to carry on commerce and trade. After this 300 years of dark ages were learning receded into the, into the monasteries. And life was very unpleasant, very short, very brutal, very unpleasant. Now we had this warming period, okay? With the growth, the expansion of agriculture and the abundant food supply. And the, um, prolific harvest people were getting strong, healthy again, a statute and it's been well documented that during this two or 300 years of the medieval warming period, human stature actually increased by inches. Average human size, okay. Um, by 1150, this accumulated wealth that had ensued from the, the, the, the, the benign climate of the medieval warm period is what allowed the, um, the Great Cathedral building era to ensue which began between 1130 and 1150 add and what we see as eco magnificent cathedrals.

Speaker 3:          00:37:59       If you've been to Europe and visited any of the Kathy put that on your to do list, get there and look at some of these extraordinary works of art that were built during the high gothic or high middle ages between, like I said, about 1150 and the early 13 hundreds. They built 80, about 80 of these gigantic magnificent cathedrals that, that required the organizing of, of thousands of highly, highly skilled craftsman armies of workers and craftsman. You had stone masons and carpenters and glaziers and astronomers and GM attritions and, and all of these people brought together to create these incredible cathedrals, and it was made possible by the fact that European society had become relatively wealthy and this wealth was brought on by this global warmth. Right now what we see, go ahead to the, to the beginning, to the end of this magnificent gothic building.

Speaker 3:          00:39:02       Boom. And, and by the way, there's about 500 smaller abby's that were constructed during this interval. This was a very prolific time for a number of reasons. This was the time that you had the templar knights forming. You've probably heard of that. The tempur nights, I'm sure. Um, you had schools of Kabbalah being founded in Spain and, and you had the rise of Catheter Ism. You had the troubadours, you had these amazing spiritual things going on. Um, amazing. Culturally. It was a very extraordinary time. Those high Middle Ages. Well, a lot of those gothic cathedrals were never finished. And what we see is that some of them have the appearance. You know, I'm a builder by profession and you know it's, it's, I've looked at some of these in a what it's very much like as they're going along building and then all of a sudden one day nobody shows up to work and there are still tools laying around or still materials that are often a pile that we're waiting to be incorporated into the structure.

Speaker 3:          00:40:04       And what happened was that the climate began to cool again between 13, 15 and 1320 precisely. When we see the end of this tremendous gothic building boom is when the climate began to cool and it's cool for the next several decades. And what we then see as a repeat of what happened between 5:36 and 5:42 had agricultural collapses. Crops rotting in the fields. People going hungry between, I think it was around between 13, 14 and 1345. The onset of the black plague. And once again the population of Europe was decimated and it took 150 years basically to recover from that. And what we see is that what what what was happening is the planet with shifting into what's called the little ice age, where you probably heard that term, the little ice age, right? There was two phases to the little ice age and the first phase began, like I said, around 13, 20, lasted about 150 years and there was a break and it was during that break, that warm period that basically the renaissance kicked in and we began to really move forward.

Speaker 3:          00:41:14       The second phase of the little ice age came in during the 16 hundreds and it was actually even colder than the first phase. And worldwide glaciers expanded to the largest. They had been in 10,000 to 12,000 years since the end of the big ice age throughout the whole Holocene glaciers had been smaller. Now during the big eye, the little ice age, they grew and they grew to the biggest that they've been in 10,000 years. It's important to have that context of understanding when we talked about glacier recession because the glaciers begin to recede around the middle of the 19th century worldwide, as the little ice age began to wane and global warmth, warmth begin to return to the planet. This happened in the mid 18 hundreds, around 18, 40 to 18, 60. We see the little ice age coming to an end, and at that point, the glaciers worldwide began to recede.

Speaker 3:          00:42:10       They begin to contract. They've been pretty much contracting uniformly since then, so when we're talking about glacier recession, it's important to understand that the glacier recession really began a century and a half ago or more, and his basically considered continued more or less uniformly since then with no real change with the advent of of human a fossil fuel to the atmosphere, a human carbon dioxide which began really in earnest during the Second World War is when when we begin to add significant amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, it's important to realize that the glaciers had been receiving almost a full century before that point.

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       So when you see all this, a modern hysteria about global warming and the human created global warming that we, we keep hearing about in the news and that our influence on the atmosphere. Does it drive you crazy? I mean, do you think it's silly? It obviously human beings are contributing to the carbon footprint, right? Obviously. Yeah. Obviously. And obviously that has an effect on global warming.

Speaker 3:          00:43:23       Yes, yes. But you've got to bear in mind at carbon dioxide is only one variable in a very complex equation, right? There are many factors influencing climate of which carbon dioxide is only one. My problem with so much of the stuff that's coming out in mainstream media, which is coming through the intergovernmental panel on climate change, is simply that when, when they were instituted back in early nineties by the United Nations, the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change basically gave them a mandate which is demonstrate that humans are causing climate change, right? So they focused exclusively on carbon dioxide, but there's all kinds of other things going on. For example, cosmic rays are constantly bombarding the earth, right? Cosmic rays produce clouds. The more of the cosmic rays penetrate the atmosphere, the more a low altitude cloud cover there is. Low altitude clouds reflect heat back into space. Now the amount of cosmic rays are penetrating the atmosphere.

Speaker 3:          00:44:31       A function of a couple of things. You've got the helio sphere, which is the whole, essentially the, the, the, the energy envelope of the sun, which encompasses the whole solar system. The Sun actually is fairly variable. Um, and what that means is that when the solar wind is an in more intense phase, like when, when the sun spots, for example, are very active, the solar wind is, is much stronger. What that does is it serves as a buffer that prevents cosmic rays from penetrating the atmosphere of the earth as, as strongly as they did previously. Also, the geomagnetic field of the earth acts as a buffer. So here's two things that are completely not included in the scenarios of the ECC, but probably have a very profound effect on global climate. Um, the earth's geomagnetic field is, you probably know that the geomagnetic field has periodically throughout earth history disappeared completely.

Speaker 3:          00:45:36       Sometimes it's it's disappeared and come back with reverse polarity will let geomagnetic field acts as a buffer, which helps to reduce the amount of cosmic rays penetrating the atmosphere. How's it disappeared completely? I don't know, and I don't know if really anybody knows. I haven't kept up with all of the most recent research. What's the geomagnetism, but you know when you've got you hold a little compass in your hand and it points to north, right? Right. Okay. That's the Jew magnetic field that's being measured by the compass. It's moving, it's fluctuating, and for whatever reason throughout the the history of the earth, it has completely disappeared at some points and his reverse polarity. It's. It was the reversing of the polarity of the magnetic field that helped prove, prove the reality of continental drift because as the mid Atlantic Ridge separates and and and a lava flows out, it crystallizes and locked into the crystal and structure of the of the lava is the direction of the magnetic field and the polarity of the magnetic field is imprinted in there.

Speaker 3:          00:46:46       If you look at the research going back to the 19 fifties, they realized that you had stripes effect effectively as you moved away from Tomato Atlantic Ridge as the, as the lava flow it out and crystallized, locked in the magnetic field. They looked at it and they could see that there were times when it had completely reversed itself. And so this was like very powerful evidence that the, that the theory of continental drift was right, that, that the Atlantic Ocean had been spreading. And getting back to this whole Atlantis thing, which is interesting to me is because when you look at, at um, replay those account, he describes Atlantis as being a west of the pillars of herrick lease, which of course is the Straits of Gibraltar, the mouth of the Mediterranean.

Speaker 3:          00:47:36       He describes how if you go, you come to some islands, then you come to some more islands and that was the island complex of Atlantis and beyond. That was another whole continent. He describes that, right? If you look in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, you've got the [inaudible] plateau, which is now a couple of thousand feet under the sea. The aes or islands are the tops of mountains that, that emerged from the surface of the ocean, right? And they sit right on the Atlantic, uh, the mid Atlantic Ridge, now, the mid Atlantic Ridge, some of the thinnest crust on, on the planet, right? And if it's like a giant suture or a giant crack that runs up halfway around the planet, well, when you have an ice age and you start piling ice up onto like the North American continent, what happens is the weight of that ice begins to crush the crust of the earth down into the mantle.

Speaker 3:          00:48:39       It's called isoss to see which is a vertical movement. You know, continental drift is horizontal. I saw stussy is vertical now it's just like right now you're sitting on that soft chair, right? And your ass is creating a depression in the cushion of the chair, right? That's isostatic depression. You didn't realize that. Did you know that your ass is creating isostatic depression? Right? And when you get up and you walk away, then you will have isostatic compensation. You'll have isostatic rebound because the cushion will now rise because the weight has been removed. It's the same thing with the ice mass on the continent. The ice mass was hundreds of billions of trillions of tons of ice. It pressed the center of the North American continent or, or the center of at least Canada down perhaps as much as several thousand feet into the mantle. With the removal of that ice, the land begins to rebound. Hudson Bay is the depression leftover from the thickest part of the ice right now.

Speaker 3:          00:49:44       Our photographs, we could probably even pull some up here in a minute. There are photographs taken where you can see the elevated shoreline surrounding Hudson Bay because it's still rising, right? What's interesting too is if you look at the, the, uh, the distance between these shorelines, you'll see that early on there was a greater distance because the land was rising faster. As the millennia have have gone on, the distance separating each shoreline has diminished. But now you have to think that all of that weight is being transferred back into the ocean basins. A lot of it was dumped directly into the Atlantic Ocean, either via, like the St Lawrence River up there, the Hudson River, up in the New York area, or via the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico. Now you've got all this water dumping back into the ocean. Like I said, ocean levels are coming up hundreds of feet, right? So now you're adding all of this weight to the ocean basin and now you've got the mid Atlantic Ridge, which is some of the thinnest crust on the earth.

Speaker 3:          00:50:47       Right? This is what it's doing. It's like a hinge line. Right? So now you picture during a glacial age, when the weight is taken out, it does. This lifts up, lifts up, listening, not watching. Yeah. When the ice melts, the water goes in, sea level rises, it subsides. Right now you look at the [inaudible] plateau is a chunk of the African plate that got left over when the continent's separated around 70 to 80 million years ago. Right. If you've seen the maps into the showing how you can fit the continents together. Yeah, if you fit these back together, if you, if you reverse continental drift, go back about 70 or 80 million years and it's all fits together like a piece of the puzzle, but when it's separated, a piece of the of the African plate got left behind and this is what is the [inaudible] plateau and it sits right there, a stride.

Speaker 3:          00:51:45       The Atlantic Ridge, it's maybe a little bit smaller than the than Iceland, which is considered to be an island, but a pretty good sized island right now. If you're doing this and you have as much as two or 3000 feet or maybe more of this vertical movement, right, and you added that to 400 feet of sea level rise. Now you can, I think, begin to get a scientific rationale for how you may have had a large island in the Middle Atlantic back during the ice age. Also, additional evidence has suggested that the Gulf stream, which now basically brings a subtropical warmth up to northwestern Europe. I mean, if you were to terminate the Gulf stream, England would, would have some pretty, pretty, um, malignant times. So in northwestern Europe, because the warmth is being brought up by that Gulf stream, right? Well, during the ice age, the Gulf stream diverted to the south at about 45 to 46 degrees, which was hundreds of miles further south and it now goes.

Speaker 3:          00:52:51       So essentially if you look at the [inaudible] plateau, a big chunk of that, a source plateau would have been above sea level during the ice age. And that Gulf stream with its warmth would have just basically embraced it. See? So if you suddenly, joe found yourself transported mysteriously back to the ice age, that's probably where you might want to go is the [inaudible] plateau. It might've been, uh, one of the most benign places on earth to live during the ice age. And if there was a place where civilization could evolve, that would be a very logical place for it to occur. There's nothing really pseudoscientific now about assuming that there could've been some type of historic reality behind these stories of Atlantis. Of course, the problem is as the wound will factor that has gotten so grafted onto these stories, but you know,

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       crystals and aliens and flying ships and you. I mean we don't know, but you know, we don't have any hard evidence, but the hard evidence does suggest that there could have been some very benign habitable islands, large islands in the mid Atlantic during the ice age. Wow. So that's intense. That's so incredible. It's so. It's, it's, it's so crazy to think how, how much things have changed while human beings have been here. The idea that during go Beckley tappy, which is 12,000 years ago, that North America was covered with ice and they. This was when these people in Turkey had created this incredible structure. So when you see this, the modern hysteria about global warming, which is really essentially been like a wrestling match between the left and the right, it's this weird thing where the right wants to support like burning coal and they don't want to diminish the economy by putting all these environmental regulations on natural resources. And then the left, which is screaming at the top of their lungs that the sky is falling, the oceans are going to rise and people are going to drown. W when you, when you know so much about what has happened over the course of the earth, when you've studied this for a great deal of time like you have, what is your take on all this stuff?

Speaker 3:          00:55:05       Well, I guess my intake is, is, is fairly simple. I, I tend to think that, you know, if you know, if you're looking at the, the, the whole process of if you look at the carbon cycle, for example, what, what you see there is interesting. We can talk to this to this as much as possible so we can have his little variation in the tone as possible. Thank you. Um, you know, putting this into context, we have to say, right now we're approaching 400 parts per million of the ambient amount of Co. Two in the atmosphere. AT the beginning of the industrial revolution, it was about 100 parts per million less. It's, you could say basically that over the last century we have increased the amount of co two measurable co two into the atmosphere, assuming that it's all from us. Now, I meAn there, there, there's questions about that too, because if there are other factors inducing global warming such as changes in, in solar irradiance, the amount of installation penetrating the atmosphere and so on, it means that the oceans are warming as a result of that.

Speaker 3:          00:56:09       Okay. Oceans are a gigantic carbon dioxide sink. When they're warm, they exude carbon dioxide when they're cold, they absorb it, right? So if you have a natural warming, it's gonna expel some carbon dioxide. So it's not even clear necessarily that that 100 parts per million is totally the result of fossil fuel burning. But for the sake of argument, let's say that it is okay, 100 parts per million, that's minuscule trace of this very important constituents of our atmosphere. You know that carbon dioxide is what fuels photosynthesis, right? And if you start reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and you'd start, once you start dropping below 200 parts per million and you get down to about 1:50 to 100 photosynthesis plant, photosynthesis starts shutting down. I mean it's kinda like the amount of co two in the atmosphere right now is at the very bottom of the scale.

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       You know, if we look at history going back when you mentioned the cretaceous tertiary, when the dinosaurs ruled, there have been many times more the amount of ceo to up to well in excess of a thousand parts per million. Several thousand parts per million in the atmosphere. But if we have increased the amount of co two by 100 parts per million in 100 years, it means we've for every million molecules of air up there, we add one molecule of co two every year or two. Maybe try to make it a little bit more comprehensible. If for every hundred thousand molecules of air up there every 10 years we had one molecule of co two. I. I'm not convinced that that's going to lead to global catastrophe. I mean, think of it this way, you've got a huge tank with a hundred thousand fish in it every 10 years you're throwing one more fish.

Speaker 3:          00:58:08       Are you even going to notice that? You know, I think that what's happened is that ceo to, like I said, is one variable in a very complex equation, but all of the other variables as far as the, the government funded research ngos have been excluded from the debate. And what dismays me is that we're told that all scientists agree on this. No, all scientists don't agree. When you have though a major government funded program like climate change research, which is funded to the tune of about $2,000,000,000 per year, you're going to have a large vested interest in basically. I mean, if these guys came out and said nascio two is really not a big deal, it's perhaps fueling plant growth. Um, and this is an interesting aside, you know, if you look at the, um, the projections of forest in inventory back in the fifties and sixties based upon deforestation is a result of timber as a result of agriculture. The projections that at how quickly, um, forest inventories we're going to, if you look at those projections back in the fifties and sixties and then you realize that in the ensuing period of time, we've now got exhaustive, highly accurate satellite surveys that can actually count the number of hectares of forests. what's interesting is in the nineties when they really started looking at this date of just how much forest there was compared to what the projections were, there was like 25 to 40 percent more forests worldwide than anybody had predicted.

Speaker 3:          00:59:54       What fueled this prolific forest growth? Well, it's very likely that at least part of it was because of the slight increase in ceo to Israel resolved as a result of our fossil fuel burning. Now we, we put in every year we burn about a, in introducing into the atmosphere about 6 billion tons of co two. Well there's about 750 or 760 billion tons of co two in the atmosphere naturally. And at least a third of that is cycling through from the atmosphere into the biosphere, into the oceans and so on. So our contribution isn't really that significant, but another part of the. The argument is that, and this has been admitted right in the ipc reports, is that based on the amount of fossil fuel that we're burning, there should be twice as much co two into the atmosphere in the atmosphere as we're now measuring. So what they have been talking about for about 15 years now is where's the missing carbon?

Speaker 3:          01:00:59       What's this missing? Carbon sink will probably. Some of it's going into the ocean, but most likely a lot of it is going into fueling plant growth and forest growth worldwide. And there's a lot of studies that are beginning to come out now that shows that perhaps some of the desert areas of the planet rather than expanding are actually contracting. So, you kNow, at thIs point there's a lot of things we still have to learn when it comes down to understanding the climate. We're in the infancy. You, you can't talk to a single climatologist and come up with one single coherent answer or agreement on what has actually provoked the planet to go into a full ice age or what has caused it to come out of an ice age if you don't have, if you don't know that. We still have a hell of a lot to learn about how the climate works, so I get really frustrated when I hear this claim that the debate is over. The debate is over because the debate hasn't really even begun yet. You say we need to really look at all of these other factors as well. I mean, when you look at at at wind currents and ocean currents, you have the, the el nino, southern oscillation. You have the, the, the indian ocean dipole, you have the pacific decadal oscillation. All of these things have a very profound influence on the climate, but they're essentially being

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       ignored within the. Within the government funded science to a large extent and you have a lot of scientists who have objected to some of the claims of certainty made by the ipc see scientists, and for the most part the left likes to demonize them. This is people like, oh, I think probably the the leading demon of climate deniers is fred singer because he wants was given an a, a $10,000 unsolicited donation from exxon years and years ago, but you've got guys like Roy Spencer and craig ensure would id, so when robert balling and Timothy Ball and and and the list goes on and on. These are distinguished climate scientists that have devoted their lives to understanding climate science, who say, well, there's a lot of flaws in the methodology of the ipc, but by saying that now they have entered the, the, the spawn of hell according to the left. Now in.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       You're right. See what happened. It's turned into a political football. It's an idler ideological debate. It's an ideological debate, a political debate, and it's just too bad that the science of the thing has had to suffering. The consequence. It is, it is fascinating because even hearing you say this, I'm, I'm, I'm thinking like it starts popping triggers like I'm not the type of person that worries too much about being labeled because I've been labeled a million times already as an idiot. It doesn't. It doesn't bother me to start contemplating the possibilities of controversial ideas, but when I'm listening to you saying this, all I'm hearing is the knee jerk reaction of climate denier climate to always a climate denier. This guy's a climate denier and seeing these fucking things that we've grown to be accustomed to on television where you have a guy on the left who has one point of view and a guy on the right who says something wacky and then everybody fights about it and then the youtube clips.

Speaker 1:          01:04:23       You look at the comments and it's filled with this guy's a faggot and that guy's effect. This guy eat shit. I hope your house goes under water. You fucking climate denier and when I'm listening to you and you mean this podcast has been over an hour already and it's incredibly complex. We have barely scratched the surface and you're never going to hear anything like this on any television show because most people feel that the general public does not have the attention span to absorb. All of this information is really complex explanation of the known science, of the changing of the atmosphere of the earth. So when people start talking about climate denying and you know what, what is going on with climate change, what they're really doing is establishing their position on what side I am the side of. I'm a person who believes in science and education, but how much of this have you actually explored?

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       How much of it as anybody actually looked at? Well, I'm a person who supports industry and I'm a person who believes the United States needs to recover from our economic disaster and we got a frack, a few wells, you know, so be it. You know, there's these two very distinct and oftentimes shallow ideological perspectives. And when I say shallow, shallow from the point of the general public person like me who's not a scientist observing it. And just picking aside with very little information really, and you talked to, I would like to grab, grab the average person, the average leftie and the average kid that thinks that they're, you know, they have an opinion on global change. And just just do me a favor and just write down what you know, just write down. I don't want you looking online. Do you have an opinion? Write down what you know you wouldn't.

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       You know, dog shit. most people know dog shit. It's true. It's true. Joe, it's so fascinating. It's so fascinating to me because it becomes another one of those things. Ideology is. I mean, I don't remember who said it, but it's, it's the enemy of free thinking. You get in these ideological clusters and then anything outside of this thing, these predetermined patterns of behavior that you have to subscribe to anything becomes forbidden. It becomes you. You can't even entertain it. You can't even approach the idea or you see it with everything you see with atheism. You see it with, you see it with any isms, with feminism, with the men's rights. You see it with people who subscribe to the right people, subscribed to the left, any variables that don't fit into their equation that they've already subscribed to, they don't want to be labeled as that other side and anytime they don't want to be labeled that they start ignoring any evidence or any ideas that don't fit within this really rigid description.

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       That's exactly right. I mean, that is, you hit the nail on the head job weird. Exactly right. People get locked into these ideological paradigms and then from that point on, basically their perspective is modified more by emotion and rationality is more by, you know, their feelings rather than real information. And, and it's too bad. I mean, I don't know what to blame it on. Maybe the fact that the government runs all the schools, I don't know, you know, the government monopolizes the education system, so they're not teaching people critical thinking skills. They're not teaching people how to actually become, how to be scientifically literate, um, which is really sad. Um, but you know, it's like, you know, you keep hearing the term climate change denier, right? Well, there's no such thing, I don't think you're going to find a

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       single climate scientist of any persuasion that denies that the climate is changing and you got to realize that the terminology has shifted. It was global warming originally when, when James Hansen gave his testimony before congress in the summer of 1988, um, you know, and proposed these potential tipping points and catastrophic outcomes of our burning of fossil fueled. We've gOne from there to the united nations getting involved in the united nations, setting up the whole the epcc and channeling all of this funding to it. And I think the consequences is that, you know, when you say again, excuse me, we went from global warming to climate change. Why dO they not really used global warming is a term anymore is mainly because for 15 years the average global temperature is flatlined. And this is based upon, you know, the most accurate like satellite surveys. The ipc generally focuses only on ground based sensors which are subjected to, uh, perhaps some considerable bias because you know, you picture a ground based sensors, most of them are sitting at airports when these things were being put in post world war ii, the bulk of them, forties and fifties into the sixties.

Speaker 3:          01:09:37       Many of these airports were rural. They were, you know, adjacent to small towns. They were surrounded by fields and farms. For us, what's happened is the urban area has encroached, you know, every when you, when you create streets, pavement buildings, all of this absorbs heat, right? And, and no one has really done an exhaustive study of the potential bias. It's introduced into the ground based sensors. That part, at least part of the warming of these ground based sensors may have nothing to do with carbon dioxide at all. It may just have to do with the fact that they're sitting next to a huge parking lot. You see, and I mean you knoW yourself, if you walk out, you know if you're walking in a field and then you walk onto an asphalt parking lot immediately, it's, it's much, much hotter. You see Anthony Watts, who is another one of the, the, the dissenters that who's demonized is the only one who has really attempted to exhaustedly document the accuracy of the ground based sensors and what he's come up with is that perhaps as much as 30 to 50 percent of the perceived warming of the last century, which is about eight tenths of a degree centigrade, is probably as a result of that bias.

Speaker 3:          01:10:57       It's been introduced by what's called the urban heat island effect and all of the major city. La has a urban heat island mitigation program underway. All of the major metropolitan cities are now trying to mitigate the effects of this heat because of all of the samantha in the buildings and the pavement in the parking lots. They're always hotter than the surrounding rural areas. So the question has been legitimately raised. How much of a bias has been introduced into the, um, into the ground based sensors? Well, when we turn to the balloon sensors, the radio sonne balloon sensors into satellite sensor is basically what they're showing is that the average global temperature has been flat for 15 years. Well, because of that and, and many of the, the key, uh, scientists like phil jones of the ipc has basically publicly admitted, yeah, the, when you look at the average temperature from that perspective, it hasn't warmed in 15.

Speaker 3:          01:12:00       Now there are regional pockets of, of warming, and you know, records being sacked all the time because local conditions will affect change enormously. Just like I was talking about the urban heat island effect is, is a local or regional condition, but because of the fact that the climate hasn't warmed statistically significantly in 15 years, now we don't talk about global warming. We talked about climate change, but those two terms are not interchangeable. Global warming. It's a very specific model of climate change, which is that you've got this 15 micron wavelength of co two in the atmosphere that's trapping infrared radiation emanating from the earth. Right, okay. But if you're talking about climate change, now suddenly you know our, our umbrella goes much, much huge and it now encompasses all of these other things that I was talking about and and to question the consensus idea, to consent to question that ceo two is the primary or sole driver of climate is not to be a climate change denier.

Speaker 3:          01:13:11       See, because no, I would challenge anybody even uses that term will show me an example of any climate scientist, no matter where they fall in the argument that is denying that the climate is changing. I mean anybody who has studied the climate all knows that it has changed dramatically in dynamically on any scale you can look at whether it's the decadal scale as centennial or millennial or beyond. it changes on every level and that's the thing. We have to recognize that if we stop burning fossil fuels tomorrow, we didn't drive another car. We didn't. We shut down all the coal plants. I'm going to tell you this. The climate would not stop changing.

Speaker 1:          01:13:54       When you see a story like here's one, it's in the news about a us senator marco rubio's denial of manmade climate change should play well with his tea party base who support he'll need if he indeed runs for president in 2:16, but in taking this position, florida's junior republican senator ignores the vast majority of the world's climate scientists who say human activity is contributing to climate change and rising sea levels. Human

Speaker 4:          01:14:25       activity is contributing to climate change. No doubt. There's no doubt that human activity contributes to climate change. Human activity, again, is one variable in a very complex equation. I wish mark marco rubio would keep his mouth shut until he goes and spends about six months or a year. Really doing the homework because then you could talk a little bit more intelligently about it.

Speaker 1:          01:14:49       That is the problem, right? It really does take that long. It does. Like he. I know you have. What did I meet you at six, seven years ago? Something like that. Yeah, and you had already spent decades observing the effects of climate change and of asteroidal impacts and the history of these things. I mean the amount of time just absorbing the information so you could rattle it off like this in a podcast. I mean, what the fuck got you into this? How did you get down this rabbit hole? Well, this is an odd rabbit hole, right? Rabbit hole. It's a fascinating rabbit hole. I'm so thankful. Not only that you've gone down, but that you're willing to exchange this information with us or imparted on us because it's. It's a very different perspective because I know you're not a right wing lunatic. You are very science based guy, but you're. You're looking at this and the way you're explaining it is incredibly rational and incredibly frustrating to me that there's not that many people that are, that are, that are saying this well. The upside

Speaker 4:          01:15:56       I think of the whole global warming issue or the climate change issue is this, that if you know, the thing is, is I made the point that even if we stopped all fossil fuel consumption tomorrow, the climate is still going to change and it's going to change dramatically. It's going to change sometimes even catastrophic when we need to do from here on out is basically think about strategies of adaptability if as a result of this whole issue, even even though I think it's misplaced based mis misapplied, if part of that comes out of this is that we begin to develop strategies of adaptability. That would be a good thing if however we focused so exclusively on carbon dioxide to the exclusion of everything else. That could be a bad thing. Um, because the climate is going to change no matter what we do or where we go with it, the climate is going to.

Speaker 1:          01:16:53       So you can put up solar power panels until the cows come home. The houses that are on the beach in malibu are still going to be underwater in 100 years. Well, not necessarily. Not necessarily so buy real estate in malibu. Well, see, the thing is, if you look at the. I mentioned earlier

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       that there was a break in the, in the little ice age of about 150 years that that basically led to the renaissance. Right? Well, we've been in a, in a receSsion of the little ice age, a an interruption of the little ice age for about 150 years and right now you know, and again, the ipc, one of the things that frustrates me is that they basically excludes solar physicists and solar scientists who are essentially saying that insulation levels, insulation, the amount of solar energy penetrating the atmosphere is one of the lowest levels in thousands of years. and I mean there are solar physicists that are saying, you know what, we could be at the beginning of another phase of the little ice age. Now if our ceo to it's helping new ameliorates somewhat returned the little ice age, that would be a good thing. So muscle cars or green, that's what I'm getting out of this.

Speaker 3:          01:18:07       Coal and muscle cars are good for the forest. Well, the property, the problem with coal is not so much the ceo to is to me, it's just the particulate matter. You know, that's a different question altogether. The pollution, the pollution, which is horrific. In China, when they had these coal plants and you see these people that are essentially walking, it looks like they're in the middle of a forest fire. They're walking down the street and it's just dark everywhere. That's a different issue, you know, and, and, and I'm, I consider myself a conservationist in the respect that we basically need examples of an, a pristine nature because ultimately nature is the most powerful teacher and we need examples. We need places where nature's just left alone to do its thing without interference of human beings. We need clean air. Nobody has the right to dump shit in the air that other people have to breathe.

Speaker 3:          01:19:01       Nobody has the right to dump shit in the water that other people have to drink. To me, those are different questions and really where are the more of our focus should be rather than these abstractions. I have found the course. I've gotten some flack over the last few years by saying some of the things I've been saying here. You know, that I've had people stand up and accused me, oh, you're just saying we can just do anything we want. We can just destroy the earth, which of course is not the case, and not saying that at all, not saying that at all. And, and when we began to look at the bigger context of this thing and we begin to understand that the extraordinary changes that this planet has been through, um, and even to some of the lesser things in recent years, mt. St helen's, you remember when that erupted in 1980 tens of thousands of acres were turned into a lunar landscape, right?

Speaker 3:          01:19:51       Well, if you read the accounts of the scientists, the biologists, zoologists, the ecologists that had been studying what happened to that decimated landscape and the aftermath, what you find out is they're surprised, almost shock. It helped quickly nature recovered from that and how quickly, you know, colonizer plants moved in, uh, and was followed by a whole, the whole succession, ecological succession of reclaiming that land. If you look at the, the exxon valdez disaster up in Alaska, in Alaska, and that was over the short term, devastating to the local ecology. And yet, what's interesting again, um, there've been several books written by some of the lead scientists involved in that talking about how remarkably quick nature begin to reclaim and recover from it. And here's some irony where the government forced exxon to go in and do it's cleanup is actually suffered more than the areas that were just left alone for nature to reclaim.

Speaker 3:          01:21:02       That's fascinating. So the chemicals that they used in order to break up, that was the issue with the gulf as well, right? With those dispersants that they were spraying over the area, they probably should've just left the gulf alone because, you know, when you have a submarine earthquakes, they can expel huge amounts of hydrocarbons into the ocean. Nature has been dealing with massive expulsions of hydrocarbon into the oceans and into the marine ecology for, for millions and millions of years. Um, you know, it was bad. But I think what we'll see is that the recovery time has been consumed faster than most people believed possible. you see, I think what's, what's really going to turn out in the end looking at all this, is that nature is robust. And when we begin to look at the number of times that nature has been disrupted by, we've been talking about asteroids and comets, and here's, here's a perspective for you, you know, at the peak of the cold war, when us and the soviet union were eyeball to eyeball with our nuclear weapons on, on high alert, and we had, we had 10,000 weapons on our side. They had 10,000 weapons on their side. The total nuclear arsenal at the times had about 18,000 megatons of, of energy capable of being delivered. 18,000 megatons. Now that means 18 million tons of tnt. The bomb that destroyed hiroshima was about 10,000 tons of tnt. So 100 times a hundred hiroshima bombs would be one mega ton. Right now there was aBout say 15 to 18,000 megatons total in the arsenal of the superpowers during the height of the cold war had we unleashed an all out nuclear war and

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       fired every warhead that we had in our arsenals at each other 15,000 warheads, you know, I mean, yeah, 20,000 warheads, 15,000 megatons. It would have been an environmental disaster, unprecedented in history. You remember the scenarios about nuclear winter, right? Because of all of the fires and the suit and the particulate matter thrown into the atmosphere. It could literally bring on a a mini ice age, right? And and probably cause without even the radiation caused, major collapse of the human population. Right? Get this number in your head. 15,000 megatons. Okay. Now even a small asteroid impact or let's say, let's say the, the asteroid impact that that struck the yucatan. There's a simple formula that you can use when you look at the crater size. you take the size of the crater and raise it expressed in kilometers. Raise it to the power of three point four and multiply the result by two point four and what it's going to give you as the energy yield in megatons of that object striking.

Speaker 4:          01:24:15       If I put in 180 kilometers into this calculator here, which is the diameter of the yucatan crater, and I raise it to the three point four power, and then I multiply that by the two point four power, I get the, the megaton yield. All right, that number comes up to be three, one, 111 million megatons. I divide that by $15,000. And basically what we have there is about equivalent to the entire nuclear arsenal of the superpowers 8,000 times, over 8,000 times over. Now, what kind of an environmental consequence would there be to that? Well, we saw that global firestorms, you know, that this, uh, the studies of the amount of suit at that boundary layer shows that the amount of biomass that went up in firestorms, that the kt boundary was about equivalent to every plant on earth today going up in fire, right? You had tsunamis that we're perhaps a thousand feet in height.

Speaker 4:          01:25:28       You had global earthquakes probably measured 10 to 11 on the richter scale. And you know how the richter scale works. It's logarithmic. So that an eight point, oh, earthquake is 10 times more powerful than a seven point. Oh, nine point. Oh, is 10 times more powerful than an eight point? Oh, an 11 point. Oh, earthquake is going to be unimaginable. The whole framework of the globe would have shaken. You probably would have massive failures on every fault line on the planet. Now, the kt event was the middle of the five great extinction events. Right? There was ordovician, silurian. There was the permian triassic. There was a couple more. Two of them were more extreme than that. Now even even much smaller than that. Right. You know, w when they talk about a tipping point, you know, are we talking about a tipping point that could trigger a climate change, a disastrous catastrophic climate change is being a few parts per million, more of co two or as a tipping point, really a mile wide asteroid slamming into the earth at 100 times the speed of a rifle bullet.

Speaker 4:          01:26:37       That could be a tipping point, my friend, and that has happened thousands of times and hundreds of times since we humans have been here hundreds of times, hundreds of hundreds of times, and one was the most recent one. That was the holocene crater. Well, probably it's, there's evidence emerging now that the collapse of the late bronze age civilization is around 4,200 years ago, may have been precipitated by a series of impacts. There's evidence emerging that the climate downturn that occurred between 5:36 and 5:48 that I talked about earlier may have been triggered by a series of multiple impacts. one that looks like it occurred off the coast of Norway and another one that looks like it occurred off the coast of New Zealand. Like tandem impacts right around 5:36 and, and, and we're basically faced with the idea now that literally impacts from things from space maybe hundreds of times more likely than anybody was even imagining a generation ago.

Speaker 1:          01:27:36       So we're essentiallY this civilization that is banking on the knowledge that we've accumulated over a very small amount of time. And as we're uncovering more and more evidence, more and more information, we're starting to realize our ignorance. We're starting to realize how little we know about our own history, the history of this particular species and how it's interacted in this crazy volatile environment of earth. And how many times we've been hit by rock.

Speaker 4:          01:28:05       Yeah. And see, you know, a hundred years ago, the assumption was what are these, these images of these craters are impacts. Oh yeah, that's, that's actually 10 years old. But it shows now all the identified impact.

Speaker 1:          01:28:19       And this is 10 years old. So since then some new ones have. Oh, does the dozens more. Yeah. And since then has been discovery of this nuclear glass that they've found all over europe and all over asia,

Speaker 4:          01:28:31       I think. Are you referring to the possibly the thing that graham was talking about the, the 13,000 years a year ago

Speaker 1:          01:28:38       of event, I think. I think that's what it is. What I'm referring to is there was a mainstream report about all these, these pieces of this very similar material to what they find at nuclear blasts and that it was all over the place at when they did the core samples around 12,000 years ago. Then that's exactly what graham stark and and yes, the evidence is getting stronger and stronger each year that there have. There may have been a multiple impact event. The terminated the ice age and this is still a very controversial idea because the gradualists just don't want to go there and this is probably what killed off mass extinction of the woolly mammoth mass extinction of the saber tooth tiger and a series of animals that they really have not figured out why. like there's, there's been all sorts of theories about why the woolly mammoth went extinct and some of them are ridiculous like that.

Speaker 1:          01:29:33       people did it, you know. I'm glad to hear you say that. That's ridiculous idea. Well, it's ridiculous. When you think about what kind of people were around 12,000 years ago and what kind of weapons they had and what a fucking mammoth looks like, like jesus christ, how many of them more and the other thing that's ridiculous about, obviously when I say ridiculous, I am ridiculous. I shouldn't even be making that statement. I don't. I've done very little research, but the research that I've read and the people that have questioned it, have talked about the mass graves where they've found these animals that have died instantaneously, thousands of them and not consumed either. They don't show signs of predation or of butchering. They're there. They've died in full form. Full body. Yes. And the massive, massive, massive graveyards. And, and you know, for centuries a pristine mammoth tusk, ivory, who've been hauled out of the permafrost of siberia in train load lots.

Speaker 1:          01:30:30       You know, and this has gone into the global ivory market literally for three or 400 years. Um, some estimates are that there may have been as many as four to 10 million woolly mammoths worldwide. Most people don't realize it right here in north America. There were three species of provo city and are three species of elephants during the ice age. Africa has one species. Indian India has another species. We had three species here during the time will go. Beckley. Tappy was being built. Yes. During the time elephants in ai. Elephant, here's another perspective. Is that one that they found. What is that? This is the bArest safka mammoth that was found in 19. Oh, one quick frozen. Uh, yeah, with flesh. Now, at the time this photograph was taken, a wolves had eaten the flesh off of the skull. That's why it's, it's, um, it's bare. But what you see there immediately. Dirty wolves. Yeah. Eating some million year old meat, gusting assholes. Probably $13,000. Zero. So that's a little. Not quite as bad as stills gusting, but you can see the, the, uh, the mammas left for liam just in front of his face there. You see how it's, and if, and if jamie toggles back and forth between this image and the next one you'd be able to see. Um, yeah. This was how the woolly mammoth was found. And so they took photos of it when it was found like this, and then they left it alone

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       and the wolves came and got it. This is not, this is a reconstruction, I believe in the leningrad museum. So what they did was they took the remains of the woolly mammoth and then taxidermists came in and reconstructed. But this shows the position in which he was found sitting on his haunches like that. And um, at the time that the woolly mammoth met his demise, he was eating flowering plants right now. It's important to keep that in mind. His stomach was full of about two dozen different varieties of plants and sedges and things that he had been munching on up in siberia at the time that he, that he met his death number of interesting things. The contents of his stomach could not purified right now. That's mysterious. The fact that his, his flesh was still edible, at least by wolves. You know, the stories about, you know, the scientist eating mammoth burgers is probably made up.

Speaker 4:          01:32:56       But the wolves definitely were able to eat the flesh. Right? It was described as still being marbled, almost as if it had just been frozen, you know, a week ago, but since the time that the woolly mammoth died, it had its whole carcass. Now this was a six ton woolly mammoth, so he had been frozen for how many thousands and thousands of years and so thoroughly frozen that the contents of the stomach putrefying now a woolly mammoth of six tons, has a lot of internal heat, right? Clarence birdseye, the, the, the founder of birdseye foods and the inventor of the fast freezing of foods for preservation got involved in examining and in speculating about this woolly mammoth, his conclusion basically that did something like this in order to prevent the contents of the stomach from putrefying, the entire carcass of the woolly mammoth would've had to been frozen through and through in 10 hours or less.

Speaker 4:          01:34:00       Now, bear in mind that this woolly mammoth was eating flowering plants right now, how cold would it have to be to freeze a six ton woolly mammoth in 10 hours or less? His estimate was probably somewhere around 150 degrees below zero. So from flowering plants to a 150 degrees below zero in 10 hours in 10 hours. How, what, what causes something like that? Well, there's been some speculation. Um, w, the speculation that I found most interesting was possibly volcanic gases that had been ejected up into the stratosphere, approached absolute zero. And because of the cold fell back to her, I think you could get the same effect perhaps with a gas is released from a disintegrating common nucleus. It's still a mystery. I, anything that anybody says at this point is purely speculative. However, it's clear that whatever this mammoth underwent was disastrous in the extreme you saw I'm sitting there on his haunches right.

Speaker 4:          01:35:09       Both of his hip bones were broken, which means that he was slammed back onto his haunches very violently. He was also found with an erect penis, which means that he died by suffocation, which meant that he was entombed virtually instantly by the material that later became the permafrost. We were talking about the little ice age earlier and I was talking about how the little ice age ended around 1850. well, this guy was found about 19 oh, one after the climate in siberia had been warming somewhat see, and what happened was a part of a clip, a cliff that had been next to the barest safka river, the [inaudible] river had shifted its channel and eroded some of the cliff face back and then one year, one warm spring, there was a collapse of the cliff face that exposed this mammoth to the atmosphere and at that point is when the wolves came in and began to devour the flesh on the on the skull. See, so clearly this morley mammoth is an example of or indicative of some type of a catastrophe, whether it was a global catastrophe or local catastrophe. Nobody knows, but clearly it was catastrophic, but that woolly mammoth. There's only one of dozens of examples of flash frozen late pleistocene mammals that that died under similar circumstances

Speaker 1:          01:36:31       and these large graveyards of mass extinctions of thousands and thousands of animals. What are the best examples of them? Because I know that I've seen some of them online, but I can't pull them up like I'm sure you can

Speaker 4:          01:36:45       got some right here. If I can get my laptop there, pull jamie, pull up, look towards the bottom of the list list. You'll see place to seeing the lost world of the pleistocene. You see that pdf? No, it's a. It's a powerpoint. It's in that list of the powerpoints that I gave you. I have some photos.

Speaker 1:          01:37:07       You're freaking me out. I just want to tell you right now. You're freaking me out. I get freaked out. Pretty easy, but she freaking me out. I actually frozen mammoth. I have to confess that one of my objectives in coming here was to try to freak you out. Well, you did it. Congratulations. You're successful. Um, I've been terrified of yellowstone for, for years now. I've watched some late night. Documentary was a huge mistake. It was one of those things. I was about to go to bed and I was just flipping through the channels and they were going over this thing about a called dara volcano in yellowstone. And I was like, what the fuck's it called dara? And then they started talking about what it was it something like 600 kilometers wide or something crazy like that. Which is something like 300 miles, and they were saying that they didn't even discover it until they started satellite imagery

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       of a of earth, and then they realized that, oh, this was a giant volcano that was so violent in its eruption that it blew the mountain off of it and it became this massive crater and that it happens every six to 800,000 years ago. That the last time it happened was 600,000 years ago. So hopefully keeping our fingers crossed. We got another 100,000 years if we're lucky. Yeah, but see, that's another aspect of this component of the dynamic history of planet earth. These, these gigantic volcanic eruptions. There's been some interesting work linking asteroid impacts with giant volcanic eruptions as well, and it would. It would make sense that that, that the energy injected into the earth by a major impact could trigger volcanic eruptions. We know that during the great meltdown event of 11 to 13,000 years ago, that there were enormous, massive volcanic eruptions and mount st helens, for example, was, was massively erupting at that time.

Speaker 4:          01:39:04       And I have photographed. I have some photographs right here, I don't know how much time we have to look at some of this, but where I have gone out and found thick layers of white volcanic ash from mount st helens sandwiched in between these flood layers and and it. It shows that it undoubtedly had to have been a response to the fact that you had this enormous mass transfer of weight that we were talking about earlier from the continents back to the ocean and when we go through maybe it's time to go through a few of these images that I brought. You can begin to see some of the consequences of this melting. You'll begin to appreciate that. Yeah, there were these just enormous mass transfers of weight unloading in certain areas, loading and other areas. This would clearly have a profound effect on the subterranean stability and could easily lead to major eruptions and there was a spasm of major volcanic eruptions globally at the time of the transition out of the ice age, which would only have added to the havoc of that transition and why, you Know, half of the great species of megafauna disappeared.

Speaker 4:          01:40:18       A megafaun is basically defined as an any, any animal in this case, mostly mammals over 44 kilograms and body weight, which is about a hundred pounds. Right? So that would include us. And if you started thinking about all of the animals globally worldwide that are more than 100 pounds, depending on how you divide up the species, there might be 100 to 2,130 different species. And I'm talking about the lions and tigers and bears and elephants and rhinos and hippos and moose and caribou and dr. Right down the line. Right. okay. Let's go back to the ice age. The extinction, the loss of species at the end of the last ice age was about equivalent in number. The loss of species of mega mammals was about equivalent in number two, the number of species of mega mammals that still exist, so in other words, these events that terminated the ice age basically decimated half of the species of of mega mammals on earth.

Speaker 4:          01:41:19       Half of the species disappeared. So if you were going to try to affect an equivalent mass extinction of species today, you basically have to eliminate every animal on earth, over 100 pounds in body weight in order to get the equivalent of that mass extinction episode of 12,000, 13,000 years ago. That's insane. It's insane, but it's absolutely the truth. I. What is the official like or mainstream explanation for this? It doesn't exist. Okay. You brought up the idea of of it's called overkill, which has been the dominant theory for for decades, which is that human hunters exterminated the wooly mammoth and in some vague way, the extermination of the woolly mammoth being at the top of the food chain somehow had a ripple effect down through the ranks of species and somehow perhaps in an unaddressed way resulted in the loss of all these other species.

Speaker 4:          01:42:17       But theY just don't address that. And the more you said that theory is ridiculous and that's an understatement. I mean you're talking about, you know, perhaps bands of few hundred or maybe even a thousand individuals, migrant bands, human hunters coming in and somehow able. So you've got to bear in mind that the estimates of human population during this time globally is less than the estimates of the population of woolly mammoth. But somehow our ancestors were able to wipe out 4 million to 10 million woolly mammoths so fast that they couldn't even reproduce. So there was only like 10 million people back then. That's well see, that's based upon more or less the conventional interpretation. Now of course, what we've been talking about implies opens the door to their possibility of there being a lot more people and then mass extinction also including a massive amount of human beings as well.

Speaker 4:          01:43:15       And, and there is some interesting evidence emerging now that there perhaps was a population collapse between what is called the clovis culture and the folsom culture. The clovis culture appears in north America to be what is believed to have been the earliest culture and the, there's a site in New Mexico that was the first discovery of the, the association of human artifacts, meaning spear points and arrowheads and things like that along with extinct mammals. Right. This is clovis, New Mexico. It's a very interesting site. I visited there about six or seven years ago, uh, in order because I was looking for this so called black matte layer, which has now been documented at dozens of clovis sites around north America. And the black mat layer is this unique layer, uh, that, that essentially separates the pleistocene from the holocene and it's full of soot. It's full of a radium nano diamonds, microsphere olds and all of these signature things that are indicative of some kind of a cosmic event.

Speaker 4:          01:44:18       Is this an image indicative of that? Is that what this is that. yeah, that's kind of a blurry image, but right there you can see it up here too. So you can face the microphone. Yeah. The white strip in the middle shows the black mat layer. That's exactly it. Um, and what you see below it are the bones of extinct mammals. And what you see a couple of thousand years later, his bones of extent, mammals and nowhere above that black matte layer. Do you find the bones of the extinct mammals? What is extent? It means dead. That snow still. It's still exist. Okay. You know, uh, bears are extend. I see. You know, that's the only mammoths are extinct. So there's a very distinct line that can be attributed to some sort of an event. Yes, some sort of innovate something before that. They're all alive, something.

Speaker 4:          01:45:11       After that, they're all dead. They're all dead. And a massive amount of the larger mammals gone, wiped off the face of the planet, wiped off the face of the planet. North America lost about 75 percent of its species of mega man. holy shit. Three quarters. Yeah, there we go. There we go. There's some of them. I learned that thing below that thing below. What is that fucking thing? That giant ground sloth. That fuCking thing is thE mega theOry. I'm american. I'm, it's the giant ground sloths. It was the size of an elephant. oh my god, these are the glyptodonts these are all 10,000 years ago. Not this guide is a dinosaur's obviously did norris. Maximus is the giant moa. This guy threw him in here for rock is because he's just such an awesome preacher. The terror bird, right? It's the terror bird. Yeah. Scroll back up, stop scrolling.

Speaker 4:          01:46:01       Jimmy, look at that fucking bird. That's a seven foot tall. Bigger than that with eight. Nine foot tall. Yeah. A bird that doesn't fly. So essentially a murderous ostrich. And this was the top of the food chain during the miocene. Really? Yeah. This was it. This was the, the, the, the baddest ass predator on the planet for awhile. Really more so than a saber tooth tiger. These guys existed before the saber tooth tiger. Wow. But they succumbed to one of these global events. You got to bear in mind that if you take a census of all the species that ever existed compared to the species, now it's conservative to say that 99 point nine, nine percent of all species have become extinct. Wow. And in the ones that, uh, and, and of course most of those had went extinct without any help from humans at all. Stops growing. What does that fucking thing? That's the last materium siberia come. Jesus christ, you begin to appreciate. It's like a bowl that fucked a rhino. It's like that.

Speaker 4:          01:47:08       Wow. That's insane how big that is. Oh, it was huge. I mean it was elephant sized, basically a woolly rhinoceros the size of an elephant. And this is sila donta, which is the classic willy right now. So there've been quite a few species of these guys found that were flash frozen. And this is 12,000 years ago. This thing existed. Wooly rhinoceros. Yes. And we're in north America. Jesus christ. That's incredible. And what is, what's the mainstream explanation for these things going away? Good luck on trying to find one. I have looked. There iS none. There is nothing. They don't. There's nothing. So is this something that they just haven't formed any theories about or they don't try to or it's been ignored because there's not enough information. It's been ignored. And here's why. At the dawn of earth science, geological science, and early, early 19th century to a man, every one of the founding fathers of geology, whether it was william buckland or qva or sir James Hall or or rodney merchants and adam sedgwick, you could go right down the line.

Speaker 4:          01:48:15       All of these guys from 18, 20 up to about 18, 60, every one of them was task surfaced to a man. Everyone because these were guys basically who had not been indoctrinated into any particular interpretation of world history. They went out and they looked at evidence in the landscape. In their conclusion was, you know, something really catastrophic has happened. And then what happened was you had charles lyle play fair and hot, james hot and these three guys came along and basically establish the doctrine of uniformitarianism is. It's called a mouthful, right? And basically the idea of uniformitarianism was this, is that we look at modern processes to explain ancient process. So if we see a river eroding, it's bank moving sediment, creating a sandbar with that. If we see like during the early 19th century, we were in the last phase of the little ice age, so glaciers were receding and these guys could essentially go up there and look on a year to year basis and see what was happening as the glaciers were receding. Right? So Basically what they then did was extrapolated from modern processes to try to explain all the ancient processes. This is the doctrine of uniformitarianism. Okay. It's a very powerful model for understanding ancient change. However it became ensconced as dogma so that by the turn of the century as we come right up to the, to the threshold of the 20th century, it was now considered

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       unscientific to try to explain anything in the past that we couldn't see happening today. Right? So as we go into the 20th century, this gradual, as dogma became ensconced in academia, in every geologist, from about 1900 up to about 1980 was thoroughly indoctrinated into this idea of the gradualism that all of the earth change that we see going on on the planet today has occurred. One grain of sand, one drop of water at a time. And it was considered to be very unscientific to begin to evoke things because initially some of the founding fathers of geology were a lot of them. Interestingly, we were theologians who oftentimes a number of like adam sedgwick is a good example of somebody who is a, a traveling theologian, a traveling minister, right? He was traveling around england and he was seeing things like the team's river valley, and he was seeing that the tims flowed in this gigantic channel that was completely outsized relative to the river that was flowing in it.

Speaker 3:          01:50:56       And he says, that must've been a huge flood wall. He was a theologian, right? So he said, no, his flood. Right. Well, as it turns out, there are enormous jus morphic effects of gigantic floods all over the planet. Right. We know that now, right? In the 18 hundreds, they assumed that if you saw effects of gigantic floods, it had to have been noah's flood. Well, at the same time that you had geological gradualism on the ascent, jeal a biological gradualism came along in the form of, of darwinism. And the two sort of complimented each other in, in, in mutually supported each other. Well, if we've got infinite time, you know, millions and millions of years of gradual geological change now that allows us millions and millions of years for gradual biological change. And these two paradigms were mutually reinforcing. So now we come to the 20th century and for the first three quarters of the 20th century, that was the dogma that was indoctrinated into the minds of every earth scientists.

Speaker 3:          01:52:08       Right? And to vary from that was to be pseudo scientific and you're trying to revert back to biblical fundamentalism if you start talking about giant floods, right? Well, what happened was, and it was left to people like emmanuel volokhonsky. It was not a neuroscientist. He was a psychoanalyst and he wrote several books in the mid 19 fifties where he had gathered together in one place all of this anomalous evidence from the earth history that did not fit the uniformitarian paradigm. Now, his books were popular successes, but mainstream science just slammed him, slammed him and said, this guy's a nutcase. Right? well, he did make some serious missteps in trying to explain this anomalous geological evidence for catastrophe and it was those missteps that they were able to focus on to try to discredit him. However, the amassing of evidence for catastrophes in earth history has held the, the, the, the test of time and and what we see as 1980 was a pivotal year.

Speaker 3:          01:53:08       That was a year that three separate teams published evidence showing that the cretaceous tertiary boundary, the dinosaur boundary was profoundly catastrophic, and that opened the door to begin a reconsideration of earth history. Now, at the same time, with the advent of the space program, we are beginning to realize that near earth space is not a completely empty place. It's actually densely populated by all kinds of things. See, prior to the apollo moon program, it was believed that most of the craters on the moon, if not all of the craters on the moon, where volcanic right post apollo. The realization was that no, they're not volcanic. There impacts of things from space c. Now you're looking at the surface of the moon and I think I'm the last image on the joe rogan images. There is going to be a picture of the moon and you'll see that it's littered littered thousands and thousands and thousands of craig

Speaker 1:          01:54:11       and because it doesn't have an atmosphere because it doesn't have plants, we can actually see we can't explain. It's happened

Speaker 3:          01:54:17       and the point joe is this. If we were unable to strip away the biosphere, the thick layers of sedimentary rocks, the oceans, the earth would look like the moon.

Speaker 1:          01:54:27       God damn it would look like fucking moon. So it's simply a matter of time and perspective that we really, well thank thankfully these people like you that are paying attention tests, but we with the amount of time that people have been videotaping things and writing books, this tiny little window that just hasn't been enough time to really get a real account of how often this takes place because that, that amount of time, although it's a grand amount of time compared to our lives, the life of an individual for the life of the planet, it's nothing. It's a perspective issue,

Speaker 3:          01:55:05       the perspective. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And, and this is one reason why I'm an advocate for moving forward and essentially becoming a cosmic civilization. You see, I came of age during the heyday of the mercury and gemini, gemini and apollo programs, and you know, that was the one thing when I looked back and I go, well, what? One of the last times that I was really proud of my country was when we put those men on the moon. You know, when we planted our aMerican flag on the moon, and I really believe back in 1969, 1970, that we were america's destiny was to move the human

Speaker 4:          01:55:43       into this grander cosmic environment. And then of course, you know, the Vietnam war came along and other priorities and money got shifted in the nixon administration shifted huge amounts of money away from the space program. The timetable that was set out that we were going to have a permanent lunar base by the end of the seventies, first manned mission to mars before the eighties was over, perhaps a independently self-supporting colonies in space by the year 2000. Remember I was a junior in high school when a kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey came out. Have you ever seen it? Sure. Yeah. Nineteen, 68. Nobody had any. It was no stretch of the imagination to assumed that by 2001. Yeah, there were going to be orbiting hotels in space. RIght. That could have happened, but we lost our vision. We lost our will and we just got sidetracked. You know, I'm remembering the seventies talking to people about the potential of colonizing space, using the materials and resources found in space and that the knee jerk response I always got was, well, we've got too many problems here on earth.

Speaker 4:          01:56:53       We got to solve those problems first. Well, my response to that was, well, good luck because you're basically talking about altering human nature, right? And it's going to take something more than just some policy to alter human nature. What it's going to take is some serious a consciousness excursions, uh, perhaps people going into space. You know, here we had these astronauts. I met edgar mitchell years ago. He's a a mace and he came to my lodge years ago, edgar mitchell, who was one of the astronauts. He was one of the many astronauts that went into space and like as in free mason as in freemasons, everybody freaks out and you say freemasons, illuminati, black helicopter nonsense, and we should have a whole session just to deal with that ridiculous nonsense next time you freaked me out about that. Okay. So edgar mitchell, when you met him, was he talking about aliens?

Speaker 4:          01:57:47       No, no, no, no. He was talking about going into space and seeing god. Whoa. Crazier than aliens. Yeah. Crazier than the aliens. Has god made aliens? Perhaps. So he saw god in the sense that he got a sense. It means without even saying god, he got a sense of the, the, the, the grandness grand universe. yes. And, and yes. And, and you know, the potential role of humans in that. Have you ever been to the keck observatory in Hawaii? No, I haven't. The keck observatory in Hawaii is a very unique place because it's on the big island of Hawaii and it's very high up in an altitude. And when you get up there, you actually drive through the clouds. I took my family, there are several years ago and uh, we were bummed out when I was like, god. So clowning, we're not gonna be able to see anything. But then you pop through the clouds as you continue to drive. And the view is magnificent and in is

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       to this day, one of the most intense experiences, consciousness expanding experiences I've ever had. I believe it without drugs. I mean, it was like a psychedelic experience. It really was because the, the amount of. That's the keck observatory. See how it's above the clouds when you. That's a daytime shot. See jamie, see if he could pull up at nighttime, nighttime shot because they set the camera aperture to capture the. I didn't, I had a regular camera I couldn't have. I couldn't really capture the, the actual stars themselves. But you see the milky way, like, not like that. It's way more intense than that. You see the milky way in its full form. You see? All right. Yeah. And there's so many stars. It's, it's so shocking. You, you're immediately forced to accept the reality that we're in space, whereas it's so easy to deny when all you see is the moon and a couple of little dots, like whatever, man, I'm in hollywood, I got to go to work and you drive and you get.

Speaker 1:          01:59:37       That's what it's like. Yeah. And it's. So, it's, it's, that's just a photograph and that's, you know, obviously there's some doctor and going on because I don't know what those lines are, but it's insane how intense it is. It's insane and it's, it's, it's right above you. It's right above us all the time. That's what I love about the high desert plateaus. You've got this dry atmosphere and it's like literally you can almost reach out and touch the stars. You know what you're talking about. You've never been to la before. This is your first trip to la because when you're in California, you just go to the mojave and stare at space space and I stare at the rocks, the rocks below my feet and the stars over my head. Yeah. How dId you get involved in the exploration of all this stuff? Well, you know, I guess I better, it's time to come out of the closet, like I did a little too many drugs back in the sixties.

Speaker 1:          02:00:29       Uh, I think he did the right amount. Yeah, I think you're being hard on yourself. Actually. Actually, I'm in 1969, so of course I wish I was raised in rural Minnesota and where we grew up, we lived on the shores of a puddle of meltwater puddle leftover from the receding of the glaciers. yeah, call it a puddle. It's, I call it a puddle. It was three quarters of a mile long. It was just, you know, Minnesota, Wisconsin has got what, 25,000 lakes and every one of them is leftover meltwater puddles from the recession of the glacier, so I can still remember being like six or seven years old. And my dad telling me, you know, once upon a time, this was thousands of feet under the ice and that's how this. We had land on the edge of this lake. And um, as a kid I used to sit in my backyard and fish for sunfish and crappies and bulkheads. That's what I don't understand that interrupt for just one second. How the fuck does that happen? Were 10,000 years ago. It's a glacier. Ten thousand years later. There's fish in there. Where the fuck are the fish coming from? I don't know, but they were there. But how? Where's the large mouth bass come from? What's the. All this with the lake trout and the great lakes. Where the fuck did they come from? If if 10,000 years ago. That

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       was frozen. Solid. Frozen. Solid. Where the fuck the lake trout come from? I'll have to get to work on that joe, because I don't know the answer. I need to know man. I'm freaking out. How about northern pike? I mean northern pike. You go to saskatchewan. People fly in from all over the world to go fishing up there because they have this massive population of beautiful northern pike. These big that was frozen. Yes. Saskatchewan was a mile of ice. What the fuck man? I'm freaking out. That doesn't even make sense. Yeah. So you saw this. So you were a kid. I was a kid growing up with that landscape, so I got fascinated by it, but in 1969 I went to a rock on outdoor rock concert that was at an airport called eden prairie. that's in the. I'm just outside of the twin cities, minneapolis, and it's on a series of bluffs that overlooks the Minnesota river valley.

Speaker 4:          02:02:34       Right. I'm, of course I'm stoned out of my gourd and I was taking a break from the music and the ladies and everything and I went over and was standing on this bluff, andy and jamie, if you would pull up. I think it's near the end of the pictures I brought for joe. I have a beautiful example of scale invariance and this is going to be similar to what I saw. And, and when you see it, um, that's, that's like the 25 images that's labeled for joe picture though. It'll be towards the end. It's a picture of the snake river. Find it. wow. The snake river. Wait till you see this joe. now this is an example of scale invariance. Now what that means is that, you know, yeah. Here we go. now look at this, what you see here, where can folks that are just listening to this go and see these images is a there.

Speaker 4:          02:03:26       Are they on your website? Uh, I think this one is on my website. Yeah. I think this one's on the snake river. You see the snake river scale and variance, meaning that the river at the bottom, obviously you see the lines all around it where it indicates that there was a much, much larger body of water. One point much better. This, the modern snake river is about 50,000 cubic feet per second, right at the end of the last ice age, the river here was about 30 to 40 million cubic feet per second. So wAs that because of the melting glaciers, the force of this particular was not directly fed by the melting glaciers. It was the result of the catastrophic overflow of lake bonneville, which was the result of massive, prolonged torrential rainfall that just drowned all the deserts of the southern, of the western and southwestern United States.

Speaker 4:          02:04:22       And there was an overflow, a spillway out of the lake, bonneville basin in northern Utah, and it's spilled over into the snake river plain of Idaho. Thirty to 40 million cubic feet per second. Cut this channel. Now you'll notice that the modern snake river occupies a small channel within the big channel that scale invariance I'm the big river, would have been about equivalent to six to 700 of the modern snake rivers. And what you're seeing here is an example of scale invariance say that the little is superimposed upon this big sea. Now in 1969, I was standing on a bluff overlooking the Minnesota river valley, similar to this, right, looking down at the little Minnesota ribbon of the Minnesota river and seeing it in this huge channel. And I had an aha moment. I had an aha moment and I realized I saw then that this channel that this bluff I was standing on had once been the bank of a gigantic river, thousands of times bigger than the modern Minnesota river.

Speaker 4:          02:05:33       But I didn't know it rationally in the sense that it took me another 10 or 15 years of study and research before I could go back and say, yeah, what my initial instinct, looking out and seeing this matching set of bluffs for five miles on the other side and seeing this small version of it into modern river that I was right. That I remember one time in the eighties, I was giving a talk on that and I. There was a geologist in the audience and he got up and he goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That big channel that was millions of years, millions of years. It took for that channel to form. And I said, no, I don't think so. And what happened was, is by him challenging me, it really, you know, I said, okay, you know, like an, an, an mma fighter getting challenged, says, okay, I'm going to take you on, you know, I rose to the occasion and I spent literally years doing research on glacial geomorphology on paleo hydrology. And of course, at the end of the thing I knew that I was. My instincts were absolutely correct that yes, now there is solid scientific, documentable, verifiable evidence that this whole channel of the Minnesota river valley was filled, brim full with water at the end of the lesson,

Speaker 1:          02:06:49       so when he was saying it was millions of years, he's saying that same exact channel of water had never varied and that it had just cut through over millions and millions of years very slowly, but does that sort of. That doesn't seem rational because of the width. No, it doesn't. You'd have to. It doesn't. It doesn't make. So this goes along with what you were talking about earlier, that the idea that the ideas of science with that everything had taken place much like evolution on a very gradual pace. Exactly. Is this the grand canyon as well? No, I would. Here's what I would saY about the grand canyon. I think that the grand canyon is presently. we can observe it, that we can observe the Colorado rIver eroding the grand canyon. However,

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       I think that the erosion of the grand canyon is not uniform. It's episodic or which means that the grand canyon has probably been there between two and 5 million years because for one thing, the grand canyon wouldn't start eroding until the Colorado plateau had lifted up and 10 to 12 million years ago, the rim rock of collar of the Colorado plateau is limestone, which implies a shallow marine environment. Right now when it's down at marine at sea level, it's not going to road. It's not until the whole plateau lifts up between five and 10 million years ago that the downCutting can start. So my takE On the grand canyon would be that. What happens is is we have. You have to understand this now. This is, this is I think now is the, is the merging emerging paradigm. There are two modes of change. The gradualist mode that we've seen dominating through know the last few hundred years at least sInce the advent of modern science and then the, if you want to call it the catastrophic mode, where is much change.

Speaker 4:          02:08:44       It's compressed into a few years or months or sometimes even days or weeks as normally would take thousands and thousands of years. When I look at the grand canyon, what I'm seeing there is episodes of catastrophic erosion, probably stretching back over two and a half million years. Remember I said the pleistocene was about two and a half million years. What characterizes the pleistocene from the previous plyo scene is this alternating succession of glacial and interglacial ages. This swinging back and forth between these two extremes, those episodes of transition appear to be profoundly catastrophic and they are associated with things like massive storms, massive rainfalls, rising and falling of sea levels on a extreme a basis, and I think it's that that has created the grand canyon predominantly. In fact, the inner channel. I know if you've ever seen grand canyon. Yeah. Okay. There's an inner gorge I could guess at that inner gorgeous, probably less than 100,000 years old and uh, probably a lot of it was cut 13,000 years ago. Wow. And so that's when the pleistocene ended somewhere around 10,000 years ago. Ten to 13,000 years ago. Wow. Yeah. That's a, that's not a real fixture is it seems like an artist's rendition. Yeah. I have pictures somewhere in there where you still get a sense. Yeah. Now the, the, the, the accumulation of the sedimentary rocks. Yeah. Took hundreds of millions of years, but that's one process. The downcutting, the erosion of the canyon is a different process. So again, it comes to a matter of perspective that we're almost incapable of. Let me, I think, you know, academically

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       and you could sort of explain how all this takes place and explain what's happening, but in our minds are our perspective of living a hundred years. Looking back, it's very difficult to go back 20 years ago. Oh, I remember when that happened. Wow. Barely. But this is, that ain't shit compared to the earth, the earth, the earth is just constantly changing and our knowledge of human history, we have this sort of static view and occasionally we have that meteor that flew over Russia recently and blew up in the sky and everybody's like, whoa, what's, uh, what's that? And then it stops. Then nothing go back to work, go back to work, go back to sleep. Yeah. And that thing that blew up over Russia, that was, that was a spec and there was nothing. And then those turn goose which blew up in the early 19 hundreds.

Speaker 1:          02:11:22       Nineteen. Oh, eight. June 30th, 19. Oh eight. Which just flat and thousands and thousands of acres. Oh, well, let's see. It was 800 square miles and 640 acres per square mile. So it flat and a half a million acres, a million acres. And that was the energy of that was about equivalent to a 15 megaton bomb pull up. There's an image of tongue goes. Yeah, just all the trees completely flattened. Completely flat. A few look at that. Gangster tree is still standing there. Hasn't happened. I know. It's just like every now and then just one bad motherfucker tree. That's how people stay alive, right? Because just like everybody else died or most things died and most of the species died. a few people figured out a way to make it. And then they decided to have babies. What a bunch of crazy fucked. Could you imagine? A giant asteroid hits.

Speaker 1:          02:12:17       Kills everybody. Rotten people and woolly mammoths all over the place and you're still horny, still horny, and you make a baby like wow, and you raise it and that baby makes more bikes. What does it say in the book of genesis? Be fruitful and multiply. Now get this the word, replenish the earth, replenish the earth and subdue it. I think clearly that's a clear hint that saying this is not the primordial creation. It's a subsequent creation to something. A previous order of things. Why you used the word replenish. Be fruitful and multiply. It would make sense if if the human population crashes in the wake of a global catastrophe and we're down hovering at the threshold of viability where you know, we could become extinct if just anything else happens and we want to. We want to preserve our species while the. Probably the thing we need to be doing is having a lots of sex. Hm. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know. I mean we need to do a lots of screwing and we need to screw and make scientists to figure out how to get us off this rock. Yeah. Well, see, be fruitful and multiply. It makes patient replenish the earth

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       and subdue it. What the hell is that? Is this a subdue it? Subdue it. That's in genesis in genesis. What the hell are they talking about? They're choke the earth. Well, I see. That's the way it's been interpreted. I think it's being interpreted to say, look, you guys are the only rational species down there. You've got these big brains, you know, you gotta be born before, you know, it takes you years and years to actually get where you can survive on your own because you've got these big fucking brain. See? So we're kind of like nature's answer to all of this. You know, only one species right now has the ability to intercede and prevent the next global catastrophe. And that's us. Do we rise to that challenge or do we say, well, we're going to let nature run its course and if 50 percent of the species disappear, civilization is over.

Speaker 4:          02:14:27       We go back to the stone age struggling for existence. Well, so be it. That's what's in the cards or do we say, you know what? We could be in one generation be harvesting to resources of asteroids, which we could be if we had the will innovation and the thing is, is that the most dangerous asteroids that are out there, it's the closer they get to the earth, the more accessible they are. And, and you see we already could be harvesting the resources of astra. I meAn asteroids are loaded with precious metals and ors and hydrocarbons. there's virtually nothing that we are now mining from the earth that we couldn't mind from asteroids. Wow. What does that suggest to you? Well, and, and think about this, if, if I like to kind of imagine a scenario, suppose we had discovered, remember shoemaker levy nine? Yes. Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:15:18       Discovered in march of 1996, within about eight weeks of observations, the astronomers were able to predict that these fragmented pieces, we're going to orbit the sun and comeback and be crossing the orbit of jupiter at exactly the time to jupiter was there, right? There was going to be a t bone collision. It was like two vehicles coming to the intersection at the same time and they were able to predict that right down to the, almost to the minute to the hemisphere, what if we discovered that there's an asteroid orbiting the sun out there that's got our number on it and it was going to strike the earth and three years or 10 years or 20 years or whatever. What would be our response to it? What will we do? I think globally it would be, there would have to be some sort of a collective x effort.

Speaker 4:          02:16:04       Yeah. The scientists from China and Russia and all these different various countries that have a vast technological capabilities would probably get together and have some sort of an agreement. I would think that that would have to happen and it would fact, it would probably make our petty human conflicts pale into insignificance if we were faced with the demise of civilization or even possibly our species, but suppose we discovered it and it's coming in a couple of years and there's no time to respond. What could we do? Well, perhaps if we had a loNg enough lead time, we could actually deflect. All we need to do is is is an asteroid that's on a collision course with the aerosol it has to do is be nudged a little bit in a direct hit, can be a wide miss. See, that's all we would have to do is just nudge it a little and there's various potential technologies whereby we could do that, but what if we didn't have enough lead time and we knew that, that it was going to slam into the earth and for a thousand years gonna be havoc.

Speaker 4:          02:17:13       What would we do? Well, perhaps we could go build a base on the moon or build a a something in space that would allow humans to survive at least until the dust settled enough that we could return and begin to replenish the earth. you know what a bummer it would be if you had a base on the moon and everyone was living there and you wash the earth below up. Total bummer, but it would be even bigger. Bummer if you didn't have it and you were sitting on the earth. Knowing that that's it, man, that's all she wrote.

Speaker 1:          02:17:42       How many different times do you think that this has happened while human beings are alive and how the, the, the great speculation has always been when they see the pyramids or when they see any incredible structures that we really haven't totally explained how they built what like bow back in Lebanon is what, how advanced were they? How advanced were they before the shit hit the fan?

Speaker 4:          02:18:09       Well, it seems to me then in order to, you know, you gotta go, why would primitive cultures move rocks that weighed 200 to a thousand tons? Apparently with impunity, they were doing it all over the planet, right? W why would, why would somebody be motivated? I mean, you know, like again, I'm a builder so I know how much work it takes to move even a, you know, without a crane, without modern technology to move, uh, uh, uh, a beam into place that weighs a ton. Right? Well, you know, we've got stones in some of these ancient temples that way. Hundreds of tons and again, all over the world. It seems to me difficult to imagine that they didn't have some kind of a technology that we've forgot what that technology is. I couldn't say, um, but it would sure seem to me that there would be no motive for moving, you know, 500 tons stones, unless you had some convenient way of doing it or

Speaker 1:          02:19:14       if not a convenient way of doing it. just explain how an inconvenient way they could have done it. When you get something like the acropolis or the parthenon that's on the acropolis, right? Isn't that, what is the part? The acropolis is the stone and the parthenon is what's on the hill complex on it, but the parthenon is one of those impulse. The acropolis is a manmade construction that has massive, massive stones that they just don't explain. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they're there. They're in there. They're in cusco in south America. They're in Egypt. Yeah. There it is. The ball back one is actually probably even more impressive. Chamie. See if he could pull that up and stones have a ball. How do you spell it? B double a l, b, e, k and there there's these stones are just unbelievably big. Yeah, and no explanation for how they moved them, cut them and them got them into place and what year it was all done, right.

Speaker 1:          02:20:18       That's one vision of it or a picture of it, but if you search for others is actually a closeup of the actual stones themselves and they show people standing next to the stone so you get a perspective of it. Much, much taller than a human being. In fact, I think 10 or 11 feet tall and some places like there's one rock just like fuck that. But some of the stones, the. That's not a good one, jamie. There's some where you can see the massive amount of, uh, of, of stone that was in each individual one. Some of them are literally building sized and it's just an individual stone and yeah, there's one like, what the fuck man, what the fuck is that? That is so big. They moved that. They cut that query. Didn't move it. Yeah. I mean, I don't know how many people they had to do that, but boy that doesn't seem like something that a society which is really concerned with feeding itself is a is going to get done what?

Speaker 1:          02:21:25       So when you see like the constructions of the great pyramids, which is one of the great wonders of the world and to this day they're always trying to come up with ways that they did it, but the sheer size and to put it into perspective, if you cut and I think the number is 10 stones, that debt is $6 million, 300,000 plus stones in the great pyramid of giza and if you cut and placed 10 a day, it would take you 664 years. Yeah. I, you know. Yeah. Having seen the great pyramid and many of the temples in Egypt, I'm convinced that they had to have some means that we've forgotten about for transporting these stones. You know, they may have used fairly primitive methods to quarry the stones, but when it comes to transporting the stones, you know, I mean, we could imagine that they're putting them on rollers and dragging them over hill and dale, but again, you got to go really all over the whole planet.

Speaker 1:          02:22:30       It just, it's one of those things, it's like the demise of the frozen woolly mammoths. There's just no real explanation. And, and we can invoke explanations that are basically designed to avoid the implications of admitting that there may have been advanced knowledge, scientific knowledge in prehistory, and that somehow or another, that knowledge was lost, whether it was because of the burning of the library of alexandria or whether it was just a cataclysmic event that wiped out a massive amount of the population. And what was remaining was buildings like that. Those things survived. And then people tried to recreate them. People eventually figured out some of the techniques and made similar structures, but not over a period of a thousand years or two years, but maybe 20, 30,000 years. That's always been the work of graham hancock, the, the, uh, the ideas they bounced around and uh, I remember there was that charlton heston narrated a documentary on the sphinx where they had gone into great detail about the erosion and they brought him the geologists, robert schoch from boston university.

Speaker 1:          02:23:43       I know robert, I want to get him on the podcast too. He's a fascinating cat and he concluded that the temple, the sphinx, the enclosure where it was cut out of shows thousands of years of erosion by rainfall, which there wasn't rainfall in the nile valley before 9,000 years ago. So it predates the pyramid construction, the average or the, uh, the conventional dating of the pyramid. There it is right there. There's some explanations. It predates the, what the conventional date of the pyramid is by more than 5,000 years. Oh, I'm convinced. And I've had conversations with robert where he will basically say he's got one number for public consumption, but he's perfectly willing to admit that perhaps this makes is much, much older than that. And I, what's the dark number? What's the crazy number? Oh, I think that the crazy number is tens of thousands of years if you pull up.

Speaker 1:          02:24:43       It's not that crazy though. Now it was kind of crazy when that charlton heston documentary, the documentary was around, but now that they found go beckley tapping and they know that 14,000, 12,000 years ago, whatever it was, they were absolutely building these enormous, immense structures that would be what, 8,000 years, 70,000 years earlier than the pyramids. Not that. Not that big a deal. Not that big of a deal. They, they, the conventional dating of the great pyramid of giza is 2,500 bc, which may be correct, but it still doesn't mean that the sphinx wasn't way older than me. Way older than that. Exactly. And you know, I'm convinced having seen it firsthand that that erosion is water induced. I've looked at a lot of erosioN over the years and you know, it's got the classic parabolic profile that you would expect if you started out with an initially square.

Speaker 1:          02:25:40       I'm jamie, open up the powerpoint show entitled a cataclysmic, most global super flood, cataclysmic global superstar. That's my new band. It's going to be my new band. Go for me. Cataclysmic. Cataclysmic was the greek term for the destruction of the world by water. Oh wow. From where we get our term cataclysm. Whoa. And their term. See, you know, the greeks believed that they were alternating destructions of the world by water and fire, right? Eq per paralysis was the term greek term for the destruction of the world by fire. Wow. And um, cataclysmic of, of water on this stuff is so unbelievably fascinating because there's no way that you can attribute all of this stuff. I mean, these, all of these ancient structures, there's no way you can attribute it to what we know about their culture. We don't know enough. There's just not enough evidence.

Speaker 1:          02:26:43       There's not enough. We don't know enough about ancient Egypt or you know, or their construction methods are so much. There's so much thinking, so much guesswork, so much. You know, when you look at these giant structures and you wonder, like, what, what were they doing? How did they do this? Who are they like? It's so fascinating. I would just, I would love to be able to go back in time inside a giant bulletproof bubble. I know. Just hover over ancient Egypt. That was going on back then. I know. When did you guys know jamie go? You've got a global super fluid. What is this image? Go to slide 58 slash 58. The infamous slide 58.

Speaker 1:          02:27:33       Hanger 18. Slide 58 hours. There it is. Wow. That's beautiful. Okay, that's amazing. Now what you can see there is you got to get it into the microphone. Get on the microphone there. The valley temple up there. Oh yeah. Okay. The valley temple with stones quarried from the ditch around the sphinx and you've got to remember what the sphinx is that originally it was a yard day, which is a, which is a limestone outcrop that sticks above the surrounding landscape that yardang was the head of the sphinx. Everything else was below. Now go to the next slide, jamie. Okay. There yoU can really see the ditch surrounding the sphinx and the layers forming. The sphinx body correspond to the layers into surrounding ditch. Now wanting to me notice the scaffolding

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       next to the sphinx. They're there. They're there, they're undertaking these campaigns of rests, quote unquote, restoration grows, but what they're actually doing is they're covering up the real message of the sphinx. Know why are they doing that? Why are they bothering to try to rebuild the thing? Know it's so stupid like, wait, you're not rebuilding it. You're building new shit. Yeah, you're just rephrasing it with, with new stones. So gross, but at least nobody is messing with the quarry walls where you can see the water erosion so effectively displayed. Go to the next slide, jamie. Now what we see here is an abandoned quarry. It's hard to tell the scale here because that opening is like 40 feet high, but if you look at, you see the striations in the rock wall. Okay? This is where they quarried the blocks, right? And remove the blocks.

Speaker 4:          02:29:17       Go to the next slide, jamie. Okay. This kind of shows the methodology that they use. They, they would create these separation trenches. They would usually go by the, the natural bed bedding layers of the rock. Go to the next slide and you'll see here, here's the presumed process where they're cutting a separation tranche and there's a block about to be quarried there. And then you can see there would have a stack of four blocks there. And these blocks are enormous. Several tons. Oh yeah. That, that block there would be, it looks like it's probably about four by eight by probably 10. So like 320 cubic feet at 160 per. So, uh, or 180. So you're looking at about 57,000 pounds divided by 2000. So yeah, about two. Yeah, about 30 tons. She's got 30 tons for that rock right there. Now go to the next slide.

Speaker 4:          02:30:17       Thirty tons. Okay. Now the reason I'm showing you this is because this is the process they would have used to quarry the blocks away from the, the surrounding the sphinx and exposed a quarry wall. Well, at the time that quarry wall was exposed, it would have been essentially a flat surface with this slightly stepped profile like we saw in the photograph. Right now, go to the next slide, right? So there's now would be a cross section with all of the blocks removed. Okay, go to the next slide. And what we have here is stone pick marks in a limestone quarry from pharmacy times about 1200 bc. So about 3,200 years ago. So here's a limestone face of a quarry that's been exposed for 3000, 200 years and it seems like they used to some sort of a chisel to get that out. Exactly. The pick marks are still visible. Go to the next slide. Okay. Here's stone pick marks in a quarry from nearly new kingdom circa 15. So 3,500

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       years ago you can actually determine the type of tool that they used to quarry the rocks. The picks are the chisels. Go to the next one based on the market are based on tomorrow. Yeah. And here you see that the chisel marks made or pick marks made by stone picks in an old kingdom. Limestone quarry, 2000 years bc. So here's a 4,000 year old quarry that's been sitting exposed to the desert elements and the pick marks are still visible on the face. Now go to the next slide. Now here's the spanx. Go to the next slide and look at that quarry wall. Yeah, that's crazy. It's crazy. Yeah. Now, supposedly this quarry wall is only a few centuries older than net. Last picture. We just saw where we could see the pic marks. Does that make sense? Well, the only way it would make sense as if there was a vastly different type of stone.

Speaker 1:          02:32:13       Well, it's not though. It's the same. It's a. Well indurated limestone. Robert can tell you all about the composition of that stone, but the. The composition does vary though. Oh yeah, correct. Like some. Some of it's more dense than others and that's. you can see the changes and you can see that that indented layer about halfway up, it's going to be a softer limestone. Absolutely. It certainly looks to the layman and I'm clearly a layman, but it certainly looks like like water fishers, like, oh, fishers that are driven rainfall. Even to the trained eye, it looks like water, but some legit egyptologists and even legit geologists have tried to attribute this to a wind and sand. Well, again, you know robert has shown pictures of the comparison of wind erosion or water erosion and they don't look the same, so the only reason to attribute this to wind and sand, it's not based on the scientific evidence of what it looks like when there's water erosion.

Speaker 1:          02:33:12       It's to confirm or to conform with the known or established timeline of construction. Yes, and that's why I showed you those examples of other core like that old kingdom quarry that's almost the same age as this, so it's actually really not scientific to try to attribute it to wind and sand. It's just your. What you're doing is confirming to confirmation bias. You have, you have an idea in your head and you're trying to to make this really odd erosion fit into that, but that doesn't look like wind and sand. Go to the next in lik joey, jamie, I'll jam band. So there's the depth of the, of the, of the ditch. It's about 22 feet and eric show shows each of the layers. Like if you look at layer of Lebanon, that's going to be a softer limestone. it's eroded deeper right now. Go to the next slide and you'll see what I've done is superimposed what the original profile would have looked like and there's been an enormous amount of rock limestone rock removed and we know the profile would have looked like that because the stones that were quarried are what make up the sphinx and valley temples.

Speaker 1:          02:34:25       The no's have been eroded as well, but unfortunately they've covered that up with this reconstruction. Most likely, most likely, and I think robert would confirm this, that the limestone blocks at formed those temples were sheathed in hard granted. Whereas this quarry wall was not. It was exposed and then there's also the issue of the sphinx head itself, which seems to have been altered in this. This is a timeline thing that folks may or may not know, but there's been. The Egypt changed quite a bit, mean Egypt. Ancient Egypt was around for thousands and thousands of years and at some point they were conquered by the nubians and the more african, what we think of as traditional african feet. Obviously Egypt as part of africa, but the more traditional looking african faces is what you see in the current face in the temple this face. So probably whaT had happened is a later date pharaoh said, you know what?

Speaker 1:          02:35:21       Fuck this line. I want my face up there. So they put the face of this probably catherine [inaudible] and I think both John Anthony West and robert schoch would concur with. That's why there's so little erosion on that face. That face is only a few thousand years old and why it would be disproportionately small compared to the rest of the body. So fascinating. I've just. I would give so much to know what they knew then if any point in time to go back in human history and just to be able to observe. That would be the time that the just the middle of Egypt. I would love to see what it looked like before they raided it and took off. For folks that don't know, it was covered in smooth limestone and they cut it all up to build cairo. They rated it. Yeah. There was an earthquake that flattened cairo and you know they had attempted to penetrate the great pyramid prior to that without success, but apparently the earthquake, which I think happened, I think it happened in the twelfth century, loosened a few rocks from near the top of the pyramid that allowed them to get some levers in there and begin to pry them loose.

Speaker 1:          02:36:27       So I've read a bunch of fucking assholes talk about vandalism that get this, whether this is true or not, we have no way of knowing, but there are many, many arabic accounts and accounts of early travelers and pretty much they all unanimously declare that the entire outside of the pyramid was inscribed. Now think about that. What in the hell would that have been telling? What kind of message was that that was being sent to the future? That must've been amazing. Yeah. I get. I get my. My hair stands up on my legs. Just thinking about inscribed. Yeah. Hey listen, there's rocks in space and occasionally they land and when they do you're fucked. Build one of these. get inside, wait for

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       further instruction. It's amazing that there. I mean, if that thing existed, if you've robert schoch has corrected, nothing existed before the holocene events. Those are the only types of structures that would still be here. Yeah, exactly. Fuck, did people make it through there? I wonder what the number was. Well, I'm going to adam and eve story. Here's my theory on it. You know, all over the world we have traditions about cactus catastrophes and cataclysms and giant floods all over the world. They've come down to us and there's a lot of deviation, but there's also a lot of similarity in them. The idea that a small group had some kind of foreign knowledge, you know, whether it was knowing the bible or do kalien in the greek myths or wooten, a pitch to him into samarian myths, or is this a thrusts or man knew. I mean the, the, the culture heroes that survived these great cataclysmic floods are into dozens and dozens.

Speaker 4:          02:38:17       Right? American indians had prolific traditions about giant floods when, when george, caitlin, the famous indian artist, spent decades of his life going around living with various indian tribes like 40 years painting and in writing about him, very interesting quote in one of his books, he says that they're widely divergent with traditions and language and customs and so on, but have a hundred and 20 tribes that he visited. They all had one thing in common that they were descended from survivors of some gigantic cataclysmic event. That's american indian. Do you find it in north America? You find it in south America. You find it in the polynesian islands. You find it in Australia, Japan. I mean, it's around the entire planet. This idea, and now modern science is confirming what we assumed was merely some kind of superstitious nonsense. Have, you know, pre scientific illiterate, barbarians.

Speaker 4:          02:39:24       And we're realizing that those myths and those stories and epic tales that have been handed down for centuries and centuries actually contained hard scientific truth from surviving eyewitnesses. Well, if these craters actually do exist, and they do right, craters undeniable. The nuclear glass throughout asia and europe, undeniable human beings were alive then. Yes, and if human beings were alive, then they got fucked up. There's no doubt about it. Yeah, they did. They, they, they, they would have suffered enormously and just like, you know, if, if you know, if three quarters of the species of animals in north America when extinct, do you think that the 25 percent surviving came through completely unscathed? No. It simply means that there's a threshold above which species is viable. It can survive. There's there and below, which you know, there may have been survivors, but there just weren't enough of them.

Speaker 4:          02:40:19       They were too widely scattered, serious habitat loss which would have diminished food supply in a just died out, but either directly or indirectly as a result of these catastrophic environmental changes that accompanied the ending of the ice age. Humans had to have been affected by this and all of the myths and the stories would totally concur with that idea. You know, that, that, that there were humans and, and they're all consistent with this one detail, that there were some humans that had for knowledge and so they built arcs to kalea and built an ark just like noah did, wooten, dipesh to built an ark. Zissel sutras built an ark man, new built an ark. Where are these stories coming from? You know, are they just completely conjured up independently of one another and that detail is just thrown in or is there some kind of a reality behind this that there were people who had for knowledge?

Speaker 4:          02:41:12       Well, if there were people that had foreign success to suggest to me that there were two groups of survivors, those who survived because they intentionally planned to survive. They had for knowledge. They took steps to secure their survival in freemasonry there. So the account of, um, of lamech or the account of enoch, there's variances on it. But enoch, the story of enoch in, in, in masonic tradition says that enoch had, you know, he was in the, into the patriarchs before noah had this for knowledge, that the world was going to be destroyed either by fire or flood. So he created this underground vault. It was deep underground, and it was cool. It was preserved within nine layers of stone. It was nine layered vault and you only in unless you had the key to accessing to, to how to access this vault, which was now like a time capsule that preserved the science and the knowledge and the wisdom of the [inaudible] world or pre flood world.

Speaker 4:          02:42:18       He then set up two pillars, pillar of brass, and a pillar of marble. The pillar of brass designed to withstand the effects of the cataclysm. The lottery destruction. The pillar of marble, if I'm remembering it right, was to withstand the, the, uh, the destruction by fire. So there were these two pillars that basically informed any survivors that there was this nine chambered underground fault that contained the secrets of the previous world age that has what's coming to a pass. And that's an intrinsic part of masonic tradition. In fact, the whole masonic symbolism is based around that idea. And um, and it has parallels throughout other traditions as well. Well, what I'm getting at here is if, if there was some people who had for knowledge of it and took steps to survive, they were the ones who preserved the knowledge of the pre, the, the previous, the antediluvian world order, the other survivors just survive by the luck of the draw.

Speaker 4:          02:43:19       Like that tree standing there, right? They just happened to be in the right place at the right time. They survived, but now they are going to be the ones who are going to be wholly preoccupied simply with the task of surviving, finding enough food to eat and shelter. Because clearly the planetarium environment was going through all kinds of changes. Whereas the other group had taken actual steps to survive and preserve knowledge. Now, when we look at the beginning of recorded history, 4,000 to 5,000 years ago were basically halfway back through the holocene. Right, okay. Let's for purposes of conjecture, assumed that the end of the holocene human population crashed, right? Well, if you want to build a pyramid or a great temple, you've got to have a labor force, right? Well, if you've got scattered bands of survivors, you basically aren't going to be able to accomplish that.

Speaker 4:          02:44:14       Now, let's assume that you've got two groups of humanity, one that's sitting there with all of this knowledge at their disposal, just like imagine if our modern society was wiped off the face of the earth, but somebody somewhere in some deep cave underground was able to preserve our knowledge of physics and chemistry and and the various sciences. Well, obviously in order to run this computer that we're running here to do this broadcast requires an intact huge, intact infrastructure. Right? Well, we could know how to build a computer. We could know how to do, how to broadcast, but if we don't have the infrastructure, we're just sitting on information, right? Well, let's assume that you have a group that survived, right? And they've got, they're the custodians of this body of knowledge right now. It takes 3000, 4,000, 5,000 years for the human population to reconstitute itself and now you've got a labor force and let's suppose that there's gonna be another cataclysm impending, you know, such as the one that perhaps caused the, the, the noah's flood, which, you know, there's evidence now that around 5,000 years ago there was an asteroid impact into the indian ocean, right?

Speaker 4:          02:45:24       That plunge through two miles of ocean water and blasted a, a 12 mile wide hole on the floor of the indian ocean. And what year was this? This would have been about 5,000 years ago now. How much of an impact would that have had? Oh, it would have created tsunamis. Well, I'm on the island of Madagascar and the southern island of Madagascar, and it should be in this, in this program that we've got open right here. Jamie. Um, if you go to slide number, yeah, go to slide number 111. It's so ironic that today our focus is closer and closer to the cloud and closer

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       to chips to solid state, hard drives, all these different things that are just not going to last, right? No paper. No, but no one's carbon. Anything in stone, you know, the knowledge that we have is like how much of what, what everybody has his own hard drives. I mean how much of what everybody has is in the cloud on a server somewhere. Yeah. And who the fuck is going to be able to figure out how to read that shit a thousand years from now. Yeah. Just anything happened to us.

Speaker 4:          02:46:39       We're trying to figure out how to read egyptian hieroglyphs. Okay. Look at. Look at slide number 111. Now wish I had my pointer here. Go to the next slide so you can see we. Okay. Right there. You see, you see those weekly things like dragon scales? Yeah. What that is is it's water, ocean water that washed on land and washed up and you see it kind of comes to a point and then it washed back out. This is, this is a tsunami deposit and those few features that you're looking at, the kind of look like this there, she called chevron's right? That's what happens when the water washes in, makes deposits of giant ripples and then washes back. What kind of timeframe are you talking about when this happens? How long statistics do the oh hours. So that all happened in hours. In hours. And you could still see it today. Oh yeah. Go to the next slide. Jamey. We're getting a closer up look here. Now you see how, see how they're shaped. Almost like that's the chevron, like a sergeant stripe almost, right? Okay. Go to the next slide. Okay. Here's a cross section of one of those v shaped hills at 600 feet in height.

Speaker 1:          02:47:53       Wow, that's incredible. Now what? So what you're seeing in the back. That up. One more jamie. So those images right there. What we're seeing there, it looks like the effects of a river or water or something. It is water. Yeah. But then when you go back, you see it from the ground. It looks like hills. Yeah. Six hundred feet high. So you're talking about a massive amount of water.

Speaker 4:          02:48:18       We're talking about a tsunami whose minimum run up height is the height, the thickness of these hills, 600 feet minimum, minimum minimum, and that's of course massive amount of weight and devastation. And this was all 5,000 years ago. Yeah. Go to the next slide, jamie.

Speaker 5:          02:48:35       Uh,

Speaker 4:          02:48:37       keep. Yeah. There's Madagascar location of the chevrons on the southern edge of Madagascar. Let's see. Go to slides up

Speaker 5:          02:48:46       and

Speaker 4:          02:48:47       over on the other side at the same age. If we look at the southwestern coast of Australia, I think the next slide, we'll get a closer in view. There we go. You see that? Splurge. That's, that's the technical scientific term isn't really blueedge. No, I just made that. You bet. You

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       see, you see the stuff that's been washed over. You can see it. It's very clear there. Okay. That's the other side of the ocean. So the other side of the ocean directly opposite of where this thing impacted. Yeah. Go to the next massive impact in the middle. Yeah. Ancient crash. Epic. Wait, let's go back to that slide where from the word says ancient crash, epic wave. Next slide. Keep going right there. Right there. Can we read that? Yeah. The southern end of Madagascar lie for enormous wedge shaped deposits called chevrons that are composed of material from the ocean floor. Each covers twice the area of manhattan with sediment as deep as the chrysler building is high on close inspection. The chevron deposits contained deep ocean microfossils that are fused with medley of metals typically form by cosmic impacts. Wow. Holy shit. Yeah, yeah. Holy shit. And so that, if that happened 4,000, 800 years ago, um, what, what kind of an impact would that have had on human civilization?

Speaker 1:          02:50:16       Oh, well it pretty much would have wiped out anything adjacent to the indian ocean. Anything close to it. But what about on the other side of the planet? I mean, there would have to be some massive effects. Oh, there would be. Most likely. What we would see on the other side of the planet is extreme weather events, hurricanes, torrential rain falls, things like that. Winter kill a huge amount of people worldwide could kill a human, a huge amount of people worldwide. Yes. Wow. And so that is probably the most recent one. That's probably the most recent and no record of it because people really didn't have any records. I think the record of it is probably when we see these stories like noah's flood and the rest. So that's probably about this one. So it's not even about the holocene one. It's about one 5,000 years after the house in one.

Speaker 1:          02:51:03       Yes. See, that's what we're beginning to realize now is that these events have happened with a much greater degree of frequency than anybody hit imagined. well, congratulations. You freaked me the fuck out. I just want to say, you know, you had an objective and you pull it off of five stars a plus freakout. Wow. This is a. This has been an intense three hours. It just flew by three hours. Yeah, we just did three hours. Wow. It's over. Yeah. That amazing. Yeah. We got to do this again. I bet you could talk for another 16 hours. Yeah, I mean we've barely scratched the surface here. Oh, please, let's do it again. Let's take a couple months off, regroup and come back in again. Oh, I'd love to do some more. Thank you very much for doing this. I really, really appreciate it. It is incredibly enjoyable, incredibly enlightening for me. I really, really appreciate it. I knew it was going to be like this. Just the brief conversation that we had a chance to have in atlanta, you know, many years ago. I've been looking forward to talking to you again. Thank you very much for doing this. Oh, it's been awesome. I really, really have enjoyed it. If people want to research more your work, read

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       more of your stuff, where can they go? Where can they, what can they find? Go to sacred geometry, international.com and there are links there. I've got another website that linked from there, so like in sacred geometry, international idea with a bunch of different stuff. Not directly connected necessarily with what we're talking about here, but there'll be links to another website that I've got where I'm really exploring like the catastrophic stuff or I've got lots of images of, of things. Um, yeah. cause I've done lots and lots of field exploration. They have thousands of images of just awesome stuff. Does it sacred geometry have anything to do with this stuff or is that a totally different sacred geometry? Put it this way as we've inherited this corpus of ancient knowledge, sacred geometry is one of the keys for deciphering these ancient traditions because all of these ancient temple structures which are the textbooks in stone, if you will have several components in, in common astronomical and geometrical being the two predominant.

Speaker 4:          02:53:12       And if you understand the geometry, you realize the geometry is like a universal code by where whereby you can preserve certain types of information because geometry is universal. It doesn't matter what your spoken language is, the principles of geometry are what they are, you know, the relationship of a, of a radius to a circle is the same and it doesn't matter what culture you come from. You see, and so geometry is a critical means of decipher the, the knoWledge that and I think that the, that the predominant way of preserving ancient knowledge is in the temple structures and they have to be looked at as textbooks in stone and once we begin to realize that, then we can go. It's like when you go to Egypt, it's not just the hieroglyphs that's a part of it, but it's also the geometry and the astronomy that's encoded there and we can see the same astronomy at work, whether we're looking in Egypt, whether in geometry or whether we're looking at megalithic structures in ancient england or whether we're looking at, um, mega a monumental earthworks up in the Ohio valley or we're looking at this, the mind you've been to teach an eatsa.

Speaker 4:          02:54:20       Right, okay. That whole complex there is laid out according to principles of sacred geometry and astronomy and it's exactly the same principles underlying that is we find in Egypt. That will be our next conversation. I'll be a great. I can't wait. I can't wait. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Randall carlson, ladies and gentlemen, you can follow him on twitter. It's a sacred geo int for sacred geometry, uh, international. So yeah. So sacred geo I n, t on on twitter and sacred geometry international.com is the website. Thank you so much man. Really amazing and I can't wait to talk to you again. I'm going to
