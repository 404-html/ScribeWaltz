Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Right, we're going to go live in five, four, three, two. So tell me about your feminist. I got it here.

Speaker 2:          00:00:14       Um, girl logic. It was the difference between, oh, the genius and the absurdity. What's the difference between girl logic and boy logic or do you know? Because I don't know,

Speaker 1:          00:00:22       I can't tell you exactly the way men think because I think if I did that it'd be like slow your roll. The book is about me sort of noticing that women are always called crazy psycho psychopaths psycho bitch, you know, like oh she's insane. We always write off women as crazy and women are expected to be so many things to so many people at once and if these expectations that sort of we have to take into account all of this and we try to be so many things at once and we have to take in so much stimuli to process all this. So our logic is sort of, it's sort of this like circumlocutions way of thinking that seems insane. Slow that word down. What was that circle like? You know, like going around in circles. I was at work was say it again, circle the computer, this big bird or whatever like that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       I've never heard that before. So it's like, um, I'd never heard of the mad cow thing. You were telling me that earlier and I was like, oh my God, are we on? I was, as you were talking about, I was like, please don't make me look stupid. I don't know about El Kevin Crazy brains, but I just the base, the boiler plate example is, you know, you say to a girl what do you want to eat? Right. And that's always an argument. It's like this common trope, like my wife couldn't ever figure it out, but it has less to do with women wanting to be difficult and more pressure on just that one decision. If I say pizza, am I doing a diet? Do I have to be in a bathing suit later? Did I go to the gym already? Am I expected to be thin in this society? And we take all of this into account for every micro decision. And it's all about processing how we don't let everyone, including ourselves down and all the thought that goes into it.

Speaker 2:          00:01:53       Well No, this is used specifically, like obviously you're not speaking for all women,

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       but I actually got the title, I got the rights to it, I pulled 10 women. They were like, it's cool. So I need is honoring the fact that we get painted with these broad brush strokes and there's so many and there's just so much that goes into the littlest things because we have to take into account how other people feel. So it's easy to say, oh, just be yourself, but when you're a woman, other people's perceptions of you can have detrimental effects on your future, on your safety, on your health. She seemed slutty so she deserved it. She seems like a bitch. I don't want to give her a chance, you know? So our perception versus the way that we are, we're, we're constantly wrestling with these two sort of realities.

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       Yeah. Yeah. I, I've often wondered like if you could like, I believe that one day they're going to be able to, you know, today we have transgender people, right? We have people who decide to have operations decided to take hormones, but I think one day they're going to be able to literally a person into a woman with a shot. Yeah. Well, not with some sort of treatment. I just feel like it sounds crazy to say today people say, no, you can't change your chromosomes. Well today you can't change your chromosomes, but 200 years ago the idea of sending a video to someone in Australia, it'd be ridiculous. Right? So like what we've been able to do just over a short period of time, relatively is pretty staggering. And if you look at like what they're doing with Crispr, do you know what Crispr is? It's gene editing tools that they keep evolving there. They've gotten them to the point where they're starting to work on human embryos, non-viable human embryos in there. They're changing the expression of certain genes has changed. Genes got stopping genes for certain diseases and there's. Yeah, I don't like this chair. I knew it was expensive. It can drop if you want to make it lower. Close to my heart. Okay. Hm. Interesting. Um, but the idea is that they're going to be able to like make designer people.

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       Sure. Right. So this, this is less, this is, you know, you're a woman obviously with by genetics and your Genitalia, but this book is all about the experiences and this is more societal based. This is less about what you're born as.

Speaker 2:          00:04:11       That was, that's what I was going to say. I was like I was saying if, if you could like I, I've wondered if that was a possibility they could reverse it. What I want to be a woman for like a week.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       Yeah, for a week, but let me see it just to see, just to play with them.

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       Just stick stuff up there. But I think that like we don't, we don't know about the, the closest you come to understanding a man or a woman if you're a man or if you're the opposite. Sex I think is living with one or having one or having one. Yeah, that's a big one for me was having daughters and just seeing how they just interact. Sure. From the time they're one until you know, they're older. It's some of its biology. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:51       You know, this whole, you know, when you, and I've talked about or know of someone else, but still the sort of um, what women excluding other women. So this goes back to when we were hunters and gatherers. If you didn't want someone to live, you'd turn your back on them and you wouldn't share information and then you and your offspring will die. Right? So some you see this, a little girls like they're mean, they're mean to each other and as you get older, you know, you're taking in all of this stimuli from society, all the messages and we have to process these things and then eventually you get old enough, you're like, fuck it, I'm going to do it my own way. But there's still expectations place. And a lot of them are conflicting like polar opposites. Like you have to be sexy but also demure, outgoing, but don't be too pushy and too pushy or outgoing. They're relative depending on who's in your path, so, and women have to take these things into account because we got to do everything second. We didn't create professional sports or corporations. We're late to the game for everything. So it's a man's world and you do have to take into account those rules and it sucks, but these are all the things that we have to factor in when we're making decisions.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       Then there's always going to be a certain amount of resentment if someone tries to do it a woman's way rather than a man's what? You need a tissue? Never going to stop running. But uh, you, uh, you have allergies. I don't know. My nose just always runs a little bit too much. I hate. I hate when people do so much. He knows it's so little. I don't know how you get coke up there. You have coke rocks that we get stuck in your nose holes. They're still stuck up there. Keep it like I've wondered like I don't work right. I don't have a job, a real job and I haven't had one in a long, long time. So the idea of like having a boss is alien to me and had a female boss is even more annoying to me. Sure. So I was, I'm talking to someone who has a woman boss and um, we, we were saying that there's an interesting thing that happens where a woman can do the exact same thing and she's a bitch. Whereas if the guy does it, he's stern, he's a hard ass or no,

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       it's a, it's all this, it's a, you know, as women age, their gross and men are austere or the regal intersects, you know. And those are kind of basic examples, you know. Um, and I think we're moving away from that. It's more nuanced things I like, you really can't identify with workplace issues. I talked to some friends of mine, they're like, I hate that I have to dumb things down or people express and in my domain, like I worked very hard to be the one in charge and men don't speak to me that way because they're opening for me. Right, right, right. There's just, I don't have that hierarchy. So they're the manager of the club or you got to pay me anyway. So, um, but it doesn't mean that I don't have a sort of sympathy for that and that I don't understand what it feels like to be discounted. So as long as time you had a job job, job, job, job, job was probably 2004, five, six relatively recently, 12 years, 15 years ago. And I wasn't mentally present that much for it. It was kind of relaxed, you know, but, and it wasn't like I wasn't trying to get ahead at that job.

Speaker 2:          00:08:00       It was 2006. So 11 years ago. That's like a base of maybe seven years ago, maybe, maybe 2007. So 10 years ago, 11 or whatever it is that you're like a different human. Right. You're so like, do you remember it very well? Like what was the job?

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       I was the last job I had, I was an assistant in the marketing department of a large company that dealt with like Black Jack. It was like a black Jack. It was like a new kind of interesting and so. But this Nice Jewish guy hired me and I was just there to answer the phone if anyone ever called, make some press kits like it was monkey work and you were obviously doing standup. I was doing standup at night and I would spend the days sort of like soliciting people if I could get a spot on their show, making flyers, like I just use it as my own office and I didn't have also the environment like I could wear pajamas to work. Like no one ever came to. Our office was barely, barely a regular job. Yeah, there's definitely. I wasn't like in the workforce now happening

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       regular jobs. There's obviously a huge problem with the dynamic that men and women have in regular jobs, but there's a problem with men and men in regular jobs like pee. I don't think that it's normal for people to be working on top of each other doing something they don't want to do for long stretches of time. I think it's very difficult to be yourself. You have all these restrictions on your language and the way you're allowed to communicate with each other and then you're obviously doing something all day that you would rather not be doing.

Speaker 1:          00:09:24       So I have two thoughts on that. One. It's interesting because we have this corporate structure which is really designed to minimize suing and to minimize issues, but since humans aren't meant to be put in these boxes, I think it perhaps creates more problems were too confined, but it's interesting. I opened a lot of my snaps on snapchat and you'll always get ones that are like, ugh, for 49 can for the state of database over hate work, don't want to go into work. It's all about hating your job, which I don't understand because I. I love my job and I worked very hard to have a job that I enjoy, but I don't know if everybody I talk in my book about, you know, your passion and finding it and whenever you can find it. Not everybody's meant for greatness. Not everybody's meant to be happy and some people are dumb and I know this sounds terrible. Like I'm designing some master plan, but some people need to just go and do the shitty job. You're not contributing. Not everybody is meant like this is like some Hitler Eugenic Shit. Make my fucking phone be quiet because if you think about the majority of people you talked to, like some people are not bright and no, you don't have the mental wherewithal to carve out your own happiness. So

Speaker 2:          00:10:32       that's a genetic thing. I'd always had an environmental thing.

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       I think it's a religious thing. No, I don't know. I don't know. It just takes all kinds. Right? It does take all,

Speaker 2:          00:10:40       but I will always wonder like is it what they've experienced in their life? Is it the family environment that they grew up in? Is it just straight raw genetics?

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       Some people are just dumb. I don't know if it's nature versus nurture. Fix that. Well, I will tell you this. I do think it's more nurture than anything because I go and I read to kids at at this elementary school and they're all Latino. They all speak Spanish. There's not a blonde kid in the group and I think it's very easy to write off minorities, you know, they don't speak English as their parents don't speak English, whatever and the kids are so fucking smart and like they're like four years old and they're reading and they're guessing things and they speak two languages and you get chills because you're like, I don't know if you're going to have the opportunities I had and that kills me because I can see that you're smart and you want to like take one which is illegal and like put them in a good school. But I mean that's just the way of the world as opposed

Speaker 2:          00:11:38       diet. I think diet is a huge part of it is a huge part in the way a child's mind and body develop.

Speaker 1:          00:11:46       I was, I read this article, I want to say it was in the Atlantic, but it was about sort of the language surrounding and running clean

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       eating and how that term shames people who are poor because you're suggesting that their food is dirty, which it is to an extent, but it how clean eating is just for rich people. That's a silly way of describing it. No, it's not. That's not what it means. It means there's a lack of preservatives and bullshit, but that's all in and twinkies are affordable and they're filled with garbage. Yeah, but let us is affordable too. I mean it's not expensive to eat queen. No. In terms of. I mean it's expensive. You want to go to whole foods, but you have to define. I mean clean to everyone is different. Right. It's a weird term and is just one interesting. It was just one take on it. I don't know if I totally agree with it, but like I did the. I started doing the Ketogenic Diet and my father isn't doing it, but he takes these exogenous Kita Jens, I guess, and he's like, my mind is sharp.

Speaker 3:          00:12:42       I'm focused and I think there was a bit of a power of suggestion, but I definitely don't have an energy dip and I feel like my body's burning clean fields. Very legit. I mean there's. There's a lot of science behind it. There's a podcast that I did pretty recently with a guy named Dom D'agostino, who's a scientist and does a lot of clinical research on kidogenic diet and he. He can give you like real raw hard data, but there's A. There's a big issue with your body burning off carbohydrates, especially in particularly refined carbohydrates and then spikes of insulin and then the dips. You just feel terrible and you need a nap in the middle of the day. I've been operating that way for so long. I'm not saying I'm enlightened now and this will be it forever, but I was like, yeah, you just take a nap.

Speaker 3:          00:13:24       President takes a nap. People, most of Europe takes an APP. You take a nap and I started doing this and I was just on this press tour and I went into it and this is sometimes just knowing that it changes possible is almost more important than the outcome. I went onto this thing in New York and every time you do press it's like you're up at 6:00 AM, you're done at 7:00 PM and it's a gauntlet and I always feel disgusting and tired and bloated and this time I was like, I'm just going to. I'm going to do the ketogenic diet throughout, and I never needed a nap. I didn't feel like I outgrew my clothes. Like I felt like a human and I felt pretty, which is such a weird thing, but like there's nothing worse than being bloated as a girl and it's got to be the Diet because you're burning clean fuel and there's no dips and if you think about every time you reach for a snack, which is so easy or a piece of candy and a Green Room, you're doing that to your body that the spikes and that's exhausting and that's why you're napping at 4:00 everyday.

Speaker 3:          00:14:16       Yeah, it's not, it's not good for you and we're not designed to consume food like that. I'm just not all these refined carbohydrates. It's a massive part of the modern diet. It's just, it's really recent. Last few hundred years. Humans have had it in the last hundred years, has changed pretty radically. I um, I went to this thing called the summit, which is Kinda like a giant Ted talk and I did some stand up there and just end up at it. I just went. How many people did stand up there? It just meat Bengali. You've invited me. And so I went, um, what has been doing there? He did some stand up before and uh, so I did it and then after, you know, it fosters this environment

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       of sort of open mindedness and just talk and you can just talk to people. And I, it was the first week of the Diet, so I had the Keto flu and I had to leave the comedy store one night I had a second show and I was talking to Steve Simone about cheese and I almost threw up and I was like, I have to go home because my own diet was making me so nauseous because that's part of it. You get sick at the beginning I never got the, I just got tired to the point where it was fucking with my workouts so my workouts folds flat. But exoticness ketones are the way to kill that. So I was taking those two. But it's also, you're kinda like you're reading stuff and you're kind of sussing out what works for you and trying to find the right balance.

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       Anyways. I was not feeling well, but I was talking to everyone about this diet. I was like, this could not be more La. I'm like, hi, I'm Eliza. I'm on a diet. Check it out. Like on the Keto Diet, the Keto Diet, that's big La. And it's also like an intense thing, like you're changing everything. So I. and so when you say you have a diet, people want to tell you what's wrong with it. And I was like, my favorite part of a diet is people telling me how wrong I am for spending all this money and doing this and this one guy came up and he's like, I'm a Vegan. And I was like, okay. And he starts explaining why he's basically a better person. And I was like, but your shoes are leather so fuck you. And I was like, okay. He's like, you're impacting the world in a negative way.

Speaker 1:          00:16:07       I'm like, okay, but do you recycle? And like, no, like we all do what we can. And you're not a better person just because you happen to eat only herbs and maybe you don't drive a prius. Like who knows where you're making your shitty. The desire to project that on people. Absolutely. I was like this. I don't say I'm not telling anyone to do it. I was just saying what I'm doing. I'm going to mean you're not saying you're a better person, but him saying he's a better person for that or he didn't say he was acting like. You know what I'm saying? It's one of the reasons why people do those. This moral high ground that they take. That being said, that being said, when I see people eating garbage, I do feel superior. I'm not hungry. Well, you realize they're doing something bad or their body.

Speaker 1:          00:16:44       It's way I feel when I see someone smoking cigarettes, man, but I'm not going to say something to you. You should walk up to them and start coughing. Okay. Can I tell you, I was at starbucks the other day and I just was running in to grab an espresso shot because I have one every time I work out and I go in and there's a girl there and were comic. So a big part of our job is sort of scanning people, identifying what they are, making assumptions because we're usually right. So this girl in front of me and she's standing there holding a snack because usually we're usually right. That's why we're successful and she's holding her snacks and, and I can see that she's Kinda weighing her options and I see you're putting out and I see her grab a banana. So to me, for the most part when women do that, it is about a dietary thing.

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       You're trying to lose weight. She looked like she was maybe going to the gym. I don't know. So just trying to be a good girl to another girl. I just, because I thought she was making like a sugar based decision. I go bananas full of sugar just because I didn't know that I did it because someone told that to me because you always think of bananas healthy. You put it in a smoothie shake. I didn't know so much sugar so I just said it just as a like, hey girlfriend, I didn't know this. And so she and, and Oh God, what did she say? She looked at me and she said something and she was. And then the, the, the, the Barista like gotta tune. She goes, fruit has a lot of sugar. I go, well, blueberries have a load by simic index and just bananas have more.

Speaker 1:          00:18:03       I just didn't know that was it. I was just trying to be cool. I leave. I'm walking through the courtyard and I hear this, excuse me, and it's the girl from inside and she goes, did you know dying? Your hair causes cancer. Oh, I'm sorry. That was it in the place. I go to the banana sugar. She goes, but it has potassium, and I go, well, we don't really know what potassium does doing. I mean, we know what's in bananas. Like I was just trying to be funny and I leave and she comes across when she goes, do you know the dying to hear it causes cancer? And Joe, I thought she was fucking with me. And I go, yeah, but there's a lot of potassium and hair dye. And she goes, you really shouldn't tell people what they should and shouldn't eat. You don't know what I'm going through. And I was like, I do now. Crazy. Oh crazy. That is crazy. That is crazy. It's crazy. Oh, for sure. Oh yeah. Are fucking. If you're gonna like you're gonna attack on me in a courtyard and tell me to go fuck myself because I just said bananas. Have she got like so offended?

Speaker 2:          00:18:56       Well you are slim and maybe she was not. She was fine. She was fine. Looking fine. Maybe she has a body image thing who doesn't? My point is if you can't suss out, but I was just making tommy super comfortable as body. I'm pretty comfortable with my. Alright. But the point is I get and I asked everyone, I was like, was I wrong? And sometimes you just catch someone. Like I've always described it this way, like most people all day long, if you're lucky, people are at like a two or a three out of 10 on the outrage scale. But you might run into someone who's at a nine. They just, they might've just got dumped their car. My be getting repossessed. They might've just got fired. They might just got yelled at by their mom. There might be like a whole series of things and behind her with the fucking banana,

Speaker 1:          00:19:39       banana sugar, just bitch. If you're listening, which I doubt it because you don't seem like the kind of person that wants to be enlightened, but if you're listening, this is not a good apology.

Speaker 2:          00:19:48       Knows about cancer and hair dye and that's what she wanted to tell you. Well, I'm not going to not be blond. I'm not gonna. Walk around with like roots just because it causes cancer. Maybe. I'm sorry if I offended you. I'm sorry. Banana Lady. Banana ladies. Do you need a hug? Um, does, does hair dye actually caused cancer? I've never read that. Doesn't like, doesn't involve. Well, living in a city causes cancer for sure. Oh my God. It's got a big time for you. They say they say they say that living near a highway I give you live within a certain distance of a highway. Can Shave 10 years off your life.

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       I believe that not just from small, but anxiety. I believe twitter is slowly killing us to really do twitter and I have a foil helmet to prove it. I the amount of anxiety it causes. I think the bad far outweighs the good.

Speaker 2:          00:20:38       Do you, do you like read comments and talk back to people and have conversation now and I had a conversation at the improv where you were frantic. That sounds like a year ago you were getting into it with someone. God dammit, I wish I could remember what it was about, but you are fucking pissed and you were frantic and you had been going at it with all these people and they were pissed at you. Do you remember

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       the make America great again? Thing that I went through, which was horrible, but I could have been something about racism. Sounds like my running with Hashtag Maga.

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       Maybe that's what it was, but we were in the front of the Improv and you were so fucking frantic and angry and frustrated and I said it was just don't read that stuff. Just don't. Don't, don't engage. Like you wouldn't engage with those people in real life. You're like, you're right, but I have to fucking tell them because they say this.

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       I can genuinely tell you this. I gave it up. I had like my own thing. I did this interview and some girls got like butthurt over something and it was then that I was just like, you know what, I'm done. I'm done reading all of this, so I'll skim it once in a while for like a, like a retweet about something or if someone's posting something, but I, if you look at my tweets, they're all just sort of self generating. There's Vr, there's no responses anymore. I've just decided like you're following me for a reason. So what I say is the, is what I'm saying and I don't need to backtrack and that's just the stance that I've taken because it really is like screaming into a pillow. That's all it is. Like with all and by the way,

Speaker 2:          00:22:08       but don't you find interesting? Do you find interesting things and then tweet them out to people like, hey, look at this cool article I just read.

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       I will retweet people's things if I think someone's brilliant. There's this girl just to whack who I can't stop talking about, uh, who has single handedly upending the trump administration. Like her tweets are so brilliant. Just dweck. How do you think it's dw? E, C, k? I think I phone. She's just so good and I just believe in if something's good, perpetuating it and putting it out there. So I retweet hers. If somebody says something funny, I retweet it, but. And, but I don't answer people. Dew, W e, c, k dot just get ready for a boost. Yeah, they're just hot fire. But she does a good job. So I like to retweet it. The dweck is her, her name, she was on a show I did last night. I did a women only invite show and she did a women only. Could I go if I wore drag?

Speaker 1:          00:23:03       No, I'm not allowed to know because I'd be like, what if I identify as a woman? So people ask that and I was just like, you can come, but no one did that. Oh, you can come if you identify as a trans woman. I'm not going to be the one to tell you. You just figured it out like five minutes before the show here. Here's why you can't because it's about a lifetime as a woman. So if you were always a man, you probably just aren't going through the same things that a woman who's a woman was born a woman, but you can come. I'm not going to be the one to say no. Um, what's your stance on Trans racialism? It's okay. Oh, sorry. No, no, I didn't get the with the like, uh, the Rachel dolezal person.

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       I don't think it works. You can't be another race.

Speaker 2:          00:23:49       Well, how can you be a woman then? How can a man be a woman? What if you really aren't hockey? If a man feels like he's a woman, why is that different than a man feeling like he's like. There was one I tweeted yesterday, a guy who believes he's Filipino, he was born. I think he's transgender as well. He's got both things going on. You know, I think it's people that just don't like who they are and they feel like a radical shift. There is transracial man born white says he feels Filipino. And by the way, that makes it into USA Today.

Speaker 3:          00:24:18       Is he a nurse news? Maybe that's why he feels that scrubs. It's like tie dye, looks like scrubs a. This is where he has purple highlights in his hair or can I just say that? It seems to be the issue is when white wants to be another color, everybody has been forced to sort of take on white characteristics. Black girls flattened their hair, nose jobs. Do you know about Sammy Sosa? Yeah. And getting lighter. Do you know what he looks like now? Yes, I do. Because he looks like you. He looks just like 10. He knows he doesn't have a tiny nose, but he has like literally your color skin. So my best friend, her wife is Dominican and she posted a picture of it and she was like, this is not a joke. It's so sad that he feels that he has to do this.

Speaker 3:          00:25:02       Holy Shit. Just look at that. He's a fat white concept. The Gerber baby, I mean I guess he got it off the steroids and that's when his body sort of started getting fucked up and it doesn't work out anymore. So he's big now. But the white is outraged when you try to be white. I think people of color get angry when it goes the other way. Right? Because they're like, you don't get to just take on our look as a costume. That I think that's the social issue. Yeah. Not for sure. But that's, that's. I guess that's my only answer. Right? But what if that's what you really feel like you would be happy? I didn't do it to a privately, privately where, uh, a Dominican Day parade costume under your overcoat. We can get away with some of it. Right? Like affectations, like you can get away with like if you're a rapper you could sort of talk or MC search. I think it's like teetering on that line. Who's MC search? You don't remember the third base.

Speaker 2:          00:25:56       He used to have a, a, a TV show and it was horrible. It was a talk show, but he was going to keep it real. And it was. Yeah. It was so bad that opie and anthony used to play clips from MC search show. Yes. That's him. Is He Jewish? Because we do this. We love hip hop. Yes. Yeah, that's from back in the day. I was a big fan of third base. I love them as a, as a band, but his show, well, you know what his show, here's the difference between his show and what his show could be. He, uh, that's awful, but he thinks he's being choked out by like he was all. He was also wearing makeup and he was also being, I'm sure produced. You got to be yourself and you can't be yourself. If you're on a fucking network, you just can't. They're not going to let you, they're going to force you some box. They're gonna,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       they're gonna. Figure out a way to sell you like, this is what you're going to be. You're going to be the. This guy did a pilot for look at them. Hey search, I think it was oxygen. And they were like, we need you to say things like, keep it 100. Ooh, can you say that for me? Keep it 100. I like it. Keep it $100. Nobody says that you stupid. Fuck. There was a while ago, but this is how dumb they are. People write that. They don't fucking say it. No one says, keep it 100. You dumb cunt. Who are you?

Speaker 3:          00:27:13       But it's always that. I always watched TV. Advertising is always one step removed from what's cool now because by the time they push it through corporate too late, it's like, guess what? No one's saying it anymore. Right. Remember was up. Remember that one guy that had that great video where it was like him calling his friends was friends. Like was. It was a hilarious. That was like the nineties, right? Here's another one that bothers me when people say I almost threw up in my mouth. Oh, you didn't invent it. Stop using it in commercials. Yeah. That's not good. Bad. Yeah. There's a bunch of those that they use. They go, Ooh, this will connect with the kids will be able to sell more things. Well, the worst is when like exact SCO. We want it. We want to make a viral video. I'm like, you can't, it becomes viral.

Speaker 3:          00:27:58       It goes viral, will make a viral video. And then what was the other one? Um, when people. It's bingeable. When I was on free form, we want bingeable. We want everyone to binge. I'm like, you don't decide that you're going to binge it just because you put all your content out there. You binged things because you decide bingeable taught. It's now it's fresh. Oh God. How can you be in that industry and keep it real? That's what I want to know. Can You keep it real? Can You keep it 100. Look at that lady. Oh, what is she doing? Is She doing the Dab? Dab It on him. Are you sure she's dabbing or she just doing Tai Chi in the park? Ah, definitely. Says it on her shirt, on a shirt that she doesn't know she's wearing. She didn't realize that she can't read the no 150,000 years old later, just keep pounding.

Speaker 3:          00:28:41       Have. Ooh. We think it's so funny when old people talk as if they were ever young and fucking like as if they've never had sex. Right? Like that lady probably at one point in time was a connoisseur when she's out there in the park, not knowing what the fuck she's wearing. Dinosaur in the park. That's probably the best place probably to be sampling Dick. Probably hard to get a good one though when you're at that age. Probably real tough because it's all about enthusiasm. I feel like dudes are pretty down with old ladies. Like old dudes. You. Oh yeah. Well that's an issue. I'm a friend of mine go on. One of his buddies worked at a old folks home and said that one of the big issues was these old guys would get Viagra. Yeah. And these old ladies, they didn't give a fuck and a lot of them are on antidepressants, so they're like, wow, Allah who gives a shit.

Speaker 3:          00:29:31       Like they're on Xanax and getting stds. That will. I don't know if it was that. That's something that I heard about, like it's rampant because that's happening. That's probably really bad. You're old, right? Like your body doesn't heal so good. No. [inaudible] 98. Herpes is like an attack on your immune system. There it goes. The new erotic frontier, sex in nursing homes. Until recently, nursing homes frowned on sex. Now increasingly they smile. Oh, well that makes sense. Why? Why shouldn't we have fun? Look at this, when Aubrey Davidson age, 85 minutes, special guy at the Hebrew home in Riverdale in the Bronx, New York, they did more than sit next to each other in the dining room. Then he invited her to his room. They hung a do not disturb sign on the door and at breakfast the next morning, they both supported broad smiles, terrible writing, but also calling it. What are the top say the you see the new erotic frontier. You're like, oh, and it's like sex and nursing homes. You're like, oh, there goes the boner. Well, it sounded so hot. Yeah, that's not. It's not exciting for me, but there's a whole category on Youporn so old people. They do. Some people do like watching old people. Fuck. You know what I watched the other day? I'm not proud of it, but I will admit it to you. I watched an old thing, my special.

Speaker 3:          00:30:56       I watched an old porn stars still at it. I don't care what he provides. Exercise and at the time of life when many elderly feel cold sleeping as a payer provides warmth. Oh, that's cute. Look at this though, like killed back to the relationships, make people happier and that happiness reduces stress and irritability and improves mood, appetite, sleep, sociability and immune function. So to plants. Read that first day. Oh, how dare you read the first sentence says the Hebrew home. That first one at the bottom of the Hebrew home does more than tolerate resident nookie. The faculty hope. Probably someone who works with the Hebrew home propaganda. The faculty holds regular happy hours, dances, and even organized a dating service for residents. Gy Date, g four grandparents. I like it. That's great. Whatever. No one's getting hurt. Yeah, cares. And they're enjoying themselves. Fought for our country.

Speaker 3:          00:31:53       Some of them probably did let him fuck. This is like an age, like might have been a few draft dodgers from Vietnam in that mix. What about Korea? But by the way, by the way, he needed one of those wars, but they're really fighting for our country, but no, but they still went. They still went to Vietnam was a draft. That was a horrible thing, but they still went. They still went. Well, it's not their fault. It was a bullshit war, it was a bullshit for sure, but it's not their fault. Who was the most bullshit war? The most bullshit war. What was the most bullshit war? Because it was literally founded on bullshit. Do you know about the Gulf of Tonkin? I know talking to them a, you know, it was a false flag that caught us into Vietnam has never happened. This Gulf, the Gulf of Tonkin incident as it. I'll take a step further. I think the threat of communism is something that we like to do to scare Americans and the poor Laotians got caught in the middle of all of this.

Speaker 1:          00:32:42       I went to Vietnam and they still have. I'm sorry. I went to Cambodia and they still have like active minds because they dropped, we dropped, I think more bombs was. It was several million or something and it's still an active thing, like people are still losing body parts to this. Sure. Farmers. So we're just like, oops, a daisy, sorry. And they're not an angry people.

Speaker 2:          00:33:01       I don't know if the threat of communism was perceived as real because I think if you look at the rest of the world, like we were obviously in conflict with the Soviet Union. They were worried about China, the Marxism and Mao and all the various issues that people have overcome. I think they were worried that communism was going to spread. I think it just one of those things where once a witch hunt starts like the mccarthyism area, that's, that's really fucking scary. That shit where they were going after people and ruining their lives. They'd went to a meeting. Sure. Like if you went to a communist meeting,

Speaker 1:          00:33:36       I mean we definitely blacklisting people, you know, and it's, it's a fine line because it's like, well you're Americans, you have these rights. And then like, who's deciding that line? I wonder if we're kind of getting into that now with what we're able to say online with the whole sexual Predator thing, which if you want to talk about draining a swamp, like it's great what's happening now, but then you're going to get guys who are like, I never did anything. It's like, well, sorry, now no one wants to work with you.

Speaker 2:          00:34:02       Well, there's people that are absolutely guilty that are getting caught and then there's people for sure they're going to get accused by people who really just want attention. You can have that too, but I think you're going to have way less. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:14       I think you're gonna have less of that because I think the stakes are so high that for you to do that, for you to be the type of person that accuses someone just for your own personal gain. I feel like it's not going to happen as much just because it's such a serious thing right now.

Speaker 2:          00:34:26       It's a serious thing, but there's so much weirdness to elect George Sekai. A guy says he grabbed his dick in 1981. Hey Dude.

Speaker 1:          00:34:35       You let it go. Walk it off. Walk it off. I'm sorry. It's also. It's not as damaging as it is when a man does it to a young woman. Percent. Thank you for saying that.

Speaker 2:          00:34:44       That's so true. I've been saying this on stage and I have a bit. I don't. I want to reveal it here, but I, there's a big difference between being threatened for your life, like if you're dealing with a situation like, all right, this is not the throw Louis ck under the bus, but someone was saying like, what's the big deal? Someone masturbating in front of you? This is what I, this is what I said. They've never had it happen. You're a man. Yup. Okay. And if a woman was masturbating in front of me, I would not be worried. Not threatened for your safety. I would exactly. That'd be like, okay, you want to do that? But if a man is doing it and they're blocking the door and it's a man that, look, I was in the green room, not the green room. The um, uh, the bar area, the comedy store, you know, that little narrow pathway. And this guy walked by, it was about three months ago and he was six foot seven, 300 plus pounds. And He, when he walked by me, I just looked at him. He looked at me. I got physically nervous, physically nervous. Like I was thinking, okay, if this guy decided he was going to kill me, he was going to smash me. There's almost nothing I can do about. He's so much bigger than me. That is how almost every woman feels around a large man.

Speaker 1:          00:35:58       This is the thesis for my last special for confirmed kills your thesis. I talk about it. It's added at length. How it all goes back to the fact, all of the suppression, all of your nervousness as a woman, all of it goes back to the fact that men are physically stronger than women in. My whole joke is if we were stronger, if women were stronger, we wouldn't have waited for the right to vote would have been like, I'm going to the polls out of the way. Jeddah diet like it just went. So it all goes back to that and I think for some guys it's hard to grasp what that feels like to feel physically inferior because it's not mental, mentally inferior. It's not someone's funnier. Your life is threatened when a guy blocks the door, when a guys in your weight, when you're in some guy's home and maybe he doesn't want to hear it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:40       No, he can kill you. That's all the. Even a guy that's not that much bigger than me is still exponentially stronger than me and that's just the way we're designed. It's not every woman is not every man, but women live with that fear. So it's so insane. You know, they're like, he jerked off in front of them and at the time, you know, this is a very valid thing. Like at the time I didn't know what was happening because your brain isn't designed to handle like a famous comedians masturbating in front of me. I'll file this away.

Speaker 2:          00:37:06       Well, not only that, how about it comes out of the blue. How about, how about you process it? You and I are friends. We've been friends for a long time. If we were in some hotel room somewhere and I said, can I jerk off in front of you? You'd be like, what? Yeah, you probably wouldn't eat. This is not like a rational request. Like, Hey, do you want to get some food? Hey, let's let's go to the bar. Hey, there's no neurological path to this. Where it's like, yeah, we'll go to the food bar and get food. You just opened a door and dropped off a cliff

Speaker 1:          00:37:35       and you're just. You're grabbing onto anything. So they giggle. They laugh because that's a natural reaction. You're like, okay, you can't believe it's happening. A lot of girls like Ali reisman just came out, the gymnast, her, the Olympic doctor was molesting her and another girl as well, and the guy's already in prison for child porn, which is so insane I think at the time, especially when you're younger. I have good friends who were like, I was basically raped or assaulted and at the time you're laughing and going along with it because you don't know, like your brain is like almost shutting down. You're like, I don't know

Speaker 2:          00:38:10       that it's not okay. Well, especially if you're really young, right? Sure. I mean, you're. If you're a young kid and you're not exactly sure you don't have a context for this action, right. So sudden it's happening. You don't know. Just don't, you don't understand, like I almost got scooped up by a child molester once when I was really young. I was like, I guess it was like eight or nine. I was in the library and I was looking at these books and this guy came up to me and I was looking at. I was always in a monster books, like monster movies and this guy came up to me. He's like, you're a monster books. And I go, yeah. And he goes, I've got some monster books in my car. You want to see him? So okay, got a monster in my pants. I didn't know any better and know I was fucking eight years old or whatever. So I start walking out to his car in the librarian sees him and me and start screaming. She said, Joseph, you keep away from that man. He just got out of jail. Oh my God. I was crying and I ran to her and the guy ran away. But I think to myself like I had no idea. I didn't know what a child molester was. Sure. I didn't understand.

Speaker 1:          00:39:09       You don't know. And even if he tried to touch you, you're like, this feels weird. I know I don't like this. It's just such a gray area and our, our sexuality, Dr. Right. For a doctor to like abuse and you think, oh, maybe he's touching me. He needs to be doing that. I don't know what went on. But your sexuality, especially as you're younger is so vulnerable. Like if you want to fuck up a girl's life, all you gotta do is go over and like grab her boobs as an adult and like that's it. Just go up and grab some young kids Dick or like touch a woman's vagina and you're fucked. Like it's such of precious vulnerable thing. The fact that any of us get out unscathed is America.

Speaker 2:          00:39:46       I had another one when I was 14. No 13 wasn't in high school yet, so it was like the year before high school I used to go fishing at this lake and there was this old dude that used to come by the lake. He was jogging all the time. Me and my buddies would fish there and he was a former professor and he Kumbaya and talked to us. He was always like really smart and articulate and interesting to talk to and it would sit with us while we're fishing and talk to us. It was always super friendly and then he drove up, drive off or run off. And then one day I went over his house and I didn't think anything of it because I'd been around the sky all the time. And He um, he watched me pee in the bathroom. Didn't think anything of that either, like grown man watching me.

Speaker 2:          00:40:29       P is like normal. And then like maybe a week later he showed up at the pond where we would fish and he was drunk and he told me he loved me and I remember thinking like, Oh, I don't know. Okay. I like you too because I'm fishing. At the time it was like, what the fuck is this guy going on? And we're in a weird area of the pond. There was like no one around. And it was like a lot of trees and bushes and shit. It was, it was sketchy and our memory said this to me, said something about something along the lines of you can't have love without sex, just out of the blue. Yeah. That's his opening. Yeah. He said he loved me and he said, you know, there can't be any love without sex. I said, what, what the fuck? And I had a knife and I remember I had a knife and I put my hand in my pocket. I like a little folding knife and I held onto it in my pocket and I told him he had to get away from me and then I'm leaving and he told me I was overreacting and I reeled in my line and got out of there, but I was like, this guy wants to do something to me. I'm, I can do anything. I'm like, maybe I might be able to stab them. Probably not. You know, it's definitely, I think about that because

Speaker 1:          00:41:42       especially as a girl, and I hate to keep saying that, but it really does. Like, it does affect us the most. And you know, you get in these, Uber's like, you're like, I'll just get in with this dude, right? I'll just get in this cab and hope that he's not going to snap today. You know what, even a cab, it's a guy's actual car, right? So it's even more intimate or just walking or it's basically your app, you know, you have to keep, you have to be vigilant about it because like, if somebody just decides this is what I'm going to do and we're all vulnerable to Greece. Some guy decides to take out an AK 47 or drive his car into a group. We're all just sitting ducks, you know, and all the preparation in the world, you can't fight a gun with your fist. You can't outweigh a man with your body mass as a woman was a real big girl. And uh, you know, I don't know. I think about those things. And so that's why it's tough when you're walking in, you're a girl and some guys like smile. You're like, I'm just trying to fucking survive. Forget the smile thing.

Speaker 2:          00:42:33       That's such a bully move. Because those guys who do that, they're only doing that because they're bigger and stronger than you. Oh, and by the way, smiling causes wrinkles. Wrinkles. What if you have done like, can't even smile. I don't know about that. But if you like, the reason why a guy will do that is because he can like, a guy's not going to do that to a bigger man. You know what I'm saying? Like a bigger man walks by, hey, smile. Hey, fuck. You know what I'm saying? Like you're ordering someone to do something. But moreover

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       I'm just trying to. I'm putting on a face just saying I don't want to be bothered because I'm scared and I'm trying to get from point a to point B and you're praying on that vulnerability thinking that I want that. If I want to see your Dick, I'll tell you, if I want to talk to you, I'll look. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:43:13       you're not thinking that you want that. What they're doing is they're realizing that you don't want to have anything to do with them. And by saying that they have this power to affect you, well, what scary watch smile wouldn't look like such a bitch. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       And what's scary is then if you don't, I don't know what wrath that's going to incur when I say fuck off, I better put them on the other side of the street. Yeah. And what's funny, because I and I talked about it in the specialist, I'm not trying to do a bit. This is such a common conversation. We have this thing where a guy says something to him who sweetheart, and you're like, fuck off, and you get tough. Immediately followed by what if he kills me? It's always our thought like, oh my God, please don't, don't follow me. Oh, of course. We came out of this show last night, this girl's night in show, and everybody was feeling great. We walk outside and it's like, dude walks up, boat to go to the loader. You're walking into a group of five girls having a lively conversation. You put yourself in the middle and I walked where I go ill, I'm not doing that. And he like started chirping at me. What's your problem? Who was a lawyer and my fucking dumb friends like I think I do sir, and I'm like, this is not the time to demonstrate how compassionate you are. Fuck, don't give him a lighter. Like there's no reason to go anywhere else. You're obviously a crazy person,

Speaker 2:          00:44:22       but that's another incidence. Where are instance where other, where a guy will do that because he's bigger because he can get away with. That guy's not going to do that to a group of guys know. You know what I mean? That's this. The reason why he's doing it, he's doing it because he's as imposing like he's a big dog walking to a room

Speaker 1:          00:44:37       in this and sometimes you know, for shows like I have security thereafter and it's not, you know, not beyond say it's not like people are throwing themselves at me, but I found just having a large man, even if it's a friend of mine standing next to me, detours, even the beginnings of even the inklings of a let me step to her and see what's going to happen just for having one there.

Speaker 2:          00:44:58       Well, that's got to be a thing with girls that's different with like God. People get obsessed with people. Guys get obsessed with girls, girls get obsessed with guys. There's a lot of people out there that are unstable and they lock onto someone that get obsessed with them. Sure. But if a man gets obsessed with you sexually, that becomes a giant issue

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       and there is no separation by the way. You can't just be obsessed with me because you're like, oh, I just, she was brilliant and I'm totally normal like relationship with you. Right. Had that happen. I had a stalker. It was a couple of years ago. And um, I did a show in Michigan. Was it Michigan? Nope. I was university of Delaware and I was going to Michigan the next day. And, and the idea of college obviously, and the woman working there, she comes up to me, she goes, hey, there's a guy here. He says, where's your cousin? And I was like, I don't have a cousin in Delaware. So she leaves, she comes back, she goes, he says he's a comic from La. And I'm like, I don't know any comes from Delaware also. And then she leaves, she comes back, she goes, he says, I go, stop, stop coming back to me.

Speaker 1:          00:45:59       This is obviously like several attempts and now security has to walk me out to the car. So we do that. And so I had it kind of in my mind like somebody did something. So I've go to Michigan and I'm in Michigan, I'm there for a festival the next day and the secure. And I mentioned it. It just kind of mentioned. I was like, this happened yesterday and the security guard comes over. And he was like, yeah, there was a guy waiting in the hallway after we cleared it. And when I talked to him he kind of ran away and I kind of got his name. I think he likes his ID for a second. The guy was like trying to get in, but he was creepy enough that security like caught it. So they showed me the surveillance tapes, you see nothing but a grainy face and like a black leather jacket and what they thought his name was.

Speaker 1:          00:46:38       So a couple of weeks later I had, I was going to play south by southwest, so I told my manager about it, so she tells security there, my buddy, I'm not gonna, say his name because he's very shy, is ex army ranger and works for the contracts with the government and so I told him so he called the FBI and they gave him with just the grainy photo and what we thought his name was and they found who he was, just some nut who of course has guns and has a record and lives off his family money somewhere in rural whatever. And I was at south by southwest and I had given and I felt bad and this goes to women feeling bad for taking up space. There were way more famous people there than me. But here I am. I can't pick up my badge. I had to go talk to the police. Like I had to have an escort everywhere. I'm doing like a bar show, you know, I'm just there to hang out with my friends and I had to have to all three shows

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       and I felt embarrassed because I have this police escort and like huge movie stars are there and they don't even have that and I didn't want anyone to look at me like who does she think she is? But I was scared and he had and so it was the last show and I thought it was in the clear and I go and I do my set and one of the cops comes over. They were like, he showed up and we caught him, but had they not been there and they talked to them and I guess they put the fear of God in him because they were like, she doesn't want to talk to you. And he goes, oh, I don't want to hurt her. And I'm thinking your version of hurt and mine are very different. Like I need my skin. You probably don't think it hurts to take it off of me.

Speaker 3:          00:48:05       How about you don't want to talk to him, period. Like he didn't want to hurt her, but I need to talk to her. Look, you never need, you don't need that. And it's Texas cops so they love, they get super hard for you in the fucking desert and they scared them off and I've never had to deal with him. But for months at the Improv at the customer, we had this guy's picture up, Jesus Christ and I did nothing. You know, it's just, you decide like he goes, she's communicates with me through meditation and Kabbalah. I was like, all right, let them in Jewish meditation. No, I think a Madonna was doing that for awhile. Jewish mysticism wasn't madonna like she was into which all these people that are like kabbalists that have studied it forever and she's trying to like hack it. She is Madonna. She gets a velvet rope to the front of the line.

Speaker 3:          00:48:53       That was Janet Jackson's tore the velvet rope tour. Thought you're making like a pop reference. No. Saying like she gets VIP to the Kabbalah Center. Registering in the water. What is Caballo like w, what do you know? Anything about the study of Jewish mysticism. So Judaism is actually a very ancient sort of mystical, spiritual religion and this Kinda goes sort of back to its roots and its something that you can't because I've always been interested in, you can't just pick up a book, like it's a lot of studying, a lot of like deep seated, dissecting Hebrew numbers, you know, it's not something you just decide you're going to do, but I don't know much about it other than it from ancient Hebrew. Ancient like it's. Yeah, it's, yeah, it's weird language. I would love to go. It's like I love looking at old languages because you're looking at like some weird art form and that way it was the first forms of communication.

Speaker 3:          00:49:47       Like if you look at it, you know, ancient Hebrew or ancient Arabic or Aramaic or something like that. Like the, just the way those things are structured, the way the sentence is written out of this. Um, it's several hundred years old, but it's a Thai Bible. Ooh. And it's on my wall, like I have. It's written on these, um, palm the palm would and flattened it out and painted it. So it's like this really like artistic, weird thing that's framed, but I just go buy it. I look at it, I'm like, this is like I have no idea what the fuck it says, but it's just cool to look at. Sure. Weird way of of writing and communicating these people had was also fascinating because like they had the urge that we do to record everything. People are going to look at ours in a million years and be like, why are there all these eggplant emojis?

Speaker 3:          00:50:38       Why does everything have eggplant and squirting water? Why is everyone yellow? But they had to say, I always wonder, did they have. I mean obviously they didn't have the same advancements, but like ancient Greece, like did they have like what were young people doing? Like was it, what was your fun besides vomiting? Couldn't vomitorium in wrestling? Yeah. Well I would just love to be a fly on the wall back then. I mean, when you're talking about people that had very little understanding of how the universe worked or the rudimentary understanding of science, just to hear the wisest the wise amongst them and try to figure out what makes everything tick. Talking about how acne is the devil. We want to talk about how women were treated. Then that's what's really weird. It's like women have always been treated like shit always. It's always been some weird sort of relationship between men and women because we can get away with it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:27       That's really the bottom line about at all. It's like what's happening today I think is that because of the ability to express now, like it's almost like something could happen to you in a bad way and no one could know about it. Right? But now everyone can know about it if you express it. If you express it, everyone can know about it. Everyone can know. Sure. And now everybody's realizing that and there's like a shift where everybody's. It's like when black lives matter really came to the forefront, you know? And all these white people are like, oh my God, I didn't realize America was racist and black people are like, really? Because we did. So all these women now are like, yeah, this shit goes on all the time. And I even think about in comedy, you know, and I went on a twitter rant the other day about it, this idea, it's an art comedy as art and people feel ownership over it.

Speaker 3:          00:52:19       So you get these boys clubs, you know, I'm very lucky in that I, you know, like you get like it's a group of dudes that run the show and they don't like girls, whatever it is or the way a lot of guys make women feel and it's so insane. I'm like so because you moved to La a year before me and you and your friends wrote the same jerk-off jokes. You somehow think you own this art form that I've always felt a connection to it my whole life. Just because you remember it. Because I would. Not only that, I mean, I don't mean you get it, like do you understand it? But I mean, does it happen to me as it happened to, you know, and the truth is I was able to avoid it because of what I did in my career early on because like winning a show like that makes you, you get to headline. So I was never respected. It's not even that as much as I just was never in the trenches as much because I got to headline, which is always the goal. Like I just had a different path. How much, how much? How many years were you doing standup before you? One last comic standing. Whoa, that's crazy. Right? So for me, I'm even more firmly, I guess planted in my, in my convictions about sympathizing or empathizing with women who didn't

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       have the same advantage and I want to just, or anyone being bullied, but I've see it, you know, at clubs that we do. And these are my home clubs and I love it. Coming up the last 10 years I've watched. Oh no, he's a good guy. And this guy cyst like systematically, like daily harasses women and all the guys like, no, he's cool. He's front, we're friends with him, you know, it's like you've seen the. I've seen that. I'm not gonna say names, but there are people who go out of their way to be horrific and I never see the guys around us and these are all contemporaries say anything because it's like now he's a good guy. He's our friend and women will dm me. Female comics will send me messages. This is happening to me. He said this to me, what do I do? And I'm like, Oh, you can do is be kind work on your jokes. Fuck that guy doesn't mean anything, but it is a thing.

Speaker 2:          00:54:13       Does mean something psychologically. If you have to go to the club and then you see that guy and if you see him right before you have a set.

Speaker 1:          00:54:18       Oh my God, yeah. Oh my God. I've had, you know, disagreements. I was nervous. This isn't you. When I, when you and I had the, the thing about your phone number, I was like, I don't want to run into Joe. I'm so afraid of Joe. And that's someone who's a friend of mine. You know, it's already such a weird thing to go to work, but the girls who were like, oh yeah, I, he told me I wasn't funny. He told me I was a slut. He told me this, he told me I was to x, Y, Z to this and just as if the guy owns the art form, when what breaks my heart is like real comics, like you are like Sebastian or like people that I or Mark Mayer and like guys that I look up to that I think are so brilliant, they don't have time to sit there and get in the head of some girl who's just trying to make 15 bucks. You know, it's not your emo. It's only loser.

Speaker 2:          00:55:03       Well, I always feel that we're all in the same boat together and that if you have a vagina and I have a penis, it doesn't. We're all comics. Like I think the really. I mean that's got. It sounds like even to be sincere sounds like such horseshit and this weird day and age because you feel like you're trying to cover up and try. I'm not those guys. Hey, I'm not that Harvey Weinstein Guy. I'm different. I'm going to come with me. Yeah, I'm a sweetie. We could sleep on the couch together. I wouldn't even bother me. But you know what I mean, like there's. But I think it's very important that all of us that work together, look, I could learn shit from comedy, but from you, I can learn shit from anybody. I mean, I've seen people do do standup. They've seen me do stand up. They do it different than me. We talk. You've got a different method than I do there. There might be something you see, it's always, we're all peers and we're pairs, but you, I feel like that with friends and I feel like that with peers in a field like that. Within it, you gotta you gotta be open and if you're not open you're going to miss stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       You're also very secure and I really do believe that insecurity, whether you're a woman hating another woman, whether you're a dude trying to like step to another guy, it all comes from insecurity. So when you're run the show with my buddies or you know, I've been doing it three years, I'm old the world, like you're told that you're, that you're owed more, right? Or concrete job. I should have more. It comes from this insecurity of if she gets something that I deserve and it comes from this place of you think you deserve something. Um, and that was a big thing for me after I did the show. The men that I had to tour with were horrific, like mental scars, indelible marks on my brain, horrific. Because there was this entitlement like how dare she take that, you know, how dare you, when the show, how dare you not roll over and die. But so I see that and I don't have to deal with it as much. Um, but I, my heart breaks because I wish that these girls five years later could look, could realize from like a bird's eye view when it's happening. I'm like, that guy's got nothing. Like if you really are going to be that mean to a fellow comic, you obviously hate

Speaker 2:          00:57:12       yourself so much, but you don't see that. Like I wouldn't see that if somebody hated me, even if there were a loser. When someone hates you, it sucks. No, no. Hate yourself. Hates them. Like if you're gonna have someone hates on you because they saw themselves as still. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:57:24       I had a guy when I started I was doing these like comedy contest and like Orange County, which were a total racket, but I don't even know the guy. I think he was another comic and he was like a middle aged dad and he would on a weekly basis write me hate email calling me names that I had never been called in my. I was like 23 or something. You were fucking bitch, like just railing on me and I didn't like someone jerking off very. You don't know how to handle that. No one I've ever even had a woman be that mean to me. And so I, I took it. I wrote back a couple times like what's your problem? And it was just, he was just a crazy person firing off at someone and a year later he wrote me an email to be like, I'm in Rehab now. I'm so sorry, I've got a wife, I've got kids, so you enter into this art form and into the city with the best of intentions, trying to keep your soul as clean as possible and you have no control over the crazy that's going to be in your path. You only have control over how you heal

Speaker 2:          00:58:20       I guess, and I think every comic is crazy in a certain way. There's just no way around it. If you're funny. I've never met a single funny one that wasn't fucking crazy. They're all crazy. It's just everyone's crazy as a different. Crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:58:33       Well here's the other side of it. So you get women and and my whole thing is like, you should be fired from your job for not being funny. Not because you didn't like fuck someone. Right. But I think some people take it a step further. They're like more for women and I'm like, no, no, no. Do the jokes be funny. You shouldn't get the gauges because you're a girl. You should get a chance and you should have a chance to prove yourself. And not everyone's standing in the way, but this like more women in comedy. Right? The jokes be fucking funny. I will. I will fight for you to get that chance, but I'm not going to hire you

Speaker 2:          00:59:04       a woman. The more women in comedy thing is like, I just want humans to be good at it. I want good, funny people and I think there are more women in comedy now than ever before. But I think there's more people in comedy now than ever before. So saturated. It's so saturated. But I think it's a good thing. There's a lot of. And there's a lot of support. Like one of the things that bothers me the most about any sort of weird shit that goes on with Comedians, whether it's boy, Girl Shit or anything else, is that there is a comradery that we share that is very unusual in a fairly competitive art form. Competitive in that I don't think it's as competitive anymore. And what I mean by this is that I don't think that the idea of like getting a sitcom or being the host of the tonight show or you know, these, these limited number of gigs that are available, I don't think that's where it's at anymore. I think there's more people like you that are doing netflix specials in me and we both do podcasts. Like that kind of thing I think is way more open to people and it's way easier for us to all to be supportive of each other and supportive of each other in the art form of standup. Like what's important in our world is don't steal. Don't be an asshole to your fellow comedian. Support each other and I'm going to be there for you if you're there. For me.

Speaker 1:          01:00:20       I think there's two things to that. I agree. I think it's also easier to be supportive when someone's undeniable. I think when you're first starting out and when you're kind of in the clubs and you're all kind of fighting for to figure out what you have when someone's genuinely funny man or a woman, I'm the first one to be like, yes, love that. Like I visibly fell over subash and when I bring them on stage and I'm sure he like, doesn't love it, but I'm like, he's the. And, and you are. I mean, this sounds like a, like I'm stroking your ego, but it's true. Like you single handedly, I think change the sort of landscape in the way that we consume comedy. Like you have this massive podcast. You guys don't know. We're in a studio that is at least 2 million square feet and there aren't stuffed animals everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:01:03       Like what ones were not teddy bears. And there's elk horns and there's an interactive dinosaur exhibit. Like it's huge. Um, he's like a monster drink fountain. It's crazy. But you know, having this podcast and then people see what's possible. So what's funny is you did this and you built this sort of podcast empire and there's other big ones too. But this is definitely one of the most consumed on the planet, so then it sort of opens up this new avenues and then you get all these other comics on do podcasts too and not everybody's equipped to do it and there is, I think a glory and being one of the originals because you kind of paved the way

Speaker 2:          01:01:37       and imitators fucked up a lot in the beginning and got better at it. And I was having a conversation with a good buddy of mine this morning about it and he was asking me about conversations. We were just talking about conversations about letting figure there's like an art form to letting people talk in a way that's easy to consume for the people that are listening.

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       We are very good listener and I think a lot of when I started my podcast I did it so I could work on my listening skills. I know you were. And that was so nice. Talk about support and you did not have to do that. Um, and I think, and I don't do a lot of podcasts, I begged to do yours. So it's not like you asked me and I was like, I'm busy Joe, but I don't do a lot of them because not every comic is a good listener or equipped.

Speaker 2:          01:02:17       Well, we were talking about before the show started about some interviews you've done,

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       you know, and there's, there's always going to beat it. It's like you got to want to talk to people. I like. I like talking to people like this is one of the reasons why podcast is a good fit for me is because I'm curious. You're very curious, very curious. I like talking to people. I want to. Like when I was saying like would I be a woman for a day? I want to know how the fuck your brain works. I know, I know you don't know how mine works and I know I don't know how your works. I'm fascinated and I think that we try to figure men and women try to figure out our interactions with each other through trial and error and when sexual harassment and sexual assault and stuff like this, what's coming out in the news with Harvey Weinstein and, and others. And even the Kevin Spacey stuff, what we're starting to see Kevin Spacey stuff not very applicable to what I'm talking about because it's men doing it to men, but the Harvey Weinstein thing is it's like here's someone who's not even trying to think about how women think.

Speaker 3:          01:03:17       Not only that, he was trying to think, how can I, how can I do this the most? He had like a network of people helping him exact that plan. This wasn't like, I'm drunk. Touch my Dick. This was my assistant's going to score it. You Lynn. I'm going to send spies to try to cover this up later. Like it's maniacal. Did you ever see that article from 1945 with a. What was that woman's name? I'll send it to you again. Jamie Loreano her. That was like, if this is Hollywood crazy, Jamie, I'm going to send it to you again. Put this up on the, on the big screen. You know, I got a better version of it where it's not cutoff. Hollywood is probably like, yeah, goodbye. Yeah, this is 1945 til she was complaining that people were trying to fuck her all the time and she couldn't get any work because they said she was cold.

Speaker 3:          01:04:00       She was like, in order to get work I have to like leave my husband, get rid of my kids and be just fuckable here. Does Irish film star Maureen O'hara, sorry. Today charge Hollywood producers and directors of calling her a cold potato without sex appeal tonight. Potato refuses to let them make love to her. Says the mere in New York correspondent. Can I read it in her Irish accent? I'm so upset with us that I'm ready to quit. Hollywood marine says it's gotten so bad. I hate to come to work in the morning. I'm helpless. A helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or tell them or let them, Paul me and have them spread the words around town that I'm not a woman, that I have a cold piece of marble statuary. Statuary could word.

Speaker 3:          01:04:45       I guess Hollywood won't consider me as anything except a cold hunka marble until I divorced my husband. My husband gave me baby away and take my name and photograph on all the newest papers. If that's Hollywood's idea of being a woman, I'm ready to quit. No crazy. How good my accident is. Yeah, it's very good, but 1945, but this is what I've always said about Hollywood and this is one of the real problems with the people that are involved in the business, not just in terms of like the way it's set up, but the problems for the person that's doing it. That's trying to be an actor, an actress. Here's

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       the problem. You have to get picked so because you have to get picked, you have to go into places like please like me and you're already fucking insecure, which is why you're an actress in the first place. The reason why you're an actor in the first place because you want an exorbitant amount of attention. You probably didn't get it when you were younger. There's something missing. People like Daniel Day Lewis or he's a different cat male. There's a few of those things out there, like there's a few of those. Especially Daniel Day Lewis. He's been working the last two years is a cobbler. Yeah, fucking shoes. He's my favorite. I love that. He's such a Weirdo. You know, and then when you watch him in some movies, you know, like there will be blood and you're like, oh, okay. This is like you're. You're not even really acting. You just become new people.

Speaker 2:          01:06:00       Yeah. Like is that he becomes the guy on the set all the time. He's the guy all day. I don't want to spend that much time outside of my body. I don't either. But the problem that I faced when I first came here was I got, first of all, I never wanted to act. I had zero intention. I wanted to be a comic, but then I started getting these development deals. I went on to auditions in my very first, my, my early days of being an actor. I got both shows. That's, that's. I got this show called hardball and then I got news radio. Those were the two first two auditions that I ever went on. I know I didn't, I just got lucky. I mean I got his fucking lucky as a person can get. Part of it was because I didn't want to do acting. I wasn't nervous about it and also I was coming from fighting. So was used to like really being nervous.

Speaker 2:          01:06:54       Yeah. So I could go in there like, Hey, what's up? How you guys doing? I was fine. I think it's, there's a kick in the nose. It's fine. Yeah. I'm not going to get a concussion and bleed out of my ears. This, but this environment where you're always wanting to get picked. That's why everybody out here is fucking left wing. It's not even there. They're really left lane. They have to be. You have to wear a pink pussy hat. You have to say, you know all the things that you need to say. You're, you're literally formulating an act and you bring that act into auditions. You bring that act onto the red carpet. That's why you're seeing these people like Harvey Weinstein who would donate to the Clinton campaign and do all this. What seemed to be like very left wing stuff. You know, and he was the darling of left wing, amy's Miramax, which is really kind of a progressive studio.

Speaker 2:          01:07:45       People will thought me, wow, this is just a house of sexual assault. Allegedly, you can be a total pervert and have good politics, bad politics, I don't think. But that's not a pervert, right? There's a difference between what he is in a perfect total psychopath predator. Um, and it's interesting too, because look, donald trump's a fucking. He's. These are the worst. That being said, we're going out and we're attacking people. There are people like, I don't speak to my parents. They voted for trump. And I'm like, cool. Well when they're dead you can, you can rethink

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       that. Those four years, you know, and we out actors, like he's a Republican. Like, what are you doing? Well, some of them revel in it, right? Like James Woods, he's hilarious. He's on twitter all day long fighting with liberals, but he also was not of the best moral ground. Here's something interesting on my book, there is a Weinstein logo. A, my book is the last one to be published on the back or it's in the, it's on the spine and what I've been likening to and I feel like the people and now it's a shit, like they got absorbed. Weinstein books was only two women. It wasn't like a huge company. I'd never met him or anything. I liken it to like when your grandpa comes back from World War Two and he brings back like a plate with a Nazi insignia on it. Like because they had, they made their own shit, like Nazis had like a whole home goods line. Um, and he brings that one thing back. That's what that book is like. One of the last ones.

Speaker 2:          01:09:10       MMM. With the wwe now they don't have them anymore. Well, look, before this had happened, anybody would've done a miramax movie. He was the guy, I mean the fucking movies that they put together. They put together some of the greatest movies of all time.

Speaker 1:          01:09:24       I think it's crazy. I think we're getting to a place now where we're realizing, oh yeah, for every everything. There was an upside down every the upside down world, there's a whole stranger thing. There's an underbelly to every. Every business you can think of, there is a CD, horrible side of it with horrible people and most of us choose to live in the light and thing. Things are good. Every industry has that and we're just at a place now where like we're kind of shaking it out and people are coming forward, but this has always existed and it's rampant in every business.

Speaker 2:          01:09:55       Don't you think? There's also, there's like there's systems, right, and system systems of power where someone gets to a position where they have this massive amount of power almost like royalty and what a guy like Harvey Harvey Weinstein was essentially like a royal in some ways, right? Like royalty, massive power, right? Massive money. Got All of these people terrified of him. This big booming figure, almost like a kingdom would cut your head off. Right? And when you have that kind of power, it's such an unrealistic position to be in that. I think it's human nature to exploit those unrealistic positions. That's why this Maureen O'hara articles fascinating to me because this has always been the case, these unrealistic positions where someone has to get chosen. There's one person who has a billion dollars and makes 100 movies a year and every people have to be chosen to be the chosen ones to be in those movies. So you have a whole ecosystem, right? And then you have people that are depending on that ecosystem for their own survival.

Speaker 1:          01:11:07       Nobody, even if they know something wants to say anything, it's like, well, I didn't know.

Speaker 2:          01:11:10       Well, you can't be the first one and then get fired and then you're fucked.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       Right? That's what they're thinking. You don't want to be the first one. That's the other thing. You don't want to be first, right? Because rose McGowan was talking about this stuff forever and they're like, whatever. She's crazy. Nobody wants, especially for women. Nobody wants to listen to that woman. And historically, you know, like Monica Lewinsky, her life got wrapped and she was a young woman with the most powerful man in the world and we love Bill Clinton and she gets called a whore. You know, so it was a paradigm shift where people are now speaking and in terms of like if you're talking about exalting one position and someone getting chosen, that's shifting to people are like, fuck it, I got a cell phone. I don't need your movie. I have 8 billion followers on instagram. You know, I'll just show my book. I'll just show my, but I'll just make a video about me eating pizza.

Speaker 3:          01:11:57       I'm relatable now and so everything is shifting. Everything shaking out. I don't think this is ever gonna go away because if you're the kind of guy that does that, that's just something you're going to think you're wrong. I think it's going away. I don't. I don't see how. I just don't think you can get away with it anymore. Well, it's for sure going to get watered down. There's always going to be some amount of influence. Powerful people have that are in a position where they're choosing people, but you're implying that if you are that kind of crazy where you're assaulting women, that you are choosing good over evil. You just do. If you're a predator, you pray on things, but he couldn't do that when he was 20 and he didn't have any money and nobody might've done it a different way. I think so he might've been.

Speaker 3:          01:12:41       It's just who he is. I think sometimes it's who you are. So this whole I went to rehab. I'm apologizing, I'm to, I'm going to listen. I'm so sorry. It's like it's who you are and you can maybe stop, but that. I do believe that that's. We like to think, oh, I'll just go home and reflect for a little bit. I love that they have a rehab that they all go to break for a week. Give me a break. We can fix you. Is it Canyon ranch? I don't know what it's called. It's not Kevin Spacey's there right now. They go for a week, but I will say, you know, absolute power corrupts absolutely. So Dave becky gave the whole gay, wrote a follow up letter to Lucy ks, which I thought was, it sounded very genuine and there is something to, you know, we have these levels that you exist on, you know, and you can't be aware.

Speaker 3:          01:13:26       I feel like I'm going to put my foot in my mouth, but you can't be aware of everything that's going on all the time. Some people think he was aware of it, but when you're dealing with these high level deals and you're at a certain dollar amount and you're flying high above everyone else, you genuinely might not know what's going on, but you almost have a responsibility when you are that powerful and someone tells you something about your client to like maybe take it seriously. If I go on a twitter rant, my manager calls, she's was like, you're acting like a maniac. Right? Okay. But let's, let's follow that up then. What, what does one do? I don't know. So if someone is a dave, becky, and you think that this woman might be telling the truth, and I don't know what Louis said today, Becky, but we know that Louis told Mark Marin ally as mark baron talked about it on his podcast and he said that he asked him, hey man, are you jerk it off girls?

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       He said, no, I'm not. It's just a rumor. It's bullshit. He goes, why don't you just talk about this rumor? And he goes, I can't, you can't do that because then it'll give it credence. Which I guess I kind of understand if it wasn't true, but I don't think I have an answer. Yeah, I don't have one either. I definitely don't. I don't want to seem like I'm going one side or the other. It's disgusting and it's horrible. But there's also, when you hear inklings of rumors, you hear like little things. Everybody always says like when their kid ends up killing a bunch of people that are like, I didn't know. And as the public were like, how could you not know he exhibited x, Y, and Z, you know, he did all this. He had a gun in his room. He decapitated rabbits. How could you not know?

Speaker 3:          01:14:50       Maybe sometimes we are too close to something and you don't want it to be true. Well, what about that Vegas shooter? Oh my God. Like that guy had nothing. He had no criminal background. No one had any idea. He gave his girlfriend $100,000. She thought he was breaking up with her and she thought he was giving her money. Right? He was just giving her money to get by and while he was going to murder 50 fucking people are 58 people and kill himself can apply rationale to an irrational thing where we don't know. Well, any sort of situation like that. School shooters. Did you see the um, most armed man in America piece that went out? No. Can you pull this up? There's a guy who the most godly man in Colorado, his last name is Bernstein. So as a Jew I was like, why are we profiling the one Jew that's a gun nut?

Speaker 3:          01:15:35       Great. Uh, he lives in America. Most are. Manny has like $3,000,000 worth of artillery. You've got to watch this. He has several shooting ranges. Shit burning, but wait, so his name Bernie is Bernie like Epstein or something. It's terrible. He's got tanks. He's got tanks. He's got blamed for growers. But first, yeah, until I do want to partner. You go in his house. Nope. Oh good. Three percent of Americans. According to a recent study, over 50 percent of guns, you probably fall into that group. Why do you think so few people have such a large concentration of weapons? You get addicted to them. You know, it gets you in your blood, but driving up my property now and uh, there's all kinds of warning signs. As you can see. If anybody comes on your property and threatens you with bodily harm, it's illegal to shoot from Colorado law.

Speaker 3:          01:16:24       They should have. Sounds like my dad is. This is one of the first signs I see. One guy was a registered democrat. It says he's got old cars laid out with dolls, manikins and bullet holes all over the car. The number you want to party with him, you'll see. Oh, do want to party with him? If, if you're going to listen, if we're going to, not a lot, just like one night I tell you what happens at the end or do you want to watch what happens? He dies. No one talks about. They're like, so your wife uh, died. Oh Jesus, he killed his wife. No, look at this. He's getting mannequins, mannequins, dressed up in women's clothing. He changes their underwear when it gets cold outside. Oh, Mel. And this guy is the most heavily armed men in America. Legally. You know, we've talked about machine guns and hot rods and Dino stuff highlights, I don't really care what you like.

Speaker 3:          01:17:14       So she never says nothing. Anyway. I'm real nice to them when it gets cold in the winter I put underwear. He's got a New York accent. Yeah, he's a Jewish guy from the bronx or something. Lives on a ranch in Colorado that's filled with bullets and guns and mannequins and he's got his own firewood. His wife died and an explosion, but the way he describes it, he was like, we were shooting the show. I think it was for like a and e and the last day some they were walking through smoke and one of the smoke canisters turn into like a rocket. It just went through her. Oh Jeez. He describes it as if I was describing what I had for lunch. He's like, I went through her and they canceled the show. Throw it all away. Not a tear. Nothing about the wife. She's just more like in the show's over.

Speaker 3:          01:17:56       It's crazy. Clip. Whoa. That guy's probably waiting for someone to trespass. Like he's like putting out chocolate and money, like on a string and these old too. So he's got like not much left. You know. How much time does he have left but about his girlfriends. He's got a girlfriend. The mannequins mean I can do. Would you want to meet him and interview him? Oh, how about a show on Netflix called Eliza interview psychopath. It's just all comics, you know, comics. She doesn't meet at the store. Just whoever watches this guy you with preppers. It would just be cut back to me. Just staring at him with my mouth open with his. All the soldiers and plastic than other video on another channel I've found just loves mannequins. Oh, this guy's so creepy. Maybe doesn't like people. And this is like how he sort of.

Speaker 3:          01:18:47       There's a lot of shit. Look at the size of his fucking house. This kind of rocket launchers. This guy's. Where's he getting the money for? All this stuff. Sells guns to. Oh, two. Who? I don't know. One by one of his guns. He can contribute to this. Uh, it's too late. Yeah. He was like, in the last couple of weeks we've sold more guns that we have the whole year. Well, here's the thing, if this guy dies, whereas all this fucking weaponry going, I just hope the state swoop in and in Colorado, Colorado is the wrong place to pull out a gun. Fucking everybody's armed. Everybody's armed and now everyone's high. You're paranoid to things. He's Got Samurai swords. Jesus Christ was like this fucking guy. Interesting character. Yeah. There's a lot of people out there like that in Texas. Texas is crazy. I grew up shooting, not all the time, but we would go.

Speaker 3:          01:19:41       My best friend's parents would do these, I'm sort of not reenactment shootings, but they would dress up in period costumes like late 19th century and we would go out to the country and they would have these little fake town set up and it was like timed event shootings and they all had names like boy named sue and they had like their cowboy names and you'd shoot and you'd win like an antique coin or something, but they would go and Mr Hewitt had all the rifles and the guns and shoot at a was like targets. Like I remember one was like just the sort of outline of like a fake saloon town kind of thing and it's time timed. You try to get your targets and we would just drink dr pepper and watched, but because I didn't and I've shot guns a couple of times, it doesn't do much for me so my thing.

Speaker 3:          01:20:28       But he had a lot of them don't even like hunting with them. Do you just. I feel like you are so masculine that you see an elk, you're like time me and you just run alongside it. Tackle it by the neck and you just punch it into submission. No, you can't even get close to them. No, they can't even know you're there early Joe. You can't. You can't tackle an elk. Okay, cool. We might be able to tackle like a calf. He's brand new baby. Cow Elk. You know. Do you want to do something crazy? A baby. Crazy. A pony is not a baby horse. It's not. Isn't that crazy? What's a baby horse? A Colt. The foal of full. What's a cult then a horse. Oh, Colt is like a full grown horse. So pony is like a type of horse. It's its own kind of horse.

Speaker 3:          01:21:13       Isn't that crazy? See, I always thought a pony. That's right. I should know that. I love telling people that fact. I should know that pony. Babyhood registers. You knew it. What is so a donkey? What's. What's the difference in a mule and a donkey? One the same as. No. One of them is a hybrid. A DM is a hybrid between a horse. A donkey is a horse and I'm. Nope, a mule, a mule and a donkey at the same thing. Well, one of them is a hybrid and it's non-viable. I know that. Do you mean non-viable? Meaning hybrid's. A lot of hybrids can't breed reduced when you breed a male donkey with a female horse. Okay. That's it. Notice the mayor. It's also an ugly type of shoe. A hiney meanwhile is a mules and ugly kind of shoe. For Women. It's like a slip on.

Speaker 3:          01:22:01       Put that up. It looks like enough with the folks who, by the way, so many of your fans who like live in rural areas are like, I can't believe these people don't know the difference in the idiots. It's just ugly fat one, but. But if you really hot you can pull that off. Guys, don't give a fuck. They don't get it. But like that's a. that's, that's a. That does seem like a satanic sort of a thing. Park goat. No, it's not even clothing. The reason why I know this is because we got mule. Come for fear factor. It's cheaper to make people drink meal. Come [inaudible]. Mule come doesn't really become anything. It's just, it's not good. How did you say that? On the show? Mule emissions sperm. Oh my God. We said sperm. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't my idea. That's what got the show canceled though. I'm one of the few people in show business that has a show canceled because we made people drink. Come. I think the only one maybe ever. I feel like there's a lot more than you think. Yeah, there's probably some behind the scenes stuff off camera. There's no way. They drank as much. Guarantee

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       that one minute meals on the video on youtube. Oh, Donkey Jews. Interesting. Well, yeah, that's it. That's what girls have to go through. Well, that was what's interesting. What they choose between come and urine yet a drink, like a vat of urine and a vat of a come and a lot of the girls chose to come over the urine because at least we. It's a similar beast. You've been there before. Oh my God. Yeah. I don't want to watch any day. Yeah. Amazing. I love her running eyeliner. That's how the show got canceled right there. Ladies and gentlemen, kill you now. No. Urine is nothing. Urine is just like. You can only drink your own urine. I think eight times. I love that she's got. It's like doing the acid, doing it more than eight times. You become insane. Is that true? No, no. Oh No.

Speaker 2:          01:24:01       It's a fact about drinking. You can only drink if you're stranded. You can only drink your urine a certain amount of times before it becomes toxic. Did you read about those two women that got up? They got stuck at sea for like five months with their dog eat the dog. They had like a year's supply of food on the boat so that apparently it's falling apart. The stories falling apart and now people don't even believe they were really stranded as long as they were like. Apparently people were suspicious right away because they were too well kept. Yeah, so and then now their story would have been reading and I should shouldn't really comment on it until I see if he could find out. I don't know how much of how much it's fallen apart because I was reading something about how it continues to fall apart.

Speaker 2:          01:24:47       The story continues with like they might've just pretended to be at sea for five months because you would eat that, that you would eat that dog also, like you might not if you have a year supply of food. Sure. Okay. Right. You can have those like Alex Jones supplies those fucking buckets at Jim Baker pushes. Have you ever seen that at the end time? Rescued? Stick with their story. You would say the same thing. I did. Well, there's an easy way to fact check this report. Did you leave like who's the last person you saw? I guess they're having some issues. There's some people that think it's bullshit. They claimed daily distress calls were unanswered and at one point tiger sharks bumped against the boat. Might be real. Well, you can fact check those distress calls. See if tiger sharks live in that area. They do. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:25:34       That's around Hawaii. That's where they were. That's one of the. One of the real problems with Hawaii is tiger sharks. Tiger sharks are one of the most aggressive of sharks and they get people all the time. I think second only to bull sharks. What does it say indicating that they had like an emergency beacon that if they would have activated it would have alerted this coast guard would have been found really fast, but they didn't, but they for some reason didn't, didn't know about it necessarily. There was no storms recorded on satellite images that have, I guess supposedly

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       also what they said caused their disappearance. Eliza looks to stick up for girls though and host that. I have not read this story. I'm just looking at, you know what I was honestly thinking. No, I was just like, of course the two lesbians have like a giant dog. I'm assuming one of them is like 46. One of them is 25, so I think they're probably lesbians who knows, but like that's such a lesbian, like he's a pit mix, but we love him. Yeah. Because like the big disparity in age, that's like the difference between like a guy with a yacht and it's hot girlfriend. Who knows? Maybe she's, she's her instructor. You know what I love most about lesbian couples? There's almost always like a male and a female. Yeah. Sometimes. Yeah. Sometimes. Well, a lot of the time my best friend and her wife said, obviously they're married and so your best friends, lesbian, lesbian, you were so diverse, but she, we've noticed everything.

Speaker 3:          01:26:58       We are three and so she is, she was a lesbian when she was three. She gave us like the quarterback in high school. That's probably ruined her. I think she kind of just figured it out. I mean he was a psychopath, but um, so they're married and they want to have a baby. And Michelle, sorry, Michelle. Uh, you keep her name up. We're both Jewish, white. She's half my body weight. She's the tiniest and kind of sickly. She has like plantar fasciitis. She's got her own issues, right? So she wants to carry the baby and her wife is American, but Dominican and like strong. She's like, but I want to carry the baby. I'm like, no, no, no, no. Our people have like Tay Sachs and, and uh, then, uh, like just diseases like pass the sec. It's like a Jewish thing. It's like a genetic mutation that only Jewish babies get.

Speaker 3:          01:27:45       But the point is Jews have to deal with that. I'm like, her people are given birth left and right and going back to work the same day. They don't carry the baby and I'm like trying to encourage her. I'm like, let let the other one do it. She's like, no, I just want to. I want to go through it because she's the. I guess if you had to pick one who's the boy, but Michelle wants to do and I'm like, you're going to get snapped and how you're going to fit yourself and you're going to just be a puddle of Jewish skin and bones. Let the other one do it. Are you going to have babies? I thinking about that, so I'm getting married in May and then I was talking to your boyfriend's a very nice guy, fiance. He loves you. He loves coming to the store.

Speaker 3:          01:28:21       He's a good dude. He's a good guy. And I was just like, I guess I was like, we'll get married, we'll go on a honeymoon. I was like, I guess we have those happy when you got them. So it was like finally one good one. This one's going to stick. I get rid of him, the Yale story in that one. That was. That was so it was like three years ago. It was quite awhile ago. That was a great story though when you brought him around. I'm like, well, I don't want to be too friendly with them. You know? It's like war. Yeah, the new guy might get shot, but then after a couple months it was like, hey, you're still here. What's up man? And then we became more and more friendly. You're like, I don't want to be cool to this guy. She might get rid of them.

Speaker 3:          01:28:54       Every time I see him a hug him. He loves you. He loves seeing it. Loves watching all the company. He's a fan of comedy anyway. Not in a weird way, but like he listened to your podcast. I think it's cool for him and he's super supportive, but I was like, I guess we just have a baby. Like I guess you do that viable. I don't know. Many more years. Got kind of a quick, I don't know, checking my stat card. Did you get an. I don't have. I only have one. Your eggs, you cook them. I have one big egg. One giant one like an ostrich. I keep it in the back of yourself. A little gladiator baby. Like some strong man baby. I've always wanted that. Do you think you'll have a boy or a girl? Do you have a feeling? Can I say this? So I didn't know his job when I was 18 and which is tiny.

Speaker 3:          01:29:35       That's why your nose is so tiny. Would you knows you still look like a little bit of a bump. It was their worst things didn't shrink your nostril holes? No, I always had small nostril hold down. So you just got rid of the bump. The bump. It's. I talk about in the book, it's not like a huge revelation. I'm Jewish, like we do this, but he's half Italian, half Jewish and he's got a big nose and I remember looking at it the other day and I was like, our kid had better be fucking brilliant or amazing at sports because if a girl has a combination of our noses, it's over for her. So fingers crossed that she gets someone else's knows, maybe by the time you guys decided to have babies, crispr will be totally dialed in, get a nice little Christie Brinkley knows. I don't know, maybe we'll have.

Speaker 3:          01:30:19       It'll be an APP at that point. Or if it's a dude, a big nose just gives you like character. Big Nose for dude is fine and I'm praying because he's very tall. If it's a girl, maybe she's just a brilliant athlete and then it's like, who cares? Right. But it's probably not gonna happen. Probably just be kind of funny. And who knows, who knows. That's the interesting thing about having children that I've found is that they come out of the box, their own little mind, their own little personality. You just kind of nurture that personality along the way. But you know, my two youngest daughters could not be different. They're so similar to each other. They're there so dissimilar rather to each other. Yeah. That happens. My brother and I are, I don't know where he's from, the planet Zap Guitar and we just, uh, I don't know, it's just the way it would just be.

Speaker 3:          01:31:05       It's a weird combination of like we're talking about nurture and nature and do you, but see the thing is about a woman having a baby go on. Is that you, especially as a comic, it would be much more difficult for you to do the road? I think. I think, I don't know anything about it. I don't know, you know, I know that I work out a lot and so obviously the more mobile and healthy you are, it's easier, you know, there's a couple of months where you can't, but there's also a couple of months of the year where I don't do the road anyway. Like I think I could tailor the schedule around it and we certainly could because you're successful because you make enough money to hire help and hire people to help you when you travel. Oh my God, absolutely. I don't know. But your whole life changed. I think about that a lot. Uh, you know, it's at night, it's 10:00. I'm like, let's go grab dinner. Don't do that, do that. So I don't know, I guess that's like the next step, but you just adjust.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       Your life becomes so much, it becomes very strange, like hanging out with your own kids is. It's, it's very odd because the love that you feel for them is so intense and so weird. Yeah. It's like this warm, cuddly love, but it's also like while you're doing it, you're, you're, you're cuddling with your kid, you know, talking with them and while you're talking with them, for me at least, I'm like, I can't even believe you're real. You can't even believe this is a daughter. Like I have a daughter for forever. Yeah. And we're talking and she's like, well, what do you think about that? I'm like, no, what do you think about that? And we're having a little calmer.

Speaker 1:          01:32:39       You're worried that they're thinking at all. You're like, you were just a puddle of mush. So I don't know, but I'm open to. I think a big problem in our society is that we expect women, like you've got to have this career, have this body, have this family, but why do we do that? We do that because it's always been that way. Who is we in this group? Right? But how many people do that? How many people do expect you to have all these things? I think it's a projection, but obviously when you get down to it, nobody cares what you actually do. But it's what's put out there as what looks like happiness and I even talk about this because I never, I'm not trying to pretend like what I'm saying is something I'm thinking about right now. I've thought about it. I wrote about it.

Speaker 1:          01:33:15       It, you do have to do this digging to be like, what does my happiness actually look like? And it might not be the cookie cutter image that is kind of put on all of us. Like I have a very weird job, but if I couldn't do this job I would, I would be the saddest person. Like standup comedy gives me the most joy and uh, that is a huge. I'm in a relationship with that and I have to factor everything sort of around it. Yeah. Until I have a kid. And then who knows? You don't have one.

Speaker 2:          01:33:44       It does change. I mean, I hate to say Louis C, k game. He created place once came to having a kid, which is very odd. What he said. Let it change you and I don't know Louis very well. I should say this too because people, somebody, somebody was giving me a hard time about not commenting on it. No. My, my thought was like, first of all I want to gather my thoughts. Absolutely. And second of all, I don't know him that well. I don't even have his phone number. I've never had a phone call conversations with him. I bet we've exchanged emails maybe three times ever and he and I have run into each other at clubs and said hi, we've never gone out and hung out together. I'm not good friends with them. So when all this was going down, it's not like I had information. Like if Joey Diaz did something fucked up and people wanted me to comment, first of all, I would never say anything bad no matter what joy diaz did. Sorry. That's just the way it is. If there's just no way around. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:34:39       If you knew he raped someone, this is horrible.

Speaker 2:          01:34:41       Alright, so sorry that he did that, but when, you know, I mean I, I would never, I would never throw them under the bus,

Speaker 1:          01:34:51       you know what I'm saying? There's bus throwing and then there's bus throwing, there's a comment after sort of condemning, condemning it and then there was of course like there was a guy who was in that movie baby driver, um, and he asked us, no, it was like at the 48th lead or something and he went on some show and just went off about Kevin and so everyone's like, it was like, it looked like a way to get attention. Like yeah, when I was on set he didn't seem that cool and it was so much in retrospect, but he's not the guy that's on the walking dead, the punisher guy. I don't know, isn't that him? I just saw that. Yeah, I think it's that guy who's pretty successful. He's, he's the new punisher in that Netflix just seemed very like bandwagon jumping. When the Louis C K thing happened. I can speak from a perspective of a woman who's seen this kind of stuff. I don't know. I brought him up twice at the store. That's my knowledge of him. But you get these emails from like the New York Times or like, Hey, if you have anything you want to say or if you know any other things, I'm like, I don't and I don't want to attach myself. I don't want to be like, I didn't want to be part of that story just for the sake of it. Because then you look like a fame whore.

Speaker 2:          01:35:54       Well that's also the problem. Like you get caught up in something where you become inexorably connected to this awful event and you didn't do anything.

Speaker 1:          01:36:04       Sure. Yeah. So Joey didn't do anything. It was just like, not joey, Joey, but oddly enough, it's crazy as joey is, he's a very gentle person. He's a giant. He's Puerto Rican. He's Cuban. Sorry. Giant Cuban teddy bear. He is because he seems so tough and he loves St Cox Soccer, but he is just, he's like, he's just so kind and he's got these eyes like a whale, like they're just ancient and big, like the camel eyelashes. He's got these lovely I and you and he smiles at you like a toddler. I love him. He's the best.

Speaker 2:          01:36:39       I exchanged emails with him maybe once every three or four years. We've texted each other maybe 10 times ever for all only phone calls. Calls me every couple of days. What's up cock sucker. What are you doing, brother? What's going on? Is He wants to talk to you. Joey wants to talk to you. If I ever ever text him is because I have to send an address to him. You know, he's got to like put it in his navigation system. That's it. He, he calls you. He lovely. Yeah. He's, he's a beautiful person and you know, he, he and I were talking about this whole Louis, c, k thing and he was like, you know, he goes, you know what's fucking crazy? He was like, I held somebody at gunpoint. He goes, he goes, fuck fucking kidnapping. And everybody's like, ah, you were crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:37:25       But it goes like, this is the kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          01:37:28       This is the kind of thing that sticks because he did it to one of us. Right? Like if you in our world like we are all the same, we're all the same thing. I mean there's gonna be some weird pettiness and bullshit and there's gonna be some prejudices and it's going to be some individuals that are supportive, but overall amongst the good eggs amongst the ones that you and I associate with, we are all. We all consider each other same thing.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       Good. We are, we understand each other's hearts and we know how hard it is and what it's like. And we all know that it's us. Even though the audiences are friends, it's US versus them. It's the club versus you know, you're trying to do a job and we know exactly what this very weird job entails and we know the way the other person thinks like we have fucked up thoughts and it's okay to admit these thoughts to each other and it's a very special bond and you can't just be like, I'm a comic. I get it. Like you have to kind of earn it and there's a respect there. And so it's what he did as deplorable and it was with other comics and I feel bad because I feel bad because everybody gets so angry at women, they're like, why now? And I'm like, because there's safety in numbers and no one would listen before. But people knew, they knew. Some people knew. They knew to a degree. Like I knew I knew the girls names, but I didn't know if it was true. It was a rumor you don't know and you don't want to be the one that's running out there like with a lit torch and you're wrong.

Speaker 2:          01:38:53       It's going to sound fucked up, but I'm going to take a chance with it anyway. You Ready? Have you put yourself? Like I put myself in Harvey Weinstein's brain. Not Really, but I sat down and I tried to think like, what, what, what would this guy like? How would his brain work? Because he just like, like lost in the throes of the addiction of power and sex in this chase of getting all these superstars to suck his dick. Which is apparently what a lot of them did. I mean I've talked to women that know people in the business and it was like negotiating tactic, like yeah, he would give them roles if they did and he always followed up. He always honored his word was wondering about that. Yeah. I was wondering like how do you ensure someone gives you the part? I don't know. I mean he had a reputation for doing it, you know, the, the, the contract thing that he had you, his contract with, with Miramax, with the Weinstein group.

Speaker 1:          01:39:48       Oh, it was like a sexual harassment. Like a clause. Yeah, covering up too.

Speaker 2:          01:39:52       But they had it like in tears, like one would be worth two fifths because they knew it was fucking crazy. They knew. I mean that is. If that's not complicit then what is. But have you done, have you tried to put yourself in the Louis Ck is brain?

Speaker 1:          01:40:10       Yes and no because I definitely have had this thought. I think when you get to a certain level, and I see there's, this wasn't at that level then this is the thing. We did a poll and it was a long time ago. Let me find, forget the level I've found with a lot of male comics. There is a certain like a lot of perverts, whatever. There's a certain set of blinders, like I can do whatever I want. There's almost like a lack of accountability. You show up drunk or high or fucked up and they're like, oh, he's so creative. It's a certain allowance we give to men and then people when they get famous, you can do whatever you want. I, I pride myself. I'm always on time. I don't show up anywhere drunk like I just take it a little bit more seriously because I know I have to work a little bit harder whether being a girl helps or not at times.

Speaker 1:          01:40:55       It just depends on the day. I do think that there's a lack of awareness about other people and I do think at a certain level there is a mindset of like, because I've seen this in lower tiered comics, she doesn't matter what I say to you when I call you a bitch or a piece of shit or I harass you, you don't matter because you're not gonna make it. You're not going to make it. You don't matter. And I do. I've seen this. I'm not going to go into names. I've heard things that other women will confide in me that men say to them. I remember starting at the store, things that were said to me by men who probably don't remember. They said it cause there's like a cavalier. Just I'll just say fucking whatever I hurt. I want her to hurt. Fuck you. You're a bitch.

Speaker 1:          01:41:39       You're body's discussing. You don't matter. Your body is disgusting. That's the. That's the weird one, right? Like I hurt. So I want her to hurt. There's a comic at the store. All the guys are friends with all of them. Me, I don't know. Maybe he's not there a ton anymore. It was definitely. He was definitely like a fixture there in the early years when I was there, I, we were at another comic's house for a party. I was standing there and he walked up to me. I hadn't said a word. He said something rude to a girlfriend of mine because he was hitting on her and that didn't go well and he just looked at me and he went, you better keep working out because your body's not going to be like that forever. And I was like, hi. And the only other thing he ever said to me was like 10 years later he yelled at me because I brought my dog to the store, but it was body does look like though forever, but also like stupid things stupid and it's so.

Speaker 1:          01:42:27       It's meant to for me to be like, why did you say that we should go fuck, that will help. And it did not have. Does that work? It must work on the most deprived girls and he just picked the wrong one, but it of course, but that doesn't. Does that work on the girls with the lowest self esteem? Does that ever work? It must. It must. Or they might think it works or are you engaging? Then it turns out, oh, he's a nice guy. I don't know, maybe it's like one of those, hey, you should smile. Look, it never works, but it's been nice. I think it's more of like, I don't know how to talk. So you start with that and then the girls like, I was smiling and he's like, oh cool. And it's just like an opening for someone who's not as articulate, awkward opening from.

Speaker 1:          01:43:07       I was, I'm not going to say the state, so we'll just say it was California, but it wasn't. I was, I was headlining a club. Um, so as years and years and years ago, because the club is not that great. And there was a guy who was opening for me and it's weird. My power dynamic is different because I'm the headliner, I've never told a guy he has to like sleep with me to get a gig or something like that. And I went, oh my, just like licking my purse and left and right. My box, I'm okay. I did it once. Okay. So he was the opener and he was like, oh, can I show you around? Which as the opener behooves you like to be nice to the headliner. Like if I like you, I have plenty of friends that I just take with me because they were cool. Um, so we like hung out.

Speaker 1:          01:43:50       We got, we just say, show me around his shitty city. And then on that Saturday night I had a friend in town, it was like a guy and I left with them. We all went to a bar and I left with the guy that I was friends with and this comic lost his shit. Started sending me texts, like, how could you, I spent all this time with you, do you know who I am? Like just losing it. And I'm like, and I left. I was out of the city, I was going somewhere else and he's harassing me and I contacted a friend of ours was a mutual friend and I was like, you better check your boy. Like, what is his problem? He's like, no, he's a good guy. He's my friend, like, did nothing to defend me and this guy's just like spewing this vitriolic garbage.

Speaker 1:          01:44:28       Actually I think sober, but you could be right. I don't know. And the other day I was at the Improv and this piece of shit was the host and I was like closing the show out and I hadn't seen him in years and I wasn't about to give him the satisfaction or anything and I go on and he bought, he died a thousand deaths and I was just sitting there watching and I know that he knew that I was there and he knew what he had done. So they felt like shit. I felt like shit. And then he was onstage. I'm not, I can't tell the restaurant that I know no matter, but he left his phone on stage and I made him come back up and get it. I was like, Hey, he was calling himself like he had like a cool nickname for himself. I called him back and he had to like, come get his phone and then I fucking wrecked it. But it was more like, you thought I was nobody you thought you could treat me like that. But why did he think that if he was the opening act, because he probably thought I didn't deserve it or he's a crazy person or because I was in his city, but I'd never seen behavior like that exhibited by someone who was opening for me. But it was just like

Speaker 2:          01:45:28       male female shit that's like he was courting you. He thought that he got mad that I left with someone else. He thought that you and him were hanging out and that you liked him and it was eventually going to lead to him banging the chicken. One last comic standing. I just want to be

Speaker 1:          01:45:43       before ever had right after it. Yeah. No, I would have been after a and I'm sure that if you were heading, it was after for sure, but I'm sure that girls like I've heard, you know, male friends of mine, like you, I fuck all my openers, you know like guys do that. I've never had the luxury. Sounds like a bad practice. Seems like a super gross practice. But I think a lot of guys do. It just doesn't seem smart.

Speaker 2:          01:46:04       I always tell guys to not. Well, I should never say don't fuck other comedians because like Tom Seger and Christina [inaudible], they're great. That worked out. That worked out like Moshe Kasher, Natasha Leggiero that worked out.

Speaker 1:          01:46:16       I think it either works out splendidly or is a nightmare. Right? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:46:22       Yeah. Well, one thing would be that the person would understand what you do because very few people do. I think, and I would think as a girl, it's got to be hard when you're the funny one, like if you're the funny one and you're dating a guy and maybe they. Well you're see, that's the thing is your fiance is so chill. Like

Speaker 1:          01:46:42       he's so funny too, but he doesn't need. He doesn't need any attention. That's the, that's the dynamic. There is one of, you know, and I don't really seek it out outside of Sannup I'm not. When you get it all out. Yeah. Get it out of your system and I don't want to be greedy about it and sometimes you don't know, you know, you don't know. You start dating someone, then you realize, oh, they can't handle this other gels, but it takes a minute. And with comics it's interesting. You rarely see a super successful female comic with like a guy that's like middling at the chuckle bucket.

Speaker 2:          01:47:12       Never, never. Can you think of one? I don't know any of them. I don't know any like headliners that fuck their opening acts that are girls now and I mean maybe they do. Maybe it's cool if they do a cool. That's cool. I think that fence. Yeah, let them know. Flip the script. Yeah. Like just get back to the business of comedy. What was it like headlining after three years because I did a little bit of that, but I had um, I had a manager who was like a really good. When I got my manager when I was about three years in and I headlined a bunch of places where I really did not deserve what. He got me a bunch of gigs and I. But I didn't have any pressure on me the way you did winning last comic standing. I was just sort of just starting out.

Speaker 1:          01:48:03       So you go on this tour right after the last comic standing I think, Oh my God, I could've been doing that much time because there was like four of us. So I just close it out. Um, how much time you think you're doing? I want to say 15, 20, you know? And so you finished that and it's interesting because you, when something like that and it's like, okay, figure it out now. Right. Sink or swim. And some people sang, some people swim after winning that show. Most. Sorry. Most sank. And I, that being said, you get some of these guys already had careers like John have fron was alonzo boat and like they're good and they were fine and they do fine as both those guys. I just kind of scraped together what you have. Even on the tour, I don't know if I was always the best one of the night, but people are still there to see you or their favorite one.

Speaker 1:          01:48:49       So you're just coming from this sort of scared. But also you have confidence but also humble place of like, I hope that I can stretch this. It's enough. And so you have about 45 minutes, at least I did when you were done, when a, when you're ready to headline. And I think that's a lot of the energy that I put toward it was like, I'm just going to talk really, really fast that way if you don't laugh, doesn't matter. You don't know you didn't like because I got another joke right here and that has sort of become a style for now. Now it's not about a fear, it's more of I'm so excited to talk. We did. Me and some other comics did this Ray Romano charity event a couple of weeks ago and Mark Marin was on it with me and we went downstairs to watch ray to Kinda hear what the crowd sounded like. And so he was doing well and mark turns to me, this is the funniest thing ever. And he goes, they're fine. I go, yeah, they're good. He goes, you'll be fine. I go, yeah. He goes, just do what you always do. Steam roll over the crowd. Don't wait for applause, dear voices and get off stage. And I almost cried from laughing because it was like no one ever breaks my balls like that.

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       And it's true. I do that. And that's from that competitive situation, like that sort of energy. Well you have the hard hard ass exterior so I don't think a lot of people take a chance on breaking your balls, which is a shame because I think it's like the best way to show that you love someone and it's the best way to know that somebody loves you is if they do that, you can tell the intention that shield also keeps you from getting harassed by creeps to. They don't believe they can get away with it maybe. And that's fine. I think so for sure. Right. I mean, I'm sure you've been harassed, but I think if you were more vulnerable, you've probably been harassed more. Maybe. I don't know. I mean you try not to give people a chance. You know, you're at a meet and greet after you're seeing your fans.

Speaker 3:          01:50:35       And especially after I was talking about with other comics. But yeah, after for sure. Oh, with other comics, I think with other comics, I know you win the show three years in and then you're at a certain level of kind of a level. All by myself, I didn't have a lot of other women I related to because no one else was out there that I didn't know any other women you're kinda lonely out there. Um, and so I would look up to people like you and I consider myself a colleague of yours now, but at the time I was just like, what, how do I, you're so much higher than me, you know? Um, and I didn't know you. I didn't know any of these guys. So it's just, I dunno, I don't think any of the comics would step to me because they were, you not around comics a lot.

Speaker 3:          01:51:14       I don't remember when we met. I think I knew we knew each other. Like it took time. I was always at the store, but I mean I think it was just, I think you were around though in the days that I wasn't at the store level. What year did you win last comic standing? Two thousand eight. Yeah. See I wasn't there then. Yeah, you weren't there, but obviously everyone knew who you were. It's weird. I was talking to Steve Simone about this. There are people, you know your whole career, but you may not start talking to them until recently and then it's as if you were always friends. So now I consider myself like an upperclassman there. I'm also, I really tried to just be kind to the other comics door guys, younger comics I've always given and you're like this too. It gives someone the time of day if you're going to be respectful and nice.

Speaker 3:          01:51:58       I have no problem giving it back. You know a lot of those door guys, like guys who started out as door guys, Duncan and Ra are two of my best friends. They were both door guys. It's a lot of people started as door guys. Jessica Wellington was the only girl and I have her come feature for me. She did my show last night. That's the kind of girl that needs a chance because she is like in a boy's club within a boys club because I work with men. She's a door guy, she's a girl, so it's all dudes and she's at a store at the store. Um, and I was like, someone needs to be nice to this girl, a fucking shitty job. It's tough, but you're around comedy all the time. I mean, you're, you're at the world series of comedy on a daily basis. I mean, imagine you're a cover booth person, you get a chance to sit there and watch some of the best shows. Holy Shit, Dave Chappelle

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       just showed up. Holy Fuck. And you're sitting there from that cover booth watching Dave Chappelle and he brings most def on stage with them or something like that. That shit happens there all the time. Oh my God. He's bringing up Chris Rock. Your fucking head's ready to explode. And I mean there's a, there's a reality of work in there that doesn't exist anywhere else to go over the laugh factory, you know, you ain't getting that fucking reality.

Speaker 1:          01:53:09       Ucla standup comic showcase night. Cool. That place can burn. I get very protective. I told you what you know, you know why I say that, right? You know about this right now. There's a bunch of Shit I could tell you things to van. From there I am banned from the laugh factory, a club that I've been a regular at forever. I've told you the story. I won't repeat it if I told them to you. Boy, you told it to me, but it's fine. I started going there under the idea that I should support the club because I don't want it to go under and then I don't want it to go under it. That's so sad. Why I found out they record all your sets. Uh, I will say that I get, you know, the store is. I always say that the comedy store, the or in particular is like an abusive boyfriend. Like you're like, this hurts. Oh my God. And then when you don't go for a while, you're like, I need you. I need. It's like Stockholm Syndrome training. It's like doing a set with a giant weight vest on. It's like swinging two bats

Speaker 2:          01:54:07       times. It's great if you can, if you can compete or hang rather in that environment you can go anywhere else you'd be killing.

Speaker 1:          01:54:16       It's so true. And you know, you get comics that kind of get the vibe of the store from a couple of years ago when it wasn't the friendliest place and it has that reputation. But I take great solace in knowing that like my home is an intimidating environment and I love whatever space I've carved out there and I don't take it for granted and I try to respect the shows and respect the audience and you know, I'm so proud to be a store comic. It's not the kindness of lovers all the time. It's not always the most supportive, but I'm very proud of that upbringing because that's, that storm made me the comic that I am, that our, you know, um, the main room where it's all Swedish tourist and you're like, he does not want me to talk and it just makes you so you can go anywhere in comic shit on it.

Speaker 1:          01:54:58       And I'm like, you just sound jealous because you can't hang shits on the stove all the time. I didn't say that. It's just a regular comics you did. It's just they don't like it. It's because they don't like bombing. But anybody who makes fun of something that you're afraid of. Yeah. Well then there's things to make fun of just because they saw bombing there feels so good though. Like it's like pushing into a bruise. You're like, yes, I need this. Oh, interesting. Well you've got a good attitude about it. I still did the Improv. I'm doing the improv tonight. Yeah. And is cool. The store's got it. So there's something about it though. Yeah, there's a grittiness to it. I'm very proud of it. And the Improv's never been anything but lovely to me. It was the first club I got past that. It's still great club and the Comedy Union. Fucking stupid piano off the stage. Oh my God. And they see behind

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       it, behind the fucking pain. I apologize to those people. Every time I'm like, I someone send them a drink because you can only see my feet and what have you have to do something physical and you're doing it behind the piano. So for the one time Owen Benjamin drops in. We have a whole piano. Exactly. That's what I told Owen. I said, you need to bring your own fucking piano. You and Craig Robinson bring a keyboard, asshole. What the fuck? It's just like one of those old school things that nobody ever got rid of. I think. I mean, there's a lot of things to talk to them into it. You think that was luck? That would change the world. What do to send the email to make the club way better? I know people. I got some email addresses I could send you love talking about this offline.

Speaker 3:          01:56:18       We're going to talk about a bunch of things offline. I will. I need to remember all the different people that said fucked up things to you that you don't want to say. Have a name on the tip of my tongue. I'm going to say it the second way. Turn it off. I can't wait. Let's wrap it up now. So your book, let's we can wrap it up now. I'm a [inaudible] girl. Logic avail. Available right now. Probably the last Harvey Weinstein approved book ever. Yeah, right. I wrote you something on this. You. Yeah. I won't read it though. It's very small. I don't want to be A. I don't want to tear up. Please buy my book to go buy her book. You fucks and go see her on tour. She's very funny. And where are you at? Where can people get your tour dates and nonstop.

Speaker 3:          01:56:55       So go to [inaudible] dot com and we just announced my fourth netflix special is going to be on the USS Hornet off the coast of San Francisco. In the bay. You're going to stand up special on a boat on a aircraft carrier. Holy Shit. Well you announced it today. That's bad ass. Have you ever done it before? Have you ever performed on an aircraft carrier? I did on the SS dentists in the Persian Gulf on a Uso tour. So Holy Shit, I stole the idea. That's a great idea to do a special there. Whoa. You're going to wear the red, white and Blue Bikini.
