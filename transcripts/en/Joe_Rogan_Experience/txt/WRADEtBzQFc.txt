Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches when all that shit went down with Chris Kyle in the car and when he said that he punched you in a bar and get you sued the family like, no, I didn't. Well, I didn't choose. The family sued him rather. Excuse me. I shooed him and he died and then the shoot automatically goes to his estate. That's the way the legal works. She was never in any jeopardy because in any writers contract you have insurance from the publisher, so it's me. They portrayed and I became the villain going after the widow and the kids. Exactly. That's the biggest lie. It was a big insurance company that's covering the whole thing. They're not out a panty and they won't be out a panel. You had to explain that I'm sure over and over. No, I couldn't explain it, but the tie, the trial got overturned because the insurance came out, so it's okay to lie in court, but if the truth comes out, you can get a new trial.

Speaker 1:          00:56          The insurance came out. What does that mean in court? You're not allowed to say that insurance is paying for everything, even though it's the truth. You're not allowed to say that in court. So what happens when you say it in court? Well, it came out and the judge allowed it to eliminate it degree and then the appeals court ruled that the judge shouldn't have did that because having the judge say that it sways people. So they think that a fine tool against the insurance companies because insurance companies a big, even though the other side is doing what's called poor mouth thing, they're getting up and saying it's taxing them financially and lying insurance is paying for all of it. Don't get up and lie about it. So the other side was saying this is going to devastate our family reality. Oh yeah. Trying to influence the.

Speaker 1:          01:44          And in this case, let me state this. How overwhelming must be evidence of Ben for the jury to go against the grieving widow of the dead war veteran. Yeah. It must be pretty overwhelming. Evidence was overwhelming. The, the, the jury went from. They came for me. They said he was lied. This didn't happen and we're awarding. Well, why do you think he did that? Did you know him? No. You didn't know him? No, I mean I didn't know even how he was. Thing happened. We were there on the same nights we were at [inaudible] because I was there for a graduation of class 2:58 AM, class 58. It's traditionally every hundred classes. If you can you come back to the graduation. So class 2:58 was graduating the next day on Friday I came out along with my teammates from class 58 to attend that graduation the next day. So why would I say bad things about the seals if I'm there?

Speaker 1:          02:48          That's what he said he punched me for will tell because people don't know what we're talking about because probably a lot of people listening to this have no idea what we're talking about. So let me just fill my real quick. All right. The, the book American sniper. The movie with Bradley Cooper was just giant hit movie, very patriotic movie about a guy who was one of the most successful snipers in US history. Right? A very successful warrior, navy seal, war hero. Everybody loved him. Then he goes on the opiod, Anthony Show and he says that he punched you out. You know there's a chapter in his book. Yes. Where he writes that he called me scruff face. Yeah. And you said that I said scheels deserved to die. That in other words, she accused me of treason. Yes. And I was out there for a seal graduation.

Speaker 1:          03:37          If I felt that way about my old unit, why would I be attending? So he wrote in the book, He gave you a nickname in the book, scruff, face, whoever. I mean he might not have. Even when he wrote it in the book, he might not have even thought that he was going to give that to you. I mean, who knows what was going on. My thought was at the time I was trying to wrap my head around why anybody would do this. Um, and I was thinking, well maybe he's just trying to generate as much controversy as possible to generate as much income as possible from his book. And it just got out of hand. I don't, I mean, I'm sure I was trying to put it together because there was a couple of other fabrications, right? There was a, um, a shooting at a gas station that never took place.

Speaker 1:          04:15          And he said that he, during Katrina he was on the people who were looting. Yeah. That was disturbing because that's murder. Yeah. And he also lied about his medals. The navy had to come out and. Correct. He said he had two silver stars and five bronze stars. He had won silver star and three bronze stars. So he lied about three medals. Well, that's a good one. In three is impressive enough. Exactly. Exactly. And then they try to give them an excuse saying, well, he was confused. No, you're not. When you get a medal like that, it's like graduating from college. They give you a certificate that puts on your wall if you win the bronze star, the silver star, but as a, as an seal yourself. And he threw me under the bus. What does that feel like to you? But this is obviously, this is something that's very near and dear to your heart who hugely.

Speaker 1:          05:08          He has made it to where I can't go to a reunion anymore. There were 170 seals that wanted me kicked out of the Udt Seal Association over his lie and the lives of his buddies who came up and tried to testify for them so it got embarrassing. His trial said that it actually happened. No, they couldn't say it, but they tried to say everything else to make it seem like it did well. How the hell they do that? Well because they danced around the questions and the lawyer rang and well, you have to piece together. There wasn't one witness that saw me get hit and there wasn't one witness that heard me say anything. See attributed to me and weren't you visible the next day? No photographs that night. Them posing for pictures with. If I had said all this stuff, why would they have take pictures with me? What is that feeling like when someone just fucking lies horrible and when it makes about a terrible, terrible, and what's worse about it is the media jumps on it and convicts me of it because why they broke the story when I went off the grid, Mexico where I couldn't even come back.

Speaker 1:          06:20          So they broke the story. Do you think they knew? I'm starting to believe that, but why didn't it happen on the opiod Anthony Show? Yeah, but that don't think that was planned because I know those guys. They are, but that was the whole ball. They all show did it. He did it that day on O'reilly later that afternoon. So he wants. He named you. He just start naming you ever. Oh yeah. Then it went viral. It went viral and everyone convicted me because they said, well, this Iraq war veteran wouldn't lie. Really? I just watched a. well, let me tell you all that. It's destroyed my life. I can't get hired for a job during my trial. After it was over, guess what happened? Thirty four major media conglomerates entered the, the, the, uh, the trial with that Ama. Ama. See, they call it or whatever have of influencing the court of appeals to overturn my verdict and they did it.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Thirty four media conglomerates, the New York Times, The Washington Post. All of these media conglomerates appeal to the Court of Appeals to overturn my verdict, but why? Because I won on something called unjust enrichment. They want the ability to be able to defame you and profit from it. In other words, I'll put it what they had, what these judges accommodated them with a, there's going to be another trial. They've ordered a new trial. Okay, so I got to go through it again, but I'm glad because when it comes out to juries and judges find kyle guilty who's not going to believe it then and. But the point is they. They've ordered a new trial. They've, they dis. They throughout the whole verdict of the jury, the federal judge who wrote substantial evidence supporting the jury's verdict. They did all that and they violated their own rules. A 76 year rule. Here's what it states if, because it happened during summation, where the judge allowed it in the.

Speaker 1:          08:24          My attorney it, it ended up for questions in an 11 day trial and a half, a page of a 20 page summary and it was overturned on that and they overturned it because they felt that it was undue influence on the jury that they found out that insurance was paying for everything, so was one factor. Well, and here's the deal. If the rules state that if in final argument they say something, you must object, you must object. So the trial lawyer as a chance to rule during final argument and the jury has a chance to hear the ruling, they never objected, so they must object to undue influence because of the fact that it was never wait. They never objected. The jury was dismissed at 1158 at 12. Oh, Tuesday. Then objected. The judge overruled them and we were done with it. Well, these two judges, Riley and shepherd have now overturned the case on something that was never objected to in trial.

Speaker 1:          09:29          They objected to it, so they overturned the jury and the federal judge them. They also overturned my unjust enrichment claim because the media didn't want it. What they've allowed now is the media can defame you and profit from it and you can't get any of their profits and no matter how they harm you, while that's the equivalent of if you went out and robbed the bank and they caught you and they shouldn't and shoot a two years in prison for the bank robbery, but when you get out, you get to keep all the money you took, so that's in this particular case, this particular which will now be the standard they ruled that way, they now make it to where you can profit from wrongdoing because of this case.

Speaker 1:          10:20          This is such a touchy case because it's so indicative of the complications of people because people are not simple. It's really varied. Archie, he lied. He did lie, but any harm to be with his lie that, but that's not what I'm saying. What's complicated is he's also the subject of this gigantic movie and this symbol of patriotism where so many people will say, Chris Kyle, rest in peace. So many people would have. I saw a cloud that was. Someone took a photo in the cloud and that's on a cloud. That's Chris. Chris Kyle. It looked like a sniper in the car in. This is Chris Kyle guiding, guarding the skies. Like it became a meme. I mean he became this thing where he was. He was a representative of the brave military, like the portrayal, but honestly the betrayal that Bradley Cooper played in that movie, that movie was so simplistic and so it was.

Speaker 1:          11:17          It was like right out of the Joseph Campbell Hero's journey. Had I not gone to court, that would have been in the movie. Really? I had to stop it. They were going to have him punch you in the movie, the book. Holy Shit. And I had to stop it. I know when we were. When we were in trial, you know what they tried to do to diminish my role because when they knew they were gonna lose their lawyer got me on the stand and he said, Mr Ventura. He said, would it surprise you to know that the first draft of the doesn't have you in it? Trying to prove how insignificant my first draft of the movie. That doesn't mean shit. Well, the first draft of this. Yeah, but so what if the second draft as you it though? I said, here's where my response. I said, no, that wouldn't surprise me at all because I said we've sent two letters to warner brothers warning them that if I am indeed in in this movie, they will be next to be sued.

Speaker 1:          12:19          So we put Warner Brothers on notice that if this is included in your movie, you will get sued next and you know people out here, they don't want to step into a lawsuit. That's the only thing that kept me from being punched out in that movie and portrayed me as a villain in that frickin movie. I'd never seen them fill in way more than a villain. Yeah, right. I mean that is insane. It is insane. Because what's. What's crazy to me and what's complicated about this is that there are thousands and thousands of brave men and women who have risked their lives, sacrificed their lives, and this guy becomes this this way, and when he rises above, including me, including you. Yes, very important, but he rises above all this and becomes this icon figure. Yes. This iconic figure that you can't tarnish and then the truth is irrelevant and they're willing to sacrifice people like you and the truth just for this overall image of patriotism.

Speaker 1:          13:21          Yup. It's crazy. What a crazy place that must've been for you still is. In fact, do you know that this person that I told you about, what the seizures, that she's your disorder started right after this. I'm sure that the doctors have said she's yours can be caused by stress. So I hold Chris Kyle directly responsible for the seizure disorder. All showed that I had to face that marijuana cured. Did you ever communicate with him face to face? Only one shot the first, uh, when we first and June, I didn't even know who he was. And then in June of 2012, after the book came out in January, uh, we had a settlement conference where he kept saying that if he met me in person, we could work it out, show at this conference. We agreed I would meet him in a room, the judge in the corner and just ski.

Speaker 1:          14:16          And I, like you and I are here. We sat down in the room and I looked him right in the face and I said, why did you do this? You never punched me. He looked me back and said, yes I did. I turned to the judge. I said, there's no need to go any farther. I said, if he's not going to admit it, didn't happen face to face one on one. And I challenged his courage because yeah, he had the courage to go to Iraq. He had the courage to shoot all these people, but he didn't have the courage to tell the truth. Daddy, what a bizarre moment that must have been sitting across from that guy. And he looked at me and said, yes, I did. What was the look in his face? I believe, and I'm not a doctor, but I've done some studying, I think he was a sociopath. Sociopath can lie and hold a straight face and they lie to the point where they believe their own lie. How bizarre is it that this iconic figure and then look how he died. Yeah. Well, he had no training and post traumatic stress. He's not medical and yet he's taking this marine to a gun range. Who suffering from posttraumatic stress wouldn't common sense tell you not to put a weapon in the hands of someone suffering from posttraumatic stress.

Speaker 1:          15:37          Stress is different, or what do they tell him to man up? Why would you put a weapon in somebody's hands who suffering from posttraumatic stress when you have no medical training? House, quiet, qualified to treat this guy? Well, I would assume it would be based on his own posttraumatic stress, but he didn't have it. He didn't have it at all. No. He was never treated for it. He may have had it. Maybe that's why he did what he did. I don't know. God, what a crazy place today, but, but the. For me, it's like I've been accused of something I didn't do. I don't even know the guy never. I may have met him that night briefly.

Speaker 2:          16:19          I obviously didn't get one. One millionth of a percent of the amount of hate that you did,

Speaker 1:          16:26          but just read. I got read off for September 11th of this year. I was in New York doing this book tour and I got read off in a hotel lobby over this. What does that mean? Read off? A guy yelled and screamed at me in front of the entire hotel lobby, Jesus Christ. That's what I live with now and I haven't been damaged. My reputation isn't damaged over something I never did.

Speaker 2:          16:54          When I was going to say is, I obviously haven't experienced one, 1000000th of the hate that you have, but I read. We read this article on the air. We were trying to figure out what happened when your case was going on, and so we read this article that was, I don't know, it was in the New York Times. See if he could find the article detailing all the various lies. Oh, that's an Yorker magazine. New Yorker Yorker, they did an investigation of him but it stunning and just reading that the fucking amount of hate tweets and facebook tweets and you fucking coward and you this. He knew that. I'm like, Hey, I didn't write it. Okay. I'm just trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. And if someone put something like that in the New Yorker with verified claims, I mean, everything's verified. What they were saying that he said and what actually had happened. It was all verified. It's very, very, very confusing that somehow or another this slipped through the cracks and that this became their iconic figure. Again, not discounting along with you. The thousands and thousands of patriotic Americans that risked their lives.

Speaker 1:          17:56          And he is too. Nobody's denying. He wasn't a great sniper. Nobody's denying he didn't do his job. I've never denied that from him or said that about him. He, he may be the best. I don't know. I'll still put my money on Carlos half cocteau the marine as being the best sniper I want especially now. But uh, but uh, he, he did his job and he did it well. But why did he have to take an old veteran? That would be like me taking a world war two guy and throwing him under the bus. Why the fuck would he choose you? Because I had fame. He. I think he got jealous that night. We were at the bar because everyone crowded around and wanted their picture with me. Wow. I don't know. He'll never be around to answer it. I'd love to know why he picked out me. I think because I'm probably the most famous maybe or I develop to be the most famous seal other than Dick Marcinko, the rogue warrior. Great books. I read his books. He's a friend of mine. Richard Marcinko.

Speaker 2:          18:58          When you sat down and you're talking to this guy, how much time were you actually in the room with them?

Speaker 1:          19:03          Oh, a couple of minutes. Was all the minute. The minute he looked me in the eye and said, I sure did he hit you. I turned to the judge, said we got nothing more to talk about. You didn't want it. I offered him. I shed. If you will walk out to be with the fresh and admit you fabricated this story, I will forgive you in front of the crash and we will go on with our lives. He would not do it. He did not have the courage to stand up and tell the truth.

Speaker 2:          19:34          It takes a lot of courage to admit you lied about something that massive. I mean, this is in line about speeding, right? This is. This is a massive, massive.

Speaker 1:          19:41          What about ruining my life? Ruining my reputation, ruining my wife's life rule. I lost my conspiracy theory show because of it real. I can't get hired right now. I can't get a job. My last job was on the Internet. That aura tv because the owners Carlos slim from Mexico. From that you know who I'm hired. Do you know who I work for now? The Russians. Russian TV are the only people that will hire me because 34 media conglomerate centered this case to overturn me. You think they're going to hire me

Speaker 2:          20:17          now? Explain that. Why do you think they did that? Do you think they did that? Because if they overturn your case, if they can somehow or another, because they don't want a credit check, but is that it or is that discrediting you in like that was a gigantic hit movie. But if they decide, if they can discredit you, it makes that movie still value.

Speaker 1:          20:38          Not only that, it stops me from running for president don't, and if they can discredit me.
