Speaker 1:          00:00:00       That's everything to me. See that on the podcast. What were you just saying? Young Tony Hinchcliffe.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       I love fanny packs and I've been using them continuously.

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Yeah, that's right. Folks, don't get scared that the Illuminati and the elite, they want to keep you from embracing the fanny pack. They want to. They want to emasculate you. It's probably not them.

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       That's like some group name. You've heard of the rat pack where the fanny pack.

Speaker 1:          00:00:25       Brian's never dared one. Oh yeah, I have yours, but I wear it all the time. Never seen more, but you know, it's cool it. So there's little ones that stretch. Have you ever seen those? Like super small and they like stretch big. So you could put like a couple of things in it or nothing. Nothing. And you can't really see it. Yeah. Those things are good for jogging the they, they, they pulled tight to you. It's a smaller pocket though. Can't see. The thing with these things is if you travel as much as we do, you just have all your shit in that thing and you just drop it off. Just take any thought out of your head you might have about getting laid. That won't be happening. If you are a single person, you're a single man. Single girl could pull it off. We don't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       Pennypack would not make her any less hot. No need to put a condom in a fanny pack. You'll never use it. Your fanny pack though isn't really cheesy or anything. It's actually cool looking. It's root slim. It's. We sell them. They put a higher primate logo on it. Roots does, but it's a roots fanny pack. They are the ones that dice was wearing. That's how I found out about it. Dice came in and I had instant fanny pack envy. I was like, what do you have here? What do you have? Oh, this is the one I got

Speaker 2:          00:01:35       when I'm in the line at Tsa. I eyeball everybody that's emptying their pockets and I just look at everybody and then I get snap and drop it like a mic into the things that everybody just saw me

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       and it zips up. Your pockets don't zip up. It's better.

Speaker 2:          00:01:50       Everything falls out of pockets on an airplane. There's something about it

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       I've worn on stage maybe four times. You've worn it on word, on stage in Utah. It gets in the way though. Flopping around. You're moving too much. Yeah. There's certain places where I. I can't wear a fanny pack in one way it would work because if you actually moved it to your fanny and there's just something about that. That's not gonna happen. If you're going to have a fanny pack, it's got to be in the front

Speaker 2:          00:02:16       and waterproof. Broader proof. Fanny packs might be next. Why not? Shower with soap in there. Pull it out.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       If you have like a secret and you keep it in that fanny pack, so I a picture of your deck or something like that. You don't want anybody having an actual physical picture was the one body Kelly always had, was wearing. It was like when I went over your shoulder roll a Bandolero. What is it? It's like a fanny pack that's on your chest. It's like for people who are scared of wearing a fanny packs or they pretend they're world travelers with skinny souls. You know those dudes who were like suede shoes of muted colors with thin soles, you know those kind of guys and they have like skinny on and then they were like a Satchel. I have a Satchel. I just got back from winning and size. It's amazing. These time of year. Yeah. That guy works. Not sure. I like to take those people, satchels from them and just wear them around my waist. She just turned my Satchel into a fanny pack. It's more of a butcher's apron.

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       Yeah. There's something about them. They, for whatever reason, not only do they not catch on, they became gross. Like fanny packs are gross. They're way more than didn't catch on this actual, oh, this man is very involved in unicef and the Red Cross. He goes to foreign lands and the liberties. Malaria medicine ready? Look at that guy do a uhg. There's something about you. When I'm not on the Big Bang theory, I carry randomly Satchel. I had a blow a guy to get this rule. What's in that size? We're just a bunch of Dicks, just pubic hair and it's filled with com. Thirteen pounds of this when he walks. All right. How much, how much do you think it would wave? That was filled with come? How heavy is thicker than water? So probably about nine pounds. Gallon of milk. Nine pounds. Why should know? I've, I've seen an lms. We had pitchers of come on.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       Fear factor was actual pictures. What kind of come it was donkey Kong. Oh yeah. Doc, he comes the cheapest you can get because donkeys are hybrids and they're not viable. So that donkey comes just useless. When you had that much come, did it separate? Like was there like a tough to blend it? No, he didn't have to shake it like a lemonade curdle at the top. Scoop off. No, no, you didn't have to shake it. I know what you're talking about. Some of those energy drinks, even vixen, uh, you know, water bottle and then it settles to the bottom. You got no comments. Just come. It's basically Cox not. There it is. Oh no, those girls, one of them drank a glass of calm and one drank a glass of urine. It's the what? Like there's two times ever doing that show where I was, where I was like, what in the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       Like you can't do this. Like you guys are going too far. Oh, she's that donkey. Donkey come a whole bigger mug full of donkey. Come God, I missed somebody sat down and did this, this, this is how crazy this show was. Somebody sat down, said, I got an idea. It started pitching that people would have to drink donkey come. It puts my mind that it was on NBC. Yeah, and then other people said, yeah, the, the. I like what you're saying. Makes Sense. Let's do it. NBC is as mainstream as it gets. Like, Hey, after you're done enjoying donkey, come watch the nightly news with Tom Brokaw as mainstream as possible. And the girl it, she's

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       pretending like she didn't love it though. She liked it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:00       Ugh. It's not even her first time drinking donkeys. Who? It was so ridiculous at the shit. I would love to abstain. Ridiculous show. So silly. That's overkill. Like being able to look at the donkey. Oh God. I love it. You're just yelling at these guys, come on, chug it. That guy just shucked it so quick. They're hugging on each other. So strange. It just. Then they get to throw up. They have to hold it in their mouth for like a few seconds or something. His buddies up and he didn't even drink it. I don't need to relive this. We can stop now. So unnecessary. Incredible. It's just amazing that that was an actual show. No, it was. It's amazing. As amazing to me as it is anybody that was watching it. It doesn't even feel like it was me. I watch it now and even though I know it was me and I'm like, I didn't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       It's crazy because most shows like for comedians to host suck and aren't fun at all. You know what I mean? But eat that show seems like it was. You were surprised. Like it's like you get to watch it. You're like, oh, we're making these people drink donkey. Come today. Like, how do you not enjoy that?

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       It's hard. It's hard to drink to help these people. You've got to root them on.

Speaker 2:          00:07:17       Out of all the things on fear factor, did you ever like sample anything like dip your finger in anything and try it or. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:23       eat a bunch of shit. The first episode I felt bad. The people that eat sheep's eyeball, so I said I went to just for a goof, but I don't even think we put that on camera. I just said I'll do it for you. Did it tastes because the sheep shit. You fucking can't help yourself. You literally can't help yourself. No, it didn't taste that bad. It was not that big a deal. It's more of in your head than anything. I ate a tomato horn worm again. All in your head. The actual taste and now that I'm not that big a deal. Those were the big ones. The juicy. Yeah. It exploded in my mouth. Didn't, didn't taste bad at all. It's like nothing. I'm cockroach. I had a big ass cockroach. What was that? Madagascar hissing cockroach. Was it alive? Well, there was a young lady that was on the show and she was going to get kicked off if she didn't do something else.

Speaker 1:          00:08:17       Like she had to do something to stay in the show. It was all for charity. Right. So because it was a celebrity fear factor out. Alison Sweeney, I believe her name is from days of our lives and uh, so I said, look, if you eat one of these, a roach, I don't know who came up with this idea, someone in the, the office, she's, I'm like, if eat one of these roaches you can stay. And she said, uh, I can't even roach. I go, what about a worm? I go, what about two worms? I think we made a deal like she maybe she ate two worms or something like that and I had to eat a roche. So stupid. It's just such a ridiculous show. But anyway, the point is there's, this roach tasted like nothing is. Nothing made me cough because although I was kind of put all the little legs and the parts and stuff, why would you do that?

Speaker 1:          00:09:18       You love it. That's hilarious. What Baldwin brother? The Baldwin brother, Steven. It's nice guy. Very nice guy. I would have loved to have seen one. He did. Yeah. He Won. Yeah. Who's funny, dude? He's. Oh, you know, put the Jesus though. He's with pro Jesus all. All. All up with Jesus. Wow. Yeah, he's like a big Jesus like a proselytizer does like retreats and shit or something like that. Very Jesus oriented individual, but a happy guy. Very nice guy. Yeah. Kirk Cameron style? No, not that far. No. Kurt cameras in some wacky place where they look at a banana and they go, this has to be a sign of God. Look how the banana fits in your hand. It is the perfect shape. Note how appeals designed by the Creator himself to fit in your hand. So if you ever seen that ray comfort explains a banana.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       We gotta watch this because this is his boy. Like these two guys. They get together and they don't fuck. They just looked at each other and they want to and no one does anything and they just keep doing it night after night. It just talk about Jesus and stare into each other's eyes, but this is his buddy that he baldwins. No, no, no. The other one. Kurt Cameron. Oh, this is his buddy. It's like off the deep end. Jesus guy, and this is the guy that he holds up a fucking banana and it's the atheist nightmare. He says. He's like, this is a banana in it is the atheist

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       atheist's nightmare study a well wellmade. You'll find on the fast side of ridges on the close side, two ridges. If you get your hand ready to grip it around, you'll find on the far side, there were three groups on the close side, two groups, but banana and the hand off perfectly made one or the other. You'll find a maker of a banana or almighty God has made it with a nonslip surface. Has Al would indicate, is it England contents green too early. Yellow. Just right. Black, too late. Have you go to the top of the banana? You'll find as with a soda can make us. They placed a tab at the top, so God has placed a tab at the top. When you pull the tab, the contents don't squirt in your face. You'll find a wrapper which is biodegradable, has perforations. Notice how gracefully it sensitivity. Human hand notice has appointed the top for ease of entry, just the right shape. The human mouth, it's Chewy, easy to digest, has even curved or the face to make the whole process so much easier. Seriously, curt, the creation

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       testifies to the genius of God's creative writing was about to jump in. Oh, you just totally made sense. What you said wasn't fucking ridiculous at. Oh, look how Jesus designed this banana. Is that. Get us kicked off youtube. We're going to have to edit that out. We're gonna have to edit it out. Yeah, most likely. It's not our content and we don't want to get booted off Youtube, but I'm ray comfort banana. Google it. It's an awesome God. It's awesome. All the gods shit to the side like it is sort of crazy. If you think about fruits, how amazing they are. Like it's like trick candy and a rapper already, you know? Well, it's a. it's like a delivery system trick. It's like there are seeds inside these plants and if you eat it, it goes through your body, you shit it out. So it like literally comes with manure, like it's got a seed, it's got some manure, it's got shit to the seed, can grow in.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       It's like literally comes out with fertilizer. There's a way, especially with like animals like undulates, like cows and stuff like that. Like they're shitting out like almost like mulch. They're shitting out compost mean they, you take cows shit and you take that shit and you grow things with it. I mean it's a great fertilizer. People use it on their crops, so it's in a lot of ways I would imagine. This is just me thinking that this is what it is, is like some sort of a like a transportation device for seeds. Right? Doesn't that make sense? It's crazy. I never thought of it that way though. They're like, animals eat the seeds and then they, they're pooping out the next thing. It's don't have seeds. No, don't. They don't do that. If it was really Jesus as if it was really an atheist nightmare, I think there'd be seeds seedless beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       If bananas at seeds, they'd be bunk. Man Fits into math. Perfect. I wonder that dummy knows that we've actually like changed the shape of bananas. Go, go. We're going to wild banana. Those little scrubby ass bitch ass bananas. So it's not like those Dole Bananas, those big whopper bananas were like cheese. Those Gmo Bananas. Even steroids to like a 10 year old's arm. Like these Gmo bananas are fucking ridiculous. The Brock Lesnar Bananas. Yeah. Tell that to ray comfort. He doesn't understand agriculture. Silly. Fuck the way Jesus made this benign. He's incredible. He's just such a strange argument, but it's just. If that's what you want to believe. If you really want to believe that God designed a banana so perfectly to let you know that it's food. Explain coconuts. Coconuts are fucking awesome for you. It's so hard to get to them. You've got to chop through that hoskin.

Speaker 1:          00:14:30       Pull away all that bullshit that's on the outside climate. Huge tree. First. You get a crack them open and then you gotta you gotta take the milk out and the meat you got like scoop the meat of it and if you want to get the oil all you want to take all that coconut and turn it into coconut oil. Oh, what a pain. That Dick. That's gonna be. Yeah. Have you seen the certain foods that are going to get more and more expensive because of global warming and stuff like that. Like the price of chocolate and the price of coffee is just going to go through the roof. Pistachios I guess this year or like we're like on a shortage. So you're going to see like pistachios, like double in price in the next couple months. It's really weird. Like what foods are on the endangered species list almost.

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       Maybe we shouldn't live in a place that's really fucking hot right now when the earth is getting hotter. Yeah. I mean what the fuck is la going to be like? La is going to be like Phoenix, right? Like Phoenix is like a bump hotter than La. Definitely. When you say a lot like a bump, a good solid bump, but everything's shifted. Earthquakes, hurricanes, everything's kind of like Oklahoma had an earthquake the other day, but that's because of fracking. Yeah. Yeah. That is a. That is no joke, man. They're having. They're having so many earthquakes because of fracking. I think Oklahoma just put some. They put a pause. Yeah. I don't know if it's a pause on drilling new wells or it's a pause on. It can't be a pause and operating the wells. I think it is. I think it was like 41 different fracking sites.

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       Let's find out what it is. July me. They're going crazy with fracking. Ohio has been doing it and they've been getting earthquakes. It's crazy. It's like we get most of the oil now I guess from the. From earth here, from America. Oklahoma orders shut down of 37 wells after earthquake. Fuck man. Ooh, that's crazy. Good Lord. Then there's been like the Iraqi look, a hot. This girl is telling you the news. That's the new thing isn't really super hot. Has this like supermodel lady. She's beautiful. Have you ever seen the Fox News girls? They're all like seven feet tall. I listened to her, but let's watch her face move that they're just getting the hottest women. That Mexican weather girl with the but oh my God, I've seen that lady love her. That's ridiculous. But that's kind of like a gimmick, right? And that's Mexico. What's this? A CNN like?

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       This is. They're just hiring the best looking people. Yeah. You for sexy light skin, black check. Beautiful. And she's talking to this man, will I believe in Jesus and Jesus wants us to dig oil. Look at my tie. Look at my haircut. It's conservative as is my approach to language. Ma'Am. You won't hear me using any forbidden words. You know, we need to keep the oil prices low. The way to keep the oral process flow is to continue safe and ethical fracking. And that's what we're going to do. Meanwhile, get back to the hot chick. Let me see her faith. You don't get to see it. What the fuck are they doing? Like all these shows like Fox News and all the there. There's, there's gotta be something to like the fact that propaganda being delivered by someone who is so hot. You just want to stare him like those.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Those Fox ice queens. Totally. There's a bunch of them that are just like, they're so hot. You just want to look at their face like little kids get compelled to look at pretty women's faces. Fox News has a bunch of stuff strategically to keep you watching, like spinning things and it's all like. It's all mental dude. We were watching once and who was it? Was it the Megan Kelly lady that was crossing and uncrossing your legs like 30 fucking times and she's wearing this little skirt. Find out. It might not have been her. It might've been one of those other hotties that was high as other Fox hotties, but it was ridiculous because she's wearing literally like she's got a Napkin over vagina. It's a small napkin. I mean it's not as much of a skirt at all. She has these super long legs and high heels on and she's doing this. She should she have a little Bush because you see her. No, you don't get a chance to say she's very, very calculated, very calculated, but if I was staying with a dude who moved his legs that much, I'd be like, Bro, you okay? Why keep crossing your legs are fucking cricket. You're trying to sing me a song. You see that? You see the girl that was twerking in her butt popped up in her underwear? Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:18:56       Fox News. I don't think that's related. Brian watches. Fox News. Fox News is hurting. So I keep hearing Fox News is hurting. I watched routers and uh, who was it that was saying that they had heard? Fuck, I'm trying to remember who was telling me this. Was it you? Will you telling me the thing about a trump and a television network? It was trying to remember what, where I heard it and it was, I think it was a radio show or something, but that there's a lot of those, a lot of people use added like Sean Hannity and I think that God has taken over his campaign that used to run fox or taken over his spot and I don't know how they're going to transition. If he loses, but that trump news channel is going to be started up next year, the end of this year, trump news, 24 hour trump. Here's what he does.

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       If he's. If he was smart, I mean he's obviously smart, not right. He's obviously really good at making money. He's obviously, well, whatever you can say about the outrageous shit that he says, that guy's ridiculously successful. Ridiculously right. I mean, yeah, his dad gave him a big loan to start out with, but what the fuck ever at the end of the day, that guy's ridiculous. Ridiculously successful. If he wanted to open a good television cable network and use that as a platform to set them up for four years from now, 10, like the kind of fucking shit that he would say about Hillary and like other candidates that no one would have the balls to say like he takes it to this non political place. You know, like he insults Hillary Clinton all the time. He calls her crooked Hillary. Has there ever been to presidential candidates or one of them had nicknames for all the other people? Now he's a genius. He made fun of everybody, Lion, Ted, who was, keeps repeating it, and it becomes like it's. That's who she is. That's crooked hillary. Yeah, it's fucking crazy. It's amazing what he did. If she just started calling him like Orange Donald or something,

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       it'd be Keller. She could really fire back. She needs a little like roast help because he's digging in deep.

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       It's not just that there's an uncomfortable sound that she makes when she speaks, when she gives speeches, they're not soothing and they don't draw you in like as much as she is way more qualified to be a leader than he is. Right. He knows way more about foreign policy. Knows way more about how Washington works. She's deep, right? Like she'd be a way more qualified leader. There's something about the quality of

Speaker 4:          00:21:19       voice she needs to drink. Some donkey come. Which by the way is like the end. Isn't that the democratic. Think you're going to jail for that. That's the democratic. Uh, I liked her just because she at least has built the deck, not billing anymore, man. He's bill enough. Bills stay. He's, he's kind of

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       the stand back and take naps in the background guy. Now if you noticed that there was a speech he was giving, he was falling asleep in the middle of the speech and you know, he just in really poor health, apparently his body's just not doing so well.

Speaker 4:          00:21:53       That's what happens when the blowjob stop. Wow. You can't have fun anymore. You just can't help yourself. I mean, it's true. He was a machine back in the day and now just came too much. It's all dried out. Hi. Ya know, just dried out to shut

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       so many loads. Poor guy. Um, well he was a two term president. I wouldn't say poor guy. He was the best guy. Made a mad run for it. Mean regardless of all the Dick pulling out and all that stuff. He's a madman. Would you expect from madman? He's doing some mad man type shit.

Speaker 4:          00:22:29       All I remember is everybody was taking vacations, owning houses and gas prices were like forty five cents a gallon. Right? So, I mean he should.

Speaker 1:          00:22:37       I don't know enough. I don't know enough about the economic cycles, but I do know that the people that are smart that talk about it say that there's like these upturns and downturns that you can almost calculate that just is going to happen and then we have a weird economy and that these people that are the experts, they can kind of predict how things start happening and deregulation moves things along a little bit and this moves things along. Tax Incentive moves things a little long, a little further, but then somewhere along the line the house of cards comes falling down and they, um, they see the big one was the mortgage crisis of 2008. We avoided an even bigger one with the commercial real estate crisis. There were, there were saying that they were worried about that more than anything because if you drive down like any place in the valley, just go drive down the valley and look at all the buildings for sale. Look at all the buildings for lease. It's, it's way more than you used to say. Like as you're driving down, you see available for re release available for sale, available, available, available. You see available like all over the fucking place. Like that

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       could fall apart too, man. Apparently that's a big one. Apparently there's like a lot of people that are like leveraging all these commercial properties and moving things around, selling things here. But there's a lot of vacant office shit.

Speaker 6:          00:23:59       Well there's like this whole like flip your house movement to, you know, in those channels. Like when I'm at hotels and stuff, he ended up, I ended up sticking on it like that. Like trying to convince everybody that they can just go buy a house and flip it and sell it. Make money. It's so easy. Look, he just come in, tear down a wall and then sell it for twice as much more. Yeah. Their character.

Speaker 5:          00:24:18       There's two, right? They're all like, I'm going to do my own grout out there, laying tiles and shit.

Speaker 6:          00:24:23       Right. And then they edit it down and make it look like it took 12 seconds on TV. This old house, you remember that. That was one of my favorite shows growing up with Bob Vila. That's pretty much the original flipping houses show, but they made it a whole story on this went on for days. What happened to Bob Vila see alive? That's a good question. It is a good question. I forgot about them like huge until he was a hero. Yeah. This old house was done was like a giant show, or at least it was for me growing up because we watched it every day. That in the antique roadshow is another one that had just love on pbs. It was for me to still rocking. That might be real 1 million followers. It is. Look it up. Verified handsome bastard. He looks exactly the senior AC coils mean higher efficiency and lower energy bills.

Speaker 6:          00:25:08       How clean are yours? I just had that one of those air conditioning's fucked me for life fucked you because it has like a drain and it's supposed to be tilted a little so it could drip out. Mine was dripping the other way, like I didn't even know it was going underneath my carpet, so now it got underneath a to my wood floors and now there's big buckles. So when you walk it's like speed bumps underneath my carpet and fun and there's probably black mold in there and probably go die. Does that help with black mold is from that, right? Like water, it's

Speaker 5:          00:25:36       moisture from water damage, but it has to be present, you know, and asked to be present and then it can grow like a. I know I'm, well Tom Lucas was a big one because he would talk about it on television or on the radio rather like his, his whole house had to be gutted, like down to the studs that was in Hollywood. He's feeling like shit for years, just like just health was poor, just really didn't have any energy trying to fill out what the fuck was going on. And um, they brought in a black mold specialists and they're like, dude, you're fucking houses infected. So he's breathing in all these spores, these black mold sports just being poisoned all the time.

Speaker 6:          00:26:15       Did they have home tests for that? I bet you anything. I have so much black, black matters people. Fucking son of a bitch. He's got to keep an eye on it.

Speaker 5:          00:26:29       The jokes they come, they just come. Um, yeah man. I think um, they, they do a lot of testing for it. You should probably get it checked out. Some people have it, man. Do you ever ever seen one of Jim Norton? Jim Norton was a gym and Bobby Jimmy and Kelly lived in an

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       apartment and they had black mold on the walls so bad that you would take the picture off the wall and it was just like, you could see it all over behind the picture. It's probably isn't as common though in Los Angeles since we're a desert and everything's dry, you know, it's a good question. I think if there's water, like if you have water damage, like say if you have a leaky pipe or something like that for long periods of time, see that shit dripping down. That's black mold juice hose lines. Now Watch, they pick up the uh, it's um, cribs. Jim Norton is a, if you want to find it as the video and they say brace yourself so they push us and the fucking wall is just covered with black mold behind the photo. I mean like someone spray painted all over it. I need a priest to come in and give an extra systems of health.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       How did it happen though? Like what was you speaking? They're slobs to fucking slobs. Who knows? Somebody might have come on that picture. You know, it's Jim Norton. Who the hell knows he's a savage. Look at him playing chess. Listen to cds. That's pretty much your apartment. Red Band Department. Pretty much every comedian. Ridiculous people. Yeah. That black molds. No jokes. Don't get it in your life. Tony Hinchcliffe. I keep an eye on all the black. All the black mold. Yeah. It's um, I don't think is there more than one variety of black mold and does it have to be like water damage for a long time? Because I'm sure my carpet probably dried out, you know, if I caught it could be, could be. I don't know enough. I don't know enough. I don't know, you know, I know, uh, that mold and spores thrive in moist conditions, you know, like the forest but have no idea, man.

Speaker 1:          00:28:23       It's creepy stuff. That's creepy. Yeah. Fungus and mold and shit like that. It's just so weird. There's like these, these lifeforms that live on life forms, you know, they like, you leave her a pair, leave it sitting around somewhere and forget about it. Come back in a couple of days and it's got this little green civilization growing on it. Like who are you, where'd you guys come from? Like, what are you doing here? What would you. Unlike the banana, which has a skin that protects it from these things because Jesus loves bananas. He gave him a southern accent and even though he's from New Zealand, interesting. And it's interesting choice. I hit a bunch of mold the other day late at night and we bought strawberries, you know, like underneath the strawberry, like green and stuff. I had no idea because it was dark eating strawberries and the next day I go in to get some more and I'm like, they're all moldy. I'm like, was I was reading moldy strawberry? Yeah, and the dark. Yeah, man. It's probably not even that bad for you. It's probably just all in your head. I mean, otherwise people would be dying left and right, right, right. Because everybody eats strawberries and doesn't pay attention or blueberries. Blueberries. They always fucking mold on on cheese. Sometimes blueberries have mold. Right? Right. When you buy them, you buy them and bring them home. You're like, fuck. You're already molding. Yeah. Trader Joe's a lot of times cheese to eat, a slice of cheese. Not even

Speaker 6:          00:29:42       realize half of it's white and green. Well, some cheeses to you, Brian. Nobody else is eating Greens. Will. What were you leaving your cheese? Remember? My mom would always say, just pull off the mold part and just, you know, it's still good. I would if that's true. Yeah, but pull the cheese out of the glove compartment and screen you're eating it. I just don't think that the economy

Speaker 5:          00:30:03       mold that we're talking about as toxic. I just bet it's not like Jamie lookup mold on strawberries. Is it? Oh, Katie Moldy food. What was it say? May cause may have visible bacteria along with the mold. Yes, some old cause, allergic reactions, respiratory problems, and a few molds in the right conditions. Produce Mycotoxins, poisonous substances that can make you sick. Yeah. Okay. Just Google strawberries, moldy strawberry. Can you eat mostly

Speaker 6:          00:30:34       strawberries? Google can Brian, red bandy, moldy stressing. You've done something like this before to think of your fruit had mold and it's just like, I just bought this also. So have you ate mode? Also, Joe, I'm sure I have

Speaker 5:          00:30:48       quick answer. The most likely result of eating moldy fruit is absolutely nothing unless the person eating the mold is allergic. However, while the majority of molds are not dangerous, moldy fruit is more likely to be spoiled and spoiled fruit may cause illness because mold may form on fruit without the fruit spoiling. Simply cutting the moldy area off is also a solution. Most molds are not harmful, somewhere even beneficial. In fact, mold is actually a form of fungus similar to mushrooms. Mold grows and damp environments, fruit skin, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Hmm. Interesting. I've always been scared of mold fungus in general, so freaky freaky organism because it's not really a plant. A fungus actually breathes in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide and they say it's closer to an animal that it is to a plant in like what it is like what kind of a being it is. Very, very bizarre.

Speaker 6:          00:31:45       Well, a magic mushrooms does to the brain. I mean there's definitely some stuff going on there. That's crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:31:52       Yeah. That's what that feels like. You're communicating with like a. it's like you tap in through this organism to this matrix of like, not just like plant intelligence, but the intelligence of the actual earth itself. It feels like almost like you're being transmitted in a way where you can now understand all these things that are around you all the time, but they're muted because he just, he just lacked the ability to perceive them. Like the earth itself. Like we walk around and we're like, wow, so pretty today, but do you really. You don't really feel what the earth is the way you feel it when you're on mushrooms. When you're on mushrooms, you like, you feel the actual grass as like a type of an organism. There's a thing like this, that grass, it stops like a couple of leaves and some dirt and some it, and then it becomes instead this feeling like you're, you're connected to this like almost like a, like a, like a circuit, you know, like a biological circuit.

Speaker 5:          00:32:54       That's what like a beautiful thick lawn feels like when you're on mushrooms, like when you're standing in it, you feel like you're connected to this very strange life form. That is what it is. That's not even a hallucinatory sort of a feeling, but I think pretty much everybody that that does any sort of psychedelic plant based, psychedelic mushrooms, animal base, whatever you want, call it, fungus based. You reach these weird places where you go, okay, my talking to that thing that I eat, that thing that thing's talking to me now. Like is it, is it communicating with me? Threw me digesting it? Is that what's happening? Is it. Let me go into some strange dimension when I eat it.

Speaker 2:          00:33:35       It is amazing. I miss this year shroom fest. That's normally the one time a year where I do it. We go out in the desert, but I had like, I was on the road or something and I miss it, man. I'm overdue for one. Like it's like it'll be so connected to the universe and you feel it. You feel, you know, you just try to remember what happened. Like you try to stay in that, but it goes away and it's amazing because like you're out in the desert or at least that's where I normally do it and you're looking at the rocks and the moon and the stars are just beaming out there and you'll feel, you know, is lost in the universe has ever. And then all of a sudden you'll hear like one of your buddies Fart, you know, come back and laughed for 20 minutes straight about it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:16       Yeah. It's a very strange life form. Very strange thing that you take into your body that does that. There's a gang of them too. It's just so weird. So I don't, you know, I don't, I really don't know what's going on with that.

Speaker 2:          00:34:29       Isn't it crazy that it comes from cow poop?

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       Yeah. Well that's where it grows, but really come from it. But it, uh, it grows really good on it because the, uh, the stomach of a cow against that double onion, you only make that stuff, that manure. It's just so rich for things to grow in it. So, which I do the thing with my finger, that's the kind of fucking we need to grow these mushrooms. Just a manure. These counts your seat and Alfalfa all day. Alfalfa. It's delicious. Mushrooms grow. When Duncan went to school, Dunkin with the school and Super Hippieville, he uh, he grew up in Asheville, North Carolina, which is a fucking great town. Have you ever worked at Asheville? Got to come with me to Asheville. Asheville's fucking, it's, I almost don't want to tell people about it because I don't want people moving there and ruin it because it's like you could walk around like it's a small town but the people are cool as fuck. Like, and it's like a part of the community of the College of the university and the university, super lefty, super lefty, like super hippies soup all like Duncan's like living up there in the mountains of North Carolina in like some of the most beautiful landscape you're ever going to see in your life. Just out and out. Amazing scenery, incredible scenery.

Speaker 4:          00:35:56       And I love that. There's still places like that. Yeah, like it's crazy. Like my buddy little landy that the glasses, he's from South Carolina and he went home to visit his family and he's walking around the park with his mom and Bill Murray is just sitting on a bench. Where was this chillen wherever in South Carolina where Bill Murray flips. That's where he's from. Two, I thought Bill Murray

Speaker 1:          00:36:18       lived in like the up the upper, uh, on the what on the East River or one of the rivers. He lives like upstate New York. Like there was a whole Anthony Bordain episode about he lives like way the fuck up. They're up a river and maybe he was just hanging out and because he lives in a bunch of places. Yeah. Bill Marianthi. Oh, Charleston, South Carolina. Oh, you know what? That's right. This was the new episode that he did. He moved to a new place and Bill Murray does not have a girlfriend. He's like, this dude. He's like, yeah, I'll just be by myself. Just leave me alone, please. We're just going to go have my life. He did this interview about. It was talking about. I was like, I'm not really interested in all that. Goes along with that.

Speaker 4:          00:36:59       He did it, man. He is the coolest ever.

Speaker 1:          00:37:02       He's a great, great representative of cool. The leader of the real ghost busters. They killed him in the new movie. The new ghostbusters movie. They kill Bill Murray. They can go kill themselves because I've never watched it. He's a bad guy. I didn't really kill him. He's a skeptic. He. It's like the whole thing. It's very, very. What? It's what it's like. It's like what my point was about Asheville is that there were so many kids getting high off mushrooms off of these cows because they're up in this farm area and it's raining all the time and everything's wet as fuck. It's lush and green and these mushrooms just grew like weeds everywhere and it was so bad that they had to give the cows food, that special food that made their, their manure so that the mushrooms, if they did grow in them, they wouldn't be potent.

Speaker 1:          00:38:01       Yeah, it wouldn't. It wouldn't work. I remember when we were in college would go to certain places and get trash bags worth of mushrooms because some areas just because of the weather and the farms and stuff like that, it just grew mushrooms like crazy. You've got to be so careful though with mushrooms, like what you're taking, like if you think it's one kind of mushroom, but it's another kind of mushroom. There's some mushrooms that'll kill you in seconds. That happened recently on this old folks home. These, uh, these old folks were hanging out and this lady went out and gathered up. Some mushrooms should probably out fucking head on, you

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       know, what kind of Alzheimer's medicine or anything they give them. Like when you're in old folks homes, dude, they will throw some pills down your throat. Oh yeah. Like you, you get to choose how fucked up you want to be all day and so there's ladies out there picking mushrooms and just got a gang of poison once, cooked them all up for everybody to. Everybody died. Yeah. Whoa.

Speaker 6:          00:38:57       She cooked him at the old folks' home. Brought them back. Yeah. She cooked him for the old folks at the old folks' home. Just whack the whole crew. Yeah. I don't remember how many people died, but it was more than one. Do you hear about all these people dying for elderly women die for people sick and after eating white wild mushrooms. Yeah. So crazy shit here about all those people dying from heroin overdoses because there was a bad batch of heroin in like Ohio or something and like 41 people I've overdosed on like the same heroin. I did hear about that. I did hear about that. No,

Speaker 5:          00:39:30       you hear about that. What, how do you say that stuff? Cross home. How do you say? Keratome k r a t o, m. How do you say it? Tony Kratom. Kratom. Maybe Kratom. I don't know how to say it. I've never said it, but I've read about it a lot and uh, it's uh, a plant that helps people overcome opioid addiction apparently. And the FDA just moved into schedule one or they're going to move it to schedule one or the dea I should say. I guess it's the Dea, right? But it's, it's a plant and apparently it helps a lot of people that have a heroin addiction problems and opiate addiction problems. And even some people said it helps with a marijuana, not marijuana, but alcohol withdrawals, people, alcoholics, and they try to break free and get sober. This stuff can help with that too. I don't know enough about it, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to have someone on to talk about it, but it's just, there's no need to make anything else illegal like this, this thing where they're doing what they're doing is they're behaving like an archaic society.

Speaker 5:          00:40:33       They're not behaving like America. Two Thousand and 16, they're behaving like the people who enacted the very first sweeping psychedelic laws of 1970. They're behaving like they behave. If you've got this plant, this Kratom or however you say it, and it doesn't have any history of people like dropping dead from it, it's not like some threat to the communities. It's not like this a terror that's sweeping the streets and it's ruining lives. You're not hearing that. All I'm hearing is it helps people with heroin addiction. We all know how many people are addicted to heroin, so the fact that they just want to step in and immediately not just make this like a schedule two or schedule three or have some scientists come in and testify about it and have some sort of public hearings where they discuss the merits of keeping this drug legal and should this be regulated?

Speaker 5:          00:41:23       Should it be prescribed by doctors like reasonable adults would do if they actually gave a fuck about each other, but instead they have these fucking ridiculous amounts of power where they could just step in and just make things illegal. They have a ridiculous amount of power when it comes to legislating what we can and can't do with our bodies because it's not something anybody's voting on this kratom stuff. So for the dea to just step in and make that schedule one, it's blasphemy like what they're doing is a, it's a. it's such an abuse of the function of the office. The idea of the office is you're supposed to be protecting people, protect people from math, protect people from bad ship. Don't. Don't let people come home to find their children that have overdosed because someone gave them bath salts, right? That's, that's what everybody wants from something like the dea, but they're so far reaching with their efforts that they step into all these areas where we know you're full of shit.

Speaker 5:          00:42:22       Now you step in these areas like marijuana or you're going to save people from pot. Congratulations you fucking cock blocker. What are you gonna? Do you're gonna say people from giggling or eating yummy food or having a good time with their friends. What are you going? What are you? What are you stopping? These are. This is not anything that we should ever. Not not anything we should ever asked for from our leaders in quotes, and definitely not anything we should ever tolerate for no reason whatsoever. There's no reason whatsoever why they would keep marijuana illegal. There's no reason whatsoever other, whether it would make this kratom stuff scheduled ones. There's no fucking reason. It's money. It's. It is. It's a sure sign that it's a corrupt system and if that, if that kratom stuff helps with alcohol withdrawals, then you got to know that these big companies would.

Speaker 5:          00:43:11       Why wouldn't they pitched them some money to be like, hey, lets you don't want me drinking. Even if they didn't do it blatantly, even if they didn't do a blatantly, if they're entangled with each other, you can best believe that if you were entangled with some sort of an alcohol company, you're going to do your best to maximize the profits of that alcohol company. Right? I mean it's just the way it is. If you're entangled with some donor to some political campaign or some some foundation that you run and they give millions of dollars, like you guys have a little agreement going on there. You don't have to even say it. You don't have to have it written down. You don't have to be stupid about it, but it's pretty obvious. If someone gives you millions of bucks there, you know you guys are how your guys are doing business.

Speaker 5:          00:43:55       Something's happening here, you know you're to do nice things for each other now and that's, that's where a lot of this shit comes from. Like the fact that we, the people, the people that are supposed to be represented by these clowns can sit back and just be frustrated and not do anything. We could vote for it when it comes up in our states, but federally it's a giant issue. Federally, federally is the real problem because there's a bunch of states now that made it illegal including Washington dc. It's a bunch of states that have made pot legal there. They're like, look, it's ridiculous. Doesn't the science and Fit p? And then they start taxing it and then they make unbelievable amounts of money and then they have massive research that says in their economy like you're seeing in Colorado and now you're seeing in Seattle in Washington state as well.

Speaker 5:          00:44:42       What they're doing is they're. They're being ironical like these. These, this is not like reasonable people acting in a reasonable way that they're locking people up for a long time. Oh my God. There was this fucking thing the other day where they were comparing that kid who raped the girl in. What University was that? Who's got like a ridiculously short amount of time? What's that? You don't have a mic on Stanford. Stanford. Is that what it is? That guy. So they compared that guy to some poor bastard that. Oh my God, I think he got 30 years for growing pot. Did you see that picture? Did you see it too? I think it was even longer than 30 years, man. It might've been. It might've been like 30 to life or something, but it's just the idea that you would lock that guy away for that long for something so fucking innocuous will loan book below the law.

Speaker 5:          00:45:37       It's real simple. We got a law and you don't want to break it. Okay. You took your consequences. We're adults here. We're all adults. These laws are stupid. We're being handicapped by these ancient systems, these ancient systems of control. They don't. They're not valid anymore. You can't just lock people up for pot. It's stupid. Here it is. Lee. Carol Brooker, a 75 year old veteran, served a life sentence in prison without parole for being caught growing three dozen marijuana plants behind my son's house. Wow. Oh my God. And it says, hi. I'm Brock Turner, 20 year old who raped a woman on campus. I just got six months in prison. I'm also promised that with good behavior that would be cut down to three months. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 6:          00:46:21       Wow. Yeah. He's already out and there's like a armed protestors outside of his house. Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm so rape before joint skies. Yeah. No, that's just crazy. If you're going to rape a girl, don't do it on a pile of marijuana plants. That's what we learned here. That'd be a good idea. Plus three months. Good. Pardon? From Obama. I think

Speaker 5:          00:46:45       that guy. Yes, but Ken Obama, like reverse the sentence and put that kid back in jail. But the rapist back in jail. Did He. Did he admit to doing it?

Speaker 6:          00:46:56       I think I didn't they. It was one of those things. I think we're like, she got drunk, she fell asleep and he banged her while she was out cold. Yeah, I think so. What is it behind a dumpster though? Yeah, that's right. Oh, that's the one, right? Yeah. I passed out behind a dumpster. God Damn. That's like heard of that, but I've never actually, you know, I didn't realize people actually could pass up 100 dumpster. Like I've never been that drunk to where that's where I would lay down. I fucked by a dumpster but never slept there. He fucked by a dumpster, a dumpster grease on the ground. Now. Slippery boxes down. But

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       Oh my God, what a classy girl you must been. I told you about this and the guy came out and he caught us having sex and he's like, oh, you got nervous. He's like, Oh, you guys want some pizza? Because he thought we were homeless. Homeless Bank too.

Speaker 2:          00:47:42       Homeless People Bang on pizza boxes next to dumpsters. That's pretty much it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:47       There's this homeless guy that lives by or lives on the bench outside my starbucks and then he has gang green or diabetes or something so bad that his legs are just like purple and black and I was behind him in starbucks walking in and every time you took a step like this open sore but just like squirt blood on the floor of star. It was the grossest thing in there in the world. What did he get to drink? I don't want to waters. He thought he was taking a bath or something. But yeah, that's a problem. If you're running a business and that guy walks in, what do you do? They're super nice to him too because he's there every day just sleeping on the bench. The homeless thing is weird, right? Because those are people. They are people but goddamn they stink, you know? And it's like when they're around you, they're, they're reaching their hands out. Like if you run into one of them cookie homeless people that doesn't bathe ever. And then you know, they have like those dirty caked feet and they're wandering around. What I see is like a mentally ill person, you know, what I see is like a failure of the healthcare system or like how do you just let this person wander around like this. Like this is like they're having conversations with themselves and rummaging through their fucking shopping cart.

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       It's a very serious problem in La. The other day I saw something gross right in my neighborhood. Like right at my intersection, I saw a homeless lady sitting on a bus bench and it looked like she was wiggling her pants down a little bit. She did and she's just sitting on the bench and you know, it has those greats. It's not just like a solid bench. It goes through and she paid just through right through the greats. Like it was nothing. Just p flying out of her, oh my God. And I couldn't stop watching. All of a sudden I'm just like, you know, it's amazing because you're, you're looking at the amount of Pii that's coming out of this human being. This guy sad

Speaker 1:          00:49:34       because we just leave those people out there and I think this guy's a vet. Like that's what's even crazier that he fought for us and now he can't get medical attention for free. You know, it's also, some of them you have to think probably just left. They didn't want to deal with the healthcare system. They didn't want to be medicated all the time. They didn't want to stay in a loony bin. But then there was like Rayon during the Reagan administration that they let them loose on the streets like zombies. They changed the, uh, whatever the standard of treatment, like, you know, had to treat someone if they're x amount of crazy like that, you're on your own crazy flux and they just pushed them out into the street and there was just an influx of homeless people. You find them all over the east coast. It was, it was real weird. It was a big problem. I remember that. I think San Francisco, it was a big deal up there. It's a real big deal in places like Boston. That's where homelessness is a big deal because when they're out there they can fucking free solid. You can die out there.

Speaker 2:          00:50:32       I was uh, I was with Jeff Ross when he taped his special roast, the police where we did ride alongs with the Boston police department during the winter and these cops, they know all the homeless people, every single one of them and they show genuine concern and like, you know, that they have to go up to these guys and be like, Yo, the shelter, it's open, you know, get in there. It's a whole thing. Like, it's, that's actually during the winter time, one of their main things, and this is when all the, you know, obviously there's been a cop shootings and this and that, but their main concern for the most part, what we did on these ride alongs was tell homeless people to get to the shelter. They're just going to freeze. It's pretty much what Boston cops are doing during the winter unless there's a crazy call.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       It's just a, such a sad aspect of our society, like the people that are just, it's just for whatever reason, whether it's a mental issue just doesn't click. There's just something that's not clicking in there. Right. And then just wandering around through the streets and there's no one with them, you know, and they're just living in this strange life. I always wonder like what is reality to those people?

Speaker 2:          00:51:42       I was just going to say, I always wonder what they're thinking. Like sometimes it seems like they're having so much fun.

Speaker 1:          00:51:47       Do you remember that Robin Williams movie? Robin Williams played a crazy homeless guy that lives in central park and used to think he was a night or something like that. Oh yeah. What the fuck was that movie? It was like a mental illness movie was a movie about a Fisher King. The Fisher King. Yeah. Robin Williams was completely out of his mind

Speaker 1:          00:52:09       and he played this really I, if I, if there is that, I believe that's the plot of the movie. I hope we're not fucking it up, but that was the thing is that this guy was seeing some things that just weren't there. I mean obviously when you see those people talk to themselves or something going on there. Yeah. I wonder what it's like, what if it's like the simpsons ride at universal, like everything they see is like, whoa, hey, I like to think that they're smarter than us and they like talking to people that they can see that are actually there, but we are. We can't figure it out. A former radio DJ suicidally despondent because of terrible mistakes he made, finds redemption in helping a deranged homeless man who was an unwitting victim of that mistake. Huh? I don't remember much about this movie.

Speaker 2:          00:52:56       Suicidally. Despondent. Crazy, right?

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       Yeah. Have you ever written that a simpsons ride at universal now? Drop everything I have with the shooting one, right? You like shoot? No, no, no, no. The simpsons ride like you sit in like a car, but it's sort of like everything is happening. The car moves around a little bit left and right, but everything that's happening is happening on the screen in front of you like the screen, this gigantic

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       high def screen where you're in a first person perspective and you know it's taking on this wild, crazy fucking amazingly illustrated cartoon rot. It's fucking fun, Dude. It's really fun. Scott. Smells to remember the baby powder smell and it smells like when Maggie's on the screen. It's one of the best rides ever.

Speaker 4:          00:53:47       It's so good. I was really surprised at the transformers ride too. Is that good kids? Great. And work for a minute. I was on that one. I didn't like it. Really thought it was like, whoa. I will extend with the simpsons first. Yeah. Not to move.

Speaker 6:          00:54:01       Mentioned that Harry Potter thing yet at the Harry Potter rides. Amazing. So weird. Because I live next to universal and you're just driving and now there's a castle that you just drive. I'm like, why is Eric? Oh yeah, Harry Potter. It's cool. It's a long ass ride to the Harry Potter ride is really long. I don't know how long it takes, but you're like, Whoa, this is ride keeps going.

Speaker 4:          00:54:19       How do you go to university? You go when it's closed or something. Just go. Whatever. It was. Just go. That place is crazy for anybody. I can't imagine what it's like for you on. We'll just go where this guy definitely not rocking your fanny pack at university. My fanny pack there. Heck yeah, that's the best place to wear it. How dare you say I want. They just want my family back at Disneyland. Get swamped. Just say hi to people. Say Hi and keep moving. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:54:50       Did you talk about this George Carlin's cd that are uh, that he recorded the day before nine slash 11? No. Have you heard about this? He recorded a special the day before nine slash 11. It was actually called. I kinda like it when a lot of people die. Oh No. And then the following day, nine slash 11 happened. So they had to shelve it and I guess even in it he talks about Osama bin Ladin Holy Shit, Shit like that. And so there were about to release it or they just released it. They've held onto it this long is because of nine slash 11. It's really creepy.

Speaker 2:          00:55:21       A bunch of weird nine slash 11, things like that. I looked up, I found a couple yesterday actually it was like a, there's a band that was called. We are the World Trade Center. I am the World Trade Center. It was like a synth pop band in April of 2001. They released a song again, the name of the band. We are the World Trade Center and track 11 on that album that came out in April. Track 11 was called September. So like if you look at their albums near the World Trade Center, 11 dot September, that's crazy. So insane. And then there's

Speaker 4:          00:55:57       another thing.

Speaker 2:          00:55:59       Then there's another thing I can't remember which cartoon and it's either like Futurama, I think it is, but it's the craziest thing I saw in a long time in one of these weird cartoons. There was a moment where it pans over from them and there's a movie poster on the wall and it. And this was before nine slash 11, like right before nine slash 11. And it looks like a World Trade Center smoking like blatantly. Exactly like a world trade center fire.

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       There you go. And um, it says coming soon on the thing, like a movie poster just says coming soon. And they're blatantly a world trade center smoking. It's the craziest thing I've seen in a long time. I think it's either. Futurama,

Speaker 5:          00:56:39       I think though, as much content as people put out and the World Trade Center was always these iconic references. I mean it was in a Biggie Song, you know, blow up like the world trade. Yeah. You know, cover. Yeah. And those people did try to blow it up in, was it like 96 or something like that? They, they blew up that car bomb inside the basement. So it makes sense that somebody would have caught it. But that 11 and September, that's bananas. Yeah. That's some fucking premonition shit

Speaker 4:          00:57:07       it happened. You think they planned that? Like that, like knowing that nine slash 11 not but like knowing that if we do it on nine slash 11, it's nine slash 11. It's like emergency numbers, marketing one on one. It was easier, you know, they knew it was going to be a bigger deal because it's 9:11, nine slash 11, you know the maybe

Speaker 5:          00:57:26       yeah, maybe it would have happened in nine slash 12 and been just as fucked up and people find reasons to attach numbers in meanings to things, but it's totally possible that they know are. I mean, obviously they know nine slash 11 is for emergency, that they did it on nine slash 11 because of that, but would have made any difference. It was nine, nine or 9:10. It was. It was a devastating attack and tragedy. The other stuff is just like, really?

Speaker 4:          00:57:51       If they did it on July 11th, seven slash 11 would have gone out of business everywhere. Seven. Sorry. Were you going with that? If there's going to be more to this, that's it. But like thinking about that, about people for seven, 11 July fourth will be a big smack in our face and march would be really good if it was March 11th at 3:11.

Speaker 4:          00:58:11       Oh, that, that band? Yeah. They make good weed pens. Yeah, they do. Just one of the first people to smoke the prototype last year on the 3:11 crews with peanut. The Bass player. How strong is that, Ben? They make their own weed pens. It's a very strong move. They're the coolest man. They have, like they've always been ahead of the game. Live show. It's because they're all generic. Uh, like Chinese, you know, models. So anyone can make their own weed pen by just putting a logo on it. You can buy them in bulk. Yeah, I've seen all the same. We'd pins you can go to. There's this website you can buy like 300 of them and they'll even like put a logo on it for you. So it looks like your we'd pin. They were red. They were really hands on with this one though. This they like tried out a ton of. I know because he told us all about it

Speaker 5:          00:58:53       but that would just be like the oil. So they tried out a ton of canisters to.

Speaker 4:          00:58:59       I just know that it took them like they should, like they went through a long process. So probably both. It's good stuff comes up. A highly approved. You try the orange one. I don't know what one I tried. That's what I remember is it tasted like an actual orange and got me correct. Yeah. No that's good stuff. Atheist's nightmare acs night man. It's this. Well it

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       is intelligent design though. Somebody made it there. Um, those bands also. Like what kind of band is three? One, one,

Speaker 2:          00:59:30       three, 11 is really their own type of thing because it's like ray gay mixed with heavy rock, like they go back and forth. Sometimes it's, sometimes you'll just forget that they're about to like drop. Like they have killer guitarist and high energy. They have two lead singers, one guy with a really smooth voice and the other guys sorta like a rapper do all this while they're high. Alright. Oh, I'd imagine so. But also like, I feel like a couple of days, I feel like a lot of those guys have families now and stuff and uh, they might calm down a little bit, but I'm sure they, they have to get stoned. I used to like them. I haven't heard anything from them in a long time. Well they made a greatest hits album way back in like 98 or something like that. You know, that they are, they are notorious for being one of the best live bands to see if there's a whole cruise ship with them. Right? Yeah. It was the coolest thing I've ever done. Thought it was about, uh, it was actually five days. I did two shows and I was like shaky about it because this was back when like that, like toilets exploded on that one cruise or whatever. Everybody died. Well, everybody is freaking out. It's like

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       one where the guy was trying to wave. His girlfriend came around with the boat and then he, uh, hit the ground and killed like a ton of people. Bunch of people.

Speaker 2:          01:00:47       I'm talking about carnival one that like, got all poopy everywhere. Oh, that one too. Yeah, I remember that. That happened right around then and I'm like, man, I cruise ship we're going to see. But I knew three slash 11 was an awesome life band like I did out of. I've seen them actually quite a few times. Like in high school and stuff, dude, there's a railing

Speaker 1:          01:01:02       below that railing is the ocean and you're going 50 miles an hour. Good luck.

Speaker 2:          01:01:05       It's awesome. Fuck you. I had so much fun because they're performing on the main deck. Fun cruises. I agree. Fuck cruises. So tell me what it was like. It was the greatest thing ever. I came back from that five day cruise and got everything in my life done like crazy because it's so. It's literally perfect. Going to Jamaica on the most boring part of the whole trip was the half a day we spent in Jamaica before getting back on and going, I stepped on some needle. These sponge in the ocean like, this sucks. Get back on this luxury cruise ship. A bunch of shows going on. There's a casino you can get away to your room if you want to disappear. It's really a thousand times better than I thought it was going to be. If you didn't like Jamaica. Now it's now good. God. No. Well I'll go ahead and try the chicken. It was like just bad. Everybody's cooking and it's just dirty. There's bees everywhere in nature like sucks, but cruise ships are great because it's like a fake name. Going 50 miles an hour with Caribbean era around you is perfect. I mean it's the perfect life.

Speaker 1:          01:02:18       Oh, you're going to live on boat when you're an old crazy

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       man. You're. Are you going to be like one of them? Howard Hughes type dudes? Just out on a boat, just John Hubbard style with your own captain's outfit, who give yourself metals every year. Highs for a new job today I'm want to get myself a metal pin. A metal onto your. You would have like a camel colored coat. Maybe a light camel. Something sophisticated. Yeah, probably. Well my older brother just got like way in way into it. Bought a boat and everything and he's been sailing for like a decade, but he's like way into it now. Yeah. He's got a cool apartment right on Venice beach and a boat and the dock. So he just goes blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, I'm going to go into the ocean.

Speaker 1:          01:02:53       It makes sense. I mean it's like a giant uncharted area or a an a on. There's no roads. There's no like you can go wherever you want. Like that's the cool thing about like being in the ocean. If you have a boat, there's no road. There's no one. You have to go here. You have to take a right there and you take the 1:10 to the 18th. No, no. Let's just go wherever you want to go. What do you want to go? You want to go to Catalina? Go to Catalina.

Speaker 4:          01:03:16       It's crazy. Life under there. You throw a fishing pole out to catch something. You throw it on the grill right there. You just scan it. Pam. Don't even have to get up or down.

Speaker 1:          01:03:26       You know? They're finding out that a lot of those tropical fish are making their ways into the waters around southern California because of the global warming, so they're having like yellowfin tuna or all over southern California. Water's. We used to have to go to like Hawaii to catch those things so we can catch them right here now. That's awesome. Getting your boats on.

Speaker 4:          01:03:46       Then the cruise ship thing. I'm telling you. I mean it's a. it's a whole thing, but what if someone's really annoying? They just fall. You were on that cruise ship. That doesn't happen. Stuck on them. It doesn't happen now. You can lose them. You could lose him. Did you have a huge. You have to understand how huge this is. Like a mall. It's like a small city. Yes. It's like a giant mall or a small city. How long does it take to walk around? Was also like six or seven floors. You know what I mean? So boom, boom, boom. That's what it's all like a hotel. Almost like a Vegas hotel. It's floating. That's what it's like. It's like a vegas style. Huge hotel. Like how the mgms connected to the New York, New York or whatever. It's like super duper huge and the main deck, I mean they're doing shows at nighttime and it is unbelievable going to a normal concert where you're just not moving after that. Sort of like, I'm missing something here.

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       They must have cruises that go successfully every day to their destination. Smooth. Everyone has a great experience. There is no issues whatsoever. It's like airplanes. All it takes is one poopy mistakes. There's one dude who wants a wave at his girlfriend and beaches the boat and drowned a bunch of people or one husband who throws his wife over the side to hear about that guy. There was a guy who through his wife over the side like newlyweds. There's some fucking creepy people out there, man. There's a cruise ship website like cruise ship reports.org

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       or something like that and it tells you every time there's a problem with a cruise ship and it's shocking how many there are. There's like problems all the time and like, and it shows how many people died and stuff and why and how and how often do people die from cruise. Crazy shit happens on cruise. Like you sold the elevator, right? The guy that got stuck in the elevator and it started dripping down blood of his body because he got crushed on the, on the cruise ship in a couple months ago, dripping down black. This guy working on an elevator and the elevator crushed them. And so he was working on the elevator and went up to the top and then. So there's video of just blood gushing down the elevator door and people are like, what the heck is that? And it's just blood like it looks like a horror movie. Oh my God. Yeah. But there's a real. Yeah, yeah. Fuck it. Yeah. It's on the video. You got to see that.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       They don't need to see that. It sets a weird way to go though. Get squashed in an elevator.

Speaker 6:          01:06:08       This is why I don't work on elevators. People ask me all the time, Tony, we have a problem with the elevator. Can you get on top of it and fix it?

Speaker 1:          01:06:17       Innovator before? No. Yeah, when I was a little kid. Yeah. Oh Shit. Yeah. It was like seven years old, but have only 20 minutes, you know, like probably blew a fuse or something like that. But um, I was in New York recently at one of the theaters. I think it was the beacon and they have this dude who runs the elevator back there. Yeah, I was with you. That's right. You remember that the guy had like the handle and the exchanging. It's like old school. The old school elevator where you have to have an operator is like you. There's no buttons to press. This guy had to get you up and down. So it was. Would it be saved from the 19 twenties or something like that? Yeah, it might. Yeah. What's that might have been before that net total. Nineteen, 29. Oh, that's it. That's right. I took a video of the dude. That's right. Wasn't that brother Jose? Jose. This is a old elevator. We're in here. How long has this kind of elevator been here for 20 night.

Speaker 1:          01:07:15       I said. Yeah, it was the old ones on instagram. You can only get 15 seconds or 30 seconds or something like that. Yeah, but that dude was operating that thing like you had. It was a little lever to pull up and pull down bad ass hold elevator, but I'm sure they fix it all the time. Yeah. This thing up to that, it's always. You can. There's always that thing on the inside. That was in Italy. I got an elevator from the 1800, the hotel at a 18. Hundreds of elevator. Yeah. It's super weird. There's old ones. You guys shut the door and shut the door and get to get inside. It'll still work, but yeah, we'll just leave the door open. Yeah, you could just door open and grab the floor as you're passing and rip your fucking arms off. He could do that if you looked at like how many people died from elevators versus how many people have died from coconuts. You'd be shocked. No one's scared of coconuts, but coconuts. Fuck up about 150 people here should know that. Now, do you know when people die deer every year? A lot. 200 in the United States. Wow. 200 deaths. They die from deer every year. Every year you're driving down the road listening to led Zeppelin, and you hit this stupid fucking county forest horse and it goes flying through your windshield and kicks your brains out.

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       Two hundred people a year. How many people do you think die on average in elevators per year? I know pretty in the US. Six prince's. One of them. Twenty six did die in an elevator. Yeah, for real. Yeah. Twenty 6 million elevators every year in the United States. Jesus. How many die from coconuts? I'm saying coconuts. Over 100 a year. I think so worldwide. I would say worldwide. More than 100 people a year die from coconuts. Coconuts. Coconuts falling on their head. Not Allergy. Skin jacked. Fiftieth. Yeah. Bitch. That's worldwide, worldwide. Good. Imagine if it was all in Jakarta, in Jakarta, coconuts and people walking home from school with your buddies to have them die. I just a chest an embarrassing way to die, right?

Speaker 1:          01:09:34       Oh No. That, that Husky sound. Those things clobbering you on the head song. The last thing you hear is your friends laughing at you because that's probably how they figured out. The coconuts were edible. It killed someone's friend. Someone freaked out and hit it with a rock and went, oh, we're good. This is some shit in here. I killed my friend back then you are dead. They didn't know that a coconut wasn't alive. If something came out of the sky and killed your friend and you know you were so stupid that you didn't even have clothes yet. That's probably the first people that figured out they could eat coconuts. It'd be like the first balls, right? Fruits. Mike probably sort of just hearing now. They realized they could play soccer and stuff for sure. Definitely. Wow. Dude.

Speaker 5:          01:10:16       I saw a demonstration of the day. We've showed demonstrations that lie next stuff before, but this was the most ridiculous one lie next is this plastic stuff that they can spray on things and they sprayed on like the undercarriages of some trucks and like, like four wheelers that go out into the country. You know those guys. Those dudes do those four. We'll crawl fucking things and smashed up against rocks. They'll lie next to their whole truck. They'll. That'll be the paint for the outside of it. Well, they took a watermelon. They sprayed a watermelon with lynette and dropped it off of like, I think it was like from 450 feet up. This is the brick one. This is when we've already seen. But this one's kind of fascinating to like check this out. Like just show how they did it before. So they, they drop this brick off the top of the building now and without the Linacs oh, that's a, that's a, that's when they shot the walls, the watermelon video. But there's a bunch of shit before it. Oh, is it the watermelon woman? Oh yeah. It is. There. It is.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       Trying to find it there. It's right there, these guys. So anyway, there's one of them where they're on a tower. The tower one is a watermelon one dude. I think it's a different one. Yeah, it's not the same video. Is that it? Yeah. Okay. Take all of these are in there. This is a different one because this one it's red, but it's the same goddamn thing. So I guess they just couldn't hit it with a hammer here. They sprayed this shit on a watermelon, but the watermelon just. He's like hitting it with a hammer. It's just bouncing, but that's not as impressive. Cv, you could find the one where they dropped the watermelon off the tower lie. Next. Watermelon, 450 feet drop. I mean they threw this watermelon off the tower without the line x and it hits the street and literally vaporizes just. They hit it.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       The throw the [inaudible]. It hits the ground. It bounces 10 feet in the air that the inside of it was just watermelon juice. It just became watermelon juice. But this stuff is so tough. It's just some weird freaky plastic. That'd be fun to like Prank Gallagher before he goes onstage. Sprays water break is back, open its arms would literally fly off his body. So you can you buy this consumer? Yeah. It's just. I know my friend Remy, his dad actually owns a shop up in Reno where they spray trucks with this stuff. Wow. Yeah. Like people that want like a really heavy duty application of their trucks are going to drive in the woods and branches are going to smack up against it all the time. They just spray their whole truck with this shit. That's cool. Yeah. There's a company called m d I think it's called Dev Rolo d e V e r o l o. and they make these ridiculous souped up Toyota Tundras that are bulletproof and they spray line x all over them.

Speaker 1:          01:12:58       So like they, they make them like regular and they make them bulletproof that like they make them for like, you know, some royal family or some shit that comes here from somewhere else and they have this. What is this? This is the video of the. Yeah, lie next. Didn't make some other guys just put this video out a couple like this past month. Linacs didn't make the video, but they did use line x, so let's watch it. Like here you go. So he throws this watermelon off. This ridiculous fucking power. Look at this. It hits the ground. That's crazy. Yeah. Wow. Now can you cut into it like is it possible to get to that watermelon now or is it like, yeah, you can cut it into, but look at this. Look how hits the ground. It's like a ball. I mean it seems like a medicine ball, like someone threw a medicine ball.

Speaker 1:          01:13:47       What about bullet versus that? What happened? No bullet would go through it. It's just it has a unique ability to disperse, shock and rebound and not break open. It's really cool. See if you find those trucks, Dev Rolo, it's called. I think it's like some Russian company or something like that. They make these souped up cars that are covered in this shit about a lot of companies do that. I guess cover business line shit to protect it from accidents then yes, it would definitely protect you more from accidents and not having it for sure. It would definitely make it harder for an impact to get, you know, like if your. If your car has a certain thickness of steel on the door and you had double that thickness, I would just assume there'll be safer. Right. Doesn't that make sense?

Speaker 6:          01:14:33       Well, it makes you wonder like if it caves in then that also absorbs a lot of the energy. But if you have bounced off it seems like there'd be more snapping. Snapping.

Speaker 1:          01:14:45       I'll take the snapping to the penetrating. That's how you. Your body gets crushed by a truck hitting you on the side. I don't know. Maybe a combination of the two. Yeah, I don't. I think maybe I'm just make sense that if it was a thicker, stronger material, like if you were driving around in a tissue paper car, you'd feel real nervous. Right. It just seems to reason that if you would get thicker and thicker gauge of metal, so if you took like a regular gauge metal that they have on like a Chevy Silverado or something like that and you spray this line, x shit over it, this has got to make it stronger. There's just no way it doesn't. If that's what it does with a watermelon off a 450 foot tower,

Speaker 6:          01:15:23       what was you remember Saturn's where you can scratch them. You could kick them and they never. They were made out of plastic. Is that plastic? Wouldn't that be like a safety hazard then if it was plastic? No, no, because as long as it's

Speaker 1:          01:15:36       strong, like plastics can be really fucking strong. Like there's certain types of plastics, like certain types of composite fibers that elect technically plastics that are ridiculously strong. Like they use resins and they have these types of plastics that they can, you know, they can make plastic where you can make a plastic knife. We could kill somebody with it. I mean plastic can be really hard.

Speaker 6:          01:16:01       That's why it's such a good feature. That car, I loved my Saturn and when I sold it it was like 12 years old and it looked like the day I bought it or like brand new because it didn't scratch her. Did they make those anymore? Now they went out of business, but that technology that you think they would use it in other cars are and it's probably not gonna last. I think cars want to break and go get more parts. Like gms are like, they like that thick at these trials. This is a pocket

Speaker 1:          01:16:25       immobile. Wow. That looks great. Nothing insane. One Mile per gallon. Yeah. Click on one of the pictures of them. Things like the interceptor, the challenger, the expedition. Yeah. So all that stuff is linacs there. The entire outside of the truck, the bumpers. Everything is covered in that line. X Shit does it God damn tank. That thing. You got a little Dick. That's your ride. You're like, okay, I want to distract you. Like bullet bullet tests on it or anything, you know? Will they do have bulletproof versions of the car? I don't know if that stuff is bulletproof. I would doubt that it is, but I would say it's definitely better than not having it on, but look at that thing. So manly. Ooh, I got you to Ben and Kevin prayers. Auto drive car the other day. Oh, the Tesla. It took you froze. Whoa. Cool man. So weird. And that. Yeah, when he did it, it's hard to trust that like it's, it's weird him just like letting go. And he said when he first bought it he was really scared and nervous, but now he's like, you know, laptop out like doing shit you shouldn't be doing. And, and I watched it like detect the, you know, the side car and stuff like that. And it stopped. It slowed down

Speaker 4:          01:17:36       because you know, the guy that designed the self driving car was Asian and you're like, you know, how do you know his age limit Asian, Asian computer people. This is a bad attempt at some racist humor and I'm not going to get. I can guarantee you the person that find it engineered the self driving cars and Asian.

Speaker 1:          01:17:54       If you're wrong, you have to suck. Brian Cochran, show him. I'll take a couple of strokes in your mouth. No, I'll take the donkey cousin. Just real quick little but the uh, the figure wrong that the IPAD or whatever, the display and stuff. Crazy screen sexy, but does it well, I would think that like, that would use up a lot of juice. Like why would you have such a giant screen? It seems like if you have a true. Yeah. But you know, I didn't know. I didn't know about the fast charging because we always talked about this in the past about how like you can't drive to vegas though, where they also have a stop in Vegas that you plug it in for five minutes and you get like two more hours. Here's his effect though. What was the last time you drove to Vegas? Uh, drove up for the fight. That's the five months ago. I always drive. It's, it's cheap. Well, it's cheap, but don't you get annoyed being in the car for four hours now. I'm used to four hours of fun. Me and pete smoke jolene wholly on like, let's say that you were driving back though when you were in that Vegas traffic on the way back. It was terrible.

Speaker 1:          01:18:55       It's true. You just owned you. Yeah, but you're stuck though. It's two lanes for 400 miles to make it to the stop. You'd be three hours away from it. He's right. Fuck, you know. I mean there's not just one. There's not just one thing. There's a lot, but he's got a really good point. If you're stuck in that crazy vegas traffic coming home, you know how ridiculous I traffic is traffic that makes you wake up at 4:00 in the morning just to avoid it. Yeah, I did it once. I did it once and I barely made it because I left at 7:30. I was like, I'll just get up before everybody else. Oh No, no. People are already up and driving at 7:30.

Speaker 4:          01:19:34       It messed me up last week and coming back from Mcgregor Diaz because they're like, you gotta gotta gotTa beat the traffic. I'm like, whatever. If we get there, whatever. I ended up missing the summer slam party. I Miss Summer Slam last week, which was huge.

Speaker 1:          01:19:47       Poor baby. How long did it take you to drive home? It was like six, seven hours, something like that. See, that is fucking ridiculous. Never been caught in that. So ridiculous. But if you had a gasoline, like a buddy of mine has a 50 gallon tank in his truck. Fifty gallons so he could just drive it, fills that bitch up

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       and just. I mean it gets shitty gas mileage. There's a catch 22 because you're packing around all that weight, but if he's driving from vegas he doesn't have to pull over. It's like the opposite of a tesla.

Speaker 6:          01:20:20       Yeah. I tried like my car's dead right now and I tried to jump start my car with my girlfriend's car, which is a, a Prius Prius and he can't do that. It was the second little 12 volt battery inside those cars. Like it's not a regular it. You can't do it. It says in the book do not do. You could just destroy this car. Oh, that would be crazy if you blew that car up. I know those cars blow up, man. How'd your car died? My car's got dead. So many things wrong with her. Did you ever see

Speaker 5:          01:20:48       that? A member, when those fiscal Karmas blew up, the fisker Karma was that dope looking space age electric car that actually had a solar panel on the roof and that solar panel on the roof charged up your radio so your radio wasn't draining the battery as you were driving around and they were cool looking cars like definitely the best looking out of all the electric cars and they left a bunch of them on a dock in Brooklyn, I think it was, or a no, North Carolina or something like that. Anywhere. Somewhere by the water and the water came in the sea level. Rose flooded the parking lot and all the cars went underwater and started exploding. Wow. Boom, boom, boom, boom. A. I don't know. We tried to find it last time, right? We couldn't find it. Look, look at them all. They all just blew up. Wow.

Speaker 6:          01:21:40       Pinto is. Is that what it was in the eighties that were blowing up? Is that the right cars? Because it said Tesla under there. Okay. Superstorm sandy. Yeah. 16 fisker Karma, you know, and everybody was like, yeah, we're good. And that company just went under. It's like the space x rockets that keep blowing up on the thing. They're like, hey, we're going. It's pretty soon we'll fly you out to Mars. But meanwhile they can't even get out of Florida. I wouldn't fly on one of those fucking things for a hundred years for the. Got It, right. Yeah. It's a noxious. She'd pull up a real fisker

Speaker 5:          01:22:12       Karma so you can see what one actually looks like. It was a beautiful car. Justin Bieber had one. It was totally chrome.

Speaker 6:          01:22:19       Oh, that's it? Yeah. That car chrome, that bitch. I couldn't. That one. Oh, are they back? So the back river road. Oh, they have a new car. The revero.

Speaker 5:          01:22:28       Ooh. Why Karma? It's always been Karma. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:22:33       I saw bieber driving that car once and it is. That should be illegal because you ever see that episode of chips where the. There was a truck driving a bunch of mirrors in the sun, hit the mirrors and all these people were like flying off the freeway. Same thing with that. It was just like this giant glared coming down the stream. You go back,

Speaker 5:          01:22:50       do go back to the actual car. I want to say it. Scroll down. What you were looking at right here. What Brian was talking right there in the middle? Yeah. Picture of their car wrap. That's a wrap. A wrap on it. Oh God. It's so pretty. Is that a Karma

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       data is so pretty. Karma revero because if they just brought it back, that is a beautiful car, man. That is a goddamn be. That is without a doubt. The best. Looking out of all those electric cars like by far is is this gas tank option on it? That's what I think so. I don't think so. I think this is all electric. God Damn. That thing is sweet. That is sweet. That's, that's the. That's so much better looking than all the other ones because that looks like a Maserati or something, doesn't it? I kind of like the BMW. That's like that though. That looks like a Maserati fucked at Jaguar. That's electrical at the beer that we go on a vacation and come on Friday came in a Jaguar and made that thing. What's the BMW electric sports car that kind of looks like that? That's it.

Speaker 1:          01:23:48       I don't like that one. Well, it's. It's kind of cool looking on the outside, but the issue is it has a really skinny tires and it does piss poor performance. It's not a fast car. It's a super expensive car and it's just super space age car, but he looked at. It's like zero to 60 in comparison to like other cars at bmw makes like the m four and look at. It's like track time or trackability sales. Skinny. His tires are. See the back tires. Those are really skinny, like that's not. Well, no, that's just what it comes with. This is not like a performance car. It's a beautiful sleek piece of amazing automotive engineering. It's design is incredible, but that's not what I like. A car that looks like that and actually goes fast. That's not. I mean it probably goes fast in comparison to a lot of shit, but if you compare the numbers I bet to like between that and like a porsche nine slash 11 or something like that would probably not even close.

Speaker 1:          01:24:42       Kevin did. It's a tesla like zero to 70 while I was in the car and I've been in like your cars before in the past, but it was like three seconds and there was no engine sounds so it kind of freaked you out. It was like being on a roller coaster. I. It took my breath away. It was like those cars are ridiculously fast. It's crazy. And they're four wheel drive too, right? Yep. It's four wheel drive and it has this ridiculous engine where there's no transmission. Like in terms of like gears, it's like a direct drive, so it just just goes like instant on the solar roof will create enough energy to power the car. No other vehicle sold in us has ever offered this capability. Our owners consider our solar roof and important element in our brand identity. And we listened today. It's about to come out.

Speaker 1:          01:25:27       Oh, in two days it comes out. This whole episode has been a long commercial. No, that is dope though. That the fucking car. I mean, especially in La, in La, that means you can drive that thing around all the time because it's always sunny. So if that thing actually can power the car, that's amazing. It does not seem right to soon as that hits a rock, it's going to explode. How much is it? How much is this car? I would assume we'll find out in two days. Um, I would bet it's over 100 grand. I think those are super expensive cars. See if you could find out how much the Karma was. Is that just the power

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       of the car for like, like the electronics and display but not driving? No. Saying the first one and be able to power the car. Wow. Yeah, that's insane. That is insane. If they, if they really did figure that out, it's over. If you could figure out a way to make a car run, especially here where it's sunny every day just on solar power and you can listen to radio. You don't have to. There's no restrictions and if you're stuck in traffic, it's not only is it not like draining your battery is probably better because it's just not using as much energy, but it's just being blasted by the sun and recharging. Nighttime you're fucked. Yeah, but it feel like you would store enough like a tesla does. You know? If it kept it at 100 percent, I'd be just like a cell phone. Be Amazing, man.

Speaker 5:          01:26:44       If they could figure out how to do that, that would be amazing. I mean that would, at least around here in Arizona and places like Colorado, places where it's sunny, they would put other cars out of business. It doesn't seem possible though because that sets a small solar panel I didn't think. Was that powerful enough to actually power a car? Think solar panels are getting more efficient. They must be. Well, I know that Elon Musk has this new solar bank thing that they're doing for your house where it's. They'll put solar in your house and the batteries themselves are so much smaller than they've ever been before. They're cool looking and they like stick to your wall. He'll like you have have the mounted on the wall and it's just, it's not like a whole room like you used to need like a whole room filled with batteries to run a house on solar power, so not really that way anymore and as these things are just going to get, if just the idea that you could power a house on solar power today is crazy but true.

Speaker 5:          01:27:42       So if you can power a house, it's just a matter of time before that stuff gets better and better and better to the point where. I mean you could probably wind up doing it in Seattle with what minimal sun comes through. The clouds that's going to happen. They're going to keep making these things better just like they've done with everything else, whether it's televisions or cell phones or cars themselves. Cars today, dude, this is the golden era for automobiles. Like there's people look back and say, oh, they didn't. Nobody designs cars like they didn't sixties to look at to look at your right. Yeah, those sixties cars were amazing to look at, but try steering one of those pieces of shit. Try hitting the brakes if fucking stroller rolls out in front of your car though. Those things were terrible. They were terrible handling. They're terrible on every corner.

Speaker 5:          01:28:30       The car went bent sideways and then he had to like hang on onto it while it righted itself. Like the whole car was made out of like a flexible piece of aluminum tray, like w, w, w, w, but they were shit. Those cars were pieces of shit. The design was terrible. Like they literally would. The air would hit them when they would drive. They were not only were they not aerodynamic, they will like scoops. There were like a sale. It was like driving with a sale. Like the front actually caught the air and it slowed the car down. I don't know much about old cars. I didn't have a dad growing up. Yeah. Portrait you being. Well I didn't learn from my dad either. My Dad really doesn't give a shit about cars, my stepdad. But if you ever seen like an old like show a 1970 dodge charger.

Speaker 5:          01:29:24       Here's a perfect example. This shit is so an aerodynamic but undeniably dope. One of my favorite movies, death proof. I'm pretty sure that's around the type of car. It's a dodge challenger. That's a challenger or charger. I'm not a challenge, but if your car and death proof. Have you seen that movie? I think that's. That's. That's a 70. That's interesting. I thought that was a 69. Maybe they did something different to the bumper cars. A 70 it let go right above it. Go right above it. The one, the black one. Sorry. That's. That's one too, but that black one. That's a 70 car. The bumper goes around the top all the way around like a fish with its mouth open. I think that other one is a 69. The far left one, but that far left one. It's fucking beautiful. Look at that thing. God, I think that's a 69 now.

Speaker 5:          01:30:11       Unless maybe they changed the bumper. Look how fucking sick that is. Have you seen death proof? I don't know. Is that the Quentin Tarantino thing? Yeah. No, you would love it. Look what they just did. They just reversed the picture. Right hand, left hand drive. They just flip this picture around. God, that thing so pretty. So that that car was in that movie that I'm not exactly sure of, but that's the car right there. So yeah, that's a charger for sure. There was one that they had in fast and furious that was all bare metal and it costs more than a million dollars to make is ridiculous. It's silver now. There's a silver one. Silver Dodge charger. Just Google Silver Jewelry, silver dodge charger. Fast and the furious. Do you miss sick fish your own? Have you? Is it still alive? No. Fast. And the furious Jamie A. Yeah. That Reggie Bush character has it. Um, that's it right there. Look at that thing. Wow. There is no pain on that thing. There's this clear coat over the bare metal and it like, it took forever to make the car. Took years to make it like literally a rolling work of art.

Speaker 7:          01:31:34       Hm.

Speaker 5:          01:31:34       It's crazy looking car. No, that's sick. Fish was a piece of shit and it looked great, but it was, it was just not sorted outright, is not built correctly. And that Reggie Bush guy had to do a bunch of things to it after I did a bunch of things to it. I keep calling that Reggie Bush guy. You're hearing this Reggie. I'm just high. Don't listen to me. Do they? No disrespect. Did they make electric motorcycles? Yes. That is a dope car though. I miss. I miss it. It wasn't a fun car to drive though. Tell you that. Is that you? Yeah, I'm just going to say it looks like that was a I am, but I had that car made in like a, a for a TV show in like 2005 or something like that. It was a. It was really pretty. But the insides and the way it drove, it was just, it was designed to look really pretty.

Speaker 5:          01:32:24       It wasn't designed to drive well the sound of it. When you would pull into the comedy store though, it was so awesome. It was ridiculous. Giant engine five, 28. Hemi just roared. It was 600 and something horsepower. Such a stupid car. Just sounds like Joey Diaz murdering it sounds like war. It sounded like some death machine, you know, he just wasn't safe. Like I had to get a bunch of things done to it. The suspension detached from the frame in my driveway. After I'd been on the highway going 70 miles an hour, just 10 minutes before I pulled in, pulled into my driveway and my car went sideways and I was like, what the fuck? And I get out and the wheel is like half hanging off and dug into the quarter. The fender. I was like, what the fuck? I was just on the highway. Like if that broke loose on the highway, I could've easily been dead.

Speaker 5:          01:33:14       He's like, when you're going 70 miles an hour, you start flipping. Good luck. Who knows what's going to happen is once in a car, I'm going fast on the freeway, like Tripoli and have all these guys were on a road trip and a tire popped. That's crazy. Oh yeah, man. Dangerous itself. It's just dead. Yeah. Very dangerous. Crazy. I ran over a, you know, those metal things. Not, not the, uh, the railroad. When you think of a railroad tie. I'm not the wooden. Not Wooden piece, right. That's what would that be a metal bar, the metal stuff that would be a piece of like a railroad track. Somebody had left a piece of a railroad track on the highway, like a 12 inch section of it and I hit that thing and it was like someone shot my tire out with a rifle. He just my car when my car, like literally caught air.

Speaker 5:          01:34:03       It was a small car too. I think it was my supra caught air, blew my fucking wheel apart, like literally blew it apart and blew the tire. Half a part two and I was in the middle of the highway and it was a mile from the exit and I was gonna pull over and I was going to call aaa, but kid I went to high school with, did that and died. He got hit by a car. He was, um, on the side of the road and he was trying to change a tire and a guy just plowed right into him and killed him. And I never forgot that. And I just drove gangster style on a completely blown out. Randall. It was banging and sparking and it smelled like fire. It was like bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. Just sparks and it's the rubber because the rubber was like half hanging on, half hanging off.

Speaker 5:          01:34:50       It was just ripping and flying around. When I was driving I drove all the way to that fucking exit and all the way to the side. I just kept driving. It was chewing up the sidewalk. It was probably fucking up the road, like all the asphalt asphalts not that hard, you know, fuck your rooms up there. Do you remember? Said? Yeah, there, there was no rim left. It wasn't a rim anymore. I mean it was just the whole outside of it was just completely destroyed. I fucked up a lot of suspension parts too, I think if I remember correctly, but they towed it and fixed it, but it was like, at least I'm alive bitch. I'm like, I would, I would way rather or I would have left it there and just ran down the side of the road and made sure I was like way off to the right. I'm not staying in my fucking car on the road. It's just too goddamn dangerous. Especially today. I see so many people fucking on their phones driving on the highway at night. We see their face lit up by the phone. It's so distracting.

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       You see cops with their lights on getting hit continuously. So I mean a normal car. It's got to happen all the time.

Speaker 5:          01:35:52       Yeah, yeah. It's happening all the time. But um, yeah. So that was the most fucked up thing I ever drove over in my car. But God damn, that was loud. Like black. I saw it too, like last second I was like, fuck the fuck. Like, you know, you just realize there's not a goddamn thing you can do if you swerve and you don't hit that. I was like, well, if I swerve, I'm probably gonna flip this car or something fucked up. It's going to happen. I'm definitely going to lose control of it. I might be able to just ride out this impact. That's what I want. I'm doing, but that's nothing. That's nothing. You know, I watched this video once of this. A car was on a snowy road and they were driving in one direction and there's a semi driver in the other direction and the car in the snowy road starts fishtailing and they lose control of the car and they go right into the oncoming lane and get hit by a semi and literally disintegrate. It is one of the best examples of how fleeting life could be like you're watching these people that drive in this car and then it goes sideways and then they're facing the truck and the truck hit them head on. Sixty miles an hour over. It just destroys the car. The car just becomes like little pieces of things that go all up in the air. It's a. it's fucked up. Look up man.

Speaker 2:          01:37:13       This weekend I did the odd ball comedy fest in a Detroit, Chicago and Toronto and Brian Regan has his own tour bus. That stuff is crazy because you don't even feel like you're moving at all. You're just chilling, hanging out, just hanging out in his apartment. He has got the relocation, real state of the art one, like the newest, newest, newest, and he helped design it. All this stuff like he like got to like play architect with it. Like I want this there, I want to counter their chairs there, make those captain chairs instead of couches and it was just, it was like being in the future because you're moving in a house that doesn't feel like it's moving. So does he stay in hotels or did you just stay in his tour? Bus Holidays in the tour bus has a master bedroom, has everything. You don't ever need to do anything.

Speaker 2:          01:38:03       Again, weird relationship he has with that guy who drives him around where he hit the guy that drives them around is a second generation tour bus driver. He's been doing it 30 years. His father was a tour bus driver for all these big things and he basically bottom like. It's like when he's on tour, that's his guy and he's a super pro so he knows what he's doing, like a surgeon and he's cool. Obviously he doesn't bother him or whatever. You know what I mean? What a weird life it is, unbelievable, and it's the best thing ever because you know how after a shell we have to go back to the hotel and then the next morning you have to get up and go to the airport and that takes an hour and then you have to spend an hour there early. He leaves the venue and immediately outside of whatever the closest back door is is the door to his bus, which is the house, so then you.

Speaker 2:          01:38:56       You leave the venue in. You're immediately at your own after party. You're immediately where you want to be. Whoever you invite can come with you, but you leave then and that driver drives all night to wherever you want them to. When you wake up the next morning in your bed at your destination, instead of waking up at a hotel and having to go to the airport and then having to get on the plane and then having to get out of lax or wherever you are, you just walk out that door that you walked in from the venue. You walk out the door again and you're at your house. I realized that this is the actual, like new goals. I got new goals. It's called bus goals, goals, trying to sleep. He slams on the brakes. You wake up, doesn't have car accident, you catch on fire. Didn't Ralphie have a boss? Ralphie is a bus. Ralphie is a mansion. No. Yeah, Ralphie has a bus but this and it's cool. But this bus, I've been on some cool buses. I'm friends with John Rich who's like a huge country music star. Awesome bus. But this bus, state of the art

Speaker 1:          01:39:58       says a bus. He did the bus thing for awhile. I had a bus and you would bring the bus to a movie sets to like as kids can hang out on the bus. Bus was dope. Fully set up and then he drove across the country in the bus. And what he did was his family was on the bus and he was behind them on a motorcycle so he could just ride his Harley on the fucking highway right behind the bus across the country. I mean, she's just living fantasies. This point.

Speaker 2:          01:40:28       Can I put a c do on top of my bus? And uh, but yeah, it's crazy you ever worked with Brian Regan?

Speaker 1:          01:40:35       Well, I've done some stuff with him. He's done this podcast. I know I've done some gigs with them back in New York, like back in the day. He's a great guy. He, it

Speaker 2:          01:40:42       was so much fun and I've gotten to meet all my heroes. Ron White's been hanging out like an animal at the store, which is super surreal because it was him and Brian Regan. Where are comedy central guys growing up, you know, that's sort of like all you had that wasn't on Hbo. So like, you know, it was a super surreal weekend because he was, he was very ron white, so you know what I'm talking about. Like he's down to hang with comedians. He's funny all the time. It's not one of those guys that like shuts down and he was just a blast. Like he is that guy. So like if there's ever a dull moment though, just he can pretty much say anything. And it's funny because just sorta like that, you know, and it's just boom, it's just laying everybody out. It was a blast. It was one of those great ones, like they say, don't meet your heroes, but like he was a fun one.

Speaker 1:          01:41:32       Yeah, you can meet some of them. You can meet Ron White. Yeah. Yeah. It's um, you know, it's a cool time at the store. Guys like Ron White hanging out. Everybody's hanging out there now.

Speaker 2:          01:41:44       It's crazy. I told Brian Regan all about it. I said, you know, you have to come because he really enjoys La. I don't know. I don't think he does. I don't think he really does it if he does, I'm sure it's like the will will turn or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:41:58       Well, when I was talking to him, he was saying he pretty much just kind of writes and does the material at his shows, you know, it just writes new shit and does it at his shows in front of his audiences. And

Speaker 2:          01:42:09       I'll tell you this, it was my second year doing these oddballs and I've never seen comedians or myself. I haven't laughed. Like I was laughing at him since I was a child since I, since I very first started standup. You know how when you really start and you're watching guys for the first time and you're just dying, she's like, how are they doing that? It was like that. His justice premises, his delivery is everything. Like it was surreal to watch every single joke that he went into. I thought to myself, how have I never thought of that? One of those things where over and over and over again and you're like, Whoa, he's about to talk about that. I thought only I noticed that you're watching an amphitheater

Speaker 1:          01:42:50       continuously. He's constantly touring to. Yeah, I mean Brian's. He's everywhere, but that's all he does now.

Speaker 2:          01:42:57       It's interesting. This is one of those guys like I feel like bill burr and Chappelle are always in the thing. You know what I mean? But he is. I mean, I'm not saying he's bad or whatever, but I mean like, no, he's fantastic. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43:07       You know the differences though, he's clean and so people think of him as being not as funny because he's clean because you go, oh, well you can take your kids to go see Brian Regan. It doesn't matter. He's a killer. Lays them out,

Speaker 2:          01:43:19       you're like, don't even notice that he's not clean, so everybody is clean because he's so funny.

Speaker 1:          01:43:23       It's totally irrelevant. Yeah. Yeah. It's just funny, but there was a lot. You spend a lot of guys like that. Like Mitch Hedberg is perfect example that Mitch Hedberg, people forget. It was very clean. He hardly ever swore and if he did it was totally unnecessary. It was just having fun. Like has jokes. We're all like surreal Weirdo jokes, you know? There's been a lot of people like that, like Jerry Seinfeld, perfect example, just not only was he clean, like he didn't even ever touch on controversial subjects. I had to follow

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       him at the comedy store a few weeks ago talking about Mitzi shore and how she has Parkinson's and she said he wasn't funny three decades before. Whoa. It was unbelievable. Out of everything I've done in standup in nine years, I've never been in a tougher position than following Jerry Seinfeld. I always like following good people, but he just like went off on a rant about how this lady that owns this club told me 38 years ago, whatever it was, some crazy number. I know it's more than 30, the 30 for 36 days. She told me 37 years ago that I wasn't funny. What's the deal with that brow? You know what I mean? Like the room was just dying. It was crazy. Speaking can many basically dropped the mic and I did go up there just horrendous.

Speaker 5:          01:44:35       Speak it and die. Tell me about Ann Coulter. Oh yeah. That's what I'm dealing with all day. So the same culture situation. Culture was at the roast of Rob Lowe. It wasn't live right now. It was on last night, but when did it, when did they film it? Last Saturday. Last Saturday. So we'll only a week away. Yeah. So what happened?

Speaker 2:          01:44:55       Well, you know, this is the sixth roasts that I've written for the third one that I've been a staff writer on and it's always interesting when someone gets booked, you know, what's gonna happen, blah, blah blah. And Ann Coulter was one of the last bookings that we had and I was excited to help her and she, uh, she didn't want, she didn't want to do anything that the writers told her, you know, that she sort of had to do, like to be funny. And she's like, she didn't think anything was funny. So she rewrote everything, like the script that we originally wrote anyway, she bombed really bad.

Speaker 5:          01:45:32       She bombed really bad. But what was she trying to avoid? Like when you said she didn't want to do what they wanted to do?

Speaker 2:          01:45:37       Well we wanted her to write. We had one, we had stuff in her voice, like with her angle and a little bit of self deprecating at the top, you know what I mean? Like it was supposed to be like, Hey, I'm ann coulter, you know, you might be wondering why I'm here at the Rob Lowe Roast. It's because it's the first time that I'm not the most hated person in the room, you know, like sort of like put it off on her letter and you've got to acknowledge who you are. But instead she's like, Nah, I don't like them. I'm not gonna, not gonna play. I'm not going to self middle. I'm gonna Shit on myself. Suffer House. Why would I do that? You know? No, no awareness. There's no. Those were her exact words, but she just said she wasn't going to do that and she would just cut out. You Go, you go back and forth via emails and then all of a sudden all the good stuff is cut out and there's bad stuff. And some of the stuff's rewritten.

Speaker 5:          01:46:26       Did you meet her in real life? Yeah. Did you meet her in real life before the actual roast or the day of?

Speaker 2:          01:46:30       Uh, the day of. I talked to her on the phone five days out, which she was okay on that and she's like laughing at the script. But then once it's in email she rewrote it.

Speaker 5:          01:46:40       It was bad. But you really think that she's less hated and Rob Lowe? No, no, not at all. Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:46:46       everyone loves rob lowe, who

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       was the most hated person in the room besides her. Was The joke about Rob Lowe? Yeah. The joke is like, yeah, now she's saying that she's hated. She's acknowledged. Exactly, but didn't. She's saying that rob lowe's hated, so it's a joke, but it's not really written it. That part doesn't need to be funny though. We just needed her to acknowledge that she's a piece of shit and she didn't want to do that. Instead she came out and literally it's like you might be wondering why on here what's it couldn't possibly be to promote my new book, and she leans down all awkwardly and pulls out her shitty book in trump. We trust. He pluribus awesome. And she says, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Her new book is in trump. We trust. Yeah, at. Wait for it. He pluribus. Awesome. That's like the tag of the book. She said it and just the roar boos from the crowd book. She loves trump. That trump shit money she wrote. That is her 11th book. She's written 11 books was worth a good amount of money. Jesus. What was the purpose of having her on the roast to begin with? It seems like the roads have always had, like, I kind of like a goat, you know, like Jersey shore. They had the situation on one roast.

Speaker 5:          01:48:08       We got to hold that back up. I want to read this description. Put, pull up, make it smaller. So here we go. Donald trump isn't a politician. He's a one man wrecking ball against are dysfunctional and corrupt establishment. We're about to see the deluxe version of the left's favorite theme. Vote for us, or we'll call you stupid. It's the working class against this smirking class now, and culture with her unique insight, candor and sense of humor, who makes the definitive case for why we should all join his revolution. Wow. She just bent over. She bent over for the man who might be

Speaker 4:          01:48:46       king. Yeah, she was. She. She wants to play that character, but yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:48:51       Well, if he wins and she wrote a book like that, she's in deep, deep, deep, deep, deep. She will be the one to defend him every time there's any sort of a public.

Speaker 4:          01:49:00       No, he doesn't like her by the way. He doesn't like her. Doesn't like to see in one of the really funny things is that he changed his immigration policy, like tweak the tone of it the day before that book came out and it's sorta like mess things up because. Yeah, because he's sorta like a, you know, office books like all about like, yeah, don't let anybody in his zero immigration. And he was sorta just like, you know, he visited Mexico like out of nowhere, like the day before her book came out and she's like, uh, you know, it just wasn't good press for her. What does he say?

Speaker 5:          01:49:34       Or seeing the Mexicans or have to leave and they're going to have to go through the proper channels in order to legally immigrate to the United States. You're going to have to go back to Mexico first. The, he knows. No one's doing that. No one's going back to Mexico. Dude, stop. Definitely. Did you know that? Um, who was it that, uh, tweeted this, Pete Dominick tweeted this, that there is like a literally zero percent gross migration from Mexico. Like the amount of people that come over here from Mexico versus the amount of people that leave here and go to Mexico, it evens out. There's like a zero percent migration. That sounds like a steady written by a Mexican.

Speaker 5:          01:50:18       Well, I was wondering whether or not it takes into account illegal immigration and if it does, how could they possibly know what the numbers are? It seems like they don't. Otherwise you're watching the people come in, you're counting them and then you know where they are and then you're just done. You're like a part of the problem. You're like letting them come over the border. Like how many people come over the border every day and get away with it a lot? Oh yeah. I know like five people that came over here from Mexico. They just come over. Come over. Yeah, I mean I think I would too. For sure. I just think there's. There's two ways to handle this. This is what I think. I think if you want to like go into the magical mystery world of of impossible ideas, the best impossible ideas help Mexico so much that they don't want to come over here because it's awesome over there to like help them figure out how to make Mexico awesome, but they're not going to do that because the best way to get people to work for a bucket day and some fucking underarmour factory or Nike factory or whatever they do down in Japan, which is totally legal.

Speaker 5:          01:51:23       You know, if they want to do that down in Mexico or Volkswagen. Yeah. I mean a bunch of companies make shit down in Mexico and the reason why they do it is they bring jobs to impoverished communities. These people get a chance to make money more than they ever would have made on their own without these plants, but they're working for significantly less than they would if they were living in the United States. So it gets. It gets real weird. It's like, you know, yeah. Is it better for them than it used to be? Absolutely. But is it as good for them as it is here and fuck? No. Well is it okay for a company to keep people in a position where they're never going to be in as good a position as they would if they were working in the United States with our laws? Is it okay?

Speaker 5:          01:52:03       I Dunno. I Dunno. It's trip. If you buy an iphone, you Kinda, you kinda of a part of the problem. If you bind sneakers, most likely you're not making sleek sneakers in Columbus. Hyphens in Mexico City, they make them. No, I met some of them. Did they make some of them in Mexico? Mexico. Some of them in China. What if they jump off Mexico? No, because you're fucking hard work and people, they're not going to dive off the building like a pussy. They're going to finish their job and they're going to have some Tequila and party. Yeah, they do that. Mexicans have fun. They're the wrong people to hate Mexicans, to have awesome food. They're festive. They're very family oriented there. I mean, yeah, there's drug violence, but that's just human beings. Like the Mexican culture is pretty fucking chill, you know, like as far as like having neighbors. Like, dude, you could have your next door. Neighbors could be like some crazy North Koreans that want to kill you. Like if you live in, in South Korea, you got real immigration problems, you've got a real problem with your border because you're got North Korea and South Korea. You're fucking next door neighbors run by a, a murderous dictator that's worse. That's way worse. What do we got? We've got beaches, tacos. Dan's people cool as fuck. They like bull fighting. That's a little weird.

Speaker 2:          01:53:16       Two. That's the past. That's the shit. I watched an amazing documentary on Netflix about bullfighting watering. I sorta want to go see it, but I want to go to Spain to see it. I think that the big ones are in Spain.

Speaker 5:          01:53:28       You're gonna have to do it soon. I have a feeling they're gonna slowly make that shit illegal. People. There's so much pressure.

Speaker 2:          01:53:33       Wait till you see the. Any stadiums filled. I mean it's like.

Speaker 5:          01:53:37       No, I understand, but there's also a lot of protestors. Even these European countries or it's been a tradition, you know, it's fucked up way for these animals to die, you know, it is very weird. I mean occasionally the matador gets it and that's, that's something that you don't see in America. There's not a single thing that we do where you have that much of a possibility of getting mercked by a huge animal with horns on his head. This is not. I mean bull riding I guess Sorta, but I guess those guys do get stomped. Yeah, they do, but they're not trying to kill the bull. Right. It's a totally different kind of an exchange. The bull rider is a guy who's just trying to hang on for eight seconds. The matador. I mean that shit will take a while and they're going to stab the fuck a thing. People are going to hand them different swords. He's going to try to stab it in the back of the neck and you got a bunch of people that are helping them to and they're poisoning that thing and throwing poison darts into it,

Speaker 2:          01:54:30       in the, in it to get like bigger to get more famous as a matador. Like you take more chances, you know there's this thing, one move where like you just get down on your knees and spread your legs before they let the bowl out and your whole thing is like that first move because it comes up with the. You see it coming around the corner when they release it and you have your back to the bull, you are starting like, yeah, like down, not not back to the bowl, down on your knees and someone's going to do it that way. That'd be your back to bowling. I think that's a little blade. Wesley snipes. Jump up and slice it. Snake off as it comes towards you. Celebrity. Matador would be a great show. Wesley snipes versus a bowl.

Speaker 5:          01:55:12       Did you see the most recent bull attack matador thing where it went up? His asshole. The horn literally went up, his asshole tore his insides apart in this thing has just ragdoll on him with a horn in his asshole. I think he died. Yeah, he died, right? Yeah. Whoops. Yeah. I mean that shit can happen, but I mean I think they eat the bowl, but it's just a fucked up way to do it was like, I guess. I guess it's a, it's a tradition. You kind of think this is

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       like a barbaric tradition from days gone by when people didn't know any better. It's a very slow death to. Did they eat all those dead reindeers? I got electrocuted by lightening question. I was thinking about that. This reindeer good meat. Yeah, it's Caribou rain, deer and Caribou. Basically the same thing. It's just different names for it and Caribou is one of the most delicious of all game animals. Apparently. They're also one of the rare deer where the females have antlers too, like the male and the female have antlers. They all have antlers is to fight off wolves apparently. So the males have antlers to like head butt each other and I'm like, what bitch? But the females I'm antlers to like protect their children. Maybe that's just a theory. Maybe they're all androgynous. Yeah. Or they just live it up in the Tundra. That's just makes hard bitches.

Speaker 1:          01:56:31       A lot of the women have in Alaska looked like they could be. It's Pat. Even the female theorists are giant lesbians. It's a hard life up there for Caribou. Plus they're all on this migration. So, uh, when you see Caribou's marching across the field, you'll see like maybe even hundreds of them, but they're all online. Like your father. There's a line of them. So you see them coming from like a mile away. So you just get in position, find out where they're going to be. Go down past where there are right now. They seem to be going in this direction. Sit Down, wait, set the gun up. And what, what? Let them walk close. That's the people. Do they let him walk? Close and bubbling. Blam blam were eating ham.

Speaker 1:          01:57:12       Delicious Ham. So good though. Caribou's delicious. So 300 of them died because they were all in a rainstorm and they were all on wet grass and the electricity hit the lightening bolt hit and they all got cooked. Oh, that would have been crazy video. It says five still walking around. When this showed up, they had to put them down. Why? Because they saw too much crazy shit. PTSD, Vietnam vets. Fuck man. It just look what they did to my. They were all sad. Caribou. Who lightening is fucking crazy. You really stop and think about the fact that there are these things that float in the sky and out of them come impossibly powerful beams of electricity that split trees down the middle and Cook people. My friend remy who was talking about earlier where his dad owns that a lie, next place he got hit by lightning when he was in high school and he. He talked about it on the podcast and he said it was just like you didn't even realize what happened until after it happened way after it happened. It was just trying to come to try to figure out why the fuck he was on the ground and like what happened? I could just shut your whole system. Just gets

Speaker 2:          01:58:25       Barbara from Youngstown, Ohio. We had this old legendary guy called green guy and he got struck by lightening as a kid and literally was green forever. What? Some green dude.

Speaker 1:          01:58:38       The real guy.

Speaker 4:          01:58:40       Yeah. Guy That was just green. Maybe it was purple. It's been a long time. But purple guy or green guy. Here it is. Go Green Guy. Green man. That's him. Where's that photo of western Pennsylvania, but that's next to me. I mean eastern a job. What's that photo? Beaver falls. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:58:59       He looks like snoopy or something.

Speaker 4:          01:59:01       Is that he lost his face. Is that what it is? This is a black and white picture, so you can't really tell that he's green

Speaker 6:          01:59:07       version of the story so you can read it or he lost his eyes. Nose and one arm.

Speaker 5:          01:59:12       Oh yeah, he got electrocuted. That's what it is. There was a, um, a store that I seen on some me, I believe it was a youtube video the other day of this guy was hiking and he saw a bear that was dead, his giant bear, and he went up to it and poked it with his knife and immediately exploded in electricity. He lost his arm, lost his vision last, I think it lost his hearing. My wife lost one of his legs, just got hit with an impossible bolt of electricity because the bear had dug into a power wire and bitten into the power wire and he just, by touching it with his knife, he just tapped right into that power and blew his arm completely off of his body. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:59:55       I've seen a few of those videos. And what's crazy about electricity also that a lot of people don't factor in is that it sticks you right where you are. I once got electrocuted really badly at my grandma's house when I was a kid. Uh, she, you know, she had like these old old type of light bulbs that were like old fluorescents and you know, little metal handle on the sink. And I remember I grabbed the handle and blind and you can't get your hand on the handle. That's the thing with electricity is you're stuck. So you're like, this sucks and you can't pull away. You're trying, but it sticks you there. So I imagine like a lot of people just had creepy fucking deaths from electricity. Can't get away from it. It keeps you there. Yeah. Electric fence. When I was a kid I was trying to climb up this fence to hang out with some cows or horses or something. And I grabbed onto it and was electric and I was like, I couldn't let go. I remember just, and it's like five seconds, but it feels like for ever electricity.

Speaker 5:          02:00:54       So bizarre. The fact that we have electrical signals in our own body and that electricity is in. Everyone's like this room, I think about how much you take electricity for granted, but how much it's shaped modern life. It's very rare. You're not around electricity, but electricity itself is only like a couple of hundred years old. Like as an invention, like people harnessing it. Like what the Ben Franklin when, when was that experiment? If you had to guess when there's been Franklin had that kite where the key key hanging from it?

Speaker 4:          02:01:25       17. If you had to guess 60,

Speaker 6:          02:01:27       17, 16, I would say. Wow. That's a crazy one to think of. Eighteen 76.

Speaker 5:          02:01:35       Well he was like 1776 guy. Right. So he was a part the uh, he was one of the founding fathers. So 1750 2:17, 52. This motherfuckers out there with a kite. First of all, how ball or must America been back then? Just. No, no lights. Benjamin Franklin was a beast

Speaker 4:          02:01:55       man. He did like a lot of stuff. Smoked a lot of weed. Is that true? Yep. I just made it up. That's from like dazed and confused or something. How high. They're huge. Pothead. Each other. Jamie, what'd you say? That wasn't how high that was. His Bong at the end of the method man movie probably was a pothead because

Speaker 5:          02:02:17       I think he grew. It didn't make sense for sure. Yeah. Yeah. If you look Google Ben Franklin weed, I'm pretty sure he. Not only did he grow it, I think he talked about smoking it dazed and confused. There was that whole scene about how he grew weed and had been frankly, man, he agree with. They all were getting high back then. Of course, they knew about it. If they knew about it, they were using. It just didn't have the stigma does today. America's founding fathers loved hamp. Yeah. Didn't he write something? George Washington wrote something about it as well.

Speaker 4:          02:02:48       I sort of saw it said that he had a hemp paper mill. Franklin did.

Speaker 5:          02:02:52       Well, this is back when they, you know, the whole thing that fucked hemp up was the cotton gin. When Eli Whitney came up with a cotton gin, it made it easier for them to process cotton because before they had to use slaves and it was a. It was a real pain in the ass and the same thing with hemp, like what would they had to use with hemp was they used to have to beat it down to get to the fiber. He used to have to smash it and like it was a like a long laborious process, but that's what they use for everything they did. The reason why canvas is called canvas is from the word cannabis. Hemp is what the actual paper that's used to make canvas. Like when you make a painting you see like the Leonardo Da Vinci paintings or Mona Lisa or something like that.

Speaker 5:          02:03:38       That stuff is all on hemp. Like they made them on him. Like one of the first drafts of the declaration of independence. They wrote it on hemp. Hemp paper was real common, but then they came up with a more economically efficient way to process continent. Hemp fell off. Then when slavery became abolished, hemp really fell off because it wasn't economically feasible until the 19 thirties than the 19 thirties. They invented this thing called the decorticator and the decorticator allowed them to like really effectively and almost instantly processed the hemp fires. This group, big crazy machine crank and as soon as that came out, that's when William Randolph hearst started running all those ads about black people and Mexicans smoking marijuana and raping white women. It was all just to try to stop the hemp industry. They turned it into a marijuana thing and we're still suffering to this day. Amazing.

Speaker 4:          02:04:33       You can grow hemp now, right? In the United States. Some spots on it getting yet. Well,

Speaker 5:          02:04:37       we're. We're being real careful with being real careful with this marijuana thing because well, one day we're for sure going to get involved in either Colorado or Washington state for sure. Why wouldn't we sell like super healthy? We'd will find it, but it's not. This is just to touch and go right now with legalization, it's too sketchy. Federal government is still telling people that they can't get guns. This is the most recent ruling that you can't have a gun if you have a medical marijuana card, which is fucking insane because you could drink booze all day long. Excuse me. You could take pharmaceutical pills, opiates all day long if you want it to. You can do a bunch of different mind altering things and still legally possess a gun, but you can't smoke pot if there's any drug that you should have while you're high. It's when you have a gun, rather it's pot.

Speaker 5:          02:05:27       If there's any drug, it's pot because that's the drug that's gonna make you go. Now I shoot anybody, man. Right. You know, like all the other ones are gonna displace your reality. All the other ones are going to put you in a position where you're, you're probably gonna feel less inhibition and you're, you're probably more likely to shoot someone if you're drunk, you're probably more likely to shoot someone. Sure. On pills. Crazy fucks. Yeah. That whole pot things messed up. So, uh, back to Ann Coulter. Yeah. So this silly bitch. So what does she try to do? She tries to write our own jokes. Then.

Speaker 2:          02:06:01       Yeah. You know this, you know, like I worked with Martha Stewart for the Bieber Roast. She crushed it, crushed it. The first thing she said to me is, I want to kill as hard as I can. So Hook it up and I'm like, Stuart's done time. That's what I want you to do. Yeah. She's the best ever.

Speaker 5:          02:06:16       She's been in the pokey. She stands shit at a level and culture where they're privileged lifestyle of white people everywhere she goes.

Speaker 2:          02:06:24       Correct. And so ann coulter basically says that, you know, she doesn't like this joke. She doesn't like that joke. She writes this, she puts a pitch for a book at the top. First off, she was like a third to last. She was second. So Rob Lowe, it went Ann Coulter, Jeff Ross, Rob Lowe, and to show, right. So all these people went before Ralph Masaccio, Nikki Glaser, Pete Davidson, Jimmy Carr, a blah blah blah, blah blah. Anyway, and she got lit up and I mean big time, Peyton Manning, jewel, everybody. They'd hit everybody on the day as you know, because you always make fun of everybody at a roast of course, and then you get the main target at the end of your thing. But when people went in on Ian Coulter, they went in hard, very hard. Like Jimmy Carr had this one joke which I loved, which I'm going to completely destroy right now because I. I don't know exactly how he set up, but it was something like Ann Coulter is here and you ugly ratchet faced piece of shit scum bucket.

Speaker 2:          02:07:25       It's like something like that. Just like five insulting words just gag that I can't get a gang. And he goes, you are one of the most insufferable human beings on the planet, but it's not too late. You can change. You could kill yourself. And the crowd just home. I mean just everybody hated her, so she was great to have on the Deus. Wow. She could have killed me and Mike Lawrence, who's a huge pro wrestling fan and Sarah Tiana, who's an old school pro wrestling fan. We looked at her like, wow, we can write her as a heel. She'll own it. It'll be great. We're all going to look like superstars because we were able to make ann coulter funny, but instead halfway through the week we realize like, oh no, she doesn't get it and she wants to do this and you don't want to scare away from not being on the roast.

Speaker 2:          02:08:14       You know what I mean? You don't want to be like, hey, you're going to, you're going to do terrible because then they know there's a chance that you might not do it. And we wanted her there because you know, you're gonna show she's going to do good, great. Everybody's gonna Shit on her. But also, you know, worse comes to worse. People love a train wreck. And this was a train wreck. Super trainer. There was no, this was like a gift of a train wreck. It just going to watch it. Boom, boom. She was terrible. And the one thing comedy central did do, which is hilarious, is the reaction shots that they chose for her jokes, like when she was on stage, uh, are hilarious. Like it just cuts to just. People just started just studying.

Speaker 1:          02:08:57       Well, she made her bones in the safest, softest world, which is the world of like political commentary where there's five different people and everybody's shouting over everybody and you don't have to say anything that's really relevant and especially her because she's just a button pusher. She's a white lady, button pusher and she gets up there and she says crazy things like if Canada doesn't like it will invade them. She says stupid shit like that. She doesn't even mean, you know, and like this is what she does. She pushes buttons and Bill Maher calls her his friend and they laugh together. Ha. And she lives in the soft world. That world that she stepped into is not just one of the hardest worlds, but for a person like her to go on after someone like Jimmy Carr and get washed and then attempt to plug her book and all that Jazz, like I bet she has no idea what the average person's perception of her is because she's dealing with that bubble, that fucking talk show and shit. Crazy idiots. Yeah. That weird bubble where she's kind of legitimate in that bubble and you know, she's the button pusher. Oh, here it was crazy. And you know, she thinks she's wacky

Speaker 2:          02:10:03       and another thing is, you know, one of the main things that are roast is when you get made fun of you should laugh. Yeah. Because it shows that you have a sense of humor. That's like the main thing. That's why trump did it. Now he's could be president. Charlie Sheen did it. Pro Trump can be president because he did a roast. Hey Justin Bieber's the number one artist in the world. Oh, it's all gross. If you can handle the road trying to talk you. I'm trying to get you to want to do a Joe Rogan rose. That's what we want out of here. Joe Rogan.

Speaker 1:          02:10:32       So when Ann Coulter does

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       this, I'm changing the subject immediately looking at that. I'm not doing. I'm not being mean to you and I don't want you being mean to me, but when you do this roast with Ann Coulter, what happens when people are joking about her? Oh yeah. Well, that's the best thing is she did not laugh at anything about her and she always just had the same look on her face and it stuck. That's it. Every single joke like you just put in just basically, hey, we want you to die. That's the look that it would cut back too. And the crowd when you're watching it on tv, that's funny because she's not laughing and he called her hatchet, faced a ratchet hatchets or oh, horse face got Peyton manning said, I'm not the only champion up here. Ian Coulter won the Kentucky Derby a couple of weeks ago. Peyton manning annihilated. Now that's a guy who, you know, and Sarah Tiana was really hands on with him and you know, he got his script, made tweaks, studied it all week.

Speaker 2:          02:11:31       He put it in prompter himself. He's with the prompter guy, you know, before the show, making sure that every word is perfect. Exactly where he wants it. And he stole the show. Him and Joel were the two best jewel. The singer. Yes. No Shit. She was so great. Really. One of the things she said right at the top of her set, you know, she's like, you know, as a feminist, I can't agree with everything that I've heard up here tonight, but as a person who hates Ann Coulter, she annihilated. She's so good. That's awesome. Yeah. I wrote for her that was a sort of the room a hands on. Ella was a guy named George Ryan Black, good roast writer.

Speaker 1:          02:12:14       Uh, some other people, they're smart Tiana's in on that too. Such a smart move to pair them up with comics, coach them through it. Oh, well, I mean then they wouldn't have a chance on their own. I know, but I mean as far as entertainment value, like you could have been a gross clusterfuck of you got to see their own real ideas. But yeah, it's definitely better. And you know, there were, there were reading an awesome prompter. It's show business. So you would say that Martha Stewart is like the best ever. I mean, you know, I'm a little bit biased, but yeah, she's the best ever roaster. She's just

Speaker 2:          02:12:46       freakishly great human being at everything she does. She's the best. She's a baller dude. Not only did she have more prison time than all those other people in the day is like snoop and shy. She's just a Keller. She killed. She's a billionaire,

Speaker 1:          02:13:00       she's a assassin. They put her in jail for some weird shit to. Right. Was it like knowledge of a stock sale or something like that? Insider trading. How does that work? So if you say, if you have a stock, okay, in, you know, you're, you're working in some company like, hey dude, I'm just letting you know right now, uh, we're about to sell, sell, sell. So if you want to get out, get out now. And I'm like, Oh shit, thanks dude. I'm getting out. And then I do that. I'm supposed to just sit by and not do that and lose money. Like how does that work? Can you tell me the, some

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       shit's going down and I should bail out immediately and I don't bail out. I lose all my money. Then I got to stay out of jail. Is that how it works? I'm pretty sure. Like you just can't be super blatant about it. Like the SEC or whatever it is, a, I can't remember what it is, but a securities and exchange council. Yeah. So they commissioned like if they see that you just sold millions of dollars worth of stocks that day or two before something absurd happens with that company, then you know, it's sort of blatant. Did you ever see it?

Speaker 1:          02:14:04       Stuff that's connected to nine slash 11. There's another nine slash 11 thing. So how many people sold American Airlines stock? How many people predicted that American Airlines stock would crash and it's all like Illuminati type bloom bloom. Not Bloomberg. What are those people? Bilderberg Bilderberg characters. Yeah. Selling American airline stock. It's probably bullshit. Did you ever snopes that says false, but wait a minute. I saw this documentary on Youtube, put pay. What does it say on September 11th, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The operation and taking years to plan. Was it saying Jamie false status false. Only to delay the takeoff, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It was a long ass paragraph.

Speaker 6:          02:14:52       I'm sorry this wasn't spirit airlines that went into shit. I wish it was. Spirits are really airline. They're the worst. What spirit airline? It's like all the planes that get graffitied and stuff. It just didn't turn in the spirit. Airline. Goodwill, goodwill airline. Yeah. It's like they get like pushed started and shit. They're terrible. You have to pay just to print out your your itinerary ticket and you have to pay per bag. Like any bag. Your purse is a bag fee. They would charge you for your fanny pack dude. Yeah. They'd be like, what are you doing? Well, there was a time where the lady told me that I had to take it off and put under the seat. Your Fanny Fanny to count. Oh, weren't you the one that told me that you couldn't use bluetooth headphones on a plane. I use them all the time.

Speaker 6:          02:15:37       I've never been told anything. You're not supposed to. According to the lady that talked to the guy who was sitting next to me, she said he couldn't do it. You can't do it, sir. Are Those Bluetooth? You're going to have to take them off. Different Lady. Not the same lady. My goodness. Let's see. But one person ever has told me I have to take the fanny pack off and put it under the seat. Wait, that is so stupid. It's like connected to me since your belt. It's like it's just a cook. Top of pocket. Yeah. Can I just put it in my pocket and you dropped it in my pocket? Yeah. I stuffed my fanny pack

Speaker 1:          02:16:10       being a cunt. But we've all seen that, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:16:15       People remember that Airbus that used to take you to Columbus. What was that bust? It was Airbus. There's called Airbus wasn't jet blue? No, no it wasn't jet blue airlines called airpod there. But yeah, it was like $40 million when we. Once we

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       took this shit once and the guy fucked up his landing and had to start all over again. He went down and then pulled out and we go back up again. I was like, this motherfucker just had a panicky tie at that happened to me a few months ago. God. But it was like, you know, $40 a ticket so cheap. And there was a direct flight, which they don't have that they've one direct flight to Columbus, Ohio nowadays. Really? Yeah. That's why I had that happen to me a few weeks or months ago or something. And um, and it was flying back home to la and that was not cool. It's a scary thing because you're,

Speaker 2:          02:17:06       you get used to landing your first whatever, 20, 30 flights. They're like, well we're landing, look out. But then you get so used to it that, you know, what happens, it's kind of a jerk a little bit. But what, what's crazy is that to get it back up after going down, like they have to go full steam all the way. Engines that are normally are actually pretty chill because like a bird, they sort of just, you know, you don't have to go full blast. But when they do go full blast shit gets crazy and they really had to do that there. I mean when you're, we are down like we are very close to landing but he was coming in too fast. He said afterwards you just hear bond on, on Don, like engines and all of a sudden everything's shaking and you're like, like that. They had to like really pull apart. It was scary man. Rice. Yeah. One of those, like one out of every. Whatever. Thousands. That probably that happens too.

Speaker 1:          02:18:00       There was a trump plane that didn't have the landing gear pop out once. Remember when trump had an airlines? Trump airlines. Do you remember that? No. Trump ad trump airlines and they were landing and the landing gear didn't come down. So they skid in like the bottom of the plane, just scraped against the ground. Sparks were flying. Yeah. Trump airlines. Donald trump. He had that airlines when he was younger than me. Like this motherfucker's been. He's been rich for a long ass time. Look at them there. Donald J dot trump. Is that him in the police car? That's Bobby Kennedy. Is it?

Speaker 1:          02:18:39       Um, so 29th of September. You and I are in Columbus. Oh yeah, that's right. The Fun at the palace theater. And then we're at the tower theater in Philly on October first. And I'm at Boston's Wilbur theater. October eighth. Oh my goodness. Tony Hinchcliffe. Are you filming something there? I'm going to try to. Yeah, thinking about it. It's just something we'll see. We'll see what it turns out. It shows you doing that night to this one. Just one. One in and out. Whoa. Easy Breezy. You can film it in my helmet. Yeah, I got another spot. That's good pot. Who knows what can happen while you were well received last time you were there with me. Yeah. Bunch of savages there. That's my

Speaker 2:          02:19:22       city man as the people that like it. Hard, continuous rough. No oohs. And aahs Gacaca, Gacaca Gacaca.

Speaker 1:          02:19:29       Plus you're going to be there in October, which is like the last burst of excitement before the freeze, like in November and December and January and February and then march people start coming back to life and then guess where I'm going? October 18th. One bitch place I've been to with you before. We saw a little lady get kicked in the head place called Australia like I'm headlining, which shows all by myself. Like a big boy. We did see a lady get ahead, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Beautiful of Australia or the end of October in Australia. Dude. Yeah, we did see or get kicked in the head. We did. Are you going to that same place that we went to in Melbourne? I'm not exactly sure. The venues. I know I'm doing the comedy store in Sydney. You ever done that? The comedy store in Sydney? I did do, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:20:15       I did it with Ari. We did a show at a theater and then on Sunday we came back and did A. I think what we did was the fights were Sunday because the fights, we're a day ahead, but there were Sunday in the morning and so that day we contacted the comedy store and said, Hey, we want to do a show. So we decided to do a show that night. That's what we did. So yeah, I definitely did it. It's nice little club. I'm super excited because I guess like that's the beginning of their summer, something at the end of October. I don't think it gets cold though. I don't really get it as a joke like summer, winter. It's a joke, it's always warm, like Australia, like Sydney's pretty much perfect whether they say it's like the Dallas of Australia feel like, like a show or the city. The city of Dallas.

Speaker 1:          02:21:01       How did he remember that TV show? But they, um, what do they call them? Cashed up. Bogans. Do you want to cash out? Bogan is. You're going to have to learn this terminology. A cashed up. Bogans is like a really rich redneck, like a. If a guy in Dallas had like a, a, a jeep wrangler with fucking 45 inch tires and a light bar on the roof. And, and he's driving by the club with music plan and he's got a rolex on with diamonds on it, but he's obviously trash that, that's a cashed up Bogan in America. Get it. That makes sense. I feel like there's gonna be some cashed up bogans at some of my shifts. They'll definitely be there for sure. They're going to know you. They're going to have woody think about Cyborg. Might she going to fuck you? You know, often I get that by the way, just randomly I was at the grocery store the other day and someone hit me with that.

Speaker 1:          02:21:51       You better look out and at the UFC on Saturday. I got it a couple times. Actually. It just got to find her and take a picture with her. He totally would make the Internet explode. He's everything to get you in a headlock. Take a picture. She could put me in a headlock. I'll grab her deck and squeeze that mother fuckers. You think that this one? Come on. Good Lord. Amen. You got it. You got a shot at a the joker. Now that jared Leto it Kinda. They didn't enjoy him as the joker. I thought he'd look great. He's a wonderful actor. I don't know what went wrong, but he's not. It's not really working out for America.

Speaker 4:          02:22:33       Yeah, there's a chance I'm. I'm totally ready. If you want to help me produce it, we could do it. Dude. The one somebody made put that, they put that head on a better joker body for that thing that he just instagrammed and it's a better version of it, but I really want to do it. Yeah, that's true.

Speaker 1:          02:22:50       Squad movie was not well received. I didn't see it when I saw that was fucking good. Hell or high water dude. It's really good. A Western right? Yeah. It's Jeff Bridges. And um, what is the named Ben Cohen? Isn't the guy's name the Ben Foster? Is that Ben Foster who's a really good actor? He's been in a gang of movies. He's like, one of those guys just steals movies in the background. You know what? He was awesome in one of my favorite vampire movies ever. I know it sounds ridiculous. Assigned a 12 year olds, but 30 days of night, do you ever see 30 days of night? There is him and that other dude, the star wars. Do Captain Kirk, the new Captain Kirk. Good fucking movie, man. Good fucking movie. Fun.

Speaker 4:          02:23:33       I saw. Don't breathe the other day in theaters. And that's a good one too. What's that? It's about a bunch of kids that like go around and steal stuff from houses and then they find out that there's this old Vietnam vet who, uh, who won a huge settlement and they have a feeling that they, that he probably has it in cash and they show up to his house and you know, he's blind. It turns out. So they're like, Ooh, he's blind. This is going to be fucking great. Well, the catch is he can hear you and he can smell you. And whoa, shit gets crazy. Color is really good. And who is he a bad motherfucker? I don't know, but I've been seeing him in my nightmares and picturing his head poking in my bedroom door lately. That movie Kevin Smith Made Red State, I think it was called, where he was like, he was the preacher. Oh, that guy's an excellent. What is his name? I'll look it up. I find out his name. That guy is excellent. He's so scary. Have you ever see red state? Like, do you see that now? Do you see that one there were next to the one that says don't breathe where he's just walking by. Alert me. Fuck, don't you spoil. But he's blind. So Imagine Shanti. Why don't you spoiled? Well, you got to see it. You got to see that his death, the guy from.

Speaker 1:          02:24:43       That's not the same guy. That's a different guy. That's the guy from Avatar. Is he the guy from Avatar? He's the marine from Avatar. Yeah. So you're thinking of a different guy,

Speaker 4:          02:24:53       but you also have to see death proof. You have. You have to make up for that because that's all about stunt cars and like Kurt Russel kills it in this movie. I feel like I told you it's like 28. You have told me, Brian, I love it. Made me never put my legs up on the outside the window. When you're in the room, there you go. Saw Jungle Book, right? Yeah. I didn't like it. You didn't like? No, no. He's a guy from avatar. Not what I said. Steven Lang. That's who. Yeah, he's a bad motherfucker to those guys. Excellent. He's excellent in everything. Kills it. And he's one of those guys

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       that you just see in the background. But uh, Ben Foster, that's his name, right? That 30 days and night performance. That's when I first found out about him. He played like the vampire familiar. They had these vampires who would go to Alaska because it wouldn't get. You wouldn't get light out for a month, you know, there's like spots in Alaska where they have like a never ending winter. Do you ever Work Alaska? No. Dude, you got. We got to do a Gig in the summer in Anchorage. So it take me a trip now. We need some more. It's hard enough for me. I can't hold your hand, but fishing is easy. Fishing in Alaska is fucking awesome to go. Salmon fishing and they do shows at night. You come out, he'd do a midnight show. It's 2:30 in the morning. Go outside. It's light out. That's cool. Slight. It's just barely gets dark. It gets dark for like the tiniest amount of time, but it's not really dark. It gets like 7:30 PM dark and then it becomes light again. It's real weird. I like it

Speaker 2:          02:26:22       that those are my hours that night as well. P when the sun's up for me.

Speaker 1:          02:26:26       Yeah. Alaska is cool as fuck to anchorage and particular people up there are super nice, like normal, like fun. You can hang out with them and talk to them and they're. They're very. They're hardy people. You know what I mean? Like there's not a lot of pussies that live up there. You just really can't. You really can't be a pussy and survive in Atlanta in Alaska. It's not the way the people are and it's not the way the environment is like. In order to survive in that environment, you've got to be a self sustaining person. You've got to be able to change a tire. You got to be able to dig yourself out of a snow storm. You got to be able to start a fire. He might have to make a nice tent, one of those ice Igloos to survive. That's where jewels from she is. Do you know her family? Is the those people that are on that reality show? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:27:13       Somebody had the joke like they're like the Kardashians. If they were freezing,

Speaker 1:          02:27:19       she seems very smart too.

Speaker 2:          02:27:21       Jewel eminent and telling you, man, this was the one. Like she, I mean her and Peyton both like, but like for example, one of the cool things just like doing sound check earlier in the afternoon. She's just, there was a part where like they had to reload the prompter or something like that. She's just doing a run through, but she did her performance with a guitar in her hand and she would only play in between while like people are dying of laughter to stop and she would start her next joke. Oh, that's hilarious. What a great idea. I mean if you have all the writers of the roasts, the laughing, then you did it, you know what I mean? Because we've, we've been laughing about these jokes for a week already. So we're watching you. You're a third time saying them and worse still cracking up. Then

Speaker 1:          02:28:05       what did you think about roast battle being on television? Were you happy with the way it came out or did you feel like it was too big? And.

Speaker 2:          02:28:12       I love it. I love it. I think that it's going to get better. I feel like that's like UFC one. You know what I mean? If that makes sense. Because I think that it should be regular. I think that it should get bigger. I think they shouldn't just make it a once a year special event. I want to see it every week. I want to see it get bigger and breathe and let it grow and get the cameras right often. Should they have Ralphie may back. I don't think Ralphie, we'll do it anymore.

Speaker 6:          02:28:37       Do you think that they like the way they're doing it right now and these big environments, do you think that it takes anything away from it? Like don't you think that like I was like, I was watching it and I'm like looking at where the judges are and the performers are and everything's all so lit up and I'm like, this is not the belly room. Like part of the beauty of roast battle is how intimate it is. You're preaching to the choir on that one. Why don't they just do it in the belly room?

Speaker 2:          02:28:57       Air Preaching. I mean, I'm the guy that literally like, I mean I've been annoying, you know, Jeff and Brian and everybody about this since they started eight years ago. I literally was going, you should be doing with this show what we're doing with kill Tony and just get it out there. I mean, and have. If they had, if they put that thing on the Internet, that would be huge, huge and people would be killed. Be you get up. You become a bigger fan as you see it more and you learn the characters more. I mean there's like literally like 75 UFC analogies with this thing with roast battle because you know there's different styles and all this stuff and you sorta have to be good at everything. You have to be able to hit a rebuttal and you have to be able to just do a joke right in the pocket and you know, it's timing and execution and

Speaker 6:          02:29:44       haters. Table Two, it's been, it's been like clipped. It's been edited. It's been censored. It's not the roast battle that we know because it's kind of like the TV version of a wave didn't make sense. The racist stuff that scaple says is so ridiculous and over the top. What's so hilarious.

Speaker 2:          02:29:59       Certainly some things aren't gonna make it to comedy central. They already have a limit to.

Speaker 6:          02:30:03       They should have just done it on youtube from the jump. Totally. Where the podcasts, you know you can download the podcast. So that's that deaf squad and that's pretty roast battle. It's called verbal violence. So we have the roast battle uncensored on there so you can hear all the easier. Everything. Yeah. How can you just talk about that? Play the roast battles? Yeah. It's called verbal violence. We're on like a lot of episodes. We've been doing it for awhile. How come you never talk about that? I always talk about it. I've never heard you talk about that once. Yeah. Yeah. I have literally never heard you talk about a podcast where you take all the roast battles. Yeah, put it online. It's the roasters all know they're being put online. Oh yeah. It's been on for over a year. It's, you know, Brian Moses and Jamie, you know what, coach t record them all or it sounded pretty good. Coach t does a real good job on it. They, they, they, they, they is something like if Kim, they'll have Kim as a guest can congdon then they'll interview her about her battle and they'll play the whole battle. And then uh, so they, they make it like special events. So it's not like last night's is gonna be on there. They just pick out all the good ones.

Speaker 2:          02:31:07       I think they, they, they interview the people and they'll reflect on the battles that they don't play the whole

Speaker 6:          02:31:13       also the whole way through. Yeah. They don't play all of them now. Like they'll pay, they'll play the whole thing and then in between interrupted literally just edits it and does whatever he wants. It cuts in and out of it. So it's good. It's good for podcasts because they see, they kind of have to explain some of the battles because a lot of the battles are inside jokes and stuff and so that, that's why they have like kind of cuts in between where they talked about how you film it. Uh, they did. They film it on periscope and she put it on Youtube. Uh, I think, I don't know why they don't do it. It's something that they're allowed to do that anymore. Yeah. Yeah. With the comedy central deal in new thing. Yeah. But they could have they been doing this.

Speaker 2:          02:31:48       That's what I'm saying is they don't. Then I don't even think. I don't think these networks get it yet, that if they had, if they had built a huge built in following, then you get those numbers when they switch over, those people are always going to go find the TV show.

Speaker 5:          02:32:05       Well, they figured it out. What this has done happening. Yeah. They figured it out with red show already show started out as a comedy central Internet show, which was basically uncensored and had much longer stories like Joe. He could tell like a 10 minute story or something on that, whereas now everything has to fit into those commercial breaks, so they're editing a lot of stories, you know, they chopped stories up and they short numb and take a little of this out and take a little of that out. The best way is to see him live, you know, especially roast battle.

Speaker 2:          02:32:33       Same thing with the actual roast to. I wish that it was more alive and you would see like the highest and the lows because it makes the highs a lot better. Why don't they do them live?

Speaker 5:          02:32:42       Want to just have a live event? Is it too difficult to film a live TV event?

Speaker 2:          02:32:47       It's expensive, right? There's a lot more expensive if they just get to go in and really perfect it. Like in that little bit that I did watch last night, I, you know, Joel Gallon, the Aep of that roast who's done every single roast, all the MTV video awards, like he's the guy, he's a genius and to get to see the reaction shots that he does match them up with that. You can only get like halfway there live, but to see, you know, you get more bang for your buck because you get the joke, then you get the reaction from the person who was made fun of. Then you get the audience and like if you match all those things up, right, you get the joke reaction, boom. You have your laughing at like four things at once. So I think going in and doing the surgery to that probably benefits the show, but still I think that's too long of a turnover a week. She'd be like the next night or something they could do that. Tony's another show

Speaker 5:          02:33:38       works best in that little room. It's great in the big room, but it's, it's just not as good.

Speaker 2:          02:33:44       We're getting better at it though. We've been doing every other Monday in the main room and it's getting big and man cool. We got Pat Reagan and Jeremiah Watkins in is just has a different feeling when you do the bigger ones. It's getting bigger and better. We're getting better at it, but what do you prefer? It gets really? Honestly, I sorta like what we're doing right now, we really should just take over Mondays in the main room and commit to it and have special ones, you know, like a chill one, be in the belly room once in a while, just a throwback episode because I'm starting to fall in love with the main room and I think that if we keep doing it there,

Speaker 4:          02:34:17       it's just going to keep getting bigger and to have the chance of having 400 people every Monday at 8:00 PM, like have it be like a fuck Monday's show pretty much. Which it's sort of turning into like we had like 100 people that are on our last night. You got this amazing. Now with dom I rera the old is the only guest announced October. I was perfect and murder just murder the whole time. Do you feel like there's something extra creepy about watching so many bomb in front of 80 people though? Because like there's a feeling in the, in the belly room when someone's eating a plate of shit in the belly, it's a different feeling. You hear their heartbeat.

Speaker 4:          02:34:58       It's so fucked up that you smell them. Smell the fear, you smell their insecurities. You see the sweat start to put more on. Why do fuck stole that joke? Who stole that idea? Why didn't someone steal the idea? Oh, the kill Tony. I wouldn't say stolen. I mean we'll see what happens, but according to some of our friends in New York, like the guy who's doing it's cool and like wouldn't do that type of thing. Who's at Ron Bennington? It's an innocent guy, it seems very cool. What do you know? What I've heard though, it's, it's actually a company that just takes a lot of west coast is ideas like roast battles. They made like a generic version of roast battle afforded in east coast. Yeah. And so they just kind of picking and choosing what you, what they want to steal and they rebrand it. But you know, I, I was upset the first day or so, but like, like, like Tony said, let's just see what happens because it's a big joker.

Speaker 4:          02:35:54       Sin and a couple other people were like, you know, like I got like, I think Ari hit me up and it's like Yo, just laying a Bennington guys. Cool. Yeah, let it die out. And I'm like alright you got me because I love those guys. So I mean if they're saying that and you know, we're basically like others across the country. It's sketchy though is because Joe Rogan podcast has been on serious so you know, for like the last couple of years, I don't know if it's on anymore but they used to rebroadcast it and for years we've talked about killed Tony and the format and stuff and the same show is on the same network. So that's an little kind of creepy. We've had everybody on the show. Well listen, you guys have been doing to kill Tony for how many years now? Over three years. Everybody knows about it.

Speaker 4:          02:36:31       It's not a surprise and it's an interesting format. It's a funny format in limiting them to a minute. It like gives plenty of time for awkwardness, but it doesn't let it get completely out of control and that's the part where they messed up. Like if they were, if they were going to, if they were going to take, if they were going to do it, that's they made a huge fundamental mistake because they just made it so that the comedian I guess can just ring a bell at any point. Which of course these New Yorkers, you know, I think it's hilarious to probably interrupt seven seconds thinking, oh, I got one full. Yo know what I mean? Comedy just unstoppable. Sure. Anyway, do you have a problem with New York comedians? And I mean, I don't have a problem, but like, you know, come on. Anybody that knows what I'm talking about. No toss

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       because west coast, what's going on? What is this? The elbows, shoulders. What are you doing here? You know, they're the best out there. You mocking New York comedians now you seem to be mocking them west coast. I just need to know to know where I stand. I'm going to be in a East Coast soon and uh, in November and I don't want any issues. I just want to say that I was born in New Jersey, uh, identify with east coast in some ways. I actually think east coast comics are nicer and less back stabby and more real goal

Speaker 2:          02:37:53       to New York for a year. Brian, interesting. You mean they're nice to you when they're in town and want to do your job?

Speaker 1:          02:38:00       No, no, I just, it's weird because out here it's like you don't really, you know, there's a lot of fake shit out. Well that is true. This is a climate of fakeness with auditions and you know, meeting producers and all the bullshit that comes with trying to be a working actor in La. It definitely tastes comedy. You know, there's a lot of people that you all know that are like semi comedians that do like a little stand up here and there, but they never record anything and the occasionally go on the road. But really what they do is they work as actors and then they kinda like dabble in comedy. Right. Those are all. Those are weird fuckers because they're not fully in and so the way they behave and talk and think, it's like just a little a shade off. It's like a hybrid between an actor and a comedian.

Speaker 2:          02:38:45       Yeah. And they, you know, I don't know. You don't want different. They're different. In New York it's like, hey, I did 17 sets tonight. It's like, oh, well that's good. Well how much do you. How much value are you putting on those 17 sets? So what? I did one set at the comedy store and know that this new two minutes works exactly like this and like it's a higher level.

Speaker 1:          02:39:08       I don't know man. It depends on how much time you getting. You know, if you're doing 15 minutes of the comedy store, it's a, it's a decent amount of time. One of the problems with those short sets is you're doing like five and seven minute sets and there's a bunch of people doing them. Those are really hard to get anything weird going. They're really hard to express points of view on things and like elaborate on those points of view and have those points of view tie in with other ridiculous things that you noticed in life. You don't have enough time.

Speaker 2:          02:39:36       I love New York comedians. Don't get me wrong. I'm just hating on this show specifically. Like what I heard of this show that's like the. The people said whether kill Tony Rip off is just a bunch of people ringing the bell immediately and they don't even let the poor comic even do their first job without bashing them because everything. It's funny to interrupt course and so like without that tension being built over 60 seconds, you don't know whether you like them, whether you hate them, you just know that this person on the panels just being annoying.

Speaker 1:          02:40:05       Well when I, when I do your show, it's always this weird combination of like try to be funny, but this part of me that just wants to give actual advice that's part of, it's like a balance of the

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       two and then part of me wants to like let people know like whatever you're thinking is happening right now, like whatever you think like this is work, this is, this is a mess. Like someone needs to explain this to you, that this is all a mess and like if you just through people bombing one after the other, after the other, after the other and you thought that the show was just bombers row. And then finally we go to the bucket one last time and there was one, you know, this young Black Guy, 22 years old that's been doing it for five years. Fuck in destroying. You're like, Holy Shit, he's a wrestler. He just, he just moved here from New York. He's not a wrestler and he was more. He was, he went to high school with Jon Jones. He was wrestling in high school. I wrestled in college and now he's grown up and he's a killer. He's common 22 years old. There's a lot of them out there. Something shine. David shine, I think his name was now. Do you think anybody bombs on purpose? Is there anybody that goes out there and purposely to kill Tony? There's something. There's been a few trolls. I think people want to do good. I mean, yeah, there's been a couple trolls, but they haven't. They don't last a second. I immediately get rid of them. We can't just come on and like plug something. You're done. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Ann Coulter,
