Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Three, two, one, boom. And we're live. How are you? Come on. I'm good. I'm pouring coffee in the first seconds. Perfect chat. That's the good way to do it with a cafeteria. I think it is that you guys named in a French way. A French Press. That's what they're called. Is it called? Well it's called, I think it's called cafeteria, but it's probably called a protocol fee, but that makes sense. But in that there's a French word for it that we just ignore him. They did a vet, a lot of the food, you know, cause you have um, herbs, herbs and I used to do this bit of material, which I really enjoyed saying, you know, the difference between British and American. You say that she said and you say herbs and we say herbs because there's a fucking h in it. Right. And I used to like was the fucking age, but I thought, well why as the h dropped off for America?

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       I think it's because put a lot of French guys would come over immigration and they would have done a lot of cooking. You don't see his face. You guys know about cooking and they do the herbs and they cut the h off. Totally. So I think it was an influence from that. Probably Julia Child, Julia Child. She French I think, wasn't she? She is now. I mean she's in the French cooking. Oh right, okay. But that was her thing. Right. Yet maybe that if I sit next to Washington and said, we will use our herbs with the stuff here and that we could do the revolutionary war and then a, and then you guys are winning and then then we'll hate each other forever. You guys also do a lot of weird stuff where you put like a you in color and you have a why and tires.

Speaker 1:          00:01:26       What do you put in the open eye? Res? Yeah. I think we had, we had first dibs on the lack of, yeah, I don't understand what we did know what you got on the uh, your guys got on the Mayflower and they said, okay, we're going to talk like this. Or they say, whew, a lot and we're going to get put Cara the why in tires. We're going to invent tires. Get rid of the one. Yeah, I just think the U and color and the honor is a year and honor as well and we've got it and you've got it out and I think yours is more logical or honor or not for Herb's no herbs is that's more French influenced. I agree. Yeah. I always wondered because I grew up in Boston and I always wondered like those were the first people to leave England and Europe.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       Like what the fuck happened to their language because they developed the most disgusting brand of it. Well, you've got your A's, your bus, today's which I can't hear a strong Buston coming out of here. I got rid of it. All right. I heard myself on television once when I was like 19 years old. I was like, Holy Shit, what is that? Well, you guys had, or we used to have a mother, father, brother, brothers and it's the eye and we say mother or the father, sister. We don't have an r at the end of our mother. By the pharmacist. And you. Yeah. We say mother instead of mother and the rest of America has, it has a much stronger and Ireland has that. That's a very Irish influenced thing. And for us the eye and when we'd playing, when I'm playing American, when I was in, you know, doing roles like that, the are was the hardest thing to get hard, hard tar. I remember friend saying, Hey, I

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       was cooking this thing that came out like a hard hard tar and I thought that is the one, the practice because that is just hard, hard tar. We'd call it hard, hard tone, which is just doesn't sound the same. You spend a lot of time be, I've only, the only, the only time I've ever spent in uh, England is working, uh, like a little bit of downtime doing stand up and hang out over there. But most of it, it's just been working. Even working for the UFC or, and I didn't even really get a chance to really spend time in England. I'd like to, I'd like to do that just to Kinda understand you folks. Well, I a different breed when the, I think at the base having played 45 countries now, I think everyone is actually the same when you get down below a level, but you know, if you're going to reach for you, there's gotta be a number of things which would make it seem different than brand names.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       It will be different than the sports does. You know, everyone's sports does it. Everyone was politicians. If you have that kind of thing and underneath it all, it's going to be, there's going to be more mainstream. People can be alternative people. There's going to be, and the whole spectrum now, like in the old days it used to be everything was mainstream then a bit of alternative. Now we, I think your country, Michael, we have a whole spectrum of what's interests people. It's much more open in that way. Yeah, I certainly agree. We, yeah, it's, the collection of people is very similar. It's just they're operating in a different environment and different theater. Right. And uh, you know, we're tightly smashed together. Would it be 65 million in your 300 million and you're such a large, your country is so large compared to us. Um, because there was this thing of Ted, any temps out of Americans have possibles.

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       But if you look at it, something like that. But then if you look at where the 10% can go in America, it's just so huge. So it's slightly more understandable why a lot of Americans say I don't need a possible cause. I'm just going to go to that place, which is, that's an understanding of you. But I think, you know, I think it would do everybody good to go somewhere like, like Asia, like a, every time I go to Asia I always think, okay, people are like this too. Like this is, this is an interesting thing to experience in particular, which I really loved. Right? Thailand is a, it's amazing because it's like wow, they might, they hit like this perfect frequency where everybody's really friendly and really nice and it's, it's uh, you know, they call it the land of the smiles. It's this very unusual environment there where everybody seems like warm and greeting.

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       I don't think I'm wrapped into one rood tie while I was there. I that sounds very interesting. And I, I've, I've, yeah, when I toured Asia, but unfortunately it was kind of out in, you know, but uh, that's interesting about the ties, ties more than any other country cause I shared they must have a black market and a thing and some gangster of some title. Very nice gangsters. Maybe the nicest gangsters we know. Sure. They're not ask you first before they shoot you, I'm sure when it gets to the drug smuggling and sex trafficking and all the other day, but would mind awfully

Speaker 3:          00:05:59       polite drugs. Douglas. I mean they, they have obviously a very open environment. When you go do you see Bangkok? It's like Molly Thai fights and chaos and a lot of ex pats wandering around drinking. You know, they're, it's a different sort of world over there. But, uh, when I was there, I was in Chiang Mai and it's just super friendly people. Beautiful landscape. Very nice. Have you been in Vietnam? No. Never heard. It's amazing though,

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       but yeah, I mean I find that from an American perspective, it'd be very interesting people going there, even if they were there before and during the time of war after just to see how people are because they fought for so long. There's all the French stuff before that, the chain them, but even before America got involved in it, they call it a thousand year war that they fought. Anyway, it's interesting. I, I hope new generations coming along don't bring the baggage of before, you know, previous generations and we can all try and move forward into a world that smart

Speaker 3:          00:06:57       positive even though it doesn't necessarily look like that. What has always been really interesting to me about Vietnam that I learned from Bordain was that they, they don't hold any grudges towards Americans, which I find incredible. Aye,

Speaker 1:          00:07:11       I got that sense of it. I have not played there, haven't been there, but I got that sense that they were looking forward.

Speaker 3:          00:07:17       They just accept it as the past and they don't have any grudges and it's like, it's an amazing attitude.

Speaker 1:          00:07:23       It is an amazing attitude. I suppose it's better if you, they did an empirical, it's empirical window and they kind of, they didn't like do a massive Conga in the end. America left. And so they got what they were, I assume the majority of them were trying to get, you know, just so they can run it however they want to run it. But um, yeah, it's, it's tragic the things the words are getting to. I was going to be in the military when I was a kid. That was one of my, I wanted to be in special forces and then you look at me now being a transgender guy with that. But yeah, that was where it was. I know Trump wouldn't have let me in the forces right now if I were applied right this second. Um, but yeah, so I follow everything. I, I kind of run my life on the military and that sounds a bit weird.

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       I run my career in the military thinks it's quite difficult to, you know, any career, putting it together. Kind of weird. What's your next move? What's you'll, you'll strategizes and that yell? Yeah, strategy out the Wazoo. I planned 50 years ahead. Really? Oh yeah. Well if you think about it, you come out, I came out as transgender 34 years ago. That's not the first good thing that an agent wants to hear. Your transgender, that's 85 this is such a thing. This is even now, they would say, okay, well it's got a little better than it was for five, 10 millennia. This a little better now. But it's still not the hardest ticket that everyone's, we want transgender guys in here for this, that the other, it's not the top of the list. And I've also got boy mode and girl mode and I do drama dramatic films in boy mode.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       And then I'm touring and girl mode and doing standup and I campaign for politics in go mode. And I just, how do we do that? I just switch change, you know, take off heels, flat shoes. Yeah, because if you were just talking, like if you didn't have makeup on and he didn't have the heels and the nails, you just seem male. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's a, it's, I think it's genetically and built. You know, there's some, I think there's quite a lot of people maybe who, uh, um, uh, the way that light they live their lives. They live their own personality. They're not particularly male or female, I feel, but I felt, I've always felt since I was four or five, I wanted to express this side of myself. And it's built in, I think it's genetic. Um, and if you analyze masculine and feminine, if you really get down to it, you see, it's, I find it impossible to come up with anything that was particularly mascot in particularly feminine, except for the ability to build muscle mass is easier for men in event comas.

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       That's it. But, you know, great football as soccer players, men and women in athletics, runners, men, women, strong character, men's weak character. Sure. Men and women, um, mathematicians, whatever, whatever it is, there's nothing that you can really say, ah, that is only good shot with a gun. Now anyone could do that. It's a, we're all humans and so, and we get fixated by the masculine feminine, where's it's a tiger. If there's tigers tacking here and trying to kill you, you don't care. Now is this a girl till I grow a Bortech, we don't care about it. And they don't care either the Tigers. So you've always felt like you gravitated towards feminine things toward no, gravitate towards both. I had, I gravitated towards playing soccer. I was in the first team for two years when I was a kid, was planning to do officer training corps and then go marines or Paris and then guns and special forces RSAs which would be the equivalent of your Delta Force.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       Um, and that was a distinct plan and you're a lot about that. And I thought, which war they're going to send me to actually which one? I said me too. And it could be the idiots that I'm at school with or send me to the wrong war. Well, what is very clear? And then after that, every other wards kind of hazy. Uh, but there's all this feminine side girls' side. I'm not sure how to do it. They articulate even after 34 years, it's difficult to articulate, but I wanted to express that. Um, and if I look more like a woman than I, you know, it, it would be much easier. But, um, yeah. So I decided to do that in 95 when it wasn't cool. And I go, man, I've had a lot of fights in the street. A lot of people screaming abuse at me.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       I'm taking a couple of people to court or just report it and police. And then we went to court and uh, yeah, and you fight, you fight your fights and instead of going to do a military fighting thing, I've, I've done, I said this might be wrong for me to say this by say I've done special forces, civilian division, you know, finding people that people speak and outperforming performing four languages. I've run over 80 marathons. I'm going into politics next year. And uh, and yeah, and a k and the transgender thing is, it's in a better place than it was

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       back in [inaudible] 85. Well, it certainly now I think because of probably Caitlyn Jenner and the movement that you're, you're seeing to accept people that want to do whatever and anything you want to do it is just more, more accepting of each other that we do seem to be more, um, what's the word begins with a t the more open, more allowing, there's a word for it, which is just walked out of my head, but I mean that word. Um, but uh, yeah, and at the same time people are going around doing more killings and stuff at the same and I, well there's more people. There's just sheer volume of humor and the population growth is insane. It's took us something like 200,000 years to get to 1 million and then it's taking this, I don't know, six 50 years to get to seven and a half billion, which is scary.

Speaker 2:          00:12:47       Yeah. When I was a kid, I think the United States population was less than 200 million. Now it's 300 million and global was whatever it was. Now it's seven plus. But border, yeah, eight. Yeah. So when I came out, I think it was 6.5 and I think that's just running away. And one of the weird things is if we are having less wars, if we're getting better health to people, then more kids are around. And some people in, in I suppose lower income backgrounds and around the world they will say, well we need to have six kids. Cause that's what, hmm. You know, for my, for what I have much money. Yeah. That's what we do. But as economics get better, people have less case and that hopefully that should calm down. There should be a buttering me. I think they feel that it would be a leveling off of the population.

Speaker 2:          00:13:30       I've read the theory that they believe that industrialized nations and Westernized Society, when people start having two careers, you know, and then two career households, people are less likely to have a bunch of kids. Yeah. So as people do better, they have less kids. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm, I'm uh, I, I'm a glass is two thirds full person. That's what I feel instead of a glass is half full, half empty person. That's so you're optimistic. I'm a big, I need to do, I couldn't be here in the hills with the narrative that I'm planning to do this and got a film coming out and then I'm touring the country and then I'm going to politics as well. When you first started wearing women's clothes and dresses and makeup on stage that people think it was a gimmick, what, what did they think they did? I did.

Speaker 2:          00:14:16       I decided not to call them women's clothes just, and I just say that I might close, I would just wear dresses, you know, like women can wear trousers or pants and we used to call that men's pants and that, that patents it. So, um, but yeah, F I first started talking about it and not wearing anything. Uh, again, look kind of boy light and may or like, and then you were talking about it like I had the first check. This is my first ever jerk. I had this about two years before I did. I said, look, you're doing stand up. Um, so if you're from a minority, it's kind of a good thing. So if you in standup terms, so if you're from a a low ink

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       come background, you'd say rich people, so easy for them as you are a woman. He's a man. Ah Man. If you're an ethnic background and say white people, oh that's, so if you're a white male, middle class standard, it's useless. So thank God I'm a transvestite. That was my first love and everyone thought he's making jokes about something that he's not and they wouldn't believe me and journalists were going, I don't know why he's doing this because he's doing pretty well now, but there's this idea, is this a joke? So I thought I better wear addresses, you know, put some makeup on. And then they said, okay, he's doing this. He is serious, but he looks a mess. It's kind of baby elephant thing I was doing, okay, got to get your weight under control. You could have better haircut and that and you just got to fail a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:15:34       And there's a humiliation period. I mean this is the weird thing about coming out that it's kind of humiliating. People say you look at people say horrible thing. What they say. Uh, what the fuck is that? Somebody said to my face right there as I was walking out of a restaurant, so I thought that's not very nice. And you have to be able to deflect it and go, well, you're obviously a scumbag, so fuck you man. So I'm mostly men. Yes. And occasionally women. Okay. Occasionally women. But yeah, I mean, you know, it's low. If people have low, lower character, there are lesser character. She's a strong character. And yourself, you don't care. I live in that live. What the hell? You know, people, okay. It doesn't look quite a bit together, but you know, life's tough enough. But if you want to put someone down, you raise your own status by doing and they will do that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:17       And so I have stood in the street and people have unloaded, you know, swear words ineffective to me and I've just, I will fuck you in a violent, violent, I think what? You'll fuck, fuck you. And, and it's literally two or three of them or one of me just screaming at each other and I just won't back down. Now, this happened recently, it was nine months ago. Someone outside of my house in London just having a go at me. So he knew who you were as well. They did. They knew exactly what and where I live. We said, we're going to do your house. What the hell is this awesome now where it's because of the way you dress. Well it was, he added that into it. There was a, there was an altercation over. I was just packing my car cause I was just driving home between my dad and somebody says, you've got to give me a ride in your car.

Speaker 1:          00:17:02       I said, this is just someone heckles me like that in the street. I just come back with, you will never have a ride in my car. I have to give you one. I'll give you. So that happened. And then this guy went off and yeah, this and that and the other one, it's just screaming at me and so on, shouting back at him, giving him word for word and then went, I said, who is that idiot? And they said, oh that's this guy. He's a known, he's a nutter, you know, he's just, he does this. I went, all right, maybe I should mention it because he said he's going to do my, ah, I'll mention it to the police. Our demand two weeks, that same thing. Who's sharing? I mean it's the same ticket. So I stopped right next time I go past knows where you live. Well, he always did. He was right in front of the house. That's always fun, isn't it? Yeah. Well, and he said, we're going to do your house when you're away. You know? So this was the, that was his opening gambit. We're going to your house when you're away.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       Yeah. They're letting you know there are a coward. Yeah. Well it was, it was a very positive, he didn't run a PR company. I think that's kind of terrorism, right? They're trying to strike terror in you when you were away. Well, yeah, that, well that is, yes. That is the hatred thing is, did you think about just going out there and fucking them up? I don't think I'm quite, that I would've liked if I'd gone through the military thing of a Gulf, that I would learn how to do that, you know? And I've never have craft my God, my shelf up to the thing. I do need to crab my own self up, but I haven't got there. So, um, well I saw w we were talking before and you were trying to tell me that you were lazy. I'm like, fuck you. I saw that thing that you did, that documentary where you ran a series of marathons in a row with no training at all.

Speaker 2:          00:18:36       And I remember thinking before that had this opinion of you and the opinion of you was, you're a funny guy. You're a funny comedian. Um, you, you have good stand up. You obviously work hard at it. But then I saw that and I was like, oh, okay, there's something going on. They're like, yeah, those are the different kinds of human being, the kind of human being that could push themselves into doing that day after day after day. And I looked at your feet where your skin was literally falling off and you're taping everything up. And, um, that's a, that's a person that's got, you have an iron will, like that's a very unusual will for a comedian who doesn't really exercise. Like when you were doing, I mean, you were, I mean, you may be exercise a little bit, but you weren't in shape now and you decided to run how many marathons in a way, which at the UK one was it the first one?

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       Yeah, that was 43 and 51 days. 43 marathons in a row in 51 days with no training at a, definitely. I did have training that six weeks training. Yeah. Which is not a lot, but they did, they said that, you know, sometimes if you weren't a math and you should train for nine months before that. And I thought, well, if I'm going to do 43, that's going to be, I haven't been training forever. I can't be bothered with that. So I, but you know, and this happened in your civil war in maybe an any wool, uh, I, I don't kind of somewhat encyclopedic about you. Civil war and revolution motivated World War Two, but on the spot training, you know, training as you go along. That's what I did. The first 10 math. It's trains you for the next 33. What was it like when you go over the first day though?

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       The first marathon? Christos. Okay. Fuck. My first day is okay because, well it's, it's all in your head. There's a, um, more mental than it is physical. And so the first mountain I've heard of people who are running marathons, run, walk, staggered, not very fast. Get it done. Boom. The second math in his weird cause you go, I've done one, I'm on the second. And you can't really rejoice. You can punch the sky. You can't put a metal right near there. You're already, you've got up at five or six in the morning and it's mid day and you're, you're going through your second one and then he gets to the third one and then you'll do the fourth one. And then it was raining and my feet was shredding and I, the moisture it was, yes, it made it too soft and they were rubbing

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       on the, on the running shoes. And I didn't know how to, how do I fix it when I'm actually wearing on it all the time. So we started bathing it in surgical spirit, which you call something else. Um, it's, it's a, it's a ethanol, methanol. Anyways, it's some sort of alcoholic spirit and it, uh, it takes the moisture out of your feet. And um, so it became like stones. It's Kinda like which, uh, um, uh, anyway, if anyone does have some surgical spear, if you Google it now you'll see what it's called in America, but it's some sort of alcoholic thing that just removes moisture. And so it made my feet, my toes, like little stones and kind of tough. And actually that got us through. And then I started and also apparently, cause I did 27 mountains in 27 days in South Africa in 2016.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       And that was, the temperatures were crazy on that, but it seems that the body will switch on a healing property that we've got Leighton in ourselves that we don't use and you will heal quicker, you will heal faster the more you get. So I got you get stronger and both the British one and the South African one, I got stronger as I went on the first 10 days of the other key thing. And after that it's kind of easier. You're used to it. Your body just adapts and understands this crazy ass hole is going to do the crazy also. And the brain goes, what kind of math and shall we run today as opposed to what the are you doing? What kind of marathon? Yeah, well I think that's what the brain's doing. Cause the first day is going, you got to do what? This marathon, but I'd be okay the second day, the way it's going now we're going to s during another one, third day, fourth day, fifth day.

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       This is insane. And then the data and the brain is going, okay, you're on this kind of cake or something. I understand. Let's, let's try a better man. Don't push it too hard. You know the brain starts talking to the body and somehow it levels out round about Maine. Then they get surreal marathon, 18 wrath and 23 I remember marathon 31 that was the level of media. So weird, but it was fun. And you own the road, you know a woody Guthrie. This land is Ireland's Milan, the you, you become like, it's your land. It's like it's everybody's land because you're running on the roads of this country. I grew up in. And you feel that the roads, the fields, the birds, I didn't listen to any music I wanted. It's like a safety thing for traffic, but also you could hit everything that's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       Birds, Chad rivers running there was, I ran possibly his house. This isn't that bad day too. And there was a river running there and it went through the back of this guy's garden and he said hello. And I said, can I went and visited him and I washed my feet in the river and then I put the socks back on and I carried on running. I thought I can, you can do with these. I took blackberries out of the bushes like I did when I was a kid. It just became effective feral, this holistic or feral marathons. That's what I was doing. It's not run, it's not people shouting from the sides. No one cares really, which is fine. And I'm just wrapped up in this other place and it was beautiful. I mean it's Zan.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       Well it seems like it would change you like accomplishing something like that. Like on the last day, the last run when you crossed the line, what was that feeling like? Why this is a pitch. He brought up that picture. This is me getting the, they put up some flags and stuff. That was beautiful. I tried to do a five hour marathon. Now if you know the speeds, it's two hours is what they're trying to break that. So this is really slow. But then having done 42 marathons, it's maybe it's fair and uh, I, I missed it by about 30 seconds, but it was, it was beautiful to finish it. I was really quite strong all the way through. I didn't stop at any time. That was, that was good. In South Africa though, I did 27 and 27 days. It started a salute to Nelson Mandela was 27 years in prison and day five, they put me in the hospital because they thought my kidneys were giving up.

Speaker 2:          00:24:32       And you experiencing Rhabdo is that what it is? You know, but yeah, yeah, yeah. Your first book ever talked to WHO's done it about revved my license. Yeah. I got Rhabdo in 2012. Um, and you get that I was on a uh, anti-cholesterol drug, just the sort of health drug, your cholesterol is a bit high tech this thing once a day and side effect is rhabdomyolysis, which I couldn't spell being dyslexic and I was paying Brown p and, and uh, did it. There no real pain, lot of lethargy. I was really tired. And this is without exercise you were getting in, uh, that was on marathon three American force. So I had trained and I trained before that. I'd done some training before that one. I'm a bit weird with my training, but yeah, so there wasn't a huge amount of training before that one, but a third marathon and I started paying a bit of Brown.

Speaker 2:          00:25:25       But this was not through the whole series of marathons or it was, no, well, I tried to do South Africa twice, so 2012 was my first one after day four on an anti cholesterol drug, uh, tried to control my cholesterol and I started borrowing Brian p and then they said, you've got to go to a hospital now the guys that we've got to put fluids through you, you have to go see a specialist. Especially said you can't continue this 27 thing because you have to get all this stuff out of your system. Otherwise the kid needs, because the it shreds the, you know, the shirts, the muscles into the bloodstream, clogs up kidneys, kidney failure. Very dangerous. A lot of fighters get it. Really. Yeah. I'm a fighter. Died from it. Um, recently in Boston, Massachusets area. Yeah, it's a, it's apparently something that happens when fighters overtrain as well. Like sometimes they're not doing it scientifically, so they're not analyzing their heart rate or heart rate variability and they don't know that they haven't really truly recovered and they continue to push themselves because they want to prepare harder. Yes, they have this sort of mental mindset just train harder and you'll, you'll be better off. But that's not necessarily the case of your body can't physically keep up with the recovery and sometimes they'll go into a fight overtrained and then they wind up getting robbed dough from the fight. It's happened several

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       and it's caused a few deaths. Well, they said this, you said you Karen Ryan running now in 2012 or you won't make it to 2016 did you get off that medication? Yeah, I would think that all that running, you wouldn't need that medication, I would have thought. But you know, they check you out and you say your class was just at those mother fuckers. You be on this for the rest of your life. That stuff's gives a shit out of me and they'll statens. Yeah, it's, it goes through a scary place. But 2016 day five bloods were looking a bit weird day off. So Day 27 I did double marathon and that was kind of an interesting day. So you run one marathon last day of your run, you've only done 25 minutes in and said it's the day 27 or so. And when you go through that finishing the final flag where the WWII, they should be waving flags, you've got another marathon to go.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       And it's just I, my brain like, oh this is kinda good, but you got to, it's 90 k you're going to do today, ignore it, carry on. And it was a rough, rough all day. That's five hours. And then another five hours, five hours plus a mother, five hours plus. And it was six. I took 11 hours and 50 minutes to run 90 K so I didn't double marathon in 11 hours. Tim. That's damn good. Yeah, it was good enough. And there's, they've got a, they've got a comrades marathon in South Africa, which is 90 [inaudible] and they've got a 12 hour cutoff. So I said I will do 90 K in 12 hours. The double math was 84 and then I did another six k after I'd finished that last moment. Must have been orgasmic when you finished. It must have been incredible. Finishing the 84 was beautiful year finish at the steps of Nelson Mandela stature.

Speaker 1:          00:28:16       Right. He was made president and that was bit of an and rough, I'd have to speed up in the last hour because of complications. So I actually got faster. If either of you have done a thing where you're knackered and Mac and said now go, why'd you have to speed up? There was a wind, it was a single sport relief as doing it for, so it was raising money and I wanted to finish inside the camera window there to window til three 15 South African time. Police escorts were needed, certain bits, otherwise you'll get jacked thing and you won't survive this big. So I said, can't we just ignore the car jacking thing now you can't ignore it. So I said, okay, stop the clock, put me in the thing, drive me to Pretoria. Stopped me off. But then I'll run there and we'll just continue it on there.

Speaker 1:          00:28:59       So we had to do that. So we got behind because I wasn't running cause that'd be driven across this dangerous period of port point of road to be dropped to Pretoria. Then I just had to run the kilometers off. So they have like a car jack area. Yeah. They have said there is, whether it's, it's kind of out there. There's no one really out there and you just go along there and they'll, you know, anything can happen. So, um, my, my field producer fixer, he was just saying, we don't do this, just, you can't go there. So I said, well just get me closer to the finishing line and then I'll just run them. It doesn't really matter where I'm running. Now we know, Pretoria know we need to finish, I need to just run that distance. So I ran the distance soft, but the time had got behind.

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       So I had to speed up from 7.5 kilometers an hour to 10 kilometers in there. So an extra third, the speed at which was kind of evil. No, I moaned a lot that day. I just, I was just a moaning, whining. Oh God, I got do this. I what I, I was never considering not doing it. And I got the, um, the, the, the live feed to, to London finished at quarter past and we got there about 13 minutes pass. We had about two minutes and they just caught it before they went off here. It was like, you know, like a Phil, you know, it was perfectly designed. I just knew if I got that probably I get more money or raise more money and extra hundred grand because we've, we've seen this idiot finish. He's actually doing it either. Um, so that was beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       And then I talked to the, this very interesting thing because you know, if you're talking to PR, it was a press. I talked to the press after that. It was a Sunday and so they kept talking. Normally they say we can't talk anymore. We've got two minutes. And then we got to talk to important people go away. That's what normally happens if you're talking to life press and national press. But I was on the thing and they just kept talking to me because obviously a slow news day and nothing was happening. And they say, we've got this idiot who's just run 27 marathons. And they kept asking me how the question and what favorite color do you have? What, what, how, how big are your legs, your legs? Yeah. I don't know what they were asking me, but in the end, these two interviews I did with national, I just said, I'm going to go away now.

Speaker 1:          00:30:57       I got to stop this. I had to stop my own interview, which I've never done in my life and I realize they've just got no one else to talk to. Desperate. Did you notice a big change in public perception of you once you completed those marathons? Yeah, the um, yeah, the certain community and if you're transgender guy and you come out of certain people go, but I, I crossed into a line of, well, if you're going to do that and you, I hate, I know you do some comedy, you do the drama stuff. We think you're a bit bonkers and out there, but fair play. I've got this sort of, I got to pass a fair play to you if you're going to do that. And I was trying to do selection, you know SAS, they have selection, your Delta forces, Navy Seals, they all have this thing that can you just go on and on and on and on.

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       It's the stamina thing and that was my civilian selection for my own whatever civil identification forces. Just to understand yourself. Yeah, I know I can go a lot for, I mean coming out as transgender when you're straight, I'm straight transgender, so I fancy women's. I'm, I want to be lesbian. So if you come out, you could stay in the closet and I look down the millennia. If we go back to the ancient Egyptians and further, there's probably a lot of guys said, I'm going to tell anyone about this. I just, I fancy women. I just go with it. I just won't mention this kind of feelings in my head and I thought I should mention it because if people sat and scream at me in the streets, I will, I will fight that at least verbally fight that. Or you know, if they start going for it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:26       I have had one fight in the streets and I landed one punch. I taught myself to write on the streets because of this. Yeah, yeah. The guy was was just giving me, Ooh Tracey, oh well dressed down and I was, I've been a street performer for four years at Covent garden. So living on the street, you know, living that has working on the streets and you know, just knew a lot of people going around and just said, Matt, you don't have to be like this. We can all the space enough for everyone live and let live kept giving me stuff. He was a bit drunk so he was just going to stay on that wicked keeps saying it. And I said, just chill out, chill out. And then the third time I just said, oh, just fuck off. And I went, no, I am. I am loaded load of swear words on him.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       And then he swung for me, which was the handy thing cause that came up in court and then I swung back and I landed one punch, which I was pleased about and I was doing the wipe on wipe off stuff. I was doing this blah blocking. Yeah, for the Jujitsu. But I taught myself Jujitsu from a book if you could believe that, which is, you know, you'll get these books with the different moves in and you can't teach yourself that. But I did judo when I was six actually as well. So I liked the idea of doing these things, but I felt judo was always at the bigger kid. You all get in pajamas and the bigger kit just throws you around a bit. I can never quite get the hanger. I couldn't throw the bigger kids. I could do it now, but I've never, anyway, yeah, this is

Speaker 3:          00:33:41       fantastic. Video online of a very old judo expert in, I think he's in his seventies or his eighties and he's working out with these young men and you see his mastery of judo as these young, powerful men try to manipulate him and throw him around and he effortlessly watch this, this old man and he see him, he's very, very old and he's throwing these guys around me as a martial arts expert. These, these men are not doing this willingly. This is legitimate. Like even that guy tries to throw him and this is a black belt who's trying to throw him, but he's so good and his, his use of balance and leverage is so amazing. He just knows where to be. Like see how it just throws himself into a perfect position. It's really stunning to watch. And this looks like it was from the 50s or something like that cause it's really old blood yet.

Speaker 3:          00:34:34       Does it say, just has 75 year old judo master. I mean this is an old man and the young man is much larger than him. Significantly like 25% larger than him. It at least maybe even look up. He looks at, he's twice as big as him and he cannot throw this old man. It's really amazing. Juno was a beautiful art. Oh, he's going more and more full on is and these guys, I got to get this. He's trying, I mean he knows that this guy's a master, but it's just look at that like it's incredible. I mean the way that guy's body can toss these people through the air and yet they are helpless. They can't do anything to him way that, look at that. Boom. Three times, 75 years old. I mean that hurts my hips. Just looking at that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:20       Yeah. You, you can have many different martial arts. Which ones you Jitsu

Speaker 3:          00:35:26       and striking martial arts. My background was in striking, which is in taekwondo and then eventually kickboxing and Muay Thai and then I got really into Jujitsu when I got older and well and Jujitsu's. What's the difference in just grappling choking people? It's like you, it's not throws like judo. There are throws in Jujitsu, but it really comes from judo. It comes from the ground fighting aspect of Judah, which is not as emphasized, but the Brazilians really a really emphasized it and sort of uh, they, they figured out what the best way for a smaller person defeat a larger person is through leverage. And Jujitsu is really the only martial art that I can think of that works like you think of a martial art in a movie like in a Bruce Lee movie. Like there's all these people and they were always bigger than Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee fucked him all up. When the real world, that doesn't usually work, like the bigger people have such a giant advantage when it comes to like striking. Like, you know, you're never going to see a like a heavyweight in the UFC. A fight, a bantamweight fight, a person who is 135 pounds just wouldn't, it's just too much of an advantage and Jujitsu, it's legitimately possible for hundred and 40 pound man to strangle a 200 plus pound man and do it relatively easily if they're talented.

Speaker 1:          00:36:48       I, I saw a documentary on Bruce Lee and he had the way of, no way. Yeah. Which really pill to me, I mean that it's, it's like a philosophy quite a month from fighting philosophy, but um, to be so trained up in so many things that they do not know what you're going to do. And I kind of adopted that.

Speaker 3:          00:37:07       Well, he had to overcome significant prejudice, prejudice to adopt that perspective because when he was studying martial arts, you were supposed to be loyal to your style. So if you learn Kung Fu, you were supposed to be a Kung Fu man for life. Yeah. You weren't supposed to also dabble in boxing and wrestling and all these different things that he was interested in. He was interested in taking what's useful from all different martial arts and applying them. So in a sense, he was really the founder of mixed martial arts, which you see today in the UK. They have cage warriors and the u s has a UFC and you know, there's this worldwide now the, the art of mixed martial arts of putting all the different styles together. And you can do whatever you want within the rules. Now I liked the attitude of that. I still have a life attitude then. I mean there's obviously

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       fighting attitude event and then as the life attitude of just be prepared for anything and everything.

Speaker 3:          00:37:57       Yeah. And be and be like water. Like that was his other thing. Just to go round things, move through things like don't, don't headbutt things. Figure out what's the best way, what is the, what's the best, best path?

Speaker 1:          00:38:09       Well, you know, yeah, I just, um, I haven't learned what I say. I think I'm waiting for someone to give me a really hard time. Then I say now I am checking in and I am learning in my shot, cause I really do. You live in England so many places and really here and I'm everywhere because I'm always touring. I was touring Andy and filming, so I, I just keep moving, but yeah, I know. But it's, you've got to make the time, especially if you're moving around all the time, he'd have to line it up. So, okay. We're going to check in with this guy in that place. This, yes. And, and you'd have to take it and like you do, it's gotta be something that you're serious as opposed to death. I didn't want to dabble like, um, stand up when I'm filming. I was still do standing at when I'm filming and if I'm doing standup, I will think about doing drama, you know, drama and comedy that color related but different.

Speaker 1:          00:39:02       So I keep pushing both. You've got to keep everything match, fit for life. And that's all that matters. I can drop marathons now. I just did three marathons. I just dropped three man. I took, got home from playing Australia, took the train up to Barack upon tweed on the Scottish border, ran up to Dunbar, which is one marathon and went across to Edinburg. Second Marathon. Are you running a marathon with other people or just not wanting it for yourself? Just get a backpack, put my stuff in there. Change of clothes, wash kit. Off I go, no backup. And is this something that started because of that series of marathons that you did? Yeah, and I want to stay match fit for life because that's what I noticed that everyone's a natural, like all animals in natural animals and the, there are the wild animals, which we were and then there are domesticated animals.

Speaker 1:          00:39:44       We are self domesticated but we are actually designed to be while we're supposed to be match fit for life. And I think as time goes on, you know people get back into training or whatever they say, what would that really hurt? So I backed off. I think it hurts because you're not doing it enough. I'm not sure if this is a pure science, this is just a feeling for me maybe that that I need to stay fit and running and swimming and whatever I'm doing. And the less I do, the more the body punishing me if I'm doing it all the time. If I'm always, I try and run every morning. I almost did it this morning but I had to get up and do stuff today. But if I miss one then that's kind of good cause that sort of recovery time. But I would just do hit training, high intensity interval training every morning, and then the ability to just drop three Matthew's job, seven marathons in seven days.

Speaker 1:          00:40:32       You love that. Yeah. I love to have that in my back pocket and I don't think that's, that's not allowed. That's not even a list of things you're supposed to have, but I know I can do it now and I can do it with just a backpack on. Well, you can do it too, because you have autonomy. You can kind of do whatever you want to do, right? Yeah. In the end. And you're living when you want to go make the time. Yeah. But there's also the, the actual, that's not supposed to be in the list of what is what humans do. Right. You don't just go from around three and three or seven and seven. And I love that. That's kind of, that's, that's out there. Well, there's clearly people that are doing that. Oh yeah. The speed, everyone, everything. I'd done everyone that someone's done boy more than I've done. And I kind of know that. I feel that even if I don't know that, I have one crazy friend, his name's Cameron Hanes and he's a, he's actually a famous bow hunter, but he's also an ultra marathon runner. And when he prepares for these like big foot 200 so it's like 200 plus miles of the mole app to 4,238 miles in the desert. He runs a marathon a day. So we run a marathon every day and then he a full time job.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       He's legitimately crazy and you know, he's, he always does that. It doesn't take any days off and he works at to that. So run a math and they say we're running them up, got ready at it through early, early run in the morning, run at lunch. Running at dawn is beautiful. It's African. Sure you're matching the African that I got coming up. We worried about something running up and grabbing Ya. Well I'm that thing. I wasn't, I mean they, they told me I supposed to have security high wasn't, I was kind of cool. That's for people we worry about people do. When you were around any, I was Al animals. I was in a, uh, the mountain Zebra National Park. And you know, if you've ever been in a safari as they say, so they tell you to sit in this shot of shower bank, big open top vehicle.

Speaker 2:          00:42:15       It's got metal bars over it and they say the animals, they know that the shape of that, they know it's metal and metal doesn't taste very good. So you'll be fine. And there's a guy with a gun and you feel good. But when I went there, of course they said, well, y'all running outside near the vehicle. And I thought, is this right? This is pretty big, good television. But said, okay, I'll just stay close with if something's coming. And they, they did. I said, what about how the lions during the lions have eaten yesterday? They're fine. And they told me, you know, and that's what lives, they never go for snacks. Lines are kind of organized like that. We ate yesterday, we ripped apart some animal and we don't need to go and have a bag of crisps. They knew, they knew that the line, they knew where they were and that they were okay, but they said the buffalo are around and they can stamp you to death about, I didn't know Buffalo.

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       So black death, they called them really what they're responsible for so much. They're not as responsible as hippos. Hippos are number one, but they, they fuck a lot of people up man. They don't take any shit. And you think about bowls like people when people try to ride bulls. Yeah. Like domestic cow bulls. They're ruthlessly aggressive animals. You mean they'll fucking throw you through the air now think of them but wild and in Africa and fighting off lions and that's, that's African buffaloes. I mean they are for Roche Roche's animals and that just, I didn't know what I had to do. I know that with, um, hippos, if you come in between their water source, then they'll just kill you. They'll fuck you up. I didn't know what to do to buffalo's weather. I had to go anywhere near that until that grabbed my room. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:43:47       If they find you to be a threat at all, they're just so powerful. They just just launch you in there. This is a great video that I was watching this morning of a lion. It was trying to take out a small buffalo and the other one got behind the lion and launched it through the air. It was literally flying like 40 feet in the air, like flipping head over heels. Cause this the strength of this thing to take a giant cat and just with its head she's woo and just flies. That wasn't the one with the crocodile in it as well? No, no. This was one that was on the side of a dirt road. All right. Have you had about the crossing busy go to busy wild on Instagram? I think that's the, have you heard about the crocodile? I saw that, yeah. That's interesting isn't it? Because I feel that about flow there are acting like the local townspeople. Yes, and that the, I think the lines of the SS and the crocodile is, is is another, yeah, this is it. This is the video. So it looks like the lions attacking this one. Look at that. Boom. Oh, it's actually not nearly as high as I thought it was.

Speaker 3:          00:44:49       Maybe I'm thinking of another one. Yeah, that one's pretty good though. I mean, just to see it do that. Oh, you know what I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of relentless enemies. That's what I'm thinking of. There's a, there's actually a, um, uh, a documentary about this one particular strain of lion that there was a, apparently the river split sides or the river changed its path and it turned this area into an island and the lions had to adapt because the only thing that they could eat was buffalo, which is very difficult to kill. You know, usually they're eating antelope and other smaller things that aren't nearly as dangerous. Right? So these lions developed, it became far larger. So the female lions are as large as a normal male lion and there hulking, massive muscles and they're just enormous. It's just enormous strain of lion that's exclusively eating buffalo. And there's a whole documentary. It's a national geographic documentary. I think it's really good, but it's just incredible to see these things walking around and they look cartoonish still like the hulk.

Speaker 4:          00:45:54       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:45:54       So it's hard to tell. You'd have to compare them to a regular line, but there's some images of these things walking around. They just look so much larger than a regular lion because they just had to adapt.

Speaker 4:          00:46:06       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:46:06       And I would think that if you're running around, like if you're running, you got to think like you're, you look like something that's trying to get away. What made running in that park? Yeah, no, I was right next to the green vehicle. So the big metal green vehicle was there and they just said stay close. So I was one door flip away from, I just launched myself into the is open top. So I would have been in that vehicle before they got to me, I hope.

Speaker 3:          00:46:31       Did you hear about the woman from, she was a, an editor on the game of Thrones and she was in one of those parks and she had a window rolled down and she, they told her keep your windows rolled up at all times. And she was trying to take better photographs and the cat reached in and grabbed her and pulled her out of the, out of

Speaker 2:          00:46:47       the vehicle and killed her. This is the last year. And then there they're a dangerous creature. Yeah. And you're just out there running with them. Yeah. Well I they, um, yeah, this is, I was at a picture of it. Yeah. Oh God. They have a picture of it happening is in 2015 wasn't really that long ago. Yeah. Just looked it up yet. That's correct. It wasn't recently. Um, my fax is terrible. I was flying, Bro. Look at that though. That is just so awful that they actually caught it on camera. Well, she just thought it was, you know, she was safe. She's in the car. I reached in and grabbed her and pulled her out. Yeah. I, uh, you're out there running around. I would have a, there was a guy with a next to

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       it will be a good shot. He said he knew how to shoot things. Um, I, I played my cards. Sometimes you play your cards and what must have been kind of exhilarating too. There's something about it, right there was, I was talking to the zebras, I just, I went up, cause obviously they were not dangerous. There's holiday non-dangerous ones. It was actually the first day and the bat was about marathon 10 or 11 or something. And I felt, you know, once you over the 10 mark and I've never got there, you know, if you've done the whole South African thing and failed and people are tweeting about me, Eddie is, you know, Africa kick your ass. You know, you just go with Tia. This is Africa. We're a huge fucking constant. Hey, that's what I say. No Africa. Yeah, it's a big African because Africa is, did you tell them, hey man, I was on medication.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       My didn't really matter. They're just not that whining. So I just had to come back and I've tried three times to come back and then I came back and uh, three times. Yeah, I kept trying. Can we sell it the day that, can we get back and do the thing? But no, we haven't got enough money to be able to do that. That won't be able to set up your cables and then suddenly it's on, it's on it's own. And I didn't, I couldn't train again. And uh, so I thought, let's just go get it done. And then day five was in hospital. Day Six was in the hospital as well. For how off the two thirds of the marathon on day six I have to go to hospital. So for what? Um, well, it kept what happened? Uh, they, my, my train, my doctor had gone away, but my train of thought, um, he thought I just didn't look good.

Speaker 1:          00:49:01       It was, you know, 35, 38 degrees, whatever, you know, and I'm used to, what does that look? One, oh, sorry. Fahrenheit. Yeah, I'd say one 10, one 15, somewhere up there. And um, I was not used to that. And so I was, I would've made it, I feel, but he didn't, he felt he wanted me to see next week. So I saw a nephrologist, I didn't even know what the word meant. Nephrologist is a kidney expert. I thought that would be a renal expert. We know it's a nephrologist and it's very cool black dude. And he was the in South Africa and eastern East London. It's called as the city. So it's the big place and he's going, what are you doing? Who are you? I'm running for Mandela, what? I do this thing. And, and uh, he said, it's, it's okay. We've checked out your kidneys, your right, your bloods.

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       Uh, it's, it's your hydration. Hydration is terrible. So I'm going to put three liters into and you'll be paying like a horse all night. And I didn't pay once. So yeah, that's what you're saying. You need some hydration and a, and after that it got better with, and so day 11, I got into national, this national park, so there's no one else there. Just me and animals and this security people in whatever with me. And, uh, it was kind of beautiful. It was just beautiful. And the sun was great, a sunset going down and there was a rainstorm as well in the middle of it, the more wild animals out there, I just felt okay. This zen, weird place of beauty and also knowing I'm getting stronger, I'm getting stronger. I've gone through the barrier. Um, and I also, because I've written, I've run format ans then a day off, and then the fifth, sixth day I ran two thirds or math.

Speaker 1:          00:50:37       And so I'd run forward two thirds marathons in six days, which is not good numbers for your head, right? You need five and five or something in something. But for two thirds maths in six days, it just didn't work. And then I run another marathon and I said, hang on, I've got to run a marathon and a third and get these numbers matching up. So I caught up the third marathon then it was always, so it's day seven and I've run six, eight mountains in nine days. It was always one day behind. So I felt last day I'll do a double math and, and that'll be good climactic and of my South African thing. What, what is going on with your mind when you're doing this? Because,

Speaker 4:          00:51:12       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:51:13       you're not listening to any music in your, in this sort of meditative state where you're just left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, breathe in, breathe out. I'm saying it's kind of Zen, but it's not in a kind of like I'm listening to my heartbeat or anything. It's more like I just feel, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       it's just some sort of beautiful thing of maybe cause that's what we used to be as humans. I maybe I'm reaching back into some pause memory. We humans just used to be out on the plains and we were looking for honey wild honey or berries or some root stuff. And then if we could trap something, we'd kill either. I didn't know what to, I can't quite work out what it is, but I just find it beautiful and I do know that what you're getting vitamin D in, you're getting stronger from that. Um, somebody once read my hand, I never do the hand palm reading, but I was at a Halloween party and there was a palm reader. Then I'll try it. I'm in a good place. Let's read my hand. I can't remember what she's said except you need to get out more easy to cut out outside.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       And, and I thought okay, I always felt that I needed to be bout back doing stuff. Cause when I was a kid, I live for soccer, for football. I used to run like a crazy idea. I love that game. And then from the age of 12 I went to a school that didn't play it and I never played sports. This is one of my gifts to myself. Accident. I think from the age of 12 you know, you're in your teenage years, your bones really moving and setting. And at that time I was hardly doing anything. So I think my knees have never gone. People say running in the knees, my knees are not gone. I got a whole theory about the, the heel of the foot, which it should never, you know, you should, you know, sprinters are always on your toes. Curl running should be on the toast.

Speaker 1:          00:52:52       And I think if the heel hits, that's what causes the nails just needs to scroll. I'm a could be wrong. There's no, no, that's correct. That's not how people are supposed to run. That was actually changed by Nike. They developed a running shoe with a fat heal and they changed the way people run. They changed the gate and it's responsible for a lot of injuries. I think that I'm noticing the horses, if you look for the heel of a horse, it's right up by that bum cause the, the, the, the toes, you know the hoof is the toes and then you go all the way up that leg and right by the bum is that's the heel. It's just an enormously long foot and you go, well that's never going to hit the ground

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       and a dogs don't eat cat standard. We are the ones that use this hill thing obviously initially to for walking to make us balance when we went from the chimpanzee. Good real estate agent. We need to. But even then, I mean most people if you just give them, if they're barefoot like children for example, like one of the things that I, I was reading this book about barefoot running and how important it is to develop this and that. Most people that have problems from that, they're really having problems because their feet don't have strong muscles in them because of the atrophy. And the way they were describing a regular running shoes is essentially like a cast and that you're, you're so used to being protected in this cath that everything's sorted, just gets mushy. Yeah. Inside of it. And then you're also striking down on the heel, which is a very unnatural thing.

Speaker 2:          00:54:10       And when I watch my kids run, like my kids will run with me sometimes and they naturally know to run on the balls of their feet. That's how they naturally run. And when people start running, he'll first, that's where all the problems come and it's just not a normal way for people to run. Yeah. And I was also in initiative in South Africa running on set and road surfaces where they'd just dropped instead of doing a Tom Academ kind of covering, uh, they had just put rocks, obviously some Lori had come along. This truck just dropped rocks out of the back to sort of hold together the mud in the rainy times and very uneven surface. Fay, how did the foot, and I was, uh, I was doing these very thin soled running very thin soled uh, shoes. What kind of shoes are you running with? Um, well I kept changing them now so I could I, with the vibrams or than the vive.

Speaker 2:          00:54:59       Oh, barefoot ones. And unless you were running around barefoot, we running marathons and barefoot shoes. Well, initially I was, and then my train, I, it just got so hard that I chose to look, you're going to wear these. And then I left it to them to choose my physio and he was Olympic level. So he said, these are going to be better for that. I, I prefer you not to be in the, so I said, okay, you tell me what shoes to wear. I'll, I'll take care of the, but I do remember seeing little South African children running on the roads next to me when they call, hey, we run with you. And they are completely nothing on their feet and they can deal with these sharp rocks. I thought were really sharp. I was every few steps. Great. Whoa, wow. And they would just, yeah, and they would just, uh, they had, they were laughing and running along cause they their feed that built up like, and it's very, this a very, how's that South Africa?

Speaker 2:          00:55:45       Yeah. It's a weird watch. This, no, it's kind of fun because I go right back. I ran with the flags. That's, that's a beautiful thing. And I was running in Eastern Cape and they're looking at white guy, white guy doing, and this is very rural area. So I led say more low motor. That was in the African National Park. That was the rain. That was the, um, they uh, they uh, where the rhinestone heaven because he thunder and lightning. But that's the, that's the truck there on the left. You can see the thing. And this guy just turned up out of the blue to track me there. What did he give you? I just give me a letter saying thank you for doing stuff, but I if ran with the flag

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       and I said Molo to people and I led us to say, how are you and in in the Cosa Gosa this guy seems like he's wearing women's clothes as well. Yes, he's wearing a skirt and I think he's a transgender guy with less hair than me and yeah, he's bald, but he's a transgender guy. Nope. Do you take hormones or anything or no. No, but I could, I could transition, but then I've got this, I've got these boy genetics going on. I mean, I really thinks it's genes. I think they're going to find out how it works, but I can't prove that at the moment. But if I transition over then I'll just be on the other side of this kind of fence that we give ourselves. And I've decided, okay, I'm gender fluid. I'm just going to have like a superhero boy mode and girl moment.

Speaker 1:          00:57:04       Like the human torch can go flame on the flame off. So I'm going, when do you just do decide? Some days today I'm boy mode. I can, but I tend to, uh, uh, do sort of blocked periods now, but when I campaign, I mean girl mobile, I'm doing films, dramatic films, I've been boy mode. Um, and it's about the transgender character. Think about it. Not really, no, but it's easy for me to be in girl mode because then if I can, if I can deal with that and you know, some people stare at you and I have a confidence now I carry myself with a certain confidence, they go, oh, he seems to be quite confident. So I'll just relax about that and I can, I can actually, I can control other people's embarrassment because if they don't know what to do, I'd say, hi, how are you?

Speaker 1:          00:57:45       Can I have a cup of tea? Oh yeah, we sell to, oh, that's why. Okay. So I can just relax people by just chatting to them. Um, and then boy, it's quite easy for me to do cause I just, I just, boy and I scrub up quite well in boy mode. Do you have, but you've given thought to transitioning. Yup. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but, uh, you know, the part of me wants to be Steve Mcqueen in the greatest scale and part of me wants to be Elizabeth Taylor in looking like hone in a cat and a WHO's afraid of Virginia Woolf cat on a hot tin roof, which I just saw on the plane yesterday. So these are the two books I go between. They're going, well I kind of both of them and as a kid I thought, you know, Kinda look more like Clint, the Steve McQueen.

Speaker 1:          00:58:30       Cause I kind of fascinated with Steve McQueen and what he went through to get to where he was and he was so driven. I don't know if you know about this Steve McQueen story, you know that he was in a film with Paul Newman and he was like 93rd on the list of credits somewhere. Someone up there likes me. If you watch it, you can see him. There's a knife fight between pulling him and Steve Mcqueen and he's like a heavy, you know, young thug kind of heavy guy, but he's just a small player. And then the second film he's in with them is towering inferno where they are equal billing. And I think Paul Newman is first and Steve McQueen is higher. If you look at, if you look at the names on the poster, Paul Newman comes in from the left, so he's name is first and Steve Mcqueen is on the right but higher than Paul Newman.

Speaker 1:          00:59:20       That's how they got equal billing without, you know, how do you put equal billing if you're going to start from the reading from the left, right. But uh, and if you remember the film they come at it is two, two guys you say? Yeah. That both decent guy. Yeah. These are both heroes. Yeah. That's a funny thing with actors, right? Billing. Yeah. They want, they want to make sure that their name is red first. Well that's, that's, I mean you've got to have egos to do these things. I mean, so many things need an ego to do them and then hopefully you can switch, dial your ego down when you come off state. Some people can't do that. Um, when it comes to billing state, if you know about Steve Mcqueen and his mum was a sort of sometime prostitute and had met in and out of the House and his dad was just never there.

Speaker 1:          01:00:05       And he found himself through a boy's, a boy's retreat, you know, cause he was breaking the law and they sent him off to this place and then they told him to talk to these kids that are train wild horses. And that was one of the first things he did. And he was just so ambitious. And then with your Brenner in, um, in magnificent seven, because you know, if you know that film at the beginning, they've got your brothers, you know, that feeling well wasn't actually, don't remember it. Well it's maximum sentence. A great film says, got Yule Brenner with his coloring and, but no habits, such an amazing look. And Steve Mcqueen at the beginning, they go up to boot hill to bury this Indian guy boot hill and people are not allowing it. There's racism in the town and they both go up and they ride shotgun again to hear us.

Speaker 1:          01:00:51       But he was, he was Yule Brenner was the top guy. And, uh, probably see, well Kiki, you see what you, you see what Brendan's doing? You see what his caravan is? Man, God, he's got all this stuff here and he just wanted to be the top guy and he got there and it's, it's a beautiful story. It doesn't end brilliantly, but you know, a bullet is great. Great escape is great. Yeah. He's a fascinating guy. Steve McQueen became a race car driver, like, yeah. Well serious race card. Yeah, no, he, he came second and the one before there's a documentary on, on the Lamar, the mores, the 24 hour race. And he, because he didn't race in, uh, in America, which was, I think it was a 12 hours and they came second with a broken foot. He did it, you know, and he was just, he's kind of a force of nature, but he was also do crazy things.

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       I mean, really crazy things, which is just not, we died fairly young to 50. Then cancer. He was drinking. Yeah. I Dunno what it was. How you know, we still don't know why people get cancer. My mum died when I, when I was six and she was a nurse and never smoked and she died of bowel cancer. I mean, what is, what is that? Nothing makes sense if you, unless you put in random into the world. That's my theory of the universe to get there. Yeah. If you put random and it makes sense stuff to 13.5 billion years, we've had about 300 years since the enlightenment and I just think we're lucky enough to be here. We've had five great extinctions

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       and we could have a six or we could look after ourselves and treat as a people as you'd like to be treated yourself. That great rule do unto others as you'd have done to you, and that if we did, if we all did that tomorrow, the world would all work. Yeah. How do we do that? How do we get that going? Well, it's better than it was. Yes, it's better than it was. Even though it seems kind of hellish. If anyone's pissed off with politics at the moment, track yourself back. If you're going to look at politics from any time back in history, it's always been how it's always been rubbish. It was print all over the place. And uh, I think, um, transparency as opposed to, oh, pasty, if that's the word, you know, the more transparent things other more where you can check, hey, that guy's lying about that, you know, if we can work out what's the line?

Speaker 2:          01:03:06       What's not a lie? That would be really nice. I didn't know if we could have light detectors on all the time. Do I think it's going to be mine reading, reading? Wow. I really think that we're going to have technology within the next 50 years that allows people to definitively understand whether or not someone's being honest. That would, it would make it, um, I, I'm sure someone could get a bad side of that, but it's shoring up front. You think there's a lot of good stuff on that. Someone could say, this is going to happen though. I want this to happen. A lot of people, scams are going to fall apart.

Speaker 2:          01:03:38       What do you call him? Ponzi schemes. Ponzi schemes. Pyramid schemes. Yeah. A lot of that it's going to fall apart. Why they called Ponzi schemes? Ponzi? Yeah, I think so. There's like a, there's a bunch of those little terms like for Gazy, Jeff Ponzi I think for Gazy is one that people use for fake. It was a, there was a limousine company that was writing bad checks for gazy limousine service and it became like a thing on the east coast where, Oh, this guy is a, he's a for gazy cop. That means you're a fake cop. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. For gazy became a big word. Charles policy, that dirt bag. Look at him either. He's happy. He's about to leave. [inaudible] walking, go roaring twenties. Just wrapping paper law. Do we tell people as you're listing, please look up Charles Ponzi on Wikipedia and yeah. So that's it.

Speaker 2:          01:04:27       And how did he die? Did he explode? Hopefully get hit by a meteor. It'd be nice. So you are running for something now. What are you doing? Um, I'm gonna go, I've said that for nine years. Quite consistently. I would like to say that I was going to run in 2020. We had set terms in our politics, like you always had, you've had a four year, we arrange it into a five year, but then we've gone back to the old system, which is where the prime minister of the country can choose when they have an election and it can be anywhere up to a day, you know, the next day after the election or, uh, up to five years later. So we have no idea. So prime minister can decide, you know what, we'll have another election in two weeks. Yeah. And they wouldn't do that for them. But you know, like we had a general extra 15, 2015 and then 2017 having been in for only two years.

Speaker 2:          01:05:19       Um, Theresa May was persuaded that if you go over lecture now, you're going to win big. You can go into tons of extra seats and then we'll be able to do whatever we want. But in fact, they lost seats and they'll actually, so, you know, sometimes they grab it sometimes. Um, you go in there. Fourth is it, there's a traditional thing of going in the fourth year because if you've got all the economics going and everything's pretty good, okay let's go now we've got 40, but a year to spare. But let's go in the fourth year and we can, uh, cause we know we're in a good place and then you have to allow I think six weeks for an election campaign and, but yeah, that's, we do that. I think other countries do that, but I am sure to America you go, that sounds crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:05:54       But anyway, that's what we've been doing for some time. What are you gonna run for a member of parliament for some constituency. It hopefully in England would be my thing as opposed to United Kingdom because there's whales and Scotland. And is this a step? Are you going to move further along the line or you are going to eventually that would be [inaudible] for an NP. Then I would blend the jacks. I don't know if you know Glenda Jackson. She did this well I'll just shots of like, you know about him cause he went away and then came back to creative work he was doing to doing films, but he went away for seven years. So I will go away for a period of time. I put my career to hibernation and just do politics. Just stupid. But you have a set period of time where you're going to do this and then afterwards you're gonna retire?

Speaker 2:          01:06:37       No, I would do it. No set period of time. I just got to go off and for as long as I can, as far as it got and then I come back when I choose to come home. No stand up. No nothing during that time. Could do standup. If you're raising money for charity. If I'm raising money for the Labour Party, I party. I think that would be allowable. I think my constituency members wouldn't mind that if I was raising money for constituency. Um, but if I was just doing it for myself less, well you can write books. You like to write books and articles. It's all a bit hazy. But I'm not sure if you have the same system in. We have a similar system. My friend Doug Stan hope was running for president briefly kind of as a lark and uh, realize that he really couldn't do standup because if he did stand up, he would have to allow equal time for everyone else who wanted to perform, who also had some, like his standup performances were then thought of as political campaign performances, something along those lines.

Speaker 2:          01:07:34       It was like some weird bullshit that he was going to have to navigate that he decided to just get back out of it. But he was bullshitting the entire time. It was just doing it for fun. Now I'm going to do it. I'm going to go in. I think a lot of moderate people don't go in. I consider myself a radical moderate. I do radicle things with a moderate message and they're already done a number of things like that and my life. So I'm just going to take that in. And what's your goal? My goal is to try and encourage my country in the world to go in a positive direction. I think, um, I've been saying this politically that I think this is our last century on earth or it's our first century. I think the next 80 years is for everything. We're going to choose everything here. We're either going to

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       wipe us off the planet or we're going to make it a fair world for 7.5 billion people where you have a right to have a farewell, enough democracy and transparency, enough money to live a life, to have a family, not everyone, not billions of people living on $1 a day or $2 a day. So I think we need to get to there because then immigration raises its head, your country, my country, every country in the world. And that's all people moving around because they haven't got enough money to live on or they haven't been to security because there's a war civil war. And if we could get beyond that, then a lot of those problems drop away. So, but, and going into politics and talking about a global vision of the future in whatever it is, a slightly, it's very difficult thing to do because people are going to say, Oh, you've just asked for that.

Speaker 1:          01:08:59       How is that helping this, this global vision? But I just thought we seem to be trying nineties 30 politics again and uh, in political area. So I thought, well, I'm gonna, I ain't going to look for a vision, a positive vision of the future. And I know when I came out as transgender and 85, there was no way I could imagine anything. I didn't know where it was going to go. I just thought I need to go out there and he'd to argue those, discuss at least try and set up a positive image version, you know, cause uh, I'm not sure what age you are, but I think it was 51 if everyone, so, you know, I'm 57, so remember the earlier years of our lives, it was just so out there. Transgender, you need to talk about it. There were gay and lesbian people have with transgender.

Speaker 1:          01:09:38       It was like some crazy out there and plays well, what the hell are you on about? And that was what that was when I came in the middle of that. It wasn't a, it wasn't a, an easy thing, but I just saw I'm, if I'm not going to do special forces, I'll do this. Civilians, there's a hilarious group of choices, special forces or transgender, well, I did the, the civilian special forces to fight on the streets and argue people and yeah, and B. And it's all mental, isn't it? If you're, if you're in a isn't any way the same because people are shooting bullets, a union, people are dying and getting blown up. So I know there's a massive difference there, but everything in the end is psychological. And, um, if I wasn't going to do that, I'm just gonna try and do this. And I would take risks in these areas of, of, you know, I'll go out and people say things in the street, whatever they do and do that, and then I'll run the math itself

Speaker 5:          01:10:30       going out knowing that you might have to be in an altercation. Yeah, I, I was sure that was going to happen. Teenagers this point and screaming. Yeah, they're all assholes. Teenage boys. This get the shit out of me. And my friend Eric said, it's my friend Eric Crisp. He said it to me once, he's like, you know, because uh, he was dealing with some teenage boys in his hometown and he was like, the teenage boys are the most fucking dangerous animals on the planet because they have all this testosterone. No one's really giving them any guidance yet. They're sort of just out there wild and they're trying to outdo each other one up each other, you know, and, and then they're, they're cruel. They're cruel. And they also are insecure. And so one of the ways to combat that insecurity is to try to make someone else feel like shit. It's like

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       a sort of weird natural instinct that people have. Well that, that is, that's what gossip is. Hatred. Gossip is mild hatred and Gus it when you say so, so they're less that you lower their standard yellow there, uh, respect or the value or whatever by saying something or you can do it as an action. And in doing so you raise your own, I think at least we're not them because they are shithead. Sure. Less than us. And that is a, that has gone on since the dawn of time, unfortunately. Well that's where you see the social currency of today's like shame, climate, like shaming people for this or that are attacking people for whatever various thing to do and trying to get public shame against people. But they'd be, especially people that haven't really done anything wrong with what they're doing is they're trying to do that to elevate themselves and they see someone in the public, I see someone who's famous or rich and they're saying that person's a fucking loser.

Speaker 2:          01:12:06       And you know, sports figures and perfect example, you know, like some super athlete and they drop a ball, you fucking loser. You know, and they're, they're doing this to sort of maximize this sort of this like this downfall, this, if they see anything that's going wrong with that person's life and if they can accentuate that, pump it up, it's somehow or another, they think it elevates them. It actually does the opposite. It's terrible for them. It's terrible for everybody. But they have this natural instinct, it's competitive instinct to push down the person they think is elevated to high. Well I think that leads to the trolling thing online that if you do from behind a firewall of no one knows who I am. And I remember there was something that we have bank notes, like your bank notes that had a woman on the back of one of our bank notes, the Queensland, the pictures on the front and then they change it up every few years and they, they took the woman who was on the back of it, I think it was a 10 pound note or something.

Speaker 2:          01:13:04       They took her off and they changed it. And then there was this campaign, we need to get a w and a woman on the back of another different motives. Not gonna be that. And two people, uh, trolled this, I think to women saying, you, you should die to be raped. I mean hellish stuff. One of them turned out to be a woman who was actually attacking another wound that you think or what's going on in your head? Where's that coming from? But behind this firewall you can, you can go to any place of, well, so it's almost like they don't think that a person that they're attacking online is an actual person. They're not getting the social cues from them than not looking them in there. I, yeah, I just think it's a piss poor way to communicate with people. I don't, I don't do any communicating with people online.

Speaker 2:          01:13:47       I don't go back and forth with people on Twitter in the back and forth. I don't comment on things. I don't know anything. I S I talked so fucking much as it is doing this. I'm like, I said enough. I don't know if you don't know how I feel about things, Jesus Christ, if you listen to this God damn podcast, that's me. All right. I don't need to comment on other shit. I definitely don't need to comment in text form back and forth with the person and try to explain myself or it's not, there's no benefit in

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       it. I used to, when I was doing standup in the clubs and paypal might shout, fuck all of you. Oh, so you know from the front. And I thought, well, you're drunk, you're an idiot. What am I don't care. And I would not think that person really knows what they're talking about. So I wouldn't go into a thing. I would try and destroy them with you, you know, put them on some stuff. But that's what's happening online. If someone's coming to you and I, and I used to not worry about them before and suddenly I was worried about it. I thought, actually I'm, I'm not worried about it. Just literally like thousands and millions of hecklers. Yeah, that's really what it is. It's a heckling thing. Some of the, I came up, the last one I did was something, I said something and someone says, Eddie is a fuck you. And I wrote back, no, fuck you.

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       It was a very witty response. That's like five year olds as they say loser. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You, he was the loser. Disconnect. So stupid. You never really feel good about it. Even if you get a real good Zinger on somebody, you're just like, what am I doing with my life? Yeah. There was a, uh, yeah, my dad's bigger than you. That's what's going on. And my dad wasn't terribly tall so I could never use that. But what does it matter? It has been. Yeah. And does that really work for him now? He keeps bumping into store the ways when he goes, he's much too tall. My Dad. And so you're, you guys are dealing with Brexit, right? Yeah. We've got a how's that changed the climate of England? Well, it's made, it's made of a toxic, very, um, it kind of like, what's happening over here, you know, it's all gone polarized.

Speaker 1:          01:15:46       Um, like with the build the wall stuff and it's, it's one side of the other than this, no one in the middle in a way, if, if you look at succession and a, um, Merican civil war that was bound to happen at some time. If you go back to the constitution, um, 1779, 87, that was what was happening. And I think once you've European Union, no one's ever tried from countries that have hundreds of years of history, choose to try and lend to live together, work together some shape or form this tricky thing we're trying to do. It's the hardest thing politically that's ever been done in the history of the world. Um, and I think, cause I'm saying the American model with native American lands and rolling over manifest destiny, it's a different model. It's a different way of things happen. It's a different time as well.

Speaker 1:          01:16:33       Yeah. Different time. And native Americans didn't have this idea of, oh, we mark this off and we've registered this land. So the idea that people are learning to work together is, um, it's tricky. At some point someone was going to say, I think we'd, we'd like to change this, or we'd like to move out. So this fight was bound to happen. And, uh, so it's, it's very toxic. It's, I'm, I'm not getting too in right at the center of it because you could just, you know, probably like you have a New York, um, news broadcasts, you can listen to people talking hours and hours and hours. And what do you think about, what do you think of it? And it doesn't seem to get anywhere, right? So I worked out what my worldview is, this w w view that everyone's got to have a fair chance in life. I know that automation is happening right now.

Speaker 1:          01:17:24       So there's going to be a whole load of, uh, people who won't be able to get jobs because of the unskilled labor force that job's going to get automated. That's going to get tricky. So the universal wage is probably going to have to come in the idea of universal basic income, universal basic, and whichever one's going to have to get in, it's not going to be a negative thing. It's gotta be something. Okay, then you can go off and you can retrain or you could live your life. And uh, and then there's artificial intelligence parity by 2050 next 30 years. And that's what is that mean? We can't even work out what that means. I think it's gonna get harder before it gets easier. And so I'm going to just, I always play the long game. I always do the long game. So, you know, I came out and back in 95 and I just thought, well, hopefully it will get better over time and now this world up in 2019 and it's definitely better than it was, but it can go backwards, forwards, back.

Speaker 1:          01:18:12       But I just, I'm going to try and shoot for that. And the, everyone has a fair chance in life and as to Brexit, where that goes when they, you know, positive, negative, you know, I'm against it. So I was just going to find that. I don't need to think about whether I'm against it. I just know that I want, the younger people are coming online to vote now they're old enough to vote and they 78% of them want to be part of Europe. And the older people who are passing away, probably 70 80% of them wanted to be out of here because that's a fear thing. Immigration, fear of, well there's the thing, you've got to be, have to be brave and curious rather than fearful and suspicious. And these are the two ways I think people can go. If we're brave enough, we can be curious and say, hi, how are you?

Speaker 1:          01:18:54       Where are you from and what do you do it? Can we learn from you? Can you learn from us? I think that is the way for humanity to go forward. Or you can be fearful and suspicious like what? Hang on, they'll back off outside. Don't, I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to know about you. And that's the fearful and suspicious way. And I think we have to be brave and curious, otherwise we're not going to make it. So for us in America, what you're essentially dealing with a bunch of different countries that speak a bunch of different languages, whereas we're dealing with a bunch of different states that speak the same language, but it's kind of doesn't make any difference. Yeah. It's interesting because I thought if everyone could get the hang, because English has become a Lingua Franca for the world, hasn't made much difference.

Speaker 1:          01:19:33       And America shows you can be completely at loggerheads, whether you saying the same words or not. I think if you're not saying the same words, it's easier for people to say, who are these people? We hate them because I can't understand a single word they're saying that's easier. It's an easier way to be xenophobic slash racist on it. And I've always said a xenophobia is just a racist where the xylophone check, which I got to use software to political situation. Um, but uh, it's, it doesn't seem to make the big difference in the end. We have enough ways of translating and stuff and you, and, and most people in most countries

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       now can reach for English if they need to. You know, like some people, I think Putin will always speak in Russian. Um, any, any leader of a country, we'll probably use their own language first and talk to their own country people first and then they might throw in something in English or in an interview. So, but we can always tend, we can work out from vibe, you know, where most people are standing coming in. So, uh, well I think that we're probably pretty close to some form of viable translation technology. Like you know, Google had these uh, Google earbuds. Yeah, you can do on the Google App without even the air buds. If you go to Google translate and you hit the microphone on that, you can just say hello. Good afternoon. Was it? And you can, if it's on the fringe button, they'll come out in French.

Speaker 2:          01:20:49       So I haven't done it in the field. I would like to get out to somewhere out in the sticks and actually I should test it out. I'll make that a, the Google earbuds. I think the idea is that like if you were talking to me in French, it would translate it instantaneously to English. You know it's probably a Beta version of it now or like a clunky version of it, but ultimately we're going to have something that allows you to do that. There's also Google Lens. You could I use that when I was traveling or you could take the the camera and you look at it and they'd translates. I've foreign languages and to that Song Google translate the Google translate verbal one at the moment does line by line. So you have to say a line shaver line. I mean just think about what technologies existed 20 years ago and how more much more advanced they are now and then add that to translation and that exponential increase.

Speaker 2:          01:21:37       It's probably going to, we're probably going to lose a lot of these barriers of misunderstanding. It is interesting. I do think we, we have created some amazing positive things going forward and we tend to bank them and then we don't get a hit off. Wow. We've got that now. Like we can make coffee quite easily. The grinding of Covey isn't so, but then we just go, okay and then we'll find something else to piss us off. So trying to keep ourselves happy cause when my happy enough and then it's usually economics where people are happy enough, there's less racism, less immigration plugs, there's less, everything's less. When everyone's running out of money, they get pissed off. I'm totally understandably, but we need to make the economy of the world work and then it would be an easier place. But how do we do that? How do you make the economy of the world?

Speaker 2:          01:22:23       Yeah, no, yes, that's an easy line to say and it's very difficult to work it out. But I do think as you gradually learn to live together, work together as we gradually come together. I mean it's like in the European Union, say in America, if certain parts of America or European Union having a tough time, then money goes to those places. Having a tough time to try and get them back on their feet so that they can come back in and start making enough money to be able to help other parts. And that's, that's the idea. Um, and that's a logically a model that should be able to work in the world, uh, as we, as we head towards it. Cause you know, we know that was a terribly expensive in a lot of people die. That doesn't seem to get anywhere. Surely we should have learned this as we go back.

Speaker 2:          01:23:04       So conk wars of conquest, I don't think they are going to happen anymore. Quite like the idea we're going to invade this thing like the old empire stuff, which I think the Nazis did the last version of that for an wars of conquest and now we're being replaced by wars of defense was of defense or wars that are hidden behind things. You know, under some other old specific tents. We need to, we've come in to defend these people, but they didn't need defense. What was Grenada about it? And it's still that Reagan was doing and Grenadier failed attempts to control the natural resources. Well I think that's what a lot of these are. Yeah. And you know, and then it's economic wars. It's supposed to. And then stopping terrorism in its tracks and trying to keep these radical terrorists from taking over certain countries and strongholds.

Speaker 2:          01:23:53       But we don't really have done a good job of that. When there's a will you need to do that. And then people in their countries understandably don't like people dying a broad and then was a defense. Do they, I wonder whether that's kind of happening and then you know, there's this thing called a right to defend the idea that that countries that are better set up should be able to go in or should be willing to go in and defend. People are having a really tough time and tried to get the pot politics to work on that. You know, if someone is menacing, the sheer, when Hitler was menacing within his own country, no one did anything and that when Stalin was meant a second its own country now one, you know, cause about 30 million dive understanding. But no one went in. No one said, hey we got a whistle blowing time to go in and help you just, we didn't go in, well we don't even go in for North Korea.

Speaker 2:          01:24:43       I mean, we're in this weird position with North Korea. We have this military dictator who was clearly oppressing his entire nation and this strange to see in 2019 the limited internet. I mean, they have like an intranet. They have like their own version of the Internet where they have a few websites that you could visit. We've got everybody locked down and extreme poverty, extreme hunger, like the, the, the ones that have escaped from North Korea. I mean, if they've had these soldiers and they're malnourished, they have parasites. It's, it's an awful, awful condition this way right now. And if you see when North Korea does military maneuvers, it looks like the Nazis and you thought, well, that Nazi thing, well, you know, I don't like the Nazis as tool, but how did they get all these people doing that and say, oh well the North Korea could do it.

Speaker 2:          01:25:28       Well, hang on, this is just a thing. If you spend all your time just marching up and down, you can make that happen and Leni Riefenstahl can go and film it and with low angles and make it look dramatic. Make you look fearsome. Yeah, but we're, we're better off globally than we were during World War II. Right? The world is better off the world is better off in the Western world is more progressive and more open minded. Since you came out in 1985 versus in 2019 where we're sitting here today, it's a different world, different environment. I, that's why I'm a glass is two thirds full. I do think we are in a better place. There is more tolerance. It does go a few steps forward. One step back and then, and always you're always going to have Charlottesville Nazi rallies. It was going to have like weird pockets of racism and weird thing where you're like, I can't fucking believe this is still happening.

Speaker 2:          01:26:21       You're going to have a little, little setbacks. I didn't know there was something in Germany, something like 10,000 people were wanting to vote for the Nazi by, or maybe it's more, but you know that's a country of 80 million, so let's get the perspectives right. Certain things happen in there on television and you go, whoa. That's obviously why they do them. To create an outreach, get on television, and you go, wow, that's, it's all over. It's happening everywhere. Oh, well no, there's this small place. Yeah, I mean sometimes, well, the beautiful things that human beings can do is stunning. We, you know, we have so many stories of just amazing things that humans do. And then you put the horrible things that we can do that goes on forever. If there was a god, I don't believe in a god, but if he did come down, I said, what did you guys do?

Speaker 2:          01:27:03       Who are these bastards? And you guys well done you guys, but who are these better? Well, I, you know, well, they've always said the Lord works in mysterious ways. So like of the world, I doubt that's fucking mysterious. Maybe seven. It's the correct, I think wellbore to was a test for God because 60 million people died. And at some point we're saying, okay, how many people need to die before you come and blow whistle and just say, Whoa, what's the guy with the mustache doing? Let's get it ready. Get him off the board, flick him off the board. That was my test for, for God. And he didn't come. So I think it's up to us kids. Well, he didn't come when we mean what they did, the Nazis did was obviously horrific. But what we did when we drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that's pretty fucking horrific as well.

Speaker 2:          01:27:42       No intervention whatsoever from the big guy. No, no. He didn't come in. I mean he didn't catch the bomb and mid air go and Hank, there's kids down there, there's women down there. There's diseases are not soldiers. I need to say this and I know I'm not taking the from the, the Japanese, I thought the Nazis were fanatics, but the Japanese at that time took it even more fanatical. You know when the last Japanese soldier surrendered, you know what year that was? It's like 1980 or [inaudible] 75 I think it is. I think you could listen to that one. You can Google. He was on an island. I mean that, I mean, how fanatical do you need to committed still 1975 [inaudible] 74 or 75 cents. Yeah. Okay. I, I, I give up. Well, they have an amazing warrior culture. I mean you think we were talking about martial arts, a giant percentage including judo and Jujitsu of martial arts came from this one island.

Speaker 2:          01:28:32       They perfected so many different martial arts and it's more the Japanese than any other country in Asia. Well, um, being day, I think the ties did it best. I think the ties develop the best striking style. And then the Japanese developed the best grappling style. But the Japanese are known as more warlike than the tires. You never had the time or did they used to in the ties figured out the best way to gamble on fights. They figured out the best, most brutal style of fight. And that is they, they incorporated a lot of things that other people didn't with including like leg kicks and knees and elbows and, and they fought really often. Like they would have these, like to this day they have limb, Piney Stadium and all these different stadiums in Bangkok. They have the stadium champions and they'll have matches on a consistent basis.

Speaker 2:          01:29:20       And so these people are fighting from the time they're really, really young. Like they're taking like six and seven year old boys in there and girls as well. And they're sending them off to these tie camps and teaching them how to fight and then having them fight. You know they have a hundred fights by the time they're 16 wow. Yeah, it was just with Thailand it's very strange because they're so friendly. They're so smiley and friendly. Yet they developed probably the most fearsome striking style on the planet. I can't. And then they've got a, there's a transgender thinker as well. That's a lot of that going on. They've and the Venn diagrams of what's going on there that they're crossing or what is intersecting here? So much great food. I mean they have so much cool shit. That beautiful environment. It's a weird placement. Thailand's a weird place.

Speaker 2:          01:30:09       I love it. Do they feel in apocalypse now that, cause I think they did well. Is that in Vietnam? No nerves. There was some, she sat me down, but I think that it's some of it in Vietnam now. They did nothing. Nothing. It was typically, it was too close dates. Why was it Thailand? I bet it took fucking forever. It makes sense. Philippines. No, that's right. It was Marcos. Yeah. Cause they, cause Marcos kept saying what the aircraft back. I want the helicopters. The helicopters are coming in and they piss off somewhere. Isn't funny. When a Marcos, when that whole regime went down, all we heard about, what's the Mel Demarco is shoes. It's always, remember the whole thing that the debate was had a bad time that cause they were invited to a place that they didn't know about. All right. Everybody got my head though.

Speaker 2:          01:30:51       That's what they lost to it. That was the only way the back of a truck they're holding on the street, the back of a truck go, okay we're not going to, why are we playing all these places? You know, that's when they started getting a hold of there. We're going to do what we want to do rather than what someone else wants. So I mean I, I'm with you in that I am ridiculously optimistic. Well that's good. I think that, I think people, I mean I'm, I follow Steven Pinker's logic of that. People will sort of look at the, the horrible things that we have today and say, God, this world is terrible though. There are definitely terrible aspects, but this is without doubt the greatest time ever to be alive that we've ever seen, at least in recorded human history. I would agree with that. I think communication is a giant part of that. It is. This is this global a world which we thought was going to be beautiful thing and they're busy. I don't know. It's a hellish thing. In fact, it's got beautiful aspects and some hallux aspects as any invention has. You know, like Internet, hey, you can teach someone how to save their life on, on the Internet. Ah, you can also teach them how to make a bomb on the event, you know? So I think this is always the way, every next step we get,

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       we will have some positives. Then we'll hit the all the negatives and then we'll go back to small positive. So yeah, I've, I've got to be able to miss it. Yeah. Well I am an optimistic person. I otherwise it just wouldn't be here. But this military aspect that I mentioned, I'm flipping back to that. But yeah, I do try and think I need to do this. I think that's a good thing to do. Now. I need to do that. If the 10, nine years I've been saying I'm going to politics, I'm going next year, but it might not be a general election. I try and plan ahead because I can't, I see if I randomize it and I just float because a lot of people do. Wow, this happened and then that happened. And then I was like, and that could be a wonderful life. But I have my river analogy. If you're canoeing down a river, um, if you go at the same speed as the river, it could throw you under rocks. He could give you a wonderful ride. It could be anything, but it's up to the river. Whereas I pedal like crazy. Sometimes I back pedal like crazy. I have actively backpedal against things and sometimes, usually I'm peddling faster than the speed of the river to try and guide myself through them. And you see that whenever I do these canoeing. Um, well, anyone driving a boat through for river

Speaker 5:          01:33:00       I, when I look at human interactions objective Lee, part of me has to consider that there's a possibility that we need all this negative in order to reinforce the positive that there is some component of human life that desires or, or relies upon negative things to reinforce positive things that this yin and Yang that we exist under, that this, this, that we see the horrors of war and horrific poverty and all these terrible things and the horrible violence. We see this and it actually serves to reinforce our desire for positive things and reinforce and push our society in a more positive direction. I mean, I'm, I almost think that this is when we see national tragedies and shootings and all these different, terrible, terrible things, there's, there's all this fear and anger and frustration, but there's also action and the action might be, might think there's a lack of action by politicians are lack of action by the police or a lack of action by, you know, whoever we think should be responsible for mitigating these horrible situations that happen.

Speaker 5:          01:34:12       But publicly the, the, the, the social fabric of the world, the way people communicate and interact, I think it reinforces our desire to not have that happen. It reinforces our, our understanding of peace and our, our love of peace. And I think that these, these bad things that we see in our world, they're almost propel us towards a better world because human beings are constantly striving for improvement and innovation. This is one of the things that we do. We want things to be better and bigger and faster and stronger. And we want our society to be better at all times. We never say this is good, let's keep it just the way it is. We never, we never say that. So my, my thought is that even this, even what we were experiencing in this country, we like it seems at times that were almost like on the brink of civil war between the right and the left and people are lying on both sides and conflating people's opinions and changing people's perspectives in order to suit their own narrative. That I think that this ultimately all this angst and you see it from the outside and you look at it, go, what the fuck are we doing? I think it's a natural part of the way human beings figure out life.

Speaker 1:          01:35:21       I shall respond to. Sure. Yeah. I, I think, I think almost the same as you. I would opt to slightly differently. I'd noticed that humanity only sometimes gets going and does things when he's right up against the wall. You know somebody that needs these things to go on. If you took a wellbore to scenario, we went right to the wire on that and then suddenly we came back and maybe not even, it wasn't even the political will on that. It was just accident. If the Japanese hadn't bummed, Paul Havo we wouldn't. You guys, we wouldn't have had you guys in us with us for a dealer to all that. All the, the, the forces and the, the money and the almonds and the tanks and the shermans coming in. You know, we needed that coming in. And without the Russian people, we wouldn't have won world war two and that was, and they were in this agreement.

Speaker 1:          01:36:11       So I can't quite work out humanity. I do think positive. I do think the negatives, you can appreciate the positives. I do think one thing on, on the Brexit Brexit thing that's been going on is a lot of young people are coming on saying, well, so we're going to lose all this stuff. The ability we could travel to Europe without visas, we can work there, we could retire there, we can get a healthcare they're all costs have. And that sort of thing that we cut off and we are roaming charges are going to go out with the old that people are valuing what they, uh, they could lose a lot more. So yeah, the Yin and Yang, the you can, I think, I think it's gonna go on this way. And also some people, ones, once we get to a good place, I've noticed that a lot of people will say, okay, I'm not going to be politically active anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:36:53       I'm just going to carry on doing my life. Other people can sort of things that I've noticed that people will get activated to get to a result, maybe an election result or something or referendum or whatever it is, and then they'll, they will just back off. They get frustrated. They give up. I said, well, they just think, well that's done. That's bagged and in a positive way maybe and just say, but now I'm not even going to pay attention to what's going on, but things will start rolling backwards. So, um, I think we're going to keep having it like that. Maybe the, but the percentage of positive things to negative things, there's never changed over all the years. Over the last 10,000 years. It's just, there's more people in the world doing more positive things and doing well and negative things. Maybe humanity hasn't changed cause our brain sizes haven't changed.

Speaker 1:          01:37:33       Even back to the caveman days, you know, even back for the last hundred thousand years, the size of our brains is not moved. So we, if you went back to seven 70,000 years ago we would still be able to have conversations like this even though we wouldn't have the radios and things. It'd be more on our tribe. I think I'll try B is better than you were trying to say. Actually Steve, I don't know if our tribe is better than that tribe. I just think similar than some good people that drive in this shit has in that trial we need to maybe trade with them mall. We can go to war with them but then we could die a lot of and surely could die. And Kenny and Roger Number 22 you know, cause those conversations were happening in a slightly different way I think all the way back and they weren't all just getting me food.

Speaker 1:          01:38:10       You Nice, good. Three, five years. It wasn't that. It was maybe you know, millions of years ago, but not 700,000 years ago. And really started speaking a hundred fantasies. What we've developed since then. I'm fascinated by us as human beings because we, we, uh, we were just another animal and now we are, we are kind of amazing animal. We've repented beautifully. We landed on the bloody moon. You guys landed on the moon, which I as a child thought that we landed on the moon. But in fact you guys, I think that way, but they, Apollo 11, they kept it quite open. I think Michael Collins in the command module said this is for the world and there was this kind of feeling and Neil Armstrong is, it's a nice, yeah, I grabbed hold of that as a kid. I was growing up, you know, a bit younger than me. Pretty weird thing to think that we went from not being able to talk to space travel in a hundred thousand years.

Speaker 1:          01:39:01       I mean, that's what they think, right? They think that people didn't have real language, 100,000 or Fox p two genetic. Um, I think it's about a hundred thousand years ago. That's when it came down. And the first words we said was, let's go to the moon in 100,000 what's your name? Jack Kennedy. Okay, Jack. Good idea. But let's put it on the back burner for a moment. What do you think happened that turned us into this? Do you ever stop and think about that and, well, I don't think it's a bloke upstairs floating in the clouds because they used to live in the clouds and then we flew through the clouds and then whenever they mentioned, hey, he's not in the cloud. So I, it's, it's a randomize the thing, you know, I think these like dinosaurs, 165 million years of those bastards and all they did was eat, uh, kill eight killed pool and, and have sex.

Speaker 1:          01:39:44       That's all it is. Those four things for 165 million years, we've had 300 years since the enlightenment of human rights and democracy and stuff like that. If we, if we say the Great Greeks did a great thing, but really it's the last 300 years they had 165 million years of that. But why did they come along when we had all these creatures in the sea? It's suddenly huge ones. Something happened, something twisted, randomizing things. It's, I, we, we maybe we'll never know, but it has happened and I just don't think a bloke did it upstairs with a big beard. He said, now is the time that you speak and now you make handbags and now fight wars with the MG 42 and now, now, you know, I just, I just think it happened and we need to roll with it and try and make humans work on this planet because then we're going to be getting mouse soon.

Speaker 1:          01:40:35       And you could just say it the future, if we've got it going a mouse at some point, the marshals, cause there we want to vote, we've got our own marsh and government. You sure you earthlings, you know they're going to treat us the same way Americans treat the British. Marsha has come back and attack us. The match is to actually come. And you could just see that in some sort of, you know, a, did you turn the light? Yeah, definitely happy. You know, so I, I despair about humanity and I, and I, and I, I celebrate humanity. I do this thing actually, which I think is nice. I'm going to say this, this is not, because I'm obviously, I'm doing a tour at the moment here in the us, but I'm going to come out of this us too on the 75th anniversary of d day and like fly to call.

Speaker 1:          01:41:16       And normally you're doing a standup tour. Yeah. Big. It's up to the whole of America. Are you doing any dates in la? Yeah, I'm at the Dolby Theater on the 26th and 29th of June. Okay. The Adobe, but was the Kodak. We don't want to come out from 26 or 20 Oh, I'll look at it later. Yeah, it's all on that [inaudible] dot com and but I go to, I go to Normandy 75th anniversary of d day and I do, and they fought the battle of Normandy in German, obviously on one side and then French and English on the other side. And so I do three shows, Jerome Fisher, 50 minutes in German. And then I do 50 minutes in English and then 50 minutes in French. And then we have a buffet and everyone hangs out and wheat and I meet everyone and we all the German speakers, the French and English speakers.

Speaker 1:          01:42:02       That is incredible that you're doing standup in multiple languages. Yeah. How long did it take you to learn that? Well, I did school. I did French at School for eight years. I did Germans with for two years. So, um, it's put, it was partly a sort of low level political thing. I just thought if I'm an English guy going to France and doing it in French, then maybe a French cake go, well fuck man, I'm going to do it in English. And now the Germans, the Russians are doing English, the Spanish, everyone's going to English because you can do, you can have a Holly would career potentially or be on television and English. Um, you can also tour the world in English. Now you can use it as a, as a bridging language. We were talking about Google translate. I know French kids, French code, my friend.

Speaker 1:          01:42:41       Yes. Seen bellows has performed in Helsinki, in Finland and finish. Kids have been watching in the second language, they'd been watching in English and listening in English and he's been performing a French guide performing in English. So they met and laughed in a second language, which I think is an amazing thing. But now you could tour the world that way. So this is the, but anyway, so I'm going to get a dome and the, and the, it's a commemoration of, uh, that the battle happened 75 years ago and it's a celebration that now we don't go to war in those three languages anymore. And you have different 50 minutes for French, different 50, exactly the same uh, ideas. Uh, but the words are all obviously either German, French. I'll give you an example. I had, um, I said, Caesar, I told what Julia sees us, it sees it to be everything that one day he would end up as a salad.

Speaker 1:          01:43:33       Okay. Cause he always wore like guys and he's now and a French say's that escalate Jamey imagination. He one day, imagine [inaudible] on salad. One day he would finish up as a salad and German say's that had to Yeager. Dax did he ever think [inaudible] he one time as [inaudible] and inverter as salad end up would have. So you've got the verb right at the end, but they still laugh at the same place. But maybe about half second later split second later as salad salad end up would have. So you have to really have a deep understanding of how to structure the sentences. It's just practice really. You know, anything in life. You could do it. If you were taking out of here, you, you speak, you did. It's beginning. So if they took you and, and suddenly for some reason you were had to be in any of the cup.

Speaker 1:          01:44:18       Thailand, say say somebody dropped a big block of heroin engineer. Think just as a test, as a social experiment and they filled this hole and use Hays is smuggling stuff. So you have to get a Thai prison. Uh, this is kind of extreme example. Anyone. And then you'd, you'd be learning within one month you'd have basic sentences going. Anyone who goes to prison is going to have sure. Whether, you know, if you work in a restaurant and you, any, anywhere you work with, no one's giving you any English coming in. You just have to pick up the words and our survival instincts would pick them up and then you might have a strong accent, but you, we, you me, everyone, we can pick it up. So I just, again, I can set up this artificial scenario of I have to do this. So I had to learn French.

Speaker 1:          01:44:59       So I started before this show, this Vonda Boshia which is German table, um, meaning wonderful. And I started it in French. So I jumped. I cause I improvised to work. I don't write anything. I just go on and go, hey, check is what's going on with chickens, chickens, chicken with a gun. Dangerous. You don't write your act? No, I just improvise it and I sort of workshop it endlessly until it gets it. Oh, that's it. And then you memorize it a, well, I know it because I said it last time. Correct. So in French I was just going, they pull it, pull it. So don't Ya know, and pull a Donald Trump [inaudible] shoes and compare things you record and listen to every show and never listened to them. Ah, you record on your phone or do you know we have a professional setup so with sometimes not with the laughter mixed in.

Speaker 1:          01:45:42       I've just been listening back to the German shows in Berlin and the laughter is very low in the mix. So I'm saying this Jackson County, it's anyone laughing. Oh, so it's just from the microphone. Yeah, those are the feed there. But they had another one but they hadn't mix low. But yeah, you need to have a second microphone on the audience and just bring that mix up or maybe bring it right up so you're incredibly funny. But I just found doing it in another language, it's a positive thing. It sends out a nice message. His hands across the water. Can we laugh and you can you do them from us and the comedies. I do sort of Pythonesque Monty python type surreal comedy. And so I just need to find that audience in France. That already is a journey. That audience in Thailand as the, you know, I've played Kathmandu and met our kids from Kathmandu in New York on the streets. He said that you immediately and I said, yeah, where are you from? Uh, from Katmandu. Wow. Katmandu a kid on Kathmandu. We didn't hit as well. I doing, I'm a student, but your English is good. Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah. Well can I do a Gig in Katmandu do you think so? Yeah. I think you do a King Kevin do that. So I said okay. That was in 2010 took me seven years. I got the 2017. How was it? It was good. Unfortunately the local I

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       Lester the low, cause they'd had these couple of earthquakes, which they, you know, you tend to think, oh everyone has earthquakes and, but no, they hadn't had them for ages and something that had to a bad earthquake. So they were getting over that. So I was mainly aid workers. Unfortunately I wasn't there. I can go back, but no, it was a nice setup. But I played all through embed a in Tokyo and I played in uh, Hong Kong and in Shanghai and had all the guys from, cause you have the, the people from the communist party come along to check you out. So I'm not going specifically, you know, certain things. But anyway, you know, my stuff is all deliverable from the comedy. What the Communist Party, you know, the Communist Party. Yeah. You know, cause it's Shanghai mainland China Hamadie party. No, sorry, sorry, sorry. Just me mangling my words.

Speaker 2:          01:47:39       Oh, so they come and check you out to make sure you're not violating anything. Yes. You sit sitting there is, you're not supposed to go know whatever. I Dunno. I just, I wanted to do the cake, so, but, but it wasn't like I was going to change. I have weird stuff about Gandalf talking to butterflies and, and talking about my ancient kings like Henry the eighth and, and William the conqueror and stuff. So they probably, apparently they stayed, they stayed, they normally disappear after a while. But anyway, so it's uh, it's good to get out. And you know, you said, as you said, play the world sees a week to see it. Travel broadens the mind. Yeah. I don't play very many play. I played in Australia and England. I've done gigs and Stockholm and Northern Ireland, Dublin, a few other places in Europe, but most of the time when I go on vacation I just go on vacation and just go to experience it just to have fun.

Speaker 2:          01:48:28       So just to be there. So you've have you never written Irak down? Um, no I couldn't. I used to just sketch comedy like, like Monte Python thing and I wrote those and then I was doing a street of for four years and that's very unwritten. I no, that was very difficult to write. So it's difficult to actually develop material for that. So I did that for four years. So I got into this thing of, well, I'll do performing. Like how, so what would you do? Um, we, we were double act initially. Me and my partner rob and we did weird things like escaping from a wooly jumper. He just [inaudible] jump around. I returned to a ski jumper. Was that Willie Cardigan? We really pull over. You've got to pull over. Okay. Yeah. I got a sweater. Yeah. Sweater. Yeah. So instead of a straight jacket, he said, we take this Willie's sweat, take a sweater.

Speaker 2:          01:49:17       Just ridiculous. Ridiculous. Um, uh, making a bowl of cornflakes disappear because you ate it. Yeah. So at its best they go, this is insane. These guys are crazy. And they clap when they give us five pins and what it was, it was, it go, these people are insane. This is awful. And they walk away. Then we did sword fighting. That was good because I directed three Musketeers University and uh, so we were doing, showing you how to kill someone when drunk one thing when you do, you know, all these different moves. So that was quite fun. Then I went solo and I was

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       doing escapology from chains and ropes and then from a five foot unicycle from a pair of manacles escapology meaning escape. Ology asks that all the other thing is that, what's the apology? You guys really call it that? Yeah. What do you call it? Oh, I don't think it's a name for it. I never even heard of that. I think it, Google will tell us there is an escape. Artists. I know there's escape artists. Does it exist? What does it his word? There's a thing called a skip ology. Live escape games were all escape rooms and there's a bunch of them. I don't know if it's the same thing as escape room. No, those are escape rooms. Escapology should be a, a book. An art form. It sounds like it's not really off. It's a craft. Well know Houdini was an artist of that. I was uh, I was jumping crofting person is practicing keeping from restraints.

Speaker 1:          01:50:33       Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Steal Books. She's battled his bag things. So I was just skyping from ropes and chains and you made a conscious decision to do this like on the street. Like this is how you're developing. That was developing because I couldn't get my sketch comedy thing wasn't going. I, there's a thing called the Edinburgh festival. We have Scotland. Yeah. You never that one. So I did 12 of those in the ends right before I took her off. So I did three doing sketch and then about four doing street. But on the street you have this freedom, know the freedom when things have worked in a bit and, and it's really kind of feral. No one's checking you up. No one knows what you're doing, you're just on the street. I was useless at this. And then I developed a confidence and gut confidence.

Speaker 1:          01:51:14       You know that the stomach's really important. It probably isn't fighting as well. There's something that comes out of the, there's a confidence center in the stomach. Really? Yeah. There's something about the stomach and you look into it with fighting. I think it's neurons, right? It's like this is something, everything joins there. There's something to do with it. Anyway, I felt, I developed this confidence on my own to go and stand on. If you've ever seen the film, my fair lady or seen the film of Eliza Doolittle bat is set on Covent garden. It's a massive, massive square. Um, Washington Square Park in New York was the quick and straightforward in place. So it's a big open place and I could stand up that on my own and talk to no one and build up an audience. I would set out these tea cozies, which are little animal tea, cozies ducks and hamsters with weird things, things that just look like animals and put them on the floor and people thought this guy's crazy and then let's start talking and there'll be literally no one there sometimes and I take it afternoon, I'm going to do a show.

Speaker 1:          01:52:10       Welcome to the invisible audience. Very nice to have you here. And I had this confidence if I just kept talking a bit like you know in your post here, you know you can keep talking. I can and I go on. Yeah, because of the odd, some visible people here as well. This is Dan's Jack and Kenyans and I would just go on and on until I built up about 20 people. Then I could start the show and then we get into it. And if you're doing an escapology show, in the end you're going to get out. You've worked at how to get out. And so there will be a definite end and then you can say, now don't go please, can you give me some money? So that's how I am my living. That's the Ninja training of performing because I learned perform when people didn't even want to see me.

Speaker 1:          01:52:48       Cause normally they, they've cut, they've come into a room and Lisa, okay, who is this guy? Then I, but we're in the room so let's drink a beer and watch. But if they're on the street, they don't have to watch. They can just walk up. And they often did. So it was a tough, I had it, I lost all my confidence on the street. In fact, I, in fact, I, there's a thing, army does this, you know, break you down and build you back up. The marines break you, then build you back up. And they also in, in, in, uh, drama school, they break you down and build, you buy this kind of idea. I accidentally broke myself down and built myself back up on the streets of London. So, wow. It's kind of beautiful. That's why I was creatively born, uh, this new version that had this thing.

Speaker 1:          01:53:26       Okay, we're going to talk about chickens. How many checkers it take to change a light bulb? Well, quite a lot really because you know, they can't, unless I had a friend with maybe a dog has helped them or they could rig up something. I just waffled on stuff. And if it didn't hit a punchline, I didn't care. I just carried on. It just kept going. And then the confidence things kind of gets you through. He just talks for hours. Um, so if you release a special and you've, you've released comedy specials before? Yeah. How do you develop new material once that special it's been released. I will do work in progress shows. So which I took from Lily Tomlin who did a lot of work in progress shares and then she did her show on Broadway I think. And I thought, cause I used to do the old tour and I used to tutor to it until at the end we'd film it and then I begin the next to with the old tour and just keep that improvising in the show cause at any improvise on stage.

Speaker 1:          01:54:13       And I would build up by the end of the next two will be a different show. But that didn't seem to work for people because they said we want to completely new show. So now I do this WIP shows, work in progress shows. Um, and I will go on stage and muck about just talking about chickens or banners or do you have a structure when you start, like say if it's the day after your specials done and now you have to work on a whole new special, you're doing a work in progress show first. Do you, how do you develop? We start with my life. I did it once where I just said, okay, let's go through my life. And so when I was a, you may not know this, but you know I went to, I was living in Northern Ireland. They were born in Yemen, I would go through, so I've done this troll through my life, I need some sort of structure, otherwise I'm stuck.

Speaker 1:          01:54:53       I also found that once I had recorded the show, like I lost tour force measure. I toured for five years because I just found there were no rules and touring, I could just keep going back and I did 45 countries so I can just keep on going. And uh, and I found those certain things I'd developed after we'd recorded it that were interesting and worth keeping. So I said, okay, well that's not in the old show. I'm going to pull that and start off the new show with that little bit, which is that little piece of material which is fun about. Um, and I was trading on a marathon than dog dogs will woofing at me. Uh, you know, I ran past the house where a dog was woofing at me and this is in the show now. And I suddenly thought for the first time ever, because dogs have swift to people all the beginning of time, I thought, what is the dog actually trying to say?

Speaker 1:          01:55:37       If the dog had Fox p two injected into him so he could suddenly took what would say to me, what is that Wolf Wolf? Well, what does that mean? And so it goes into, he's basically saying assassins assassins. I here, I know I'm a dog. It's my job. Get a gun. Because all dogs are very sure. You've never heard of an unsure Joel dragging your life barking. They're sure they are absolutely sure that it's assassins. It's not a postman is not the guy with a hamster outside assassins are here. Alarm alarm, danger will Robinson. Why have you never written anything down? Um, well I found initially I started to run the right stand up, but I would go and I was trying to type it or write it. So if you go in to a soup, uh, my, I'm very sorry. I'm dyslexic, so I'm the supermarket and there that I just thought I couldn't, I couldn't write.

Speaker 1:          01:56:38       I seem to be foster. If I was just ad libbing it. So you got a supermarket in this guy there and you know, and the shorts, fruit you go in and this fruit, fruit, fruit, fruit, fruit, fruit. And I found that if I just did it by finding it with the words and there's fruit and some fruit and you supposed to squeeze it, aren't you? And so I just think all the things I could think about fruit. So why is it fruit there? Why not toilet paper? You never go to the supermarket and toilet paper in there because they'd say, well that's a poo shot. You know, you have to go in as a fresh up. We've got fresh fruit here. So we are very fresh. Okay? That's why the fruit fruits right up front and you've got to squeeze it. But how much do you squeeze it and how do you know it's at the right pressure?

Speaker 1:          01:57:09       Squeeze it and what if it explodes? So I would just keep chatting. If it didn't work, you just move on. And that's how I developed, uh, this very conversational star that I have, which people say it's supposed to be improvisation. It's nice. It's just, um, I am, I'm always ready to improvise at any point. Some people, if you write a thing, you say, well, that is how that piece goes and it's locked in. But if you improvise a thing, I've noticed, I came up with this thing of molten material. When you first create a new idea and it's it, it's working, it's very open and live like quicksilver, like mercury. And then you can add another bit and another bit, another bit, and you can have a bit, once you put it into shape, then it becomes locked down and it becomes like a prayer and you can lose the joy of it.

Speaker 1:          01:57:50       It becomes a recitation. And I thought, so don't ever have it locked down. Keep it open, keep it always loose so that every time you say you're saying it a bit differently, and that's the style of developed. And so I can improvise at any point in the show. I can just stop it and go, what are wolves? Why have we got walls, walls and other people don't, you know, most animals in the world doesn't have walls, but we've got walls in that. Good. How's it, you know, when it's raining, they don't have bulls. They were okay. Should we have, you know, I just waffled about walls, isn't it? Okay. Don't talk about walls. And I've ever gangs also. So if I don't get anything out of it, I get jokes on the way out. I get laughs on the way out. So if I'm, if I don't get in the way in, so that's the technique I've developed.

Speaker 1:          01:58:34       Now when you say dyslexics, so if you read something, what do you see? I really, I see it, but I get word blindness. We're at blindness. I just see other words, long words. I, I couldn't wrap to my license. Took me ages to say let alone to spell. Um, I just find that I s I sub vocalize. So in my head I'm going to ask God, what are you doing here? I will almost say there. And you know when your kids, they actually read it out loud and I'm not reading out loud, but I'm saying it in my head and other people that they can do a page, you know, they do this speed reading and they just, you shouldn't, shouldn't and they could just take it whole pages. It's stunning. I can't, I don't understand that either. That's, that's tricky. So my spelling was Kat with a k ceiling with an FCA, logical spelling.

Speaker 1:          01:59:20       Um, my writing is all over the place, bigger letters, smaller letters, bigger letters. Um, and they tested me and they said I'm severely eight to two, eight, typically dyslexic. So I, I have a huge mental map memory. I can hold a lot of things in the memory in my head. So that's just sort of a permanent distinction like you do, this is just who you are. There's no way to fix that, it seems. So I haven't heard of anyone coming out of dyslexia and saying, now I can read much faster. Now I can do things. I just think it stuck with that. But it's a, it means you think sideways. And I think a lot of creative people with dyslexia, I think sideways. Yeah. So you see clouds, you see a line in the clouds, you see puff, there's a train going through the sky, you know, um, it's, it's a creative thing.

Speaker 1:          02:00:06       Juxtaposing things on your wall. You have to juxtapose the thing, which is they don't lead from one to the other. That could be fighting right against it all. Completely bonkers or out of it. I'm just looking at here in the room, you know, and, and linking things together. I think creativity, we're trying always trying to throw ourselves, but in comedy by something that's weird and opposite and funny. Um, Caesar, you should, you know, I'm going for the salad line when I said that sees a deal. I think it's solid. And then people seems to make people Africa, I, yeah, Caesar Salad and this guy was, he murdered really? Where did the million goal if people, you know, and he ends up as a salad is not a cognac. Napoleon gets a cognac brandy, but he's a Samad. What's that about? So, um, yeah, this is my dyslexic traits, but I think you get dealt these cards when you're born, whatever genetic cards they are.

Speaker 1:          02:00:56       And the, the art of life is to play your cards as well as you can. And the art of comedy is to relay your life in a humorous way very much. And that's your unique fingerprint as you know, if, if we all have experienced say, well I seem like another comedian, we'll talk about your own life and your own perspective. It's got three different to the next person. It's because no two people the same. Is that what you enjoyed the most or the standard? Uh, no dramatic films I probably enjoy the most because I wanted to do that when I was a kid, I discovered that films existed. I broke into Pinewood Studios, one of our big studios when I was 15 broken. Yeah. Like, like illegally. Yeah. Yeah. Got It. Yeah. Well I, I was watching a film battle of Britain and at the end it says filmed on location in, in Spain and England at Pinewood Studios.

Speaker 1:          02:01:45       I've a heath bucks and I was in the 70s and then remember we didn't have videos, we couldn't freeze things. So he's just a scribble things down. So I was scribbling down stuff off the end of films and I said, I promise I have a youth pastor, I've a heath, what is that? But it was a bucks. Okay, bucks is short for Buckingham. Sure. That's a place I have a heath must be a town. It's a weird name, town, city, village. There must be a village or town. So I got a map of the United Kingdom, which had alphabetically every town and village and city, they're going listed alphabetically. And I went all the way down and the, okay, that's where it is. So I took a train from my, the south coast of England up to London tube train underground train that to place called [inaudible] on a bus to this, this roundabout.

Speaker 1:          02:02:26       And I got off, I said Pinewood Studios, they said it's about half a mile down that road. So I marched down the road and I got to the big gabled entrance where all the big stars would come in. And they went up and they haven't got this bit worked out. So her went up and I said, um, I'm gonna, I'm going to be in films. Could I come in please? Which one I'm going to, I'm going to make, I got to, I want to be an that. Can I come in? I just want to do is piss off kid. Just I need just told me to piss off. And I thought, no, I've come miles. This is a big, so I thought the must be another way in. So I went up and there was another entrance that was near it, but it wasn't the main star enters. It was just the, they're kind of more Laurie engines, the truck entrance, the bringing stuff in.

Speaker 1:          02:03:13       And I saw people going into that. There was a drawbridge a bit like where eagles dare the film anyway, someone on the gate and some people was showing them passes and stuff and other people just walking in. So I thought, okay, you've got to have the confidence to walk in. So I did the 16 1516 year old confidence and I just marched in and suddenly I was thrown and I was in, I was into Bible study. So then in a spill or broken the universal, I broke into, into thing, he got a career going pretty immediately. I didn't get nothing goes well you're 15 and I know his well it was, you expect what's going to happen. What was your anticipation? Anticipation was, as I've said in a piece of standard that I, cause I, I had to walk at a certain speed. If you're moving a certain speed, I thought no one's going to stop you so you can't creep around looking.

Speaker 1:          02:04:00       Was this, cause they said, what are you doing here? You know, I just thought, in fact it's kind of loose inside studios and no one really knows what everyone else is doing, so you can actually creep around it a bit. But I will run a certain speed and I sort of March. So I was marching down streets in Arles and past studios and, and I was hoping somebody go, hey, you kid. Yeah. Uh, we, you your marching around. Yeah, we're doing the film called the marching around kids. Our lead kid has just exploded. Can you continue my, yeah, I could watch your aunt. Can you say words could string a few words together. Right? How do you relieve, I marched down to same, I must say we're done here. I marched around for two hours and I marched that and I've since filled twice or three times in plywood and they ain't going to, I want to do.

Speaker 1:          02:04:47       And whenever you tell him, I go back and I'm actually filming that guy. I broke him. Yeah. This is what, and I just walk at very slow speeds down streets knowing that anyone could stop me and I'll go, I'm just filming around the company. It's, yeah, it's, um, so I love films and I've just finished my first film, six minutes to midnight that I've co written and produced it. And what does it, um, it's a set in a, just for the beginning of world war two, the w I, I grew up this little seaside town like America has seaside town as well as well for the old days when people used to go to seaside towns before they went to the hot countries and Quebec Ceylon season, the Hastings, Brighton and the south coast of Maine and the 26 schools there for some reason, 26 schools, it was linked up.

Speaker 1:          02:05:32       There was an Earl Delaware that it's set the place up anyway, one of these things new. And one of them had young girls, a German girls who are linked to the Nazi high command and they were over to learn English and make friends and be ambassadors. And because there was obviously fascism in Germany and then we'll fascist in Britain and they were making friends and, and that was the idea there was going to be, Hitler had this idea of linking that with British and taking everyone on and which some people in Britain were forwards and obviously a lot of us were against. And, uh, it sat around this girls school and I was showing the badge, the blazer badge, or the girls had a blazer and blue blazer and I had a badge and it has the name of the school or Augusta Victoria College Bexhill on sea.

Speaker 1:          02:06:17       And that the top, it has a British flag and then the Nazi swastika next to it. And I thought, holy cow, I've just never seen those two flags right next to each other in the same badge. So I thought there's a film in that. So we've made a film. Wow. Judy Dench is in it. Jim Broadbent, both Oscar winners and myself. And what would that be released? Uh, rolling it out from the end of this year from a full, as you call it, autumn form with you. So your love of acting and creating films, that's, that's your primary. Even Trump stand up. I do love stand up and I could do stuff on whenever I worried that trumped is still word. I know. Isn't it weird? It's a weird, that must, he must love that that word exists. That Trump actually means to one up and better. I'm not even going to go there.

Speaker 1:          02:07:04       It's crazy, right? Yeah. It also means making tricks. You Trump things and you can make tricks. Oh really? Yeah. I didn't know that. We have tricks and cards. And how many trips have you gone? That was tricky. Dicky Nixon. So that's uh, another person who did one or two lies and untruth down his, yeah, he was also a bad guy. So, uh, anyway, yes, it's, I love, I do love stand up. I was never planning to be a stand up. I was going to be a sketch comedian comedy. Well, I was going to be an actor and then I thought I can't do it. My teenage years, I had no sexual self confidence. The transgender thing didn't play a part in there. I just, I was playing football to soccer up until 13, so I was kind of, Hey, I'm going to run a back guy.

Speaker 1:          02:07:42       I'm kind of fast athletics, whatever. Then I go to a school, I'm nothing and there's no girls here and I can't do this. And the oil bodies changing all that. And I just lost all my confidence and I just thought I can't. And I was quite small. So at school it was all about tall kids. You played at the renowned romantic lead, small kids, you're the slave or the servant. So I thought, okay, forget this, I'll do comedy. I do the comedy because I love the comedy. And Monte Python discovered them. I thought, okay, I'll do the darling. I love you. You're made out of cheese. I have, my knees are on fire with this. I just make it rubbish. And I thought, okay, that's easier. So I did that and they wouldn't take off my career, just wouldn't, you know, left school, dropped out of university, couldn't get it going.

Speaker 1:          02:08:20       And by the time he got going when I was about 30, I thought, I'm not going to hold onto this comedy and start doing drum at the same time. So I've run these parallel things and I'm going to be on Broadway. Um, uh, the beginning of the next year. Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf? Laurie Metcalf. Oh Wow. Scott Rudin production. So, oh, interesting. That was the same movie. Yeah. Great movie. As I say, I'm doing who's afraid of Elizabeth Taylor and I'm playing Richard Burton and um, yeah, that, so that's an amazing production, you know, performing with Judi Dench and films and Stephen Frears Film Victoria and Abdul. Um, so I'm getting great drama roles now. I've pushed a long time to do that. But normally if you do comedy, they won't let you do drive. You did drama, you don't review committee. It's sort of breaking down though. Right? Steve Carell's, Steve [inaudible], he has, he has moved to if he, if he does, I'm not sure if he's doing the companies too much anymore, but exactly where Steve Kraus gone.

Speaker 1:          02:09:11       John Lithgow also say he was someone who was visually dramatic career, but then you did federal for the sandwich. You beautiful. And he was nominated every year and won two Emmy's and no one had six times. Just fantastic word. Yeah, I was on news radio at the same time I was out. So we're in the same network, right? Yeah. His stuff was great. Yeah, it's great actor. I stunning. You know, you played them Churchill in the crown with the Churchill of darker side of church or that people don't know about, which I knew, well here's a guy that really has a, a love of theater, a love of performing. When when he talks about it you could see like, cause it's goosebumps raise and you just, you could see his, he gets excited. Yes, I can absolutely feel that. I mean he played such a range of Kate, if you just playing evil, you just think this guy is so evil when he's playing the character in, uh, in the federal for the sun, um, it's just a beautiful, I watched it and you can't really, for some reason you can't. I couldn't download it in Britain, but I found a place I could find it. So I'm on a second. I've watched every single episode and now going through the second time. So it's just beautiful stuff. So when you're, you got into standup comedy. When you first started doing that, what is the scene like in England? It was there comedy clubs where you could go to an open mic night. We were, how do you, we were copying you guys.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       I think Lenny Bruce set up the more alternative version cause it, but I still think in America it's, it's always stayed kind of mainstream. But Lenny Bruce was definitely doing alternative and then she got a lot of Lenny. I love that guy. But yeah, and I play them on stage and that was a wonderful thing. What did you play him in Lenny? He know the film was from a stage play. Dustin Hoffman Film. That was a stage play. Dustin Hoffman was fantastic. He was so close. And the guy who plays him in the marvelous Mrs Maizel is very good as well. I know. That's very interesting, isn't it? Because I'm watching that. I'm thinking, okay, now I've, I've gone through the clubs myself, but I did mine in the eighties into the nineties and that's in the 50s wow. And I sort of take myself there and then there's Lenny, then I think he, I know Lenny and I play them.

Speaker 2:          02:11:21       I used to diet. Oh God, that's me looking at that. But I was, I was doing the standup, I w I see that, I put that together. That was, and I called him to Jesus crisis of comedy because as a Jewish guy, he died for us to die for us to give us the freedom of speech. He died for freedom of speech because in the end that will go heroin too. I know, but the mixture together, he shouldn't have completely the two. He made sure that we could say what we wanted to understand. The missus Maizel things makes it a little, it's a little homogenized like him, like in even his struggle. It's almost like it's no big deal. Are you in the latest season? Is it, is it three or two? Three hasn't released yet. They're filming it right now through both of them. It's really good.

Speaker 2:          02:12:10       Really. It's, it's not accurate. Like historically it's way off the mark. There's no woman who's talking like that. Back then it wasn't, there was no mrs main song. I really liked it. And uh, it's interesting sheet. Yeah. Like norm McDonald got mad about it. He's like, Hey, I was, there was no woman like that back then. They would say that she, there's no, it doesn't, I mean, can we give it to, if it's a fucking show man, the hawks, not really either. There's no guy will becomes the hawk now. I enjoy it. I really like normally talking, but I love him. Yeah, I didn't have, there was a, she was swearing like a, like a soldier on stage very quickly, very quickly. Which that was I found, I don't know how she ramped into that and then she dropped out of it. It was, that was something was bad and then she went to France and I want to just start and did stand up.

Speaker 2:          02:12:59       There's someone was translating and like that was weird. I have done it in French and I don't think I could've got that. I didn't know why that, that seems just seem to be slightly shocked, not jumping a shark going up to the shock shark, swimming around chefs, artistic interpretation. They, they, they, it wasn't realistic, but it was still, it was, and that's a person who makes a living doing standup comedy. I was willing to let that suspension of disbelief taste. And I like the, the, the sexual relationship is always coming back. The husband's almost coming back into the frame and his and his fight that, um, cause yeah, but no, I, I did watch a binge watch all, that's what I'm doing there. I just sit down and I just watched everything and then I moved on. Um, but uh, yeah, Lenny um, how do we get them to, Lenny was talking about something else, but anyway, no, it was great.

Speaker 2:          02:13:47       It was great playing Lenny but oh yes, I was, I was doing the standups and I was just told by Director Peter Hall, I'll leave the standup to you. So I had no direction on it, so I just did it as close as I could to how Lenny would have done it. Did you listen to a lot of recordings? I did that. That was very difficult for British. Uh, kids are maybe math and kids of today to know cause he's doing a lot of hipster references. A lot of, you know, the Sophie Tucker references and there's a, there's a Lawrence Welk. Is it the Welsh Welsh, yeah. We don't know those guys. So when he was doing it, cause there's Sophie Tucker and the guy, I can look up. So for that I'd have to look up some of the punchlines or none of that number of the references cause you without the references you can't get it.

Speaker 2:          02:14:26       This is a trick I do in universal humor that I take either huge references or explained my references so that you know, uh, sees everyone probably knows about season if they don't. Well I yeah. Anyway, good as Lenny was. It's really hard for people to listen to that comedy today. It doesn't necessarily trends, it doesn't transfer well he's talking about Nixon and you're going, oh Nixon, Nixon knows this is a vice president Nixon and this is Eisenhower, Nixon, different thing. Um, so he, I worked out that all the, all my stuff is non datable is no, I didn't do any topical stuff. I don't do party political stuff. So it should not date. I do historical stuff cause that never takes, you know, sees it. It's not going to come back. Now sees this changed his whole thing. He's much nicer though. He's come back from the dead and he's cleaned up his act.

Speaker 2:          02:15:13       Um, so I've, I've tried to do that and python did this as well. You do stuff, it just doesn't really date. Most of it doesn't date, which is a handy thing. So yeah. But I did watch stand up does, and it's also the, the, the, the culture is so significantly different between the late fifties and sixties where Lenny Bruce was sort of starting out and making his mark versus today. It's like the things that were naughty back then, the things that he could say that were controversial, there were nothing today. They're the, literally it's a non controversy whether those one that that still was was when he said how many people using the n word, the n ass working, they just went to all the, how many are in the [inaudible]? How many of the way? And then I did this, I used to do that on stage every night. And that was still a striking dance. Yeah. Yeah. But the, the sentiment behind it was that these words only have power because it cause we give them and if he could use him again, again, again, yeah. And for the gay community, they taking the word queer reclaimed that so it doesn't have the force anymore. And that that is the truth. He spoke, he was at, that was a true analysis that he did. Yeah, it was, um, we had some still Joe, there was a, unfortunately accidentally a friend of mine stole one of his jokes and didn't know the,

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       he actually just thought of the same premise. Yeah. And he was the, the premise was that uh, homosexuality in some places illegal. And what do they do if they catch you while they lock you up in jail with a bunch of men who want to have sex with you? Like in that was Lenny Bruce's line. Like Digg, homosexuality is illegal. Right. So what are they, do they put you in jail with a bunch of men will have sex with you? You know, like that was his whole like, and like that still would work today. Like, if there was a place where homosexuality was illegal today and you did that joke, it's a good joke. It's like set up punchline. It's all right there. Yeah. Lenny was ahead of it and you know, he's early stuff was more mainstream than you can ever believe doing way, way mate.

Speaker 3:          02:17:12       Same as Carlin. If you listen to Carlin's really stuff. Yeah, I've heard of, yes. I think God, it was like, like just like a typical Jack Paar tonight show set and it was all like really like down the middle, squeaky clean and he wore suits and he was a clean cut. You're seeing Carl in the early days. I think I've seen once. I, I, yeah, I do know there was, it wasn't, there was his tie and a suit. There was a change. Well, Glenn, he had a complete change and that thing in the film where he says, you'll never play here. And what's the area in upstate New York? Catskills. The Catskills. Yeah. Um, I remember when I watched it first I thought, oh, that's a terrible thing to have. But now that I know what that was, it was a certain belt of, you know how you're going to put out, that's George Carlin play a little bit of this. It's crazy from the Merv Griffin show, big hassle. We never see how the Indians prepare. Oh awful. That suit is just because they started defending Malibu

Speaker 6:          02:18:21       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:18:23       but is that sort of style, you know, he had that, I mean that's what you did back then. This is the Merv Griffin show. I mean it really didn't have any options. That's how you perform. Otherwise they wouldn't let you on. What she did change on a dime did he arrested a bunch of times, you know, and he became a marijuana enthusiasts and the, you know, it started, it just the, the, the, the times changed and I think you can only sit back and observe for so long before you start commenting on things. And then he shifted and he became, and I think he was also experiencing prior, like prior of course was I think Lenny Bruce was the original. Yeah. But prior was the one who made it insanely personal and it was insanely vulnerable on stage and also he had a point to a lot of the things he was doing. I mean I think if there's a great, I don't think there's a greatest standup of all time, but if there is, it might be prior. You know, that he just, he had this perspective that was just wholly individually like holy, it's up 10

Speaker 2:          02:19:27       years later. That's why it looks six bid really does change at the end that I have been here. Yeah. I mean he was looking at him, he's got a look fucking Steve jobs outfit on now. Yeah. He became, it became a, you know, they hippie hair got longer. I have a bear. Um, Richard Pryor, I think Richard Pryor is for me. He was, cause I had this, I had this base of, of uh, Monte Python, which is what I was going to do. And then I had Richard Pryor and Billy Connolly, Scottish comedian, British economy, those two, Billy talks too, just so relaxed with talking the large groups of people and what Richard was doing. It was the acting out of all the characters thing. That was the wonderful thing. That's what I do. Well, you're going to do and why we did it was a no. The dog says the dog is doses.

Speaker 2:          02:20:19       Come on in. Hey, come on in to burglars. Yeah, you called me. You shall not leave. Dobermans playing these, these different voices and characters and what he could do and that was just, that was stunning to me. Yeah. He was something special. Look at him back in there too. That's literally him like on the wall back there. A mugshot. That's the same era. It could be. That could have been that night. Yeah. Might happen that night. There's some fantastic recordings that, I don't know where they are now, but they used to be able to buy them. I bought them on a truck stop and there were from Red Foxx comedy club and they were cassette tapes and a, I was on, I was doing a road gig and I think I found them. I bought a bunch of them and these recordings where they just said set up a tape recorder and he was doing these random sets at Red Fox is comedy club and it was a lot of experimenting, a lot of ad libbing, a lot of me clearly high on stage.

Speaker 2:          02:21:17       I mean he would get go on state high a lot and it was just ramble about stuff and they would, you would see these bits forming and coming out of that and then some of those bits eventually would be on some of his more famous albums. It was great. Great stuff. Just to see this guy who was just, so, if you go, if you go from, you know, your traditional standup comedian from 1960 like you were seeing George Carlin onstage to what prior was doing in the 70s it's is so different, so radically, radically different. And he took it to a different place or we, you were talking about the scene in Britain were interesting. We don't really have much of a film industry if we don't have it as quite set up. You know, obviously it's huge. And in America compared to what we are. We have a quite a good TV industry. So, but we toured like crazy. Um, so there's lots of tours in a hundred seats, 500 a thousand seaters, thousand five, 2000 CFUs that goes on like endlessly all the time, way more than it used to before. So, and there's, there's lots of clubs and they will, a lot of them would just room above a pub type clubs. So I believe the clubs in America, which

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       much more set up there was a bar thing, system people come out and do the drinks and, and, and it was quite a cash outlay had to get this club going. And it would be, you know, most nights of the week we'd have it one night a week, it just be a function room in a pub that existed for maybe hundreds and hundreds of years because all these puppies to be taverns drinking and it wasn't used. And they sit there, some guy would say, hey, I'll run a club up here. I'll take the door money. You take the bar money. And that was the deal. So a lot of amateurs running it. So we had lots of club. We had that 60 70 80 clubs in London. You could, you could zip around. Yeah. It was a ridiculous amount. And so for me, what the Beatles had with the, with playing in Germany, I had with London and we'll have with playing in London, you could, you could do four in a night, five, four foreign a night, quite, quite easily on the Friday and Saturday.

Speaker 1:          02:23:15       You just jumped in taxis and zip between different gangs they do in New York. Yeah. Yeah. But it was just so many clubs. Oh Wow. So it was beautiful. I think there's less now, but it's a, there's lots of open Mike nights now and so many people wanted to get into it. You can create, there's no top to the Korea now. We playing, people are playing an arena. I started doing arena tours. I'm now doing more theaters on this one. My audience has got a bit older. But anyway, jumping between the two, like playing Hollywood bowl here, I, you know, in La that's such a beautiful thing to play. And it's the Greeks got it right. The loft of rolls down the hill, played it twice now and it's just gorgeous. I've never played there, but I've been there for a few times for a few different things.

Speaker 1:          02:23:55       I saw Annie there and I saw the, what is it? Oh a nightmare. Before Halloween. Yeah. You so Annie the musical. Yeah, they do the musical there, do a version of it. And they do a, the nightmare before Halloween where they play, they play the movie and then they have a symphony and the symphony and didn't think Annie B you'll kind of have kids. Do you needed to say that? Cause I just didn't enjoy it. All right. I'm bored out of my fucking mind. No, I was just going to leave with that. And he's your kind of, I always, it always comes in. Yeah. Well I like everything. I like a lot of things that you would think you wouldn't like, you know that uh, for the people of la or people at the world, I believe that the Hollywood bowl is a la park, so you can actually go up there and have you sandwiches anytime you want, which is a beautiful thing.

Speaker 1:          02:24:45       I do that. I can drive up there cause it looks like don't come in here. There's barriers and stuff, but now you can pack up and go and it's a park. It's still a park. I love that space. It's just got, and I knew that Monty python and played there so I thought I couldn't play well. It's beautiful too because it's all outdoors and you know, La has such amazing weather and you look around, you see the houses and the distance and it's like this, it's a special little spot. It's beautiful. I don't, Dave Chappelle's done some gigs there. I think Chris rock did a gig there. That's a must be a fun place to perform too. It's just, it works. That amphitheater thing, I think it was the Greek democracy and empathy others and uh, yeah. Do you still go to clubs all, I don't so much.

Speaker 1:          02:25:25       I was reading the definitive thing on Robin Williams and Harry, he would jump into clubs and do stuff and go on. And I, I it doesn't, that doesn't really work for my stuff. I tend to get a small, I can divert club like for the work in progress shows I was doing, I was taking, I was, they, they uh, they have the Al Marri Club in uh, in isn't to know angel in London, sort of north, northeast Linda. And uh, they had, you know, show going on at six one at seven and eight, you know, and I would take an hour of that and just do that again, again and again. So I'll, I'll take an hour and I'll go out for an hour and workshop to show and as opposed to coming on doing 15 minutes on a, off the top of my head, cause I find that if I, if I'm completely going scatter gun, just trying to find funny, that doesn't really help me.

Speaker 1:          02:26:14       I need to keep crafting this stuff cause then I can use on the show. Yeah. I also don't need, if it's a, if it's just a, if it's a comedy club, they want it faster, they want it quickly, they want it smooth and I'm not looking to hit the gags. I'm just looking to find things and have the space to stop and go. What is it about cheese? Right. Why is it got to ease in it? I just want to waffle around until I go. Okay, that, that's a good, I'll keep that pit. Do you ever feel like, uh, like when you're doing that like Jesus Christ, I got to get off this fucking subject. Like there's nothing there. Well yeah I do that but then I do this thing I write on my left hand like it's a note to self and I go a bit.

Speaker 1:          02:26:50       If I do pig farmer talking about pigs and stuff, they never talk about pig farming there. You guys will pick firms. All right, I'm not talking about it. Never talking about cheese again. Cheese jokes do not work. Especially in North East London. You can, you just get it, try and get lost on the way out. The career is over. Cheese is taking over my life. But, um, do you do some gigs dressed in your girl mode in some boring mode boy mode? Or can I can, I can do it whatever mode they want now. It complete human torch thing. I can fly so I can wear a dress or I could wear trousers and it doesn't matter. And they don't give a monkey's either. That's interesting. It's now, well they're your fans. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. It's that coming. Yeah. So, uh, but I think get a disappointed if he dresses as a man, um, boy, girl mode.

Speaker 1:          02:27:40       Um, they, uh, I dunno. I don't care. I shouldn't care. I can't be stage stage. Oh, I wonder, cause because that's nothing to do with the comedy. Yes. Yeah. And I do think some people thought it was, you know, he's going to talk about lipstick for two hours. So anywhere, another lipstick. I know it was gross it at all. Do you address it at all in your act diagonally? I will do it diagonally. Diagonally, yeah. Um, so it's never the front part of the, the thing. Um, I will just say, uh, uh, what's a good day? It would not be the front of the subject. I might point in passing. Um, so the, the front, I'll talk about ancient king stuff with Banjos, Doug's with fighting cats, anything like that. And then I'm, then I might mention it just in passing as opposed to let me tell you about being transgender.

Speaker 1:          02:28:32       I just don't do that. I talk about the fights. I told about the fight I had, which was a in the street and that this guy was saying this and I said this. And so we to either like I built a fight into a huge thing if we stand off stuff. So just I can make that into, into something. But um, no it's not cause it's supposed to be the background of, uh, of what I'm doing. The, the essential thing, if you'd like surreal comedy off the wall comedy, that's what I do. And I just happened to be transgender, which makes no odds in these these days.

Speaker 2:          02:29:02       Do you find that more today than ever? People are asking you questions about transgender issues because they're, they're at the forefront now. Less action. Less. Yeah. Less real interesting. There was a point early stage of the spokesperson it was on

Speaker 1:          02:29:15       and they would, yes. Well, um, if not a spokesperson, I was someone who was going to talk about it. This chapter is all about this and I do an interview and if it was an hour interview, about 40 minutes would be on the, on that and then, and then when the Keto writer, they thought, well, I'm just writing all about this transaction. All right, let's, let's put that back a bit. And then they used to balance it that when they wrote the interview out. But um, would you rather that they just accept it and just not bringing it? I'm fine with it. And I, I, after the marathons, it'll, it changed because they said, oh, so cause I used to say action transvestite and executive transvestite. There was, I was in New York, has played New York and they said, um, article a guy was found living in one of the caves in the park in New York and he finds that have a lot of women's shoes in there, so he's probably a transvestite.

Speaker 1:          02:30:04       And I went, okay, well that's where they're transvestite. I'm not living in a cave, I'm traveling business class on the plains. This is executive transmits that so I cannot with that one. And then the action transvestite was just kind of a fun, cause I was more kind of Boise about things that I'll give people grief in the streets if they give me grief. And then, uh, after the marathons it came, uh, became a different thing and everyone just went, oh, I've had some, you know, I remember a guy, this was a very interesting altercation because hardly any words in it. So I'm, I live near Victoria coach station in London, um, most of the time, whatever around. And I was walking down there and then anyway, it's a coach station, so people are traveling all over the, over the Europe from there. And I walked out and I was in girl mode. This guy looks at me and said, hey, it is a ew, ew, ew.

Speaker 2:          02:30:52       On all those marathons. And you were all that clubber, which all? And then he went, yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and it was just like he was getting me a pass. He was going up. Well, okay. Okay. Fab. Yeah. Well, I, that's what my, I, you know, I didn't have a negative opinion of you. I had a positive opinion of you, but my positive opinion of you elevated once I saw you did those marathons. My Dad's a person with an iron will. That's a different kind of like, you eat it.

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       It was so huge what you did that everyone had to respect it. Like they knew they couldn't do it, or if they could do it, they haven't, you know, that that action that's covered. Yes. I haven't. You accomplished something pretty spectacular. It was beautiful. And it, and I did about five things at once and it was raising money. Yeah. So I've think I've raised about four and a half million pounds about I was 6 million, $700. So that feels great. That's with their help because the organization is good at raising the money. And uh, it gave me this, this, this confidence, this health thing back from when I was a kid. I used to be, a lot of us were running around you when you did that. First one was I was 47. So you're 47 and just decided, yeah, I'm off. Um, it was, it was training.

Speaker 1:          02:32:07       I wanted to do something. I, it's an adventure as well and you know, I think you have to live life as an adventure, otherwise life is too hard. But if you look at as eventually it means the highs and lows built into it. Um, and I, I got this, this health kick out of it. Um, uh, it was just a number of that. And then I could meet people. I remember on the first math and then I met three army sergeants who were, and they said, we've heard you're doing this, some of the British army and what? I was just having something that we halfway through my, what was it about my 10th marathon? He said, we heard, we heard you're doing this. And, and, and there were chatting to me and you know, cause I know forces and I have that mentality. I'm very happy to chat.

Speaker 1:          02:32:49       And suddenly I thought, wow, this is an interesting respect thing. He said. And they said, we're trainers, we train, we work out the training regimes for the army. And so we were very interested in what you're doing and what you seem to be able to do. So they just found it fascinating. And I found that fascinating. I could suddenly talk to service people in a certain way, a sports people in a certain way. It, everything just shifted. And people from death, different ethnic, uh, groups. Some people have laid down on some ethnic groups, the down on being transgender or whatever. But if you're doing that, then he says, okay, we put these two together and you want a different place. So it, it has completely changed the way a lot of people react to me. Yeah. I can only imagine they don't necessarily come to the comedy, but that's fine because they respect you.

Speaker 1:          02:33:37       Yeah. There's just certain different things happen and uh, and you can, and I'd like to chat to people. I found that chatting is very important because if you see someone and it's a blog, make makeup, whatever, and you get lipstick and you go, people can go Ooh, but if you say hi, nice weather today, and they go, ah, yes, on a different footing and trying to put you into a place of normalcy. Yeah. Well I'm trying to put myself, they will, they will allow me indicating they will allow me in. And it's normal. It is. The talking is the most important thing. Just chatting away and being boring. I have a natural boringness. I think maybe everyone has an awful boring this. I think the really interesting people

Speaker 2:          02:34:17       probably just blow up and when they are in their twenties and stuff because they just do stuff that's too far out, but most of us are pretty boring and then we add layers of interestingness on tops to to to reach that level of, okay. I think I'm quite interesting that I think I've got enough interest in going on a but my boring in chatting, I am chatting and talking about whether or wood or walls or trees or that introduces the normalcy. Yeah, the boring. I won't say, I won't say we've got to do something extreme now. I'll just chat about yeah, normal thing. Yeah. Where'd you get that jacket? That's quite a good jacket on you on. You woke up me, you know, just just talk about things and B, be human, be a human being and she's the biggest controversy in America in terms of transgender people.

Speaker 2:          02:35:04       Probably the biggest or one of the biggest is competing in sports with biological women. That's the biggest one. Yes. If you're asking me for answers on that, uh, haven't really got them. I know. Yeah. I've got one good one for, um, for washrooms as you call them. Lectures, restaurant, which is on the urinals as you call them. He called me rhinos. Just check them all out and everyone just, it's all cubicles. And we already do that in restaurants. We already share stuff. Uh, the, the, the toilets in, right? We do it in the airplanes. We have no bother. If you just remove urinals at, in theaters and places the won't be carrying often than women are queuing forever and the men are not curing this way. Everyone shares, everyone behaves around responsibility. I've heard of it working in a school as well. There's less bullying in, in the lose.

Speaker 2:          02:35:54       So it's the idea, just check it's regression of technology. I take it says get the wrong, check it out the window. Everyone has a cubicle. Just go to the loo and then use the mirrors and, and, and then go at it. It's just everything being for both genders. You just make it all. Even then we get outside a lot of problems. Some people will have pushed back on that and have other reasons why they didn't like it. But women don't want to be in a washroom with men though where they already are going into. If they're sharing it, they're losing the airplane. If they're sharing it in a, yeah, but a little airplane is one, you know, it's only a strong person to go in there. I think their concern is there's, you know, some men are fucking creeps and some women just want to have a place where they could just be themselves and check their makeup and go to the bathroom and wash and talk amongst other one.

Speaker 2:          02:36:41       I understand that it's just, I've, you know, um, if you think about anything that's going to change anything, there's usually something that won't. Wherever. The only reason to do this is to accommodate people who are transgender in a way that it seems like it doesn't, it doesn't put them in a position where they, they can be judged because everyone's doing it. It makes, well, if he stops bullying in schools, then it's, it's, it's a number of things in there that, that, that it can make easier. It just makes a whole, whole area of things a lot easier. How would it stop bullying? I don't know what it has gone. I mean, I'm just giving you the figures kind. I said, well, they just said that they tried it in the school and the bullying went down. She has his gills and his boys together and it's like boys are bullied.

Speaker 2:          02:37:25       The boys or girls are believe the girls, but if you, yeah. So it's to have them all together. They don't, it seems so now I, it's just punished the creeps, which is really what you, I mean, if someone's being a creep in a bathroom, that the problem is the creep. It's not the bathroom. Right? Yeah. Yeah. It's, um, anyway, so this is a, you know, I haven't scientifically proved this with chemicals and at a slide rule or whatever, but it's an idea that gets to us to a better place and surely we're all somewhere on the spectrum of something. So the idea that, um, that anyone who is expressing themselves in a different way, that that is a problem. If you take it back just straight period. If we all went back to how we used to think that there was just men and women and everyone had strikes, sex, uh, even s that sex, that when we talk about that people Victorian Age, your quiver Victorian age.

Speaker 2:          02:38:16       Now when we're talking about that, that was all horrible. Sex was a, procreation was the whole idea of everything. So if you, I'm trying to get out to a practical place where people just go to the loo and behave like adults, even the kids have to behave more like adults, which is interesting. That makes, that makes sense. I see what you're saying. Yeah. And me. Yeah. That is the concern, right? Was it, we have a system in place and someone tries to change the system, then people get upset that the trench and that always happens. Yeah. I mean, uh, but also women do queue forever and men don't queue at all. Right. Q much less. But this makes it so easy. It makes it queuing even evens that out. So like an at all. It's just a toilet. The Romans used to have it with open plan toilets, then have a chat.

Speaker 2:          02:39:02       I've seen that we have made it into a problem. We have made this a whole psychological brom, whether I'm just sit down there and have a pool and have a chat. And once they did make it a problem and categorize people by gender, then it became this thing. And now you don't want to change that. Well, yeah, I don't think that they might've had many male and female toys in the room at times, but it just, the fact that they were more open about the idea, there's bodily functions and just normal. And we've, you know, back before we came in and we were just going out into the woods and the forest and having a pool and it was just having a pool and now we feel it's a big problem having a, we don't like it, the fact we it, but we don't want to admit that we have the PR does the Queen, they've have a poop.

Speaker 2:          02:39:40       Maybe Nafa has the attitude be besides the marathon thing, has the attitude culturally shifted in the UK the same way it shifted in America where people are more, I think the more there's more and more people are out and a positive. I mean you've basically got two from every group. This is ethnic groups is from women. This is from any one that, that feels slightly out of the loop. If you can have a pause, any positive role models that go out there that do other things, you know, just something that's nothing to do with sexuality. You're very good at cooking on television for this. It tends to be television helps. Um, you great sports star, you're this, you're that. Those things people say, well there's a positive role model and they are of a different color or of a different sexuality or their, you know, and that just helps everyone adjust their mindset.

Speaker 2:          02:40:28       And the younger people come through and they, oh, that's all they know and know about this person. I mean like you know in baseball you see the Bait, that famous documentary baseball, the Ken Burns, Ken Burns one, and that black people after the civil war, black people were playing baseball. And then there was some guy who was very powerful. He said there will be no black people in major leagues at all. And it was blocked from about 1890 something like this, all the way through to 1950s so it was actually happening and then it went backwards. So there was a positive role then. Well, why over that happen? Things can go backwards and things go forwards and I just think if we're trying to get to a world where everyone's live in that live, yeah, that's really what we need, right? It's just live and let live live in that songs, you're not interfering with other people's lives.

Speaker 2:          02:41:20       You long as you're not doing something that somehow or another fucks with someone else. Like who cares? Why would anyone care? I mean, I think people care because they're unhappy with themselves. I think that's the only time people care and let my, my issue with this that I've come across is with athletes. It's with transgender athletes competing against women, particularly in my field and fighting. Right. Um, there's been some, there have been at least there was one very vocal case when we're very public case of a transgender athlete who was a male for 30 plus years, transitioned over for a couple of years, for two years, and then started fighting. Women didn't tell them that she used to be a man and it became a giant issue and people were outraged and anger. The women who got beat up or angry cause they got destroyed. Two of them did.

Speaker 2:          02:42:13       And then she started, then she was public about it and then started fighting women that were willing and new. You've got to say things upfront. I came out that long ago because I wanted to be up front about things. So yeah. And I don't have the great answers. I've been, I've balanced with everything. But yeah, I can see that. One of the interesting things about it is that there are no real answers, that it's one of those things where you just got to go home. What do we do here? And this is, this is what I think one of the more unique things about being a person is that we have this opportunity to look at this unusual circumstance and communicate about it and try to figure it out. Communication, the whole thing. I just knew my personal thing. If I came out, if we started talking about it, we'd get in a better place than not talking about it and just saying it's a negative. She came out to to give you a feeling of relief. Unbelievable. I mean, you know Skype, you know, cause you've got the secret. And the secret is, is I did self analysis. I lay on a bed and said, why am I thinking this way? What is going on? Why do I get them? What are the thoughts? Like what, what?

Speaker 2:          02:43:18       Yeah. So I, okay, here's the clearest way I can show it. Uh, there was a woman on television, you said, my daughter, she was 12 and she was upstairs, she was wearing my makeup, she's wearing my heels and I told her to get that stuff off. What are you doing? She said to her daughter who's 12 and that was from an age point of view and I just thought, well that's what I'd be doing at 12. That's what I was doing, my stepmother's clothes and stuff. So I thought well hang on, I'm having exactly the same desire to express myself in that way. So I just wanted to express myself in that way. And I was told like my society, you're not allowed to. And I just thought, well you know, some people are allowed to and I'm not, I've decided, I gave myself permission, I said that I'm allowed to and it's not hurting anyone else.

Speaker 2:          02:44:03       And I was stealing the makeup and after that I started buying the record cause the police got me, he got caught stealing makeup and I go back into the shopping Bexhill on and I say, I used to buy this lipstick. Thank you very much. I think I probably say, yeah, it's him again with a bloody lipstick. Um, so, uh, yeah, it's, it's, you just had this desire to express yourself in a way, just like some women do and some we've been done and somebody said, I don't even wear any makeup, not going to pay me. And I was not going to do it. And if I had, if I look very female, then I would, I would, might wear different things or express herself in a different way. But I'm, I look kind of more boyish, more male ish. So I, I have to, you know, I choose certain clothes at and look, um, and I, and I do it that way and a number, quite a lot of people are sort of going, okay, fairplay that seems okay and you're looking fairly well put together.

Speaker 2:          02:44:56       That's, that's what I get to. So when you finally came out, the relief though, did she could just be yourself? Yeah. Just, and you did, and you don't tend to look terrible when you first come and you go, well that doesn't work with that. Why was I wearing that? That's correct. But you've never had that teenage girl chance to be able to try things out and have your peer groups like you're not wearing that cause that's okay. So then I gradually led to, okay, how does make it work? Then how could that how it works? So you gradually get better at things. Don't buy that. That color doesn't work. Oh, it can wait. But if you, you know, so, but the relief is huge because you no longer got this hellish secret and then you can begin the dialogue. I hadn't, didn't really have a dialogue with anyone at that point, but on stage I could.

Speaker 2:          02:45:39       I have friends that are in the closet and they don't know what to do and they even comedian friends that they don't talk about it, they hide it and I'm like, God, if you just let it go, I mean people in this day and age, the people that will accept you, that's the people you want anyway. The people that don't accept you, you don't want them like that's their own problem. It's this live and let live thing. The people that don't want you to be who you actually are to fit their own narrative in their own head. Like those people are the crazy

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       ones. It's not you. Yeah, it's really obvious there are gay people. It's really obvious they were transgender people. It's really obvious they're not, no one's just making this stuff

Speaker 1:          02:46:18       back through history as well as forever. And also I think I try, I say quite often, you know it's a genetic thing cause I don't, I didn't feel like got out were, you know when I was 23 and a half and I said I think I've old become the old transgender now. Yeah, no it was. I was four or five when I first knew it and it has not moved those, those thoughts. That's interesting. So I think it is for most gay, lesbian people I've talked to, I just think it's locked in. It's built in. It's something you get given these cards as I say, and we're trying to be out front and be positive and the express ourselves, it only makes sense when you look at the other variabilities,

Speaker 5:          02:46:50       the, the other variables when it comes to people's personality, their body shape, their mentality, their drive, their ambition, all these different variables. It only makes sense that there's feminine and masculine variables and that these shifts back and forth with certain people and it's certain people just like there is somewhere in lake where you are, well you have boy mode, mode and grow mode and I, I would imagine that you talking about it so openly and then that you're, that you're just so free with it that there's probably people out there that are listening to this. They're like, God damn it. That's me, your host. I'm the young,

Speaker 1:          02:47:23       the youngest, uh, young people around the world. I have met people who are they talking about it in school? Actually, when I came back from South Africa, my co writer, Kelly Jones, his, he said, can you go in? And my daughter's in Klaus and we'd been talking about your runs in South Africa. So I went in and they could talk about racism because I was running a salute to the Mandela 27. Matthew doesn't suit his 27 years yet to spend in prison. So they could talk about racism, but they could also talk about being trans transgender or self identifying and LGBT stuff. Cause there was some kid in this in the class who was already identifying what did I that if I as a girl and so they were being positive and these kids were eight I think, you know, so it's, it's way different to our childhood, our childhood. It was just do not talk about duty and if you mentioned that you're going to get your head kicked in by your peer group. So, and I was all, that's why I never mentioned it at school especially, you know, I fancy girl so I could just go in that route. And uh, did you run into girls and had an issue with it? Um,

Speaker 1:          02:48:26       people that I know less of. But if you talk about relationships, it gets really tricky because yeah, it reflects upon people's relationships, uh, with yourself. So, um, but it's, it's cool. And I've never, I've never been great at relationships. That's always tricky. So, well, you know, if I got this career thing and I worked at how I could work that and I can just keep staying four steps ahead of the game and I'm playing in all these countries, the one doing the four languages that, doing that. So I've got all that. But then, then had you, you never really in one place to be able to continue a ratio and then there's that being transsexual and that goes on. So that all gets complicated. You can't be copied, get everything working. No. So, but I'm okay with that and it's all good. And, uh, and I enjoy things.

Speaker 1:          02:49:13       I, I'll stage, I try and make myself laugh. This isn't uncommon. This is my trick. I actually just try and live and I go, oh, that's funny. So going off of this, this weird trip, um, uh, I'm going to tell you this, but this is in later show in front of her, but I talk about Jrr Tolkien, I talk about the imagination. We have written all these stories and the animals haven't done that. All the wild animals don't seem to have written any stories. I haven't heard of any good ones, but we've written that Jrr Tolkien and I say Jrr Tolkien, ar, ar, ar talking was born, Jay

Speaker 7:          02:49:42       r, r r, r, r, r, r

Speaker 1:          02:49:44       are talking, you may not know this and people are gay. Is this true? And it is born in bloom. Bloemfontein South Africa, you know, so he's got that and then they moved to Birmingham in England and it's a different axis of the significant next morning that, and then beery booby comes, we will look, this is to walk a dog that was this kind of sound like this. And then I said when he's five, he tends to his mother because he realizes he's, he's called

Speaker 7:          02:50:06       Jay Rrr, rrr, rrr,

Speaker 1:          02:50:08       Tolkien, and he says, and his bird, it is South African, Birmingham Trang and it goes both. Both a we'll calls Volos. I do this strangulated accent that it's trying to fight between South African and Bourbon. And it's such a stupid line to go on, you know, there's no logic to where I'm going. And it's about as guy, what are you saying, Jay? Odd, odd, odd icon, icons, the standard and cause she's still in South Africa and he's, he says you. So I'm spending time going into the sidebar, which is making me laugh. And I think a lot of the audience are, what is he, what is he wittering of that? And you can't really even hear what I'm saying, but I just do this strangulated accident and in the end he has to talk, talking to Yorkshire accent too, to get his mother to understand if you could cut down the number of hours and his name a becomes Jrr Tolkien.

Speaker 1:          02:50:53       So that's, that's typical of my stand. That where I just go off on a tangent to make yourself laugh and yeah. And I think it's sort of funny, a little bit more funny for me. Well it's funny for you though, it's funny for people that are listening, we just, comedy is contagious. Yeah. And if I'm, you know, the personal state, it's having a good time, then the audience would probably have a better time. And this thing of it's not being locked down that it's living and breathing in front of them. They do love that. And uh, and, and you put more energy into the next bit when you go and then this and then that and the other thing. Yeah. So I do love standup cause it's, you know, you can just do it and do it and you know, there's no one, when I was a double act, I wasn't four person act.

Speaker 1:          02:51:32       And whenever you, if you're a double, even just a double act, if you go off on a tangent, then you have to look across to your partner, your partner's going, hey, where are you going? He might want to go with it. You might not want to go with it gets keep to the script, but on your own you could just go off. And Lenny Bruce, you know the, the, the gigs he did in front of the band. Do you know that thing in the film, that part of the film and he's trying to make the band laugh and this is the people, the raincoats in the front and the Strip is coming on. And because when we did the play, Lenny, we had a live actual jazz band on the stage, a real good jazz musician. So I was trying to make them laugh and just the way that landing yet I would try to crack them up cause I would go off script and, and uh, and I could do this and that was just beautiful.

Speaker 1:          02:52:13       And I, and they said, you're riffing, aren't you? You're just riffing like way roofing. And I thought, Whoa, this is weird. This is, it was really nice to cruise down his life and do stand up as close, closest as close to him as I could. Even the mainstream. I did the main more mainstream stuff. And then, then, you know, the really edgy stuff and the weird stuff on the where, where Jesus comes at the back and you've got it. Pat's cathedral, that whole sequence where he's got the call, the Po call, the pokes. Jesus is here and yeah, that was fun.

Speaker 1:          02:52:45       Yeah. I got very ill doing it. Oh well you started off dead naked and then you've got, you put your clothes on, then you're talking and you start going backwards. He starts off dead. Yeah. You start off dead by. So when he killed himself in the bathroom, and then as you start and you're talking to either God or, uh, I think I'm talking to a judge who was a bit like a god at the beginning of it and explaining things and as I'm putting my clothes on, so you start off naked, then you have simulated sex with my wife, but a quarter of the way through the film. Um, so that was interested in doing that and then you end up dying at the end of the film. So it just, it took a lot out of me. Three months of that. So emotionally, emotionally and physically and I've never been ill to out of a show, but it just took me down.

Speaker 1:          02:53:34       I just was not well enough. So you think it was just contemplating his existence, his life and what he went through? I think, I think it was, yeah. I think part of his journey and also it was physically very grueling. It is mentally and physically quite very and mentally really grueling and together that it made, I was knackered and I probably just wasn't drinking of water. I should have, you know, I tend to think, um, this is a, uh, me trait definitely that I will just carry on until I get ill. I wouldn't necessarily think, okay, you're going into a stress period now, so let's get some good water on. It's eat some healthy food and so that nothing comes in and takes you out. I just didn't think it was a bold, those are where I tend to boulders. We just bulldoze through three hours.

Speaker 1:          02:54:21       Three yeah, it's three o'clock o'clock there. Yeah. I was thinking I'd have no idea how long. The crazy, yeah. It's like a time warp in here. Well then you're, you're, you're, you're good at it. You're used to it. I, I once did a street show for about two hours without starting, which was quite a beautiful cars on the street. If you imagine that there's no nothing and the festivals, you know, they hadn't before. And there's this place called the mounds, so there's people milling around. So I was almost starting a show and I was just mucking about for two hours. I was just there kind of not starting, kind of starting kind of chat and kind of playing around. Beautiful. It's, I've done the most fun things on the street because no one's in charge of anything. There's just no rules. Yeah. I, I seen Dave Chappelle do that. Dave Chappelle did that in Montreal. We

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       were doing a sub club soda and then he came downstairs after we did a, I think he was like 18 or 19 and just took his hat off and started doing standup and had people put money in the hat I was doing stand up on the street that it was pretty wild. Pretty free. I see. You see in Washington Square Park? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, um, Charlie Burnett was famous for that. Charlie Burnett was a guy who was a, one of the original street standup comics in New York and he would do that and Washington square park and gather everyone round. There's video of it that people could watch online. He might, I think he went to, he might've come over to England at one point did he? I think he might have a very, he was brilliant, brilliant performer. Really good at grabbing people and grabbing their attention and Dave learned a lot from him.
