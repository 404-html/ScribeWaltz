Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. And it's been crazy, but it then amazing Raj happen where I'm at right now. Oh, let me tell you a boy joy everywhere I go. Well, did you, when did, when did the social media thing kicking my nephew, craig? Shout out to Craig Brown, let's go chat whenever you crack. Came about four years ago. Um, I had my first instagram account. I was like, it was just photos then. And I was like, you know what man, I'm gonna lose this weight. And uh, it sounds like a corny thing to do and was doing like a little blog, but I'm going to just do my own, you know, even for myself. And I put it up, I had nine followers champ and it built to like, you know, 2000. I was like, man, if I can ever get the 5,000 then you know, I'll, I'll be there and I'm, I never paid for the followers.

Speaker 1:          00:43          And they went to this whole thing where they dropped everybody with who would pay for the followers. I wanted to be in like 5,000. I was like, man, if I ever get the 10,000 and then they came out with the video and Craig came to town, I was like, Oh, Craig, I'm going work out every day and I want you to film it and we're gonna put it on instagram and see how it goes. And it just took off. But it's just hilarious how much is taken out to care when I tell people that you were going to be on man, I'm telling you like, not like anybody else that's ever been on. I've got a wave of people that got excited about it. I appreciate that because they don't have a publicist champ. Uh, I do everything. We do everything in house jam, which is just me and Craig, him and off my family.

Speaker 1:          01:20          We do everything and we don't have any, uh, marketing behind us. Nothing. We just try to hit grinding. And, uh, fortunately, uh, we've let the shot now for this wba every championship has been ordered as far as Brian and the team. They've been delaying. Um, I'm not sure if he's going to drop out and just give me the belt. I'm not sure what's happening because we've been waiting for them to pull the trigger. They said they were going to, you know, find, find the venue and everything is taught. We talked about Australia, they talked about China. Who's the promoter? Uh, well, you know, his, his, his management team and his lawyer, Leon Michael, Lisa handling most of it. But if they don't come with the deal champion, basically, I already feel like everybody's scared of me. So I didn't think he just gave me the belt because I just want to fight Klitschko to be honest with you, cause I want to prove to the world that he saw for the biscuit because he really is.

Speaker 1:          02:05          I thought his brother went on for 12 rounds. One off for 12 rounds. This happened in the first round. Joe and the first round. Yeah, in the first round, not only tore the Bicep, the tendon popped, they had to go through both sides. This was in the first year I took, I took like unreal punches to the head. I forgot how many number was, but I took unreal punches to the head. They left me for dad. I ain't even get paid for the fight champ. What happened there? How'd you knock your parents? Listen, I started, I started the promotional company called Golden Empire. It was basically backdoor to change to the empire. We fought. The company fell as though certain things that were a lot of to me, I don't know. They said I had a tab. I don't know. It was crazy, but the tide was never produced.

Speaker 1:          02:49          Um, the company that I started basically what's in my company anymore and I was surprised I was supposed to be giving shares. This company wound up going to try and trying to purchase EDC, EDC, electric, daisy carnival to my introduction. You've got crazy. Were public. The night before my fight, the stock was up. I had no shares. I said, I'm not signing nothing too. I know I'm guaranteed a purse. It was crazy chairman. This would link to my depression. It's why we're home after the fight and was like, Yo, what happened to you? I fought. I've taught my fourth vitaly critical for 12 rounds. I took ass. I ain't even get paid. That's crazy. And I was in court with them for eight months before I settle out on like pennies on the dollar because I had to take care of my family chat and this is what drove me to pure depression, but then I overcame that and I'm here with you.

Speaker 1:          03:34          How much did they fuck you out of a chair? Who knows? Who knows? I mean the fight. This is facts. This is facts jab like they say in New York, facts, you feel me? Listen, it was the highest grossing fight as far as TV coverage and history at either one or two in German history. Shannon breeds versus fatality clinical. He's a huge star in German and I will see you and I went over there now bought action and the people was like, Yo, listen, this guy can sell. We'd want to see this fight. The ratings were unreal. It was like the highest rating in history, champ. I ain't get $1. That's so cool. How can I, how can I not fall into depression, but how could I not come out of it? I been fighting since day one channel. I've been fighting a brief chat. Yeah.
