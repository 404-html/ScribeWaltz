Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches time I ever met. Alex said that weekend didn't, um, that's the only time you've ever heard that in Waco. Waco first. And then that I lost touch with him after that. He, he really couldn't, he liked me again actually after I wrote the minister go. It's like he didn't like me after I wrote my book them, which includes all this stuff about being sneaking into Bohemian Grove cause he thought I was too much of a debunker of Bohemian Grove. But then when I wrote the metastatic goats, he liked me again because he felt that I was like, oh, it's kind of like a bit of a, the minister. It goes, it's kind of like a conspiracy book in a way. Yeah. So, um, how much different is it than the, should we keep going with this Bohemian Grove? Yeah, yeah. I get it. There's more to say.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Uh, so Alex and Mike decided to go in via the undergrowth. Like I, I saw them. Um, so they went in through the bushes. They wouldn't see the bushes and there was a lot of poison oak. I wouldn't be at all. Scott. Just walked in. Yeah, man. Rick, the lawyer, this kind of preppy lawyer, um, artillery. The funniest thing I've, I've missed out of this story was it was the night before we were going to infiltrate, um, Alex and Mike decided to practice being preppy. And so they were walking down there, worked half a day or like the code or outside their Botero rooms at talking and a kind of a feminine way about microprocessors. Like, you know, I, I just nano technology is the future. I think Doug Previz die. Yeah. Oh, I do Johnny Reid. I tried to kill him. Stop. He jumped off a building and land in a dumpster.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Right? Oh my God. How bad was he? Broken. Fucked up. Fucked up. And he throw, throw punches into the [inaudible] was a trip. It was, and he got a check from the government and he gave me to like bartenders around the first. That's what people thought, but he lived like, he banged his head on the dumpster and it fucking over dog. He lived and he give his check from the government on the first of the bartender and he torment the bartender to that check was done and they throw him. I put it first and they will last a little about the 18th and 19th when I was a kid, I used to tour, met Johnny read. He'd gone through on the east coast, he'd lock the bathroom from the fuck. You say you liked the batteries from the outside of the east coast when you leave a bar at night, when they close up, right. They locked the bathroom and then they put like a a lock bolts or if you break in they can't. He would go in the bathroom. Johnny read like 11 o'clock in the morning, the P and we locked them in there. We leave them in there until like six o'clock at night. We come back to have a drink. We'd opened the bathroom and he'd come out like nothing. I swear to God like nothing happened. He was hilarious. I mean one day I put my Dick on a chair next to him.

Speaker 1:          02:46          He was sending out of Boston, my friends, like, which it, see what happens and he's like, wow. And he just got up Johnny relived like maybe 12 years ago. We used to give him bumps a coke and get them riled up at the, and they just leave. Fuck you motherfuckers. I'll fight all of this that he just fucking leave. Oh, Irish Jew a Jew. You ever have a girl you dated to kill herself? No, they should've put that fucking helmet. Grad Committee. Your fucking Dick. He said, kill yourself the first time. And when you get to your destination,

Speaker 2:          03:25          well for police it's even worse because we're perpetuating that situation. So work, we're the ones doing that cycle. So when we see a 61 time I was a shift commander in the eastern district and I'm telling my guys, stop pulling over old white ladies. Stop pulling over that young cute girl. Stop. We focus on who committed the crimes and who commit the crimes in Baltimore, 16 to 24 year old black males. That's who's committing the crimes. So focus on them. That makes sense until you complete the cycle and realize that you started doing that because of institutionalized racism in your organization. And so when you are jacking up those guys on the corner and you do find that dime bag, so you sent him to jail. Now he can't go to work the next day. So he loses his job and then he can't make it to court.

Speaker 2:          04:11          So he gets his license suspended and then he's driving and then you are focusing on those 16 to 24 black males. So now you're more likely to pull them over. Now you pull him over. Now he has a suspended license. Now he gets his license is revoked and now he can't get to the job legally and you just, and now, now he's dealt. It's left with selling drugs on the corner. So you were were creating it. We have to step back and realize what the facts are and what we're doing. And the number one problem is the drug war. And then we have money in politics. These are our two big issues that we have to solve before we get anywhere. Well, what does the money in politics, how's that player? So I don't think we can change anything until we stopped having politicians that are serving their donors versus serving the people.

Speaker 2:          04:56          So somebody that's talking like me is never going to run a police agency as long as all their corporate donors are saying, no, no, no. You keep those animals and the cages because that's what they do. I mean, that's a good joke in Baltimore that police are actually the zookeepers. She keeps everything in it. Don't let it hit the county. So, so that's, that's our role. That's what we're doing. So your mayors and your politicians are going to continue to encourage that. They're not going to take a risk and say, all right, how do we lower juvenile possession of marijuana? You know that I know you do. You know, you legalize it. Yeah. And you control it. And rates actually go down. Whether we're overseas or were in Colorado, your possession rates for marijuana will go down among juveniles. But we don't do that. We keep looking at everything like we're a hammer searching for now and we keep looking for what we're going to hit to stop it. Instead of standing back and using science and figuring out what are we actually going to do to fix this problem, what we'll actually have results.

Speaker 1:          05:50          There are, there are behaviors. This book, the murderer is so fucking incredible. This guy, Richard Walter. There are behaviors that people like certain guys will rape and kill a woman, but when they're raping her, if she dies in the process, they'll stop immediately because they don't want the cops that think they're freaks. All kinds of weird shit. Like, well, that was the thing about this green river guys and he didn't want them to know that he fucked them after they were. That's right. He didn't want to admit it because he had an ego and ego and the guy he, the way he got them to do it, he was looking at it. You wouldn't be the first guy. A lot of guys who've done that's right. Yeah. He's like, oh, okay. Yeah. He goes, Hey, I actually, I did do that. I didn't do that. I do like they used to, they got a guy, I'm a high level of terrorists who, um, had never seen porn and they started showing him porn.

Speaker 1:          06:33          Oh. And I said, and he, it was like the carrot and the stick and he was like, Hey, do you want to see more of this? Will show you more at the tellers scene. And he started talking just to see it. No, he was a, he became up in a very strict Islamic society. So they showed them some dick slot as life shit. What do you want to know? These really hot girls so much. Excited to tell you something, man. Bella, Donna and Carol. We'll get you talking if you have a, and we'll get you throwing up, but she puts up baseball bat up around us and they say, hey, go to Fossa.
