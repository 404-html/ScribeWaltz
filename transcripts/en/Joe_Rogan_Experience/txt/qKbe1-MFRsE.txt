Speaker 1:          00:00:06       The Joe Rogan experience

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       Joe Rogan podcast by nine,

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       ladies and gentlemen, the drunken himself, Danieli Bolelli my friend. How are you? Pleasure and honor to be. Or again, always a pleasure and honor to have you here, brother. House going. If you hear anything in the background, some giggling. Danielle, these beautiful little daughter is here to babysit and plans didn't work out so we'll, we'll make it happen. But I'll feel weird about swearing. Well, you should see what comes out of her mind with on a regular basis. So yeah, my daughter gives me a hard time or my wife rather gives me a hard time for swearing in front of our daughters. It's like there's like some period where your is a certain point in time. We not allowed to swear. When they hit like 18, you can say whatever the fuck you want anything before. Then people get a little squirrely. Of course

Speaker 3:          00:00:57       it's hilarious because you know you can't help it. You know you're going to listen to some music. You're gonna not even crazy stuff, but like, Oh yeah, she like Katy Perry at some point and so I'm like, okay, whatever. Are you listening to your song and then she was a steal a couple of years ago. She was tiny. She goes into school and she started singing to her teacher and their teacher's like, oh, cute song. You have such a beautiful voice, and she started going like upms like a beach. I should know.

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       Please do you know the pc police is trying to take the word bitch out of our vernacular, which is the latest one. Align the new retard W. I won't let go. Retard. I don't care what you say. It's not a medical term. It's, it's no, it's to retard is to slow down, is to be behind the curve. To be retarded is to be slow. It has nothing to do with down syndrome or any diseases I may have to abandon eventually, but for right now, fucking staying strong, staying strong with retard and I'm staying strong with pitch. What's bad with bitch? Exactly. Well, it's a derogatory term for females. It's part of the Patriarchy to engender stand. You know, you'd done understand because you're a white male. You need to check your privilege. Mr Kelly, have you not checked your privilege? Yeah, I saw your tweet about checking your pedigree, realized I was thinking about checking my privilege yesterday.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       I didn't though. I thought about it. I thought about the fact that he wouldn't be. Even though it's a way that people can silence you. I mean that's essentially what it is. I mean the idea behind it has some merit. You know, the idea that there are people that have privilege in life and they need to understand that. I think it's a valid term when you're talking about minorities and poor people and people on welfare and people in foreign countries that have no healthcare and they're poor, I believe support 100 percent that, but it gets used a crutch to silence people and it gets used as a crutch for people who lack the intellectual vigor to engage in an honest debate and discussion. They say, you need to check your privilege. I love watching videos of people that are just really not that bright, but they're like getting involved in those debates and they have that weapon.

Speaker 1:          00:03:16       Check your privilege. It's like it's like a fighter that doesn't really know how to box, but as an awesome overhand, right. That overhand rights in the other boxes like pitch, get out of here with that overhand right. I didn't see that shit coming a mile away. Check your privilege. So not that easy. You're fucking argument sucks. No, I mean I get it because there are the people who are, oh, you know, we live in a colorblind society. Everything. There is no more risk season. We can all be equal and if you are trying to argue anything but you are a reverse racist, then I can see how some of these guys that are addicts themselves because they are ignoring the fact that there's a whole history behind it and when they say we started the race evenly, it's like, well somebody has their shoots. Things tie together for 50 years, bullshit not.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       And so he's like, no, the reason the way you've been raised, that's bullshit. But at the same time when you turn 18 to everything is about what happened 200 years ago is like, come on man. It's a fine balance there. There's a website that a twitter handle that I don't, I don't follow them on twitter because I don't want them to know that I follow them, but what I did is I bookmark them and I go to her page all the time. That's. And her thing is about being child free, Hashtag child free and I mean this woman's entire fucking twitter feed is all about how happy she is that she doesn't have a child and it's one of those, you know, me thinks the does protest too much. You know, it's like when you go to it, it's like, oh my God, like is this, your whole existence is like being happy that you don't have a child.

Speaker 1:          00:04:51       Like this is so bizarre. It's a bizarre hang up, but that bizarreness is that, that's a characteristic of human beings. Like they can get caught up in a bunch of different weird ways of thinking and one of them can be just fucking meandering on and on constantly about racial issues. Oh yeah, of course. And it works. By the way. Have you seen Al Sharpton's girlfriend? Jesus? Louisa. Really? Oh my God. That good? Oh my God, she's a fucking 10, a young 10 with their arms around this crusty old dinosaur fucking suitcase. Pimp will have these sharp on the Dead Sea. It is Lee officially dead. I don't know. Fucking thousand. Seven hundred and 50. He's disgusting. He's just a creep. He's just a suitcase pimp, you know? It was just one of those guys. It's just a hustler. He figured out his way through that Tawana Brawley case where it was some false rape accusations.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       He was blaming all these white people. It's again, it's the same thing. Race, pimp. Look at her kapow. Oh, oh. And that's just one picture. By the way, this is a weird thing that happens with people's heads when they lose weight. You when people get really fat, their heads get big. That's how sharp sharp to now. He lost a lot of weight. He has stomach stapled and that's only one photo over. She's 35 years. Ah, well, good for. Yeah. What do they talk about? Crayons. Shit. She's not that young. Actually. Thirty five is pretty stylish. Beautiful. Somebody is not watching their little show. Somebody is sitting in Danielle Ebola, his lap, Kiehl's demons or no, she's. She's done. Didn't say hi to everybody. Okay. I'll hug you the whole time about that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       You can sit in my lap. Watch your show. Be the first show ever were a little kid is here during the podcast. Yeah, that should be. You're so cute. I'm going to have to let it slide. I'm going to have to just these ones to watch TV or anything. What time? Well, right now it is a 1:10. You can watch tv if you want. Do you want to? She's watching her show mode or less. That was when my daughter was three was one of the coolest moments ever. My daughter was three wounds. Skin. I took their scared. Skim Skim when? When one daughter was two and the other one was for. That's when I started skiing. Yeah. I just think it's good to just get kids doing shit as much as possible. I'd take them to dance class and gymnastics and I teach them martial arts, but I think it's good to just get them used to traveling and doing things, but when she was three we are putting all this stuff into her little bag and she's a little badge carriers how we travel and she likes to pull her own bag and she didn't have her helmet in the bag and she had everything zipped up and right when she finished up and I'll buy my honey didn't put your helmet and she goes, shit, something so adorable.

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       I bought a three year old gone and my wife and I would just like, oh no, she didn't do it right. So what's that? Bid Sees what I. The deal that I struck with her was, I don't care if you do it around me. I get it. That light to wait too. But you do not. There are places. Where do you do at school? Around other kids. He, Frodo, fewer teachers? No, I told him so one day we were driving home from school and she let slip up, something like that. I, she does shit and I'm like, is she looked at me? He's like, don't worry, I don't say it. That's cool. I just say here and I'm like, okay, that's fair. And so she sees that she had to go ahead and so she liked. She just kind of got.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       Yeah. It's um, it's tricky because it's a totally acceptable for adults in normal rational, but you know, it's not in certain circles. It's that whole thing. The whole censorship in language thing is such a bizarre aspect of being a human being. These forbidden words that we use that essentially are interchangeable with words that are okay. Like what drives me crazy is when someone goes fricken fricken guy with his fricking thing, like I hated nuts. Oh whoa. What kind of bizarre corporate world we live with Applebee's existence. Are we floating through here fricken night? That I should be nuts. It's weird. It's weird and it's why. I mean, I don't Overdo, wait, the fight can check it out, but I don't try to censor myself around there in anything you do in anything that I do is kind of like dc is how I am, right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       This is. I'm now going to out of my way to make it extra weird. But I'm like, oh I am is I am. And I like talking to kids. Not exactly like they are adults because I'll do today aren't right. But at the same time, not treating them like they are fucking stupid. Where are you just studied them like a Google God, that kind of stuff all day long. It's like, come on man, it kids that are way smarter than. You'll give them Canadian too. And if you, if you work with them like that from the get go, they will surprise you with time and time again with the stuff that they can say back to you. Oh, without a doubt. I remember when I was a little kid, people I still to this day remember people treated me like I was more on and talking to me stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       I'm gonna. Remember thinking why? When I have kids, I'm never talking to them like that, so I talked to my kids like they're my friends, like I'm very sweet to them and very nice and very understanding if they're crying about something that doesn't make any sense, but I, when I explain something to them, I explained it to them like an adult and I know their heads only that big, so it can't possibly be smartest man. Smart man. They are my six year old can read now. Wow. Which is interesting because I had a shirt on the other day that said nine fucking oranges because, uh, I had this a bit in my act is based on a true story where, um, I had my, a power cut off in my house because I didn't pay my bill. In fact, when I was young I was very responsible.

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       I wasn't even broke. I just didn't pay my bill. And so the guy came by and turn the power on. It seemed like a nice guy. And after we turned the power on and go, hey man, I had an orange tree in this yard of this House I was renting. And I go, if you want to grab one of those oranges, man, I go, they're really delicious. And he goes, oh, okay, thanks. So the guy goes out there and he takes nine fucking orange and I swear to God, man, I was 20, I want to say maybe 26, 27 time. That was 20 years ago and to this day there's still times I'm in my car and I'll be driving around. I'll just go nine fucking orange and talked about it on stage. And it's really true. It is a true story. And so this dude gave me this tee shirt at one of my shows that just said nine fucking orange.

Speaker 1:          00:11:46       Orange is on it. I wish I had it on right now. That's great. But I, I worked for one of the shows, one podcast I worked for. But anyway, uh, I, I brought it home and my daughter goes, I know what that says. That's a bad word. Bad word. That's a bad word. A busted. Why didn't even know she knew that word first of all. I mean she's the are a couple of once in a tiny moment. My wife runs a tight ship. Really? I try to. I try to keep it, keep it very pg. You can try only once, but that our thighs. I remember when she was tore something where I drop something and for the rest of the day she went on repeating doc doc doc and I'm like, I'm glad you think it's a doc. What I say, yes, that's what I said.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       What I ended up and it's like there's no way. No Way. It's impossible. Yeah, there it is. Brian Cowen, Bryan countered I nine fucking orange. I see the fucking is covered by my name, but it's nice when I said that wasn't Brian Count when I got back from a hunting. So that one was before hunting or 58 after. Yeah, yeah, no, we did two, two podcasts in row. One before and one after hunting. We went up to this island, Prince of Wales in the middle of Alaska. Terrible trip. The well, it was beautiful though. It was beautiful. It was a great trip. It was just unsuccessful hunting trip, but there was. What was great about it was when I came back home, I really appreciated civilization. Oh yeah. I really. We slept in a tent. It was wet. Everything was wet. Sleeping bag was wet. It was just.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       It was miserable. It's like 40 degrees. Just poured every day. It was so much humidity that like inside the tent, like I would turn. I had this little miner's light. Anything like a forehead light. I turned it on and you'd see the entire tent was filled with little floating beads of water. It was just that much humidity in there. When did you guys go with the first week of October? It was too late. Yeah, it's late. Yeah. It was too late for the area that we were hunting in because the deer had already moved down. We were at the top where the water is, where the lakes are, and the deer had already moved down. There's water up there. Lakes that have no fish, giant lakes that are lakes that are only there because of rainwater. Wow. Giant lakes of rainwater and he drank it because there is no beavers.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       He just dip your thing right in the water. We drink right out of the lake. That's beautiful in itself is beautiful. It is. It's amazing in that sense. Like I was prepared for diarrhea everyday. I bet that it never came. They were saying if you get Giardia, like you wouldn't get Giardia. Giardia comes from animal poop and the only way you would get that as if there was a beaver up there, but um, you could like run into a bear and bear could have pooped in there because that's a bear poop in your mouth. Yeah, that would be. Yeah, I can see how it sinks would be more fun. Yeah. But it's such an enormous lake. The odds of you getting any substantial amounts. I mean, the reality is unfortunately we're constantly getting fecal matter and stuff in your body and like, even if you're a person who only eats plants, they say that one of the best ways that vegans get vitamin B 12 is from bugs that they inadvertently eat that are on their food.

Speaker 1:          00:14:59       Just kind of hilarious that the other day I handed out this glass of wine to this lovely lady and she grabbed it and she goes about this secret and she looked and she's like, oh, there's a bag inside, and she handed it back to him and I think I was already buzzed. Then after that I look at it and was like, just shrug my shoulder. I'm down the bug into wine, and it was tasty. Nice. Bugs don't taste nearly as bad as people think. They do take it from me. From my days at fear factor I have. I've eaten quite a few bugs. It's more in your head? Yeah, there's anything. I mean I wouldn't go for like nasty. We are looking cockroach from outer space kind of thing, but you know, little box or whatever. No big deal. I had a Madagascar hissing. Cockroaches like the site, remember pagers.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       That's a pager. That's Matt, giant Madagascar, hissing, cockroach. I think they were referred to. That's pretty good. Australian, they're not bad man. Now was. I guess you know what it is, is not. The thing itself is what he does. Crawled through. It's all in your head. Yeah. It really is all in your head with was crawl through. Yeah. Disgusting. But the ones that we got, they were raised on a farm, you know, they were raised for movies and stuff like that for show business. It's really in decades, ultra sun, let's say. Isn't that amazing that there's so many cockroaches, there's so much of a need for cockroaches that there is someone who raises them for television that I've never heard before. Crazy. That's that seed that is take the ride and they would have millions of them. Man. These guys that have cockroaches. But I was around them so often it just became nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       Right. And I've watched people eat them and you know, I forget what it was. Oh, it was um, one of the girls from a soap opera. It was like a celebrity fear factor and I made her a deal that if she ate, she ate one of the cockroaches to move on, that I would eat a cockroach and she wouldn't even eat a cockroach. She ate a worm instead. Like I would rather eat a roach than a worm. But even from my book, see a boardroom I think is filled with dirt. Yeah, probably. I mean the dirt. But then again it could approach is not exactly a rap being himself day and night and taking showers is. I'm telling you, eating, it was like, it was very, like no taste at all. Very mild. Just exploded in my mouth and I crunched it. But it was a very mild.

Speaker 1:          00:17:16       Like if I had to, if I was starving, I would eat a bowl of those things. No problem. If they're starving, I think that are too many things. That one doesn't say. It makes you a gag a little just because it just feels gross in your mouth. Reality of like the actual flavor of it. It's not that bad. Not too bad. Nice. It's not. No worries. Yeah. People are saying that in other countries that bugs are becoming like a viable form of protein. Oh yeah. They say it's really clean. Protein is less fattening than most other types of proteins. So

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       yeah, if you can get over the disease grows supposed to be actually good for you. Yeah, probably not. Just less fat. I mean, how much fat is in a bug? Yeah, I would imagine next to nothing super lean, right? Yep, Yep. Yep. So they even have like cricket, like snacks that you can buy. I'd like hiking places. The SELAC please. Cricket bars. I've done that before. There wasn't a sound coming out of her ears. Ear Buds. I was wondering what that was. I thought maybe someone was outside cranking music of these things fell off and I need to just. Okay. You come to listen to the other one. I'll just. A lot of days went up. She's so adorable. It's all right, man. Yeah. I had that before with a friend of mine was from Wahaca, Mexico and so one of their traditional thing, they will have this entire plates field with crickets and you know, he didn't grow up where you grew up out here.

Speaker 3:          00:18:43       Right. His parents are all into that stuff. So one day he's like, I have to try after try he order a seat. That is what huck and restaurant. And he just looked at it and I could see he's about to throw up like any cycled that. Right. He's just like, come on, it's not that bad and I have to say them, you can eat them, but I can think of about 10,000, 572 things that are better than that are not the tastiest in the world and you, they look at you, they are, they are not that tidy so they have their eyes so that you can clearly see them. I'm crunching on some creek. A tie right now is it? But why is that? Why is that gross? But like a lobster is okay. No, I mean there are some stuff that I agree with you some seeing sir.

Speaker 3:          00:19:25       It's thought that social conditioning season you just broke up with the idea that that's normal and that it's normal, but otherwise it's not. It's just as we are, does a bunch of other stuff. Yeah, because I mean essentially like crabs and lobsters and crustaceans, they're really like bugs are bugs that just live in the ocean or water bugs and lobster or one of the few things that I can't quite. I mean the whole thing of boiling them alive. That freaks me out really. I mean, other stuff, he's like, I have no problem. You know, you second the hunting thing, you know, you go out, you hand and anamolies footy as a good life and you killed them. You eat them. Totally make perfect sense to me. Boiling alive. Something actually involving torture to make sure that you get to eat it. I feel like I can't eat something else.

Speaker 3:          00:20:09       You know? I can eat and again, it doesn't have to be a vet I can eat. I have no problem with the whole eating meat thing or writing or any of that. Just the pain of pirates. She's like, come on man. Well, if it makes you feel better, they say that lobsters lack the nerve endings to feel pain. Really? Yeah. It's. Will they also regenerate limbs and stuff? A lobster loses a leg. It just grows rack in that case. But you're on the lobster. Yes. If you really wanted it humanely, eat lobster, you just hack their arms off and they just keep letting them grow their arms back clause. You could do that. It would work. I don't know how long it would take to regenerate a claw, but they, they regenerate

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       the same way like crocodiles. Do they regenerate as well? Some lizards do. I remember when I was a kid, I went to, my maternal grandfather was in by the seaside and you know, I would hardly ever see him. So it was kind of a new thing and he was already weird enough. And when they um, I'm thirsty, I wake up in the middle of the night, I go to the fridge, I opened the fridge and he's fucking giant lobster, jump out of the features, start running away because I was like, what the hell out. The weird thing about lobsters is they, they live in the ocean, but you can ship them in a box and they don't even have to be in water and they get to you, like from Maine and they're all live everyday in Vegas. They have lobster shipped in from Maine to the restaurants. Just like how the hell, like how the, what are these things like they don't even have to breathe. I know like how many days can they go without breathing? I have no idea, but it's freaky is definitely fakey. Yeah, freak as it comes.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       She needs some sort of a television show for this to work television show right there. She's not watching. Watching. It's more interesting to interrupt. We should have worked this out, man. I would've brought my kids over. Then you could have a little party and we just heard yelling and fucking play would have been wild and crazy over there. Yeah. I don't know what it, what it feels, but the one thing I do know is when you throw a lobster in the water and the water boils, they tried to get out. Yeah. So I'm not buying it. Yeah. I don't buy it either. It sounded a little weird to me. The convenient thing that people say, it's like, no, they don't feel anything. They like it. Actually. It's like a sonar to them. You know? It's like they have these pleasant sawn and all of a sudden the day die peacefully and go to lobster heaven and all is good to hear music and they just expire.

Speaker 1:          00:22:36       They want to go to their dad. Relative lobster was been in your Paul to before and they are uniting lobster heaven and all is well and a well. One thing that is interesting about like prey animals like deer and antelope and stuff is that they believe now that like when an antelope gets captured but like a lion or something like that. Then when the lion bites down on it that it's brain floods with chemicals and an almost sort of gives up, like it kicks a little bit, but it just sort of gives up and it doesn't fight like ses if lack of a lion captured like a Predator, you know, some other Predator like a leopard or something like that. They would fight for their rights. They would go crazy and make screaming noises and everything. But antelopes just like, oh, this is just my place in the world to pray.

Speaker 1:          00:23:22       I got cold, so okay, I'll check it out next to life. We'll see soon. Come back as a draft or some shit. What's your take on that kind of stuff? Do you, do you actually send my believing reincarnation w what's your take? Um, I don't not believe in it because I think the idea of life itself is so bizarre. The idea that we have a soul, that we have consciousness that we can see through our, that we navigate with sound and feel and memory. I mean, it's, it's so, so, so bizarre that reincarnation is not outside of the question. I mean, I don't, I don't know if there is such a thing as a soul. I don't know what this life is. I don't know. Like there's this life. Is this a finite experience where you, you're born and then you die? Or are you drifting in and out of parallel experiences every time you go to sleep and wake up. I mean, are you on the same timeline constantly when you wake up and you have this memory of your existence in this life that you, uh, are you sure that that's exactly how everything goes? I mean, just because all the people in your life seemed to think that that's everything, how everything goes. How do you know that you didn't go to bed last night with a totally different existence and wake up with a memory of this life that you're living right now just completely embedded in your head. And we don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:24:42       That's negative. Fame. Moza, Schwan's when the butterfly, right to the whole, uh, uh, ways to sage, uh, Twan. So it was all like, uh, they asked him about these many say I had this dream that I was a butterfly, but now I'm puzzled because I don't remember anymore. I don't know if I'm really transformed. I was dreaming that I was about their flight or if I'm actually a butterfly and this is the butterflies dream, thinking that she's trans. So. And that's the paradox off. You'll never fucking know.

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       No, I had a really intense dream once that was so realistic that to this day it haunts me because I was some sort of an animal, like a wolf or something along those lines. And we were sneaking up on this deer and the deer herd, like a branch snap or a leaf move. And I could smell fear. And I remember smelling fear, like smelling the tingling in this animal's body as it was thinking about bolting as it was wondering whether or not it heard anything. And I also remember smelling water. I could smell the water that was dripping. And then I woke up. I remember thinking like, what the fuck is going on? Because I remember there was other similar animals near me, some wolf like animals near me. And we were like communicating without words in some sort of strange primitive way. It was a very short dream, but I woke up. But I remember thinking, wow, that was an intensely realistic experience because I didn't feel like while it was going on, I wasn't like, oh, I'm a person that thinks it's a wolf. You know? It was like I was in this. This animal's mind of course could easily be imagination. Sure.

Speaker 4:          00:26:19       But then again, it's some of those dreams. I know exactly what you mean, but some of the things that are weird, there's a staff that I know what I've experienced. And then sometimes there's something that clicks seen that he's like, this is not part of my life, this is what I'm feeling right now is way beyond the range of my experience. This is not part of the game. And that's what I find. I find it creepy, you know, I find it really interesting like you ever seen the legends of the fall, which I really liked the movie. I could only watch it with at one time and I could never watch it again because he freaked the hell out. There was one scene where, um, if you guys are gonna Watch legends of the fall and you plan to do it, skip the next main articles. I'm going to give spot from spoiler from 20 years ago.

Speaker 4:          00:27:06       Not exactly big spoiler, but there's that scene where, uh, Brett's but brother get killed in one word. One, he goes berserk and he kind of goes behind enemy lines and he, uh, end the next CEO, sees you seek coming back into camp and he's covered in blood. He has a German scalps all over him and he's walking through the camp and everybody's opening up to let him go through nobody's saying award. There's the sense of, and there's the sense about him that he's kind of larger than life. He has done this crazy thing of going single handedly again, killing probably 10, 15 guys, something insane, and yet there's this sense of extreme sadness. Like all that power, all that warrior ability doesn't give him what he truly needs, which he still got back his loved ones. You know that. So that combination of extreme larger than life power and torque tragedy that you can do, you know, that hold that power doesn't really help you.

Speaker 4:          00:28:02       When I saw that scene, he was so familiar in a way that it's not mine, you know, it's no out my life up until that point that been. He had no parallel whatsoever in my experience. And he wasn't like any other movie where I see something and he's like, oh cool. I can kind of relate to that on some degree. Any heat me like, oh my God, I know that feeling so damn well and that I think about it like where do I know that feeling, you know, 20 years ago or whenever I saw legends of the fall, um, and there's nothing in my life to mirror that. Not even a tiny bit.

Speaker 1:          00:28:34       The imagination is such a wonderful, incredible thing. It's just, it's so impossible to really understand the boundaries of the imagination and people can imagine memories. I mean, there's been moments where people have been talked into remembering things by like through experiments, like through with, with someone would counsel them and give them a memory of the past and then coach them through this memory and then time will go on and they'll think that that was a real memory. Oh yeah. And what does that mean? The imagination itself is such a bizarre aspect of being a human being. The ability to like this wolf thing that I had in my mind essentially that was my imagination. I mean, the only other option is what is it a suppressed memory from my genetics from a long time ago when I was some sort of an animal, but you know, I mean the idea of evolution is essentially that human beings in 2014 are the result of millions of years of change, of natural selection, of all these different slow processes that have led us to being this thing that we are today.

Speaker 1:          00:29:49       But this thing has a direct link to whatever the fuck survived from that gigantic asteroid that hit the Yucatan and was what? Some in one and a half miles deep, like slammed. The thing was like five, five miles deep into the earth within the first, second and a half. Killed everything. Everything larger than, you know me, I think Mckenna used the term a chicken. Everything larger than a chicken. So just like as a point of reference and just weird little mammals, rat things survived. So somehow or another from 65 million years ago, those weird little rat things that survived became CEO, right? Yeah, exactly. Hold the my mouse around us as inevitable. What is, you know. But, but there's no direct chain to any wolves. There's no direct chain to any mean. Even the lower hominids were even the ones that ate meat. They did. There weren't on all four.

Speaker 1:          00:30:49       They weren't. So there's no. I have no past with wolves. Nope. So if that's the case, like what is that thing? Is that just total imagination? Is it just the psychedelic chemicals that flood your brain during heavy rem sleep? Just creating a, a beautiful image for you to try to conceptualize and wrap your head around? Or are you drifting in and out of realities? Are you mean, are you a monkey one day, you know, and then you go to sleep, you wake up and you've done all, you have your life and everything is normal. But were, were you a monkey yesterday? Probably some would argue that a monkey right now, while everybody argues that, I mean it's obviously one of those stoner conversations that you have. Like how do you know anything about that? I don't know what you're saying. Yeah. But those, those conversations are so common.

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       Like, how do you know that, you know when you go to bed and you wake up and more than the youth, same person, but you don't know. And that's the weird thing about going to bed is that everyone wants to do it. Everyone wants to sleep and everyone's scared to die. Everyone wants to shut off temporarily, but no one wants to shut off permanently. Oh Yep. Is a very, very odd existence because you know, if there were any guarantees, if throughly people, that's why I don't really buy a lot of the religious people think they say I believe in an afterlife isn't that is like if you're really dgl, it'd be way more relaxed about a lot of things in life because you wouldn't have that fear of that is like, well, do I have to be afraid of. There's nothing to be afraid of it. It would be cool. And he's like, great, you know, I do my thing here. Whenever I check out, I check out and I go to this other cool place. Evidencing is great. There's no reason to fear the Fed, that people are obviously not thrilled with the notion of dine makes me think that they don't believe it half as, as they actually do it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Well, belief systems are very strange. It can, it can really seem in your mind to be absolutely real and you will explain these beliefs to someone else and they will tell you that you're an idiot. Like I was on a set once I was doing this thing and uh, I was talking to this girl and her sister, they seem totally normal. And then the girl, I don't remember what we were talking about, it had something to do with gay people. I don't remember what it was. It was something like about gay marriage or gay people. They were talking about how the woman was saying that it's a sin. It's. And I thought she was joking. I really thought she was joking because it was a set like intelligence such as like, well, it's a sin, it's a sin. And, and, and then I realized she was serious and I go, um, so you think that God created people that are gay and then he did it like as a goof, like a trick.

Speaker 1:          00:33:36       Like what is that? And she goes, no, no, no, you don't understand. She said that this the devil scales of covering your eyes. Wow. And I said, the devil scales are covering my eyes. I'll never forget that term. That's the devil scales. I didn't know the devil Ed scale. That's when it's starting to run. What? No, no, no. I mean, she was friendly. She was just, um, who knows, man, who knows? There was this girl and her sister and the girl, the one that I was originally talking to seem totally normal, but her sister was just out to Liz launch. Right. And that's the devil scales are covering your eyes. It was just about gay people. That's. No. Yeah, that's quite pretty key right there. You admitted. But it's like people pick and choose shit, man. I know this dude who is really religious, but he has religious tattoos. Like motherfucker, you gotta read the whole Bible are not supposed to text. I could have read all of it and that's supposed to tattoo yourself.

Speaker 4:          00:34:38       Funny. In fact to me is like when people say either they are pro or against anyone really John seely because it's like when somebody tells me they are Christiano or Muslim or Buddhist or whatever, that maybe he's not telling me anything really because as you say, people pick and choose what they want out of that. So one guy's way of being Christian. Subtly awesome. There are going to be super nice people and their belief system elps them being nicer people. Yeah. The next guy, the our way of being Christian because they pick and choose the crappiest part out of the Bible is scary as hell and their way of being. Christian is around 40 or life and also to me, the label itself. I'm not interested in an argument about whether one religion is good or bad because the reality is that every one of them you're going to find at least some good part in some. There's a lot more than in others, but you're gonna find at least a little bit. That's good in just about scene and usually I find also tons of crap I'm interested in which pirates will peak and allow those parts inform your behavior. How do, how do you behave based

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       on your beliefs? That's what the interest me. Yeah. It's like like the idea of drugs, like all drugs, not just drugs. The idea is like, you know, I'm, I'm a religious person or I'm a Christian. Well, Fred Phelps. Phelps was the Christian. Right. And then there's like rupert sheldrake is also a Christian. This very, very different ideologies at work here, but they're both calling themselves Christian and Fred Phelps is just as evil mean creepy old fuck. That eventually died. Is rotted in his own filth and fucking anger. Yup. That's exactly how it is. That's why to me, even the whole antireligious, the watson thing gets through romantic because it's like, oh, can stay on. Sorry. Terrible Muslims are all evil. It's like, do you really think every single one out of millions of people who belong to the sinks, they are all bad people, man. It's like there's, there's the nice lady will pick the parts that are all about being nice to your neighbor and charity or whatever and that's or way of being Christian or Muslim or Buddhist or whatever the hell it is and he's awesome and there's nothing wrong with deep and he's actually pleasant and I'm sure we'd actually helps our life.

Speaker 3:          00:36:45       Either beliefs, yes, those are scary and anybody going by those beliefs. Then you see it in action and is not helping an old lady cross the street is chopping people set off because they don't believe the same thing you do. That's where you get. That's the freaky part, but I don't even care what it's people and again, always Saturday about which one is the one who does all this shit. It's not even just 30 days alone because if you look a communist, dictatorship, Nazis, they've all done anything. The name of it, it's totalitarianism. You know? It's that idea of everybody needs to leave according to my way of life and anybody who doesn't need to be squashed. That's the scary thing that I got really self, which a label is attached to it regardless of which set of clothes. It's the site aware. He's the same shit.

Speaker 3:          00:37:30       Yeah. Ideologies or they're problematic because when you feel like you force yourself into like a framework, you force yourself into a pattern. Anything that's outside of that framework is like automatically not to be considered and when you have like rigid thinking anytime you ever really, except like rigid thinking like, Hey, you shouldn't rob people. Hey, you shouldn't go around stealing. You shouldn't around go around stabbing people. You shouldn't mean there's, there's rigid things that in a sense that like a pretty clear cut. It makes sense because they're causing harm and there's. But there's also, there's ideologies that are just, you get locked into them and you're forced to think that way because of it. Like people that will tell you that this religion is correct because this religion is the truth and now they'll, they'll force themselves to like be stuck in that little box. Right, and you don't want to admit that you ever fucked up and lived 20 years of your life believing in some nonsense so then you're stuck. You're stuck in this little box and that could be atheism just as much as it can be Christianity, because I've met a lot of atheists and I'm like, listen, you're

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       in a religion, you're just going to read the religion called atheism and they like want you to proclaim. You're an atheist. Like I know this dude that's an atheist and he gets upset if I say, I don't know. You know, I say that to me is the most honest thing you can say is on a about a lot about stuff of the universities. I don't know because that's the reality of it. He hasn't had any really extreme psychedelic experiences either. None. In fact, he's very smart guy, but his ideas are like only based on his own personal experiences and what he's learned and what he's red and he's a very smart person. He's very aware of religion, but he's like so adamant about proclaiming there is no god and I'm like, look dude, I have seen things on mushrooms that are way crazier than an old man with a book check in your name and the cloud and leading you to pearly gates and there's a bunch of people with wings. I've seen some shit that's way crazier than that so that I don't think that's real, but there's no evidence whatsoever in my, uh, in my estimation that that's, that exists. But the idea that there might be some universal consciousness that we want to describe as a god and it's just not this old man in the clouds wearing robes. It's just something maybe even beyond the realm of humanity beyond the realm of the possibility of us understanding. I don't see any evidence for that, but I'm not. I'm not throwing it out. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 4:          00:40:00       I mean, if somebody and get some crappy fairytale that subs really poorly at Eaton and his bad screenwriting, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what, okay, that's just bullshit and I can see it. But if you define God in some other way, how the hell do you know that, you know, once you're a drag, just the most scholarly type of fairytale, everything else is up for grabs because nobody really knows. I mean universities. That's why to me it's kind of hard to have the discussions about religions even like the books ever written about religion because usually people don't like organized religion is because they are big fans of um, you know, kind of a hardcore materialist worldview where it's all about what you can see and touch and nothing else exist. So then you write a book that pleases those guys and doesn't play the religious folks.

Speaker 4:          00:40:45       That's great. You still have an audience. But if you argue for something more sub though, if you argue for sensing that's basically not dogmatic, either religiously dogmatic or in a hardcore materialistic form, dogmatic, then you're shit out of luck in terms of fighting. And audience, because you are, there's no niche that you jumping to right away, right? It's not just one simple, you know, there's those guys that are going to be right behind you. You're asking people to be aware on a moment by moment basis so they'd urgent just seemingly, you know, binding to a dogma, spouting the ideology, spouting the disease, what we believe one, two, and three year asking people to leave life without relying on a damn recipe that you apply at every little thing you run into when instead you to use their notes to use their eyes. The situation right now I'm able to, uh, in this particular case, I'm going to do what he's saying.

Speaker 4:          00:41:39       In his other case, the same thing that work two minutes ago is not appropriate and it's not the right thing to do. It's kind of like in fighting, you know, it's like there's a rhythm to things. There's a timing to things. And going with that plan as a rigid plan, going in with a plan is great, but going with that are easy to plan. They are not going to change it regardless of what's in front of you is the recipe for death. You know, you're gonna. Ask her up. Same thing. Why would the life in general bna different region to the applying the scheme to everything that comes your way? I mean, to me real talent is, uh, is mainly mobile to judge things.

Speaker 1:          00:42:12       I can hear them. Fortunately the, her little ear buds are picking up on the, uh, the, the microphones. Okay, let's try it now. Are you sure you don't want to watch TV? That's ridiculous. My kids watch tv every chance they get because I don't want to watch tv so I can always go. Do you want to watch them to you? Like it's a book that up? Yeah. This is the greatest thing ever for travel, man, for travel. You put on one of those things behind the headset and people will go, oh, why do that? Why not have your kids like, have a conversation with? She's fucking for that session. Only last so long. Right? It's just like educational cartoons now. Cartoons like teach them how to spell and teach them and they can sing along with it and learn phrases and words. Do you have you ever heard of.

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       Well there's atheism obviously, but there's a thing called atheism plus. Have you heard of new towels? New Religion. It's A. It's atheism plus a set of moral guidelines. I call it de. This is what I call it because it's like it's all be a good person, but I just think that's De, you know, and maybe like when it comes to things like racism and these sort of discussions or homophobia or any, any sort of discussion about inequality or treating people in a very negative way because of something that they can't control their sexual orientation or the way the skin they have, what color they are, what part of the world they're from. I think anybody who's a good person sees that in 2014 recognizes. That's a fucked up way to think. So these people, this atheism plus thing, they have like atheism. So they're all saying there's no god, there's No God, there's No God, but we want a set of moral guidelines to live our lives by no sexual harassment and sexual harassment and feminist issues are big aspect of that. It's mostly a lot of like really weak men, placating to a lot of like angry women and they formed this group were they all sort of get together and they have conferences and they just die each other to death. They say Dah. It's all the same shit. It's like it's all shit that you should already know, like don't be racist, don't sexually

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       harass women. Absolutely don't rape. Of course, you know, don't murder, Duh. You know, like, okay, okay, well how many times can we talk about it? Right? I get a certain point. I've watched a bunch of their conferences online and it's hilarious because it's so fucking pedantic at the end of [inaudible] you get beaten to death by what they're saying. It's like you should already know this. Everyone should know this. This is, this is silly. And I think that depends on what audience you're speaking to because you know, for anybody was as same id, sane human being shrewd. I've learned these by the time and our five and it's like don and overweight that are we still talking about it? Then of course there are a bunch of people that are not exactly same id saying you won beings. So maybe for those guys he's a good message.

Speaker 3:          00:45:15       But I agree with you. It's like to me, my thing is like I use these diamond time again in podcasts and writing. I always write the whole idea that rules are for people who are too stupid to leave without the rules because you know if you are smart you don't need them. But it was because you know how to make the right call in every situation and you don't need anybody telling you, look, don't rape anybody. It's like, I don't need you to tell me. I got it. You know, when you're in the situation, I need the next thing. The next. No, it's not gonna apply. That's not that. There's gonna be the exception to that role either seeing, they're going to be exceptions, but steel. You're going to have the intelligence to be able to make the right call. He's Ui or somebody was coming to Mug me.

Speaker 3:          00:45:54       They made me punching your interface is a good idea. You are somebody who is disagreeing with me punching in the face. You're crazy. We a social pet, you know, you don't need a rule paddle knew when it's appropriate or not. You know, you, you are able to make the right call that Ben's. Yeah, and that's where he's freaking amazing that you can carry on a conversation with her squirming crawling on you. This is not working nearly as well as we were hoping it was going. So it's a whole thing. She was going to watch the television or watch their little video or being, you know, cheaply. Apologize. No worries man. I honestly thought that. Yeah. I also had higher hopes than, uh, than these. Then again, she's five painful. It's, yeah, they just, they are what they are five sometime, you know, she surprised me because she'll do things that I'm like, really?

Speaker 3:          00:46:45       How the hell it, like I had this conversation with 30 other day where she's telling me, um, I don't like it, that I'm so sensitive because every little thing, you know, I feel every scene too much when I'm happy, I'm really happy when I'm sad. I'm really sad and I'm like, you have five already were having this conversation and then she goes, even one step forward or she goes, but you know what? It's okay because at least when I'm happy I'm really super happy. So I'll take the pain of when I'm really sad thinking, Jesus, who are you again? Let's try this. So, you know, I get in those conversational when I'm like, wait, you are way bigger than five. I can take you to do this and that. And then I realized, no, she's a five-year-old curve that are limits to the game. But well there's this understanding that comes with being a human being and that's what she's got.

Speaker 3:          00:47:32       She's just, she's a human being with, you know, how am I, what is it 100 months on the planet or something like that, you know, there's lead me to not even imagine trying to figure the world out with 100 months of experience and I mean a year of school or whatever. She's I possible, but you do have that little human brain and then you're also juggling around this, this collection of words that you've acquired and so you're trying to express these ideas and thoughts and feelings. One of the themes that are coming out with the boat there from the get go is that she not exactly now because she's not picking up on the frustration of it all of the discussion, but normally she has a seen a level of empathy. Not just for a kid, but like even for adults. I see her. She's always, whenever she sees somebody was having a bad day, it was really sad.

Speaker 3:          00:48:23       She instantly goes to them. She's trying to, like, I've seen her at school where she'll go to a kid was like, hey, he's in bed. The kid that you don't like. It was always giving you a hard time and she's like, yeah, but I still feel bad to look at what a bad day these guys and she's going to like trying to call him for diamond to this scene. I'm like, Jesus, man, you got a really nice nicer to me. I thought maybe that's what it is. Maybe they. I definitely think kids recognize things that their parents do that they don't think of the right way to handle things. Come up with their own sort of work arounds. It's pretty laborious either in school where she was clearly quoting Bob Marley liquid. She was going through a phase where Bob Marley was called Marley. Yeah. She goes, I know she loved Bob Marley to death and she would, um, she went to this key to us crying because his mom had laughed and was like in preschool or something.

Speaker 3:          00:49:15       She was four and she started robbing the kids back as the cutesy. And she say, don't worry about thing. I every little thing is going to be all that. I really felt burt's that's a lariat. She'll ever own the. We are seeing some that one day she's like, she asked me shooting the car and she asked me for it immediately on time for Bob Marley and I'm like, okay, no problem. What Song do you want? Like two little birds. I'm like, no baby, it's three little birds. He's like, no. I'm like, what do you mean it's three? No one got shot. So now there's two little dirt and I'm like, she's, that's morbid that really are going to play today. But yeah, my daughter who's four, keeps asking me to take her hunting. Really? Yeah. And I don't know if she's serious or if she misses me when I go away and she wants to do like she's never heard a gunshot. You know, there's, I mean there's obviously no way she's going to be a pullback in Arrow that's strong enough to kill an animal. So it's like that's not gonna happen. No, of course. But step one would probably get used to hearing gunshots. I don't know. She's just so bored. That held me. What's mad?

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       Tiny

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       pinch because you are driving me crazy square. He's settle down. We can't put on a show for you or something like that. A television show for you to watch. Yeah, baby, actually, let's do this serious. Sit down and watch your show because unfortunately this is being seen by thousands and heard by hundreds of thousands. The failing, that's today's podcast about it at all. Like I said, it's, you know, that's one thing of becoming a father and being around kids. When I was really young, like when I was in my early twenties, I would never be able to deal with it. Like little kids. I'd be like, ah, the guy brought his little kid, but like when I'm on a plane and like little kids crying, it doesn't bother me at all. It used to drive me crazy, but when you have kids, it's one of those things where you kind of recognize.

Speaker 1:          00:51:25       One of the things that happened, the big shift that happened is I started thinking of everyone as being a baby at one point in time. Like one point in time, Kim Jong Il was a baby. I know, right? That's fucked up. You know, like Edm. He was a baby. All these weird people in the world, you know that fucking Pistorius guy that shot his girlfriend throughout bathroom door. That guy was a baby. Yep. Okay. You know all these creeps and fuck ups and assholes. Babies. Gloria allred was a baby. There was a cute little girl. Now she's fucking Robin. People using the law. Just straight up rob dudes out much do you think is how much do you believe in, um, whether it be dna or a soul or something like something that's purely uniquely about that person when they are born and that's part of our car or our culture.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       You're not a female's nurture versus culture debate. What? What's your take on what's more important in this? I don't know. Well, they have done studies where they've taken twins that were separated at birth that were adopted and they get them together after not seeing each other entire life and they find out they liked the same kind of music. Really? Yeah. They, they have very similar likes and dislikes. Their personalities are very similar. There's a strong argument for nature over nurture, but there's no denying that nurture plays a huge role as well. I don't think it's either or. I think we live in a soup of possibilities and I think that you can get super lucky with the amount of exposure that you have to positive and even to negative things like there's an expression hard times make good people, you know, and I do believe that in a certain sense that there's some experiences that children and adults even have that they get through and it makes them more empathetic. It makes them kinder, make some more understanding and it makes them stronger, like more, more character. Even though it's funny because you're right, I mean there's part of that that's totally true

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       and you do see that happen a lot and then you see somebody who through the exact same thing and it makes them 10 times more of an asshole. I got hurt so I'm going to hurt anybody else in the process and with them and he's like that. That's where you think like what is the make these one person make a right turn and going in their actual where they become a kinder and nicer because they felt what it is to get hurt and what is the other one may make the complete opposite turn and going in the direction of I got hurt so I don't care for anybody else. This feeding, everybody has to pay for defendant. I go hurt once. Yeah, it's weird, right? It's like there's that moment where you can really make a 90 degree turn one way or another. What is the make people make the choices they make?

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       It's a very good question and it could be a lot of it could be genetics. I mean their epigenetics, that the concept that people are passing down ideas through their DNA to their children is, is not without merit. The idea that your ideas that the lessons you've learned in your life are not just stored in your brain but are stored in every cell in your body and also stored in your genetic material that passes on to your woman who gives birth to the baby and the baby has the genetic material from both the mother and the father. I mean all of that is is real stuff, man. All absolute real possibilities and it's really incredibly fascinating. The idea that we are this soup of possibilities. We do exist in this very strange world of so many different things going on at the same time

Speaker 4:          00:55:00       and there is something to. Yeah, you're right, because that's the experience part of it all where you got some kind of traumatic experience that really changes your, your makeup the way you are as a, as a person, as a human being and like. And at that point to kind. I mean I've seen even on myself not I'm dealing with right now. I see how my brain has changed over the last 30, 40 years in some ways, you know, go the way. In some ways really not in a good way. What way is in a bad way. I think I do have. I didn't think so, but now I'm coming to the realization that I do have some serious ptsd, you know, we're seeing, you know, my wife died in my arms, wasn't quite as a, Oh, I can deal with dates. Sure. Rationally understand us.

Speaker 4:          00:55:42       She tap ins and nobody's seen goes. But it did affect me to a different level. So I know I'd have to give you an example. I'll see that because of the way it started with there. He's like, when she got sick in the first scene, that was, it was like a tiny little thing. It's like, oh, my shoulder hurts. He's like a big deal, right? It's like, well, you went to the gym and you lift it too much. Whatever. Something seeing that transformed me and I met throw for weeks to, Oh man, I can't move my arm anymore. Oh, I can barely walk that. All of that in such a short period of time. Now, every time there's something wrong with my body, I don't just think like, oh, look at that weird little scene to them that I'm having my mind immediately erased the whole sequence and I'm like, I'm going to die tomorrow.

Speaker 4:          00:56:22       Some horrible, terrible disease. Anything. I know better. Reich noted that stupid. And I know that that's a fantasy. That's like puddle Jack Things, things that are definitely not lpn and if anything they are damaging and I still can't help it. They're still part of my brain that even the conscious of the. I know it's stupid. I still go there every single time. There's something wrong with my body. And so he's like, man, what do I need to do to change that? You know, because he's almost like Pavlov's dogs, right? Is Conditional response is immediately the second something goes, they're piled high, go with it. And uh, and you know, there are moments where I have control over it and I can kind of come to this place. That's because I've seen horrible things can happen at any moment. I actually try and sign and date and I'm like, look, you have no control over anything, so let's have fun right here, right now because what the hell knows what happened tomorrow? That's the empowering part of it and I love it when I get that and I don't love so much. And the other one, which is that terror of, Oh shit, something's gonna happen. Which you know, inevitably something's going to happen at some point, right? I mean, everybody dies, everybody gets sick. That's just the nature of the business. But having that in the back of your mind as a some time paralyzing thought, that's a whole different game.

Speaker 1:          00:57:37       That's part of the problem with being a human being, isn't it? You're the awareness, the awareness of your, the finite nature of your existence and the fact that it's coming, whether it's tomorrow or 100 years from now, it's coming. You know, if you told someone that they're going to die in a thousand years, I still freak out. Of course, every year passes 999

Speaker 4:          00:57:59       pithily and I mean that's just the noise, but there's a somewhat removed, right? There's that intellectual, existential anxiety and then there's existential anxiety or for sort of like people who have seen the weather because of war or sickness or whatever. People close to them die in horrible ways. It's not just an intellectual. Some point in the future or something bad is going happen is it's in the past, something bad is gonna happen in any second now can app and that's not a fun way.

Speaker 1:          00:58:27       No, it's not the best way. It's not. It's not good in any sense of the word. Living in the moment and being happy in the moment is very. It's a. it's a very difficult thing to do. It requires. It requires discipline and it also requires that you develop like a pattern of thinking. Yep, and you didn't get. That's one of the things we were talking about with the young people, like they automatically start blaming the world and hating on people for whatever has happened wrong to them to make people feel the way. I feel that there's patterns of thinking that you can fall into like almost automatically and once you have that pattern, it's a cut groove and that groove is very easy to slip into. It's very comfortable. It's very simple. One of the things that psychedelics do is pull you out of that groove.

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       Exactly. They, they lift you above the motherboard and you get to see what the groove is. Oh, this is just a pattern that I've created and it doesn't. Not only is not empowering, it doesn't even make sense. I'm going to live my life a fucking disaster. I'm going to 60 more years of this. Then my heart's going to stop beating and I'm going to die an asshole that's very easy to fall into. It's very easy. It can happen to all of us if I go. Oh, sorry, go ahead. I was just going to say it's very hard to reset and even when you do reset, it's hard to continue that new pattern. It's like it requires great discipline and sometimes you've got to write things down. Writing things down is big right now. Writing things down, reading things, positive affirmations. Nobody likes the idea that you go over someone's house and they have fucking all these things written on the walls, like today's a new day today. We're going to go forth with strength and dignity, but doing stuff like that actually can benefit you. It can, it can. Writing things on walls and you know, having positive affirmations can help you.

Speaker 4:          01:00:18       Yeah, because I mean some stuff, just because you know, it doesn't mean that you don't need to hear it again and again, realize it because you know, most people know if you have read the books, if you have been alive long enough, you probably know what's there is to know you've already before. The difference is transforming deaf from intellectual knowledge into actual. It's part of your being part of something that affects how you behave. Both the old buddy and I'm amber Lyon on giving me the lecture about psychedelics moved three times now regarding the, this is what you need to now.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       It's a fascinating case, boys. She has. I've never met anybody that I gave the suggestions to like I gave to her where they just fucking ran with it. Like she did that she had changed her life. Henneberry's it three, she's a trip.

Speaker 4:          01:01:04       I didn't meet her before, so I don't know what the before looked like. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:07       before she was a very rational, serious journalist who was very concerned about the future of humanity and our culture and in journalism because she had seen the ugly side of the beast where she had reported on some horrific events in Bahrain and when she got back and try to put together the CNN piece, they instead put out this fluff piece, like almost like a tourism propaganda video for Bahrain, Bahrain, depending on how you set. Um, but then when I talked to her about Iowasca, which by the way, I've never even done.

Speaker 4:          01:01:42       I totally go do Iowaska. That was the funniest thing of that started at time. Berkeley House. He's like John Globe about the down it. And they say, you know, that Joe never did right? She's like, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:53       but I've done dmt a dozen times, at least. Probably nine, 10 or 12, something like that. But this the same thing. I mean, it's, it isn't, but it is. I mean, it's the same psychoactive substance. In fact, DMT, the small global forum is a stronger version of a Iowasca, but I asked. It tends to be a long spiritual trip, which I thought would really benefit her. You know, that she was struggling it. Right. And it sure did. I mean, again, I, I haven't seen them before. By the after is insane. I mean seriously one of those people that she glows every time I out with her, I feel happier. She's, she's a drug. You know what I mean? Is like in the same room, improve the level of fat is I'm amazed by her every time. I'm just like, are you for real? I'm like, I have never.

Speaker 1:          01:02:40       I can think of too many people that I've met that are that happy while she's doing psychedelics, every couple of months I was fucking hit it so hard from the moment I met her, like I guess it was like two plus years ago, more than two years ago because we didn't have the studio. So from that moment on, when she went to the job, she went to the jungle like a fucking month after I brought her up, maybe even less went. And even though they told her I didn't, had never done I was, she's still fucking, um, I think I knew that I told her to do it and I knew that it was the thing that she needed. Some people really need that they need to go to a place and they need to experience this thing in this very alien form. And it's so transformative because of the fact that you're in that place, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:03:30       I mean, I'm sure I could probably benefit from it, but my, what I like to do, I mean, my thing, I have a sensory deprivation tank in my basement, so I'm, I'm, I'm sort of experiencing is as removed as the jungle might be. I'm removing myself from reality itself on this daily basis. Not to say that I wouldn't still benefit from it, but I wouldn't subscribe what I do. Right. You know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't prescribe rather. I wouldn't say what you need to do is get a tank filled up with water and he'd trip your fucking balls out and climbing that thing. Like, I'm not doing that right now. I have friends that come over. They don't want to do the tank. Like I'm going to get in there. Why? What's so scary about it? I mean, reality is that fucking thing. Oh, because the big fucking meat locker of reality and I need to do to that have done it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:16       I mean, I've always liked. I always felt great or no. Yeah. Maybe that's my mistake. Have you been sober? Yeah, I remember the first time. It was good to do it sober, you know, amateur, right? Gotcha. Sure. Float tank, uh, with an asterisk. The asterisk is very important because whatever the asked Rick can do the astro can do in regular life. It's multiplied 10 fold inside of there because especially edibles, edible marijuana becomes a full blown psychedelic experiments and the that he bolts for somebody who is like 11 hydroxy metabolite. That's what it is. Maybe that's the [inaudible] I've tried. Every time I've tried edibles is either too little where I don't feel it or I feel like somebody grabbing the biggest basketball back in, but your way first and just slagged me off. Not Pleasurable. Just like, oh my God, where am I? What the hell? Those are my favorite trips really does. We'll do. I don't think them whether it happened when they were over, I learned the most from them. Like I like being scared that because I know

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       I'm going to be okay, but I don't know. I'm going to be okay. Why it's happening. I think I got when I was maybe 15 or 16, something like that. I did this. I remember making these tea with ashish and the. We got a little carried away because they were supposed to be a bunch of people doing that and it turned out to be only two or five years. So the doors that were supposed to be for like, I think he was like half a gram per person and the study was two and a half a gram per person. That's a lot. So by the time we'd down it's, you know, an hour goes by with teddy bowls is also messy because you don't feel it right away. So an hour goes by and you're like, Eh, nothing happening. Two hours goes by. I'm like, really?

Speaker 3:          01:05:52       Nothing steal. What a waste. We throw that stuff away. I go to sleep, I wake up two hours later and I'm just like, am I? Where am I? And I pass out and I opened up my eyes again and like, where am I? And I, and the next six hours go like these where I basically lose consciousness 70, 30 seconds and I wake up, where am I? Or Am I think after that I was like, yeah, I don't think I'm doing too badly. It even other times that I've done it was always not quite that bad, but clothes. And I'm like, yeah, I don't think it bolts are, are men for me. Well, there's, there's so many religions that have cannabis and cannabis eating as the base of their religion. Hindu is, um, there's so many, uh, so many passages in, in ancient Hindu scripts.

Speaker 3:          01:06:39       And I'm like, if you look up, if you look up on, on, uh, on Wikipedia, you can look up the f entheogenic use of cannabis and shows all these different times where people have used cannabis as a psychedelic, like not just, Oh, we're smoking a joint relaxed, but when you eat it, you have these profound visions, but you eat enough. Like Mckenna used to say that eating like large doses of marijuana was equivalent to eating large doses of mushrooms. It's just a matter of having the courage to eat too much code. You'll never get the crazy heart fast heart rate on a, on edibles. You can. Yeah. Because then you don't get a fast heart rate, but you get this panic sense like I'm never going to sober up. Oh, but not as a physical thing. A physical thing like I've done like a heart.

Speaker 3:          01:07:31       Yeah. Where I feel my heart start pounding where I'm just like, Jesus, I'm going like 120 beats per minute with our son seeing which are not doing exercise. That's a bit much. I bet it's anxiety. That probably as probably is because it brings on a lot of anxiety. Oh yeah. Heavy duty edibles make you really reconsider it. It's, it's very difficult to live in the moment on heavy duty edibles because it forces you to examine problematic aspects of your past behavior, assuming you'll still have an affluent cdt because there are really tight. So I'm just like, I'm not accepting, not accepting a belief. I don't know. Well, yeah. Oh yeah. You can go too deep. Not too long ago with the Rick Simpson oil. Oh yeah. Yeah. Which supposed to be great for health and then you know, the thing with the oil is that unless somebody preparing it for you in capsules or something, it's such a guesswork of trying to figure out which one is how many drops you not put up.

Speaker 3:          01:08:29       Yeah. So I've done it where I take a tiny bit and I feel nothing and I'm assuming it's Ilt, but whatever. I'm not feeling anything and I take a tiny bit and one day I take a tiny beat plus a, my new school, tiny micro drop more and I'm like hitting the trees. Right. I'm just way out there and I'm like, whoa. What's also, who's making those things know being made in the same place where they make Tesla's? Yeah, that's part of the problem when that's why we did sell feudal. Well, it's the plan. You can kind of figure things out and when you're smoking it you can sort of feel how it's going and you can stop. It's edible, sees you take it and an hour later you're in Florida. Surprise to see what it's like.

Speaker 1:          01:09:11       I was listening to this radio show the other day where people are complaining about marijuana being stronger than it was when they were kids. Like this guy in his fifties who just recently tried marijuana again and he was talking about how he overdosed. I overdosed on marijuana and I swear to God, how do you exactly. You almost went to the hospital. I mean I barely got through it. I mean you can overdose. I mean it was like going on like about the pot today, right? It's dangerous. Like shut the fuck up. What do you like? The fact that someone can go on the air and say something like that, that's bullshit. It's what's it's. It's not just like you could put a bad thought in someone's head and I really believe that they could die from it unless they have a computer people. I'm talking from zero, zero

Speaker 5:          01:09:54       ever. No, never. I'm going to be the first one.

Speaker 1:          01:09:59       The first one to die. I'm going to fuck it all up for everybody else. I want to be the first one to die. Right? There was a guy who died in Colorado because he jumped off a roof and they were trying to get rid of edibles because in one fucking dipshit jumped off a roof.

Speaker 3:          01:10:14       The thing is, every single substance that's out there is even the mosque held water. If you drink too much water, you can die from it. Right? I mean, he's like every single

Speaker 1:          01:10:25       using gay too. What's the con? Every tool. Cars, everything, skateboards. Everything is how you lose it. I mean if we, if we based what kills you, you know what's illegal? We would literally make everything illegal. Yeah. It'll be number one. People have died from using computer, computers are blown up on people and they've died. Right? Cell phones have blown up in people's pockets and they've been gravely injured or died from a cell phone.

Speaker 3:          01:10:52       Let's find out. Let's sound good. Anyways, killed by cell phones. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say killed by cell phone. While you're finding out about the cell phone, let me take care of them. Tiny monkey. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:11:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:08       Don't answer the call while charging. Urban legends man takes woman's cell phone after she's killed by train. Wow, that's dark man. Killed by cell phone explosion. Okay. Let's see. Gizmodo man killed by cell phone explosion. A Korean man was apparently killed by his LG cell phone today and this was a, by the way, in 2007, they probably got old shit back then. He was carrying the phone in his shirt pocket when it exploded, puncturing his heart and lungs. It happened in North Chung Cheong Province of Korea. As the man was working on a construction site, he was found dead by one of his coworkers. Whoa. Do you think his parents or his family got some money? Wendy's. This was North Korea now South Korea. Korea says a Korean man. North Chung Chung. It's just just as Korea. It doesn't say North or South Korea. I'm assuming it's South Korea because North Korea, I think there are about 250 to six years away from seeing cell phones.

Speaker 1:          01:12:13       Yeah, this is. Yeah, no kidding. Right. Poor bastards. That's why the one of the craziest things about 2014 that we still have a real live communist dictator running and entire country. That's terrified. Yep. Yep. I this little goofy, Chubby moon face motherfucker. Who's the son of another goofy Chelsie moon face motherfucker. It's like that just. Yeah. Or the Isis Guy. I mean sinks that really belong to the Middle Ages. Then you're like really dwindled shit. Come on. This is where. And on one end, you know, you see humanity and we are so damn advanced and we are doing these amazing things. And on the other end where dwayne steel, the same sheets that were Dwayne 2000 years ago, those isis guys are. They release videos on youtube to graphic horrific videos on youtube and then they don't get pulled. Yeah. Until like weeks later he find out about them like, I don't know how like a video gets pulled from youtube.

Speaker 1:          01:13:05       I mean someone has to flag it I guess. Yeah. And like maybe they're only sending it to the people that they know or, or whatever and they'll survive a while before but somebody put something up like check this shit out. And I went and clicked on a link and I was like, Jesus, this is on Youtube. I know these guys shooting each other, these shooting these guys while they were on the ground and then cutting their heads off like all very, very graphic. And I was like, I can't believe this is on Youtube. There's stuff out there that makes you. I've seen the most disturbing things I've ever seen was this one thing he like somewhere in Africa or somebody suspected of being anxious and so they get of these people and set them on fire and you know, after awhile I was like, you know, why the hell am I watching this done over?

Speaker 1:          01:13:46       I know that Ben, so I don't need to see it in it's nuts. It's like straight out of the 39 minutes or something in 2014 is all the progress that we've gone through to get to this point in age and there's still some people that just. You could take them, you could shove them back to the year zero and they would fit called. Yes. Yeah, it's both. It's. There's that thing going on. Human beings, man, that spectrum. The broad spectrum of behavior where it almost seems like you have to have like shitty people to appreciate the good people. Like I wonder if there's ever going to come a time where there's a legitimate biological utopia where like human beings like where they achieve some form of enlightenment where everyone has reached the dust age. We're talking about like his atheism, plus they rattle this onto themselves, but they should know better. They're all fucking educated and going to conferences and stuff like that. They see. It's like they're preaching to the choir essentially or, or propping themselves up on a nice moral high ground in front of their peers. But there's gonna come a time where the whole world is like that. Is that possible?

Speaker 4:          01:14:58       That would be an an I get what you're saying about you need the bad people to their shade. The good people. There's a general improvement of humanity going into more pleasant direction. We don't need the bad people just give us a dvds, a showing

Speaker 1:          01:15:12       this is what the bad people experiences like. Whoa. Really? And you know, make people very nice. So you watch movies and you get almost like an experience

Speaker 4:          01:15:23       without diving actually to deal with it because the whole restaurant, now that you've been here, a religious devout are. You need to evolve in order to appreciate the good. Like to what degree man, because we talk about human history, there has been so much evil that is like really? I could actually do with one, 100 of that. I will learn the lesson. I don't need to learn that same lesson over and over again in such brutal nasty fashion. There's something about the design of human history or nature or for that matter, because as you say multiple times. I mean, when you look at nature, it's like it's not a soft, fuzzy, happy animals running around the forest. He's brutal. His fangs and close on the whole thing and it's like, yeah, maybe if it's about appreciating the good stuff, there would be a gentler way to go about it. Do we really have to go these hardcore? It will make it happen.

Speaker 1:          01:16:11       Yeah. Nature is the most vicious motherfucker. A wall my friend was telling me about, I'm watching this bear killed this female bear. He was watching his grizzly bears. They were observing them and this male was trying to mate with this female grizzly bear and the grizzly bear. I didn't want to mate with them. She kept pushing them off and yelling at him. I kept trying so hard to get her to meet with them, but she didn't want to do it and then a new grizzly bear, a new female came into the picture and the new female came into the picture and started trying to get him to meet with her and he got angry that she was distracting him so he murdered her in front of the other business. Just tore her apart, that just ripped her to shreds and he said it was the craziest thing because all of a sudden this bear had its feet up in the air and it was just dead like within seconds, like a few seconds ago, it had wandered into the camp, you know, or into this little valley with these were and tried to get this bear to me and he, he's a biologist and so he was observing this stuff or if he's not a biologist who works with biologists and it was observing this stuff and he said it was one of the most disturbing things he's ever seen in his life.

Speaker 1:          01:17:22       He's a hunter. He's lived his whole life hunting and you know, death is a normal, natural part of life to him. But this to him freaked him out more than anything I'd ever seen because he said it was so brutal and it was so instantaneous,

Speaker 4:          01:17:37       you know, it's just really crazy, man. Do you ever do divert daily about the rapists, necrophilia docs, docs? I didn't tell you about the rapists necrophilia docs thing. So I have to. So, you know, cute little dogs, they are adorable. I remember seeing docs beam bar naturing out with an ag and I'm like, I never eat in Nag again. Diane 18 doc again and poorly told that, you know, you got into these romanticized cute fuzzy thing. Right? And then I start reading about docs that apparently mailed docs are particularly fond of raping female dogs and um, but this is where it gets interesting. So they go out, I'm sure maybe you've seen them in these super high speed chase where the female is that I need and there's like two or three male run flying right behind her and in, during this high speed chases, occasionally the female take the wrong turn and she ask us into something a three or a weekend or something. And then she, uh, she broke her neck and die immediately. But you know, bodies still warm. So the one that'd be rapists, docs on poor suites, the side, ah, what the hell, we don't want to waste this. So. And they just got on and have sex with a dead corpse after that. I'm like, docs are back on the manual

Speaker 1:          01:18:48       motherfuckers because you guys are mean and horrible and I'm going to each again, maybe this is show to all those people that are trying to keep you from eating fog war, right. You know, that's a weird thing that California has. California has a law where you're not allowed to eat duck liver, but you can eat ducks because they were forced feeding these ducks if their liver to grow and people found out to be unbelievably cruel, I guess crueler than killing them. Right. And eating them like force feeding them to get their livers to grow larger was crueler than killing them. Emi. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:19:22       I mean the, you know, the stuff that's done in raising anymore, letting industrial level tend to be pretty fucked up, which is why even people who whine about that but they do anything related to whether you have land that already with any kind of meat is ridiculous because it's like hunting is a lot cleaner. That way. You know, you'll let the animal live its life be for the end of every single commercial farming. Yet, there's some nasty stuff happening at the same time, you know, there are limits to how far you want to take it because there's. They're not too many simple, clean, painless, easy ways to do seeing that still deliver the goods that people that rely on. So it's a very. That's why he's the same thing as the stuff we were saying earlier. Any kind of dogmatic position about these either the scuttle animals, they're just here for us to use an Okr sweater and

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       a software horribly or the poor little band. Nice. You can touch anything. I've missed the boat. Three colors, right? They both have a point that they are both ridiculous. If taken too far. Have you ever seen the video of a woman? She walks into a restaurant and tells everyone in the restaurant that what they're eating is not food. It's violence. No, and she. She goes in, she tells everybody about her little girl. I want to tell you about my little girl and it's chicken. She's talking about. Her name is snow. Have you seen it? We've seen it. Jamie, let me find it for you. We should play it because it's just so ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:20:45       No, that's not food. It's violence. Are you done kid? We can. We can. We can. We can end this and next time you come by I'll bring my daughter the otters and we'll have a little party. They complain and rant goes viral. This isn't food. It's violence. Pull this up and we'll have you seen with bill cosby did yesterday. There was just that right before we started. Lord, if you don't know what's going on about bill cosby, Bill cosby going to be very careful how I phrase this. Allegedly has raped a large number of women and allegedly has drug these women and I mean I find it hard to believe that 13 women would make something that's a large number. I mean it would have to be some massive conspiracy dating back to the 19 seventies just now being uncovered. So he put this thing on his website yesterday, like me.

Speaker 1:          01:21:49       Go ahead and meme me with a photo of him and the meme being the print that you can add a meme generator and his said, happy Monday and these people just went crazy. I mean it, it went, it got so ugly, like, I mean one of them was like, one of the first one was like more than a dozen women have accused me of rape. How can I hear you say no because he's got like headphones on. What do you mean you're pressing charges? I mean it's, it's, these are the mild ones, but I mean, what was he thinking? He's a fucking idiot. What the hell was he thinking for? A lot of people believe that someone who works for him did it on purpose. Really. Someone who works for him knew that it was going to like someone who is like a website designer. We've got to think like website designers.

Speaker 1:          01:22:41       A lot of times younger people and maybe even a woman. Right? You know, it was like this fucking piece of shit. I can't believe I'm working for him. Or a guy who is sympathetic to what's going on and says, look, how do I get this fucker that would actually be ged? That's what happened. That's great. I mean they put a bunch of them that were like really cute. His on his website, like they, they took some of the ones that people had created that were pg rated, but the amount that were raped related was so staggering. Well, of course. I mean, what's he like in the news? What's has been like, what have you heard about him in the news over the last year has been the story, right? So it's like, of course that's what's going to pop up. Of course that's what's going to happen and no one is a press charges is okay.

Speaker 1:          01:23:25       I wonder how you could. Because it's. It seems strange, you know, it seems like if you don't have the physical evidence like, but you have 13 people telling a similar story. I wonder how that works. The pencils are from how long ago it is because that's all statue of limitations. Is there a statute of limitations on rape? I'm as it and I think it is. I think it is. I think there is, isn't that would save that 77 guy. That's exactly what it is. Right? This is a statute of limitations is wiser. Central limitations on something so horrible. Know. It becomes tricky though because of course once you wait to report it, it's all physical evidence is gone and Danny, you have to rely on a lot the newer kind of evidence that's a lot harder to make the case. There is also that. The thing about memory right discussed earlier that human memory is one of the worst pieces of evidence you could ever get.

Speaker 1:          01:24:21       There are people that I have had experiences with where they'll go, hey, remember when we did this and did that and blah blah, blah. I'm like, we never even been in there with, you know, you went with us like, listen man, I've never been to South Dakota. Stop. It didn't happen. Or they remember the wrong state or there. I mean, people's memories are fucking terrible. They're awful. Do you have this video will play this and then we'll give her a chance. Slicker. She looks, she's done. We did like an hour and a half. That's all good. Like you got to see this. Watch this video. Please put your headphones on so you can hear this stuff, but it's not plugged in anymore. So you of course, hold on a second, give it a chance. Did she yank it out? Of course. It's like, okay, we'll just play this and then we'll end it. This is so ridiculous. This woman walks in this restaurant and there there's a whole group of people behind her.

Speaker 6:          01:25:14       She walked into a restaurant and people are eating little girl. She was very abused for her entire life. She was terrified. She has a very determined look in her eyes wherever she goes, and she was hurt and abused her entire life because of this establishment and because of establishment, she was locked away. She was hidden. She got nobody there for her. She was crying. She was scared every single moment and because they're useful as had run out, she was going to be killed. Someone to blame and I can. I can see you laughing. It's not funny. I went in there with other humans. I took her out of there. She wouldn't be with me right now. She wouldn't be gone just like, all right everybody today. There was other girls, but they just wanted to live their life and their bodies and every time you see someone eating somebody else's ags or somebody else's body, you are going to remember her name. Her name is a beautiful little girl and it didn't just violent is the best part. They all come in and they all have a

Speaker 1:          01:26:57       sign like it's not just to say it. They have to have assigned it. Hold on.

Speaker 6:          01:27:06       I think of her name every time,

Speaker 1:          01:27:10       like these fucking pathetic people that are just so lucky. Their ancestors ate meat to get them to 2014 idealistic little kids in this video that you have the in the background. Say, my girl is all perfect, but it's crazy. She has this determined look in her eyes. She goes, no, she doesn't. Okay. Her expression never changed. She's a fucking chicken. God dammit and crazy lady. That is one of my favorite videos ever because she's just so bonkers. Like I see you smiling. Gee, I wonder why we're smiling. Maybe because you're kind of crazy. You're walking into a chicken restaurant with more people and Jamie's right. There's more people came with her that were in the restaurant. What's the at like two in the afternoon and some flower. It was just so strange.

Speaker 6:          01:28:02       She's a little girl, just turban looking her wherever she goes and she just went to live and people are eating her eggs.

Speaker 1:          01:28:09       I guess what? I eat my chicken's eggs and they don't care at all. You know why? Because the eggs don't become a chicken. You fucking dunce. Yeah. He just eggs. When you have chickens, you can have chickens as pets. They provide you with free protein, right? You give them food and they give you protein. That doesn't hurt anybody. It doesn't harm them. They have chickens. They lay eggs every day. Right. This idea that you're their milk. No, no, no. There's no chicken meal. Never seem to stay away from me. They don't breastfeed, but this, you know, that is the spectrum. That's the spectrum. I mean, sensitivity is important and understanding of nature's important. I mean I've been accused, especially lately since I've last couple of years since I started hunting of being cruel of doing it because you enjoy killing animals. I don't at all, I mean I, I enjoy hunting, I enjoy bringing home the meat.

Speaker 1:          01:29:00       I actually, I think that the killing of the animals, the worst part of it, the, the, the fact that you're able to take an animal out of nature though, like in the most natural environment, possibly if I didn't exist, that animal would be doing the exact same thing until I came along. There was no influence whatsoever on its life and then all sudden boom, it ends, which is going to end by wolves. It's going to end by, especially where I was, I was up in Canada where they have, they have so many wolves up there. They have no limit on how many wolves you can shoot serious that had begun to wealth football, a huge population problem. Huge. Like they have elk, they have deer, they have moose and the wolves are just killing them left and right. While we were up there and we actually came upon, we saw all these ravens that were floating around this one area, so we're trying to figure out what it was that they were attracted to.

Speaker 1:          01:29:54       So we went over to it and we found this moose calf that had been torn apart by wolves. This is the Moose calf. I'll put it up on my instagram later so you guys could see because you're not going much left. But this, oh, it's just mangled. It was crazy and it was wolves, wolves, it taking it from, from its mother. And they just figured out a way to get ahold of it and just ripped apart. Cars, devoured it, and it was hair all over the ground. Everything. That's the reality of that life, the get it. And then what's left? The coyotes get that and then what's left, you know, any other scavengers get that. That is a much more likely death. And by hunter, the hunter death is the least likely. Yep, absolutely. And in that sense, again, to me it's like everything is going to die as long as they are not doing where you are wiping out with a species and as long as they are not doing where you are at Dean and necessity pain to the process, then that's the nature of the business.

Speaker 1:          01:30:51       Well, what this woman is doing by running into that restaurant and say it's not food, it's violence, like you're kind of. You're missing the whole point. You're missing the boat. It's not violence. It's ending life so that you could eat it and yeah, it's kind of a crazy way to do it because we're detached from it. You're, you're right about that. But again, that's like a shitty communication strategy because I'm sure she can have a point where she's at it because there are issues that we. Commercial farming that are nasty, terrible, but you know, there's a way to communicate it to where you are. I would be like, oh, you're right. You'll make a good point. So maybe we can tweak the lows. A tiny beat to do it in a more humane way. Thought that they agree. You go like these are preaching to the choir.

Speaker 1:          01:31:33       You only have like pan out there. People who feel the exact same way. You do agree with you. Even if somebody is 80 percent, the other way you'll get are going to look at you and go like, Whoa, you really went off the deep end. She's emotionally unbalanced and on top of that, that leads people to want to kill more chickens. It really does. I mean I have this guy that I'm friends with up in Alaska or in BC rather, that runs this hunting camp and he would get these death threats from people because they would be hunting wolves and the reason why they hunt wolves, they had one of their cows torn apart by wolves. These 30 wolves got ahold of a cow and ripped it apart while the people were in the house and their hand. They look out the window and they see this wolves bringing down a cow and kill.

Speaker 1:          01:32:17       That is crazy stuff, man. Do to look out your window and see this 2000 pound animal get taken out by this pack of wild, murderous animals. It's pretty. It's got to be pretty cool, but also pretty goddamn terrifying that fans and people do get killed by wolves and they certainly did in large numbers back in the day, which is why the Little Red Riding Hood, the big bad wolf. We don't think about that today because it's not an issue, but there was many, many times throughout history where wolves and killed people, if you google like wolf desk by people before we had eradicated like large populations of the wolves, there was actually a ceasefire in world war one. Remember that story? Yeah. The Germans, the Germans and the Russians actually called a ceasefire because so many of them were getting killed by wolves. They said, all right, let's just stop killing each other.

Speaker 1:          01:33:07       Fuck these wolves up real bad. We couldn't go back to kill each other. That's how nutty wolves are. So these, these people were sending this guy death threats, and he said, every time you send me a death threat, I'm going to shoot a wolf in the guts, and so they stopped sending death threats, not just stopped posting. This woman was like, I'm going to post a new page every day if you banned me, I'm going to make a new name. And he goes, okay. Every time you do that, I'm gonna. Shoot a wolf in the guts. Silence. Yeah. I figured that the care of business really is a way of communicating where he's just like, you think it's fun, doesn't she thinks it's fun shooting the gun so far. I mean there's really a way to communicate to the guests of the job is like most people like to communicate and preach to the choir kind of way.

Speaker 1:          01:33:53       Most people communicate in a way that's not going to see that anywhere you are coming from the person they are talking with. They're only considering where they are coming through them and they want you to feel what they're feeling, what they're thinking. Exactly. Only they want to force their ideology on you and in that sense like veganism and vegetarianism is sort of a religion. Just like we're talking about atheism plus as a religion. So is being a Christian and so is being a mormon and you know, it's like its ideology. It's all. It's all thought processes. We, you could label it and call it a religion. You could label it, you know, call it a cult. You could call it whatever you want, but it's just thought processes, thought patterns that you want other people to think. You don't want them to express themselves and you can look at it from their point of view. No, you just want. You want them to know and you're right, this is not. Food is violence. No, it's food. It actually is food. It's fucking chicken and I'm about to eat and you. You crazy bitch. You came in with all these meek fucking low blood sugar freaks holding up signs thinking you got to change the world. Changing Shit. Go get a job. What are you guys doing here at 2:00 in the afternoon? How are you feeding yourself?

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       Do you have jobs? What are you doing? Your fucking parents are putting you through schools that was going on here and the thing there is like our many people's minds have you just changed by doing zero, zero point zero. So he's like, even if you believe that you're 100 percent right in your message, go back to the drawing board and look at that. What you just did is bullshit because it doesn't lead to any single person being convinced, so figure out a better communication strategy because you suck. Yeah. She needs to get on some IOWASCA. Fucking elves would let her know. Chickens are going to die no matter what. Bitch. Yeah. I. Last time I did DMT, I asked them about hunting. I asked it and I'm like, okay, whatever. That's literally what they said went into, and I had this thought in my head.

Speaker 3:          01:35:40       I was like, uh, his, his hunting and is it, is it morally acceptable? Is there anything wrong with hunting? And they're like, it's fine. Of course they're like, they're like showing me all these different things about life. Like, look, you're going to die, dies. Everything dies. It all goes into this thing and they're showing me all these fractal reality and I felt silly for asking that question that I have to tell you about that. My one and only dmt experience, which is pretty fun because I did it with Duncan Duncan. He's hating it. Then he's like seeing God and the universe said he has these big smile on his face and he's just like, it's an I'm just like, I'm looking at him and I think you are the goofiest buster I've ever seen. Doesn't just laughing my ass off, but I've not seen have him to seem and I keep hitting it.

Speaker 3:          01:36:28       So like there should be an at one point I think, whoa, my perception is changing. I am beginning to a vision because they see that Duncan ceiling is all warped and weird and then eventually come down from the experience and I realize that Dunkin is really just weird that it wasn't working. I was working in the sense that he was like the biggest, uh, it was like the biggest weed, the high in the universe. I had the big body high, you know, I felt it really sinking into the couch and melting into the couch and I failed it. That like every thing was hilarious, but I did not have a fish. Nope. No one. And you know, I took as much as Duncan beaten again. He was out there, you know, spacing out with Cosmo Molson discussion. You were like passing it back and forth. So it's like you were getting at the same depth as what they do say that there's a certain percentage of people it doesn't work on and I'm sure that maybe the next time you take one more.

Speaker 3:          01:37:24       What is it like a lot. How long was after a while I was getting mad. I was like, come on, but we'd wherever, like I'll take a hit of weed and in the afternoon or in the evening and I'm like, I barely affects me. It's pleasant, you know, he's reading glasses on, but in a very male kind of way. If I do it before lunch, I mean another, you won't. I didn't. Once I met is a horrible mistake with David Seaman. Like before it podcast he offered me that I took a hit and I didn't eat before and all of a sudden in the middle of this podcast that he's like, I hear him talk and he heard that his voice is coming. The sentence is coming to an end and I'm just like,

Speaker 1:          01:38:07       oh fuck, I don't know what I'm going to say. Oh my God. Same substance, one heat versus painting another case and the 10 where it's like, it's also different kinds of weed to some really strong stuff, but that's a dmt things weird that it worked on Duncan and not you. I wonder if maybe it's one of those things, man, one of those things where you have that thing where you don't. It doesn't work on, you know, maybe he was. Find out a report after the next one. Young lady. You have amazing patients. I'm very impressed with you. We're going to end this podcast now because you are. You're just going to score him yourself into a coma. Nikki's give daddy a kiss. Alright, Daniella, you're awesome. Next time we do this, let's do it again and we'll, we'll bring my kids will have a little party. You have a bunch of screaming back there. Much more or less boring guy. Yeah. That's how we're going to do it. Right. Thank you brother and your podcast. Let people know how to get ahold of you on twitter and your podcast.

Speaker 3:          01:39:18       The Bolo lists in my first initial Daniel as a d, e b o l e Lli on twitter, and then a podcast is the drunken tower with a t, t, a o, s t dot. If you guys look up Daniella calm, which is Daniel plus, he at the end, b o l e Lli. That probably refers you to every single cells, so that would be the easier route and I'll just throw out there now I'm more keen on a second podcast that's going to happen at some point. There's a few dig artcore. He stood in. You may dig this way. It's but you know that's right now he's on the back burner because I have to finish writing a book. I have to 17,000 things to take care of, but hopefully by the beginning of the year or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:40:02       Beautiful. All right man. Thank you brother. I really appreciate you coming on here and especially in tight circumstances like this will make it happen next time. Okay, I'll bring my kids. Thanks so much. Little little kid party sound good, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow. Tomorrow, uh, will, will be on with Dr. Mark Gordon, who's going to talk about a traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder in soldiers were actually bring on one of his patients who we're talking about his experiences and hopefully we could help some other folks out there that are experiencing a very similar, a similar situation. So tomorrow. Much love. See you soon.

Speaker 2:          01:40:46       Hmm.

Speaker 7:          01:40:53       We pulled it off.
