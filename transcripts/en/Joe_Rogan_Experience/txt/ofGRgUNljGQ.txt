Oh well that's, that's a, that that's a approach to combat and everyday life should be the same. That's, that's intense. Yeah. It's always a little too intense. I have a real interesting one on my Instagram. I don't know if you can pull it up. Is that the guy who touched the girl for the first time? That video? No, but uh, it is a lady, uh, the holiday one, but it's interesting, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Who is that guy that touched the girl? Did you get permission to put them on your part to try to take down that one that you made me put up the Christmas one? Yeah. Isn't that, that one's pretty interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:58          What

Speaker 1:          00:59          are you doing man? What is wrong with you, you and your wife? Well, first of all, you're both fucking hilarious. She is. But you guys are closed. So specific. Yeah. You have the, you guys have the funniest, silliest fucking show because you're both so specific. Thanks. Yeah, like the, the things that you just decide, like you wearing a shirt. Tom's wearing a shirt that says just glass and on it, I'm just glass and Brown. Now glass in is a term that like hunters use when they get up on a ridge and they look for things. Yeah. So when I saw that I was like, well that's weird. Like what did you, maybe you bought that convenience store when you were in Alaska, right? Something like that. Yeah. This would be a silly gimmicky shirt today, but no, this is a shirt like from your fucking podcast. It is, yeah. It's top tells the story. Every week a week

Speaker 2:          01:46          we get submitted hundreds of emails with links to videos like that. Right, right, right. I mean, so many emails. Have you seen this? Have you seen the, and the, and the Internet is endless pool of stuff to pull from. And then we have this, our producer blue band, I don't know if you know that. That's our producer's name. Bam. Yeah. Cause it used to be red band. He was a yellow band for awhile and now there's blue van, so, so blue band. Um, then we'll go through a lot of this stuff and edit down, let's say like a five minute youtube video until like maybe six, 10 to 15 second clips. And so we're just always looking at stuff and it's, you know, the, we like a range of things are engaging us. Well, we got this hunter, his name is Fred Eichler, I think he's an avid bow hunter.

Speaker 2:          02:37          He bumped he oh bonds with a traditional bow. Like a recurve bow is, that's right. The one of the most preeminent, a recurve bow hunters. Yeah. It's either a recurve bow or a might be a stick bow. Yeah, no, it's, it's a totally, it's incredible how that technology evolved. Yeah. So there's a lot of these guys, like this guy you were talking about class and guy, he still uses like one of those primitive boasts, but he's just good. He can get away with it. It says, I mean there's, bio is the incredible, but in this video it starts with him. Uh, he, he shoots a moose and it drops quick and he fucking comes close to coming in his pants. Like he, he makes a sound that you don't even, you can't, he goes like, like, like, like can you show it to us? Uh, yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:22          Are you allowed to play it online? Did you get pulled from anything? No. Play it on Youtube and, and we also play, I mean, the audio is what's incredible, but then he starts talking about glassine and he's like, we were just coming around the meadow. We were just glass and go. And then we were like, let's go, let's go ask. And he gives, keeps going. Glass, glass, glass, glass and glass, which is looking through binoculars, which we discovered, but then we played it so much. People like, I would post a picture of myself, like I'm about to go on and be like, are you glassing? And like, or you know, like if you talk to somebody like, what'd you do today? I'm like, oh, I hung out. And they were like glassing and you're like, yeah. So then it morphed into meaning like just chill.

Speaker 2:          04:01          Yeah. And I dunno, it just kind of picked up from there. So I just have so many of these though. Okay. What's the deal with jeans calling everybody jeans? Like when you guys were on that and you had to explain it to me. Yeah. You know what the latest thing is with that? First we had an electrician over at the house and whenever you're in the house, you know you're calling your spouse, I'd be like, Jane's do you know, cause that's what I call her. So then she walked down the stairs and he goes, gene, would you like me to put the, so he and we just let it go. We called her jeans, but then we started, I'm going to Starbucks and ordering our drinks. It's just like a stupid thing like that we told our listeners, we do, we do this regularly just to amuse ourselves, which is, we'll call them jeans and then say thank you mommy, or I love you mommy at the end.

Speaker 2:          04:50          And no one ever, the order happens so fast and it's so like programmed that they never catch it. Never say like, what did you say? So like when I, when I pulled up like, welcome to Starbucks, what can I get for you? It'd be like a, hey jeans, I want to get an iced coffee, extra ice and what do you want? A double tall sort latte. Okay. That'll be a six many words. I'll be like, thanks mommy. And then I just pull up. So we told them we did that. People sent us videos of them doing it. Fucking hilarious. Like a guy like getting his, uh, he was talking to a bill play place and he's like, hey mommy, I don't understand what this bill means. And the other guy's like, yeah. So that first section, like they don't even address that you're calling someone mommy or jeans or saying thank you mommy, or I love you mommy.

Speaker 2:          05:34          They're like, okay, have a good day. Like they just, it speaks more to almost how preprogrammed customer service becomes, you know, they're not even acknowledging that you're saying something ridiculous to them. No, no, they're not. It's hilarious. Yeah. But also like, what are you saying when someone says something like that to you? You probably like, you're so scrambled. I think so. Yeah. Cause it doesn't make any sense. It started off not making any sense, but then it picked up and made a lot of sense. Yeah. It's like, well clearly you can talk English and then it gets to the end. He calls you mommy and you're like, whoa. What happened? One time we called the, uh, the renaissance in Cincinnati, the hotel, the hotel, because the year before, before, a few months before my son was born, we were there for a wedding and Christina had like a 32nd fart. So we, she's very pregnant.

Speaker 2:          06:23          We came back and we talked about it and we decided it deserved its own names. What's called the Cincinnati Fart. Oh, Jesus. And we figured out what room number we were in and we called the hotel and I go, Hey, can I help you? I go, I want a book. I want to stay there, but I want to commemorate the Cincinnati part. And she goes, I'm sorry, what was that? And I go, I want to stay in this room. I think it's from six one eight, because this Cincinnati fart happened there. And she goes, I'm just having a little trouble. What was that?

Speaker 2:          06:55          The what? And I'm like, this Cincinnati Fart. And she's like, can you spell it for me? And I go, yeah, f eight. And she stayed professional. Like she was like, oh, okay, I'll look and I'll see what I can show. Yeah. She didn't probably have cameras on you. Yeah. You can't go, what the fuck are you talking about? Why you waste my time? Well, I did have a, uh, a flooring guy. I go, can you do this floor for me? And he's like, well, I can send you some samples. And I go, great. He goes, well, who do I send it to? I go to your mom's house. And he was like, what was that? And I go at your mom's house. He goes, my mom's house. I go, no, that's the name of our, our company, your mom's house. And I go, yeah. And he was like, all right, you have a good day, and he hung up the phone.

Speaker 2:          07:40          I'm going to go like I was. I wasn't trying to, for him it was a totally normal, I wasn't trying to be funny. I go, no, that's the name of the company and want to listen. He was like, okay, okay. You have a good day. Like wow. Yeah. Okay. Did you try it? You let him hang up. You should have said it's actually the name of podcasts. We tried to explain it, but he was looking it up on iTunes. It's very popular. He was, he was pretty quick with like, Oh, this is a joke, and I go, oh, okay. He grew up with a lot of your mom jokes. Yeah, he did. He's not liking it and not buying. It seems like, uh, a guy that just didn't get it. Can you play Fred? Do we will you plays audio? The glass and Guy? Yeah. It's, where do you have it on your tongue?

Speaker 2:          08:19          It's on youtube. Okay. What is the name of the video? It's called Sam. It's saved on his phone. Tell you, give me one moment. I'll look down at the ice house tonight. Sold out. I'm at, I'm doing dom Irrera show tonight and you're at the laugh factory tomorrow. Tomorrow with Duncan Trussell and Tony Hinchcliffe.

She couldn't tell it was moving really quick. Quick. Yeah. That's a compound. Will see the, the cams at the top of the boat. That's not a permanent boa at all. That's I'm super modern bow,

Speaker 4:          09:07          I think,

Speaker 2:          09:09          but this dude knows how to do this. He's, Oh yeah, I know. He's so professional. Bowhunter I've seen this guy on TV a ton of time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's got a TV show that I watch. Dude, if you go over to my house, you'd think I'm a crazy person. You change your profile pic. Yeah. It's a silly picture of me with a camera on my face hiding in the trees. I'm trying to make sure this is the right video. I'm looking going through the trees. Every one's life start, but I can still see the moon through the tree. Blended in good. We've got, when does it get good at archery? Archery moves down. Yeah. That was coming up and I really like,

We've been slipping along this big huge meadow, big long call meadow. We'd been slipping along here, just glassing juice, glass and glass and all of a sudden I hit even have, I need to put my head in it on. I'm like, God, we're just glass and he's been cured by those.

Speaker 1:          11:08          significant than a bowl? No. No. Unless he only had a tag for a cow. Oh, it depends on why. Why he shot a cow. Not a, not a bull. Sometimes it depends on the unit. Depends on how many cows they have versus how many bowls they have. They might want people to kill cows. They probably want a certain amount of cows to be killed a year. They have weird, um, who decides that? Yeah. It's fishing game department. They go that we have too many of his entirely Thailand. Where you are depends entirely on what part of the world you're in.
