Speaker 1:          00:00:03       All right. Uh, I'm here with Kevin Folta, Kevin, your a scientist, a GMO foods expert and if there is one subject that gets beaten to death online and in conversation and butchered. I, I've, I've heard many conversations that I had to just walk away from at parties where people started talking about what GMO foods do and what's going to happen and all the horrible things. Gmo Foods are probably one of the most confusing and also one of the most hated things in, in the world today, but also one of the most common and most misunderstood, right? I mean almost everything, there's a, Neil degrasse Tyson did a video about this where he was kind of explaining like the term GMO foods, like virtually everything you see, including things that are quote unquote organic at a supermarket have been modified in some way in order to prolong the shelf life in order for them to taste better, including corn and tomatoes and oranges and you name it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       Yeah, I think that's the big problem is that when you frame this very well, the problem is that we confuse this idea of GMO, which is kind of a pejorative term that we've derived to a kind of misrepresent this kind of technology, which is really just plant genetic improvement. Um, like you say, we've been improving plants for 10,000 years as a species. We find the ones that work best and we continue to select those particular lines that have benefits for us. And we'd been doing this for a long time, so everything is different than it was in the wild. If you look at the natural forms, there are nothing like what you see today in the store. So this GMO thing is just the most recent way that we've been able to modify the way a plant behaves and what plant products are. And it just is a much more precise extension of conventional breeding.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       But there is a company that looms like the death star out there in the world of GMO foods. And that company, I don't even have to say the name, it's spoken in hushed terms around Hippie campfires. Monsanto. Yeah, right. And well, Monsanto was also responsible for a lot of good things. I'm sure they, they have done some creepy shit and they have, uh, gotten, especially in India, I mean they're, they're directly connected to the suicides of countless farmers who can't afford to use their seed. They have to replace every year. I mean there's, there's good and bad when it comes to the ability to modify things. And I think what terrifies some people is that a company like Monsanto, which has just ungodly amounts of money and influence and power. I mean, they'd been sued by the Brazilian government and Brazil sued them and won. And, uh, I don't know the exact specifics of the case, but it's essentially about those seeds that explain those terminator

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       seeds, if you could, and how those things were created. Okay. So you touched on three important points there and we can come back to the suicides and also Monsanto being a giant company. Um, and I should not wear it off the top. I have nothing to do with Monsanto. I'm not, you know, I don't work for them. I'm a scientist at the, wait a minute, I've read online that you are a shill. That's right. You are not a chef. I am not a shell. I'm actually, I'm a shill for you. I actually, I'm, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a public scientist. I work for the University of Florida. I'm the chairman of a horticultural sciences department in a state where we grow almost no GM crops. The differences is that I see tremendous potential for how these technologies could be helpful for our farmers and we try to get them excited about ways that we can apply them in the future.

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       But let me go back to your last question about, cause I don't even know much about this Brazil issue either, but what you mean, I'm sure you could pull up the article. We'd see it on the big screen. Yeah. So your last, the last question out of that was the terminator, the terminator seeds and the terminator seeds. This is something that never existed in terms of a product that was available. A company called Delta pine in land back in the 1990s develop the technology to ensure that a genetically engineered seeds would stay in the fields they were planted, that you wouldn't have pollen leaving and pollinating something else and creating plants and other places. Pretty good idea for containment. And Delta Pine and land had this technology where basically the embryo of the seed didn't develop properly. So it was a dead end. You couldn't replant it and get it to grow.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       So when Delta Pine and land later was bought out by the big Yam, by Monsanto, everybody saw the terminal value. It wasn't called the terminator seed had some other name, but it quickly gained the name Terminator. And so these were never grown outside of a greenhouse. And the company has said they never will grow them outside of a greenhouse just because of the, uh, overlaid implications of what they might mean. But there have been instances of GMO crops, but by pollination, uh, infecting the lands of people who are not supposed to have these Monsanto crops. On. And they were sued for having these crops growing on their land. Correct. There's examples where people have had litigation because they've, uh, they've generated the seeds that are a licensed product. So in other words, when you're a farmer, you buy the seeds from the company and it's Monsanto or any of the companies that sell the seeds.

Speaker 2:          00:05:26       There's six different companies now you buy the seeds from any of those companies, you fill out a form saying, uh, I agreed to not grow more of this. And so there are cases where people have grown more of it and hasn't been from a little bit of pollen drifting into a field. The court cases are all public record in the ones where they had been successfully tried and litigated, they've been for thousands of acres of plants that somewhat would knowingly grow and maybe even treat with roundup in many cases so that they were selecting for the trait. The intent was to sell the seeds that they agreed not

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       to sell. Oh, okay. So these stories about farmers that were getting sued because of crosspollination because they're, the GMO crops have infected their, their land is not true. That's not, there's no evidence in the, in the record to show that this is substantiated and what's even Numb, uh, more scary about that is that is that when the company has litigated any of these and one favorable court decisions, they haven't kept the money that any damages went back into the community. So, um, again, that's, what do you mean by that? Just went back to the community that if they saw, if they sued a farmer and actually won the case, any of the funding that was a one is a penalty from that case was given back to the community where that farmer lived back in what form? I guess just guess just financial support for whatever I, it was just, the idea they wanted to get around was that they were somehow suing farmers to get rich or to pocket the funds.

Speaker 3:          00:06:55       And so they created this opera wealth, this plan or this program to put the money back where it came. So where are these farmers get the seeds then? If they, they had, they illegally acquired these seeds somehow. Is that, what's the implication? Well, if you were to go buy corn from let's say Monsanto or Dow or any of the companies that make it and you were to grow, say, uh, soybeans that were roundup resistance so that you, they resist the herbicide, you can kill the weeds, but let this plant's growth through a, if you were to buy those and you were to spray them and then, uh, keep the seeds and then grow a, bulk them up and then start selling them out of your garage, the company would come and say, no, you can't do that. So this is what you're doing is you're taking the corn and the corn itself is essentially seed, right?

Speaker 3:          00:07:43       Like the actual, the ears of corn, you can grow corn from that corn and that's what they're doing. Yeah. So they're essentially, and maybe not corn as much, I can get to that in a second. But, um, things like cotton and, and a in soil, you can't, uh, it's, it's a lot like software and anesthesia. Bodner dot. Doctor Anesthesia Bodner is an excellent example of this. You can't go buy a copy of, uh, Microsoft office and go home and make a thousand copies and sell them on Ebay without Microsoft knocking on your door. This is a technology that takes years and years to develop. It's a really expensive technology to deregulate something like $130 million sometimes to deregulate one of these genetically modified lines. So the company needs to make money to maintain its R and D. And so they ask farmers, who are the beneficiaries ultimately of this to sign an agreement saying that they'll buy it every year. So this is the lawsuit, the Brazilian lawsuit, if you scroll up, Jim's degree, this whole thing, it's so they face a $1 billion. Well, this is in 2013. They lost the lawsuit. Um, this is, uh, not a, uh, a recent article, but the farmers that were suing for

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       abusive purchase contracts. A scroll down a little bit there. Brazil farmers court actions are piling up against Monsanto for collecting royalties on our r one is that roundup, the roundup ready one, um, regarding eleague, uh, regarded as illegal and for conditioning the sale of new GM seeds in a, I don't know what that word is, intact and Taca Rr two to the signing of a contract seen as abusive. According to an article for Valor Online, Brazil lawyers for the farmers and representative bodies estimate the value of the claims against Monsanto at 1.9 billion Birr Brazilian Brazilian heels, which is about us. 1 billion processes have not been completed, but preliminary estimates say that the claims may affect the company's profit. See if you could find a more recent article cause they lost that lawsuit. I have no clue. This is also coming from sustainable pulse and GM watch, uh, two sources which have nothing positive to say about biotechnology.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       And it wouldn't surprise me if another other countries did try to litigate. And these kinds of examples, they mean it's anybody can sue a company, you know, anybody can do it. So it's a, it's possible that these things were brought before these, uh, uh, governments saying that these were unfair practices to farmers to make them sign a contract and then repurchase the seed later on. So they seeds that you were talking about before. How did these folks get them then have the, the, if they're getting enough seeds to plant thousands and thousands of acres, uh, illegally, how are they doing that? Well, you just saved the seeds from the previous year instead of, instead of processing and you know, you can imagine a corn, corn cob has, uh, several hundred kernels and each one of those represents a new plant. So you can have x amount of your acreage dedicated to seed production.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       So essentially all you would have to do is buy, you know, a few thousand ears of corn and you'd be able to plant just a giant area of, you know, and I wish I knew the number off the top of my head, but I don't, but um, it would be able to plant replant more seats, corns a bad example because corn are hybrids and it without going into a whole genetics whiteboard thing here, you're, every corn is made from two parents that are genetically very different. But when you combine them together, give you a hybrid that when you cross a hybrid with a hybrid, gives you a mixture of seeds that don't give you any uniformity in the next generation. So since the 1930s, the seed companies have been able to resell that hybrid seed to farmers every year because there's nothing to be gained in, in producing your own. And so corn isn't always the best example. And the companies have used genetics for going on a century now to protect their breeders interests. So the original corners that someone's phone, what was that? The original corn, uh, before it was modified at all was that corn that you get like for Thanksgiving, but you hang on your, your

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       door that nobody eats that weird colored funky looking corn and it's even smaller than that, right? Because the original corn was called Teosinte and [inaudible] was a basically growing on a Bush and Mexico and it gave you 13 little hard kernels on a stick that an implant would produce some of this. And it's now being thought from archeological evidence that uh, people's would take these little corn cobs, which to call it, that is kind of strange, this little stick with little rocks on it and stick it in fire and pop it and eat it like popcorn because it's too hard to, you have to use a lot of water in grinding to make any food out of it. But you can imagine how exciting it was when you were a person who is using us for sustenance. When you found a [inaudible] plant that may be made twice as many, or maybe instead of 13 kernels, gave you 26 and so you would select those implant them the next year.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       And it's really interesting that now you can go back through the 10,000 years of corn improvement. And we've been able to identify the genes that were at all of the critical thresholds that shifted this thing from being a Bush with lots of little sticks of kernels to being what it is today. And it really is just a small number of genes that were changed. So before they started modifying genes, how do they select, like say, how do they, cause before any genetic modifications are done in laboratories, they had turned this GOC what I say [inaudible] or maize as we used to call it. Right. That was the Indian word for it. Even now, even according to that commercial at RBS. Yeah. Um, well the maze is kind of a general term for everything from a field corn, which is what we think about, which is fed to animals, which 80% of GM crops go to animal feed.

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       And, uh, we differentiate that versus a what is typically eaten by humans, which is usually sweet corn varieties. So how did they turn it before there was any genetic modifications done in laboratories? How did they turn that corn into what we now, which is delicious and sweet and you put butter on it, it's fantastic. Oh, sure. Did they do that? Yeah, actually. But it was all just random mutations. DNA referendum. Yeah. DNA replication is a sloppy process and funny things happen when you, uh, from, uh, environment. So in the process of replication of DNA itself, you can make errors, um, cosmic radiation, um, just a chemicals in our environment, natural chemicals that are out there can induce changes in DNA. And these kinds of mutations sometimes very rarely result in a change in the plant that's beneficial and at least, or at least from a human perspective.

Speaker 2:          00:14:24       So in all the plants that we've had, all the plants that we have, the significant amount of change has come from random mutations that change genes in ways we don't understand pieces of DNA that get up out of the genome and sit down somewhere else randomly. They do this all the time. Um, viruses in the plants that get into the genome and sit down in places that we have no idea where. So genetic modification is something that's ongoing and constant andF in a factor in every genome including our own. And so, um, what we're seeing today is just the, uh, the long term effect that of humans who've been able to put all the good traits in one place.

Speaker 4:          00:15:03       So when you see those tomatoes that are in the supermarket that are Pale and you could play basketball with them, those hard tomatoes, and then you compare them to like heirloom tomatoes. The only difference between those two is that someone had found some tomatoes that had grown extra firm and selected those and use the seeds from those to create more similar tomatoes and only select the dose.

Speaker 2:          00:15:28       Right. So you, you, you frame two cool things here. So heirloom, what does an heirloom and an heirloom is a tomato without standing eating qualities that can't work in production commercially cause it's too mushy. It's too mushy. They don't last long and they break down. But on the other hand, so this is what the problem is with our food. When you talk about tomatoes, strawberries, blueberries, things that these are non GMO by the way, there's no GMO tomatoes or strawberries. Not at all. People would say there are, the problem is is that plant breeding over the last 50 years or say over the last 100 years, the, the objectives of the breeders has been bigger. Fruit uniformity, big yield, disease resistance, nothing about flavor and aroma. So to meet production characteristics, which is what we've been selecting for breeders, have been looking for these kinds of characteristics that don't involve the consumer. And so our decline in the flavors and the quality of fruits and vegetables is directly related to the mass breeding, not anything to do with GMO.

Speaker 4:          00:16:29       So when you say genetic modified in, in that, in those terms, they are kind of genetically modified, but they're not modified in terms of being in a laboratory in human beings doing some funky stuff with jeans. They're sort of modified almost naturally and just selected for those modifications.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       And, and some of the things that we've selected for have been the ones that didn't kill us when we ate them or the things that didn't make a poison that, uh, or something that tasted horrible. Um, plants make lots of funky compounds. And so this was an opportunity for a, so what we've seen in our stores right now is the residue of, of thousands of years of human selection. And we can call it genetic modification if we want to, but we can differentiate it from what we do in the laboratory, which is now we can call adding a transgene where transgenesis moving a gene from one background of genetics to another via laboratory.

Speaker 4:          00:17:23       And these selections that people have moaned about and I have as well. I mean, it's horrible when you're going a sandwich and has a pale tomato on it because they just taste awful though. So there's, there's no science involved in any of that other than selection. There's no, there's no, there's no like injection of some alien sort of genetics into those things. Alien to the plant.

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       Now there is no, no syringes. I'm like that. And actually, you know, it is more an art than a science being a plant breeder is the most kick ass career these days and has been for a long time. Um, plant breeding is essentially inventing the next generation of food and all we're talking about is a mixing pollen from things that maybe normally wouldn't cross together, like something that nature would never cross. But you got this cool tomato from Europe that has great qualities and we can mix it with this great production quality tomato from that grows in Florida where nothing else can grow. And now you mix these two together and you get this beautiful tomato that works well and everybody's garden. That's where we're going now. But that's not GMO. That's just using other types of technology to facilitate this net, this breeding process that breeders do.

Speaker 2:          00:18:34       And how would you splice those two together? Like how would you take it? Tomato from Europe and a tomato from Arkansas and some hard another make them work. They'll, most of the time it's as simple as plants. Sex, you just, uh, you, we masculine one of them. Uh, you had rip all the male parts out of it and then you add pollen from a different flower and it's very simple and that's what people have been doing to create hybrid varieties for, for centuries. So that is not considered genetic modified or it is wellness. Back to the confusion. It is certainly a genetic modification. You're ramming together genomes that never would have mashed together in the, in the wild never. But, uh, in creating a product that humans have never seen or tasted or tested, but yet we find this very acceptable and very, uh, even though it's a very random process, we don't know what kind of, uh, uh, those, those transposable genes, those things jumping around genomes.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       Um, two of the main corn types have 500 different genes between them, meaning one has 500 genes the other doesn't have. So you're mixing together things that have no commonality other than the basic core guts of, of genes in the genome. So this is not, I don't think those splicing of things is not what terrifies people. What seems to terrify people is the introduction of things that are not supposed to be in the organic plant. And this is something that, that really bugs people. And the real, the real fear is of disease as of cancers. And there's all these studies that have been done supposedly of rats that got cancer from some sort of round up crap. Like explain that. Okay. So let's, uh, we can go, let's dive into that. So when we're adding genes across, let's say, species or across kingdoms through a laboratory, and that's what people I think are really, uh, get strange about it, really don't understand.

Speaker 2:          00:20:26       Um, this is the part where it's actually terribly simple and we've been doing this since the 1980s introducing them to the plants since the 1980s. I've been studying it since then. And uh, the best example is insulin that the human gene for insulin is cut out of the human genome, placed into a bacterium and then gigantic fermenters of bacteria. So we're talking like an organism that is so different from humans and I then we pull out the insulin and we use this to inject in the patients rather than relying on isolating it from calf or a cow. I'm pancreas, um, where there can be all kinds of allergic reactions and all kinds of other issues. So here we have a source of insulin that's human insulin that's coming through a GMO intermediate that allows humans to live at for a low cost medicine that has no side effects.

Speaker 4:          00:21:15       And there's a bunch of instances of that and aren't there. There's a bar, it's not just insulin that they done with breeding it with bacteria. It's a bunch of other things too. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:21:23       Right. We email the main enzyme for cheese making is called Chi Mohsen. And as a camel gene that's expressed in a bacterium and Hamill gene, yeah, it's a, it seems to be the most efficient at doing the job that Kim Wilson does. Okay. How the hell did anybody ever figured that out? Yeah, you just test everything. You know, you'd try everybody's different. Uh, it, it's one of these enzymes in the gut of um, one of the chambers of the gut of the ruminant stomach. And uh, the camel seemed to have the one that was the most active in vitro cause you can do this test, you put the different enzyme in a test tube and see which one converts the milk into, uh, the cheese stuff faster. And then you were able to, uh, figure out Campbell one just because it's a better enzyme for whatever reason. Now you use that one in bacteria and 95% of cheese, it uses a GMO intermediate. That is

Speaker 4:          00:22:12       insane. How the hell did anybody ever come to the conclusion that a camel would produce

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       best cheese? Yeah, but that's what we do. That's what I do. And that's what my colleagues do. You know, we've got this really cool system of a public universities where we're using money from public funding, from you know, your tax dollars to solve problems like how to make better cheesed less expensively. Um, that's our main thing as a land grant university and a, and so this is, these are the basic science questions that we, that we strive to answer and I think we are doing a good job with. And that's why this GMO thing is so frustrating because we're so down in the Monsanto noise or so under noise that we have solutions that we can't use. So like the camel gene, you know, it, things that we don't think of that we figured out.

Speaker 4:          00:22:59       Is it the, is it because of the name because that name is associated with this big evil corporation that all GMO foods are sort of looked at in this regard. Because I mean people aren't freaking out about camel genes and cheats because they didn't know about it, but everybody knows about g m o s and they instantly connect that to Monsanto and they instantly connect Monsanto to greed. And callousness and Indian farmers committing suicide as we're talking.

Speaker 2:          00:23:26       Oh yeah, we got to come back to that too. Don't let me walk on here. That hidden that. Um, but it, this is the problem though, is that when you look at the real solutions that are there in science, the stuff I care about, you know, Monsanto, if they went away tomorrow, it wouldn't affect the fact that the science is really good. So they're a company that's profiting off of the science. Well, they sell a product of farmers. Farmers want improved crops that dead take in the big deal for farmers. We have 1% of our people in this country are farming to feed and clothe the rest of us. It's such a small amount they're getting by on narrow margins. And when you're talking about the disasters that come from heat waves and floods and everything else, they're operating just by breaking even. And so, uh, farmers who can get improved seeds that maybe don't require an insecticide because the plant makes its own protection.

Speaker 2:          00:24:15       That saves a farmer big bucks in terms of fuel, labor, uh, products that they don't have to spray. And so farmers have adopted the GM technologies faster than cell phones. I mean these were, these went from zero to 95% of acreage and just a couple of years for five crops. So farmers by the crops, Monsanto makes the seeds, Monsanto makes the seeds, the farmers want the seeds and demand more. And that's why Monsanto stays in business. They make a product that farmers use. Um, the Indians. Yeah, Indian farmers committing suicide. What's the story behind that? So the best place to get information on this comes from academic sources. And if you look at Ronald Herring, who is a professor at Cornell University, he's looked at this question very much. Suicide is a major issue in India and it's very common. And now more than ever among young women and certainly is an issue among farmers.

Speaker 2:          00:25:09       Uh, they plant a very risky crop and that's cotton. Cotton is a, is a, uh, difficult to grow crop that in most areas requires lots of water. And if you don't get monsoonal rains, your crop fails. So where this, uh, idea that, uh, Monsanto crops where somehow causing farmer suicides, it comes from the idea that the seeds are more expensive. Farmers go into debt to some degree to buy them, and then when the crop fails, they lose the money. It doesn't have anything to do with Monsanto per se or with those particular crops. The other big issue you have is because these crops, so these are, um, cotton plants that make their own insecticide. They make a protein completely a benign to humans that, uh, protects the plant against the, uh, against the weevils and other critters that burrow into cotton. And so farmers don't have to spray pesticides and, and it's a huge deal because it allows them to farm with fewer without having the cost of, they all want this. So there were many of them want this, they buy the seeds. Now the problem is, is there's a counterfeit seed market where people are selling something that isn't legit and there are the legitimate problems with farmers who have, who commit suicide because of indebtedness. But I don't know how much we can directly blame that on the company or um, or its agents.

Speaker 4:          00:26:27       So if someone buys a Monsanto cotton, say the buy cotton seeds and you grow cotton, that farmer has to make an agreement to not use that cotton to plant more cotton that they have to buy more seeds. Is that not the case? So that's where it gets confusing with people because they're like, well, why? It's a natural process. It's a natural process. If you buy that corn, I mean, and you take that corn and continue to grow corn, that's always been how farmers have done it throughout the beginning of time. Now all of a sudden some company comes along and says, no, we own that corn. We license you that corn. You grow the corn once and then you have to continue to buy seeds from us to grow corn. That was never the case before in human history is one company comes along and demands that. And that was connected to the suicides of these people in India that this is a totally new situation.

Speaker 2:          00:27:20       Actually. He very, very much not a new situation. Um, plant per plant variety protection and protection of plant genetics has been around since the 1930s. And farmers as I mentioned before, had been doing this strictly by using hybrids, which don't yield decent plants in the next generation. So you had the buy him from the company every year more recently. And you, if you wanted to, let's say you bought an apple tree for your apple or apple orchard from Cornell University, the one that Cornell University devised. So we don't even talk about Monsanto. Let's say a a public university. Uh, the apple trees are all propagated by vegetative cuttings. You cut off the little branch, he grow roots on it, grow new tree and you sign a licensing agreement non GMO. But there's things like that, Straw strawberries from University of California, you sign a licensing agreement and what does that entail?

Speaker 2:          00:28:11       It, it says that you will not propagate those plant materials as a farmer, that you'll use them to grow your crop and that when you need more, you'll buy more. And the reason, and when did, when was this done? All these have been done for, for decades and, and it's more and more upon the 70s, the 80s. Like when, when was this built? One of the started started back as long as the 1930s but he wasn't really done very often. You really started to see an escalation of plant variety protection, non Gmo plant variety protection, um, in the last couple of decades.

Speaker 4:          00:28:41       So in the 1930s did they w let's say with apples or something like that, someone, someone figured out a way to selectively breed a really excellent apple. They protected those seeds to the point of view, bought seeds for those apples and planted them. You are not allowed to extract the seeds from the apples that you planted and grow new seeds.

Speaker 2:          00:28:59       So la, but yeah, it's sort of, you couldn't, apples aren't apples are propagated by the cuttings rather than seeds because every seat is a genetic mess. Um, you wouldn't, you can plant an apple eat, buy an apple red delicious apple. You can plant the 20 seeds inside and you're going to get 20 plants that are nothing alike and none of them will have decent fruit. None of them. The ones that have the, the blockbuster traits, and this is why there has to be protection. Uh, for us at University of Florida to grow a, a new orange variety might take 30 years. It might take a acres and acres that costs the university hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to borrow or to lease. Uh, the pest treatments, the fertilizer, the water, the labor,

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       it costs hundreds of thousands, maybe a million dollars to bring that new variety to market and to have to just give it away is it ends a breeding program. So it wouldn't the solution be to publicly fund the research so that the people benefit from it. So instead of a large corporation being able to lock down this perfect orange that you've developed at the University of Florida instead, the taxpayer's dollars, which goes towards the research, creates this beautiful plant that everyone is allowed to benefit from. Well, that's what happens. What happens is that the public good or the, or you know, public research, publicly funded says you get a little dribble of dollars. But our, our breeding programs are very much self sustaining in many cases that you need to commercialize your best selections, are your best fruit in order to be able to keep the breeding program going. So the university has to generate money through its breeding program and then it has to protect that money to ensure that they will continue to receive money, uh, from all the different things they developed in their lab, which will justify the amount of money that you spend on your research.

Speaker 3:          00:30:51       And, and it's not much, I mean we get a tiny bit that comes back in terms of individual, you know, the percentage, it's not much at all, but most of it goes to the breeding programs that allow them to continue to be leading breeding programs and hire people and leased land and produce the next varieties for the public. And the only way to do that as to make sure that people don't take your orange and take the seeds and plant new oranges. And cause if people do illegally propagate this and compete against the nurseries that are doing it legally and selling at the farmers, you have a couple of problems. One is you lose control of the, the product quality. Is it really true to type what people say it is? Um, and farm, the really the beneficiary is the farmer. We make something that the farmer and wants and that the farmer is desperate for our farmers need.

Speaker 3:          00:31:41       And we have a, an orange problem right now in Florida that's coming here. We have 60 million citrus trees that are dying and we're doing everything we can to identify resistant material. Not Gmo, but uh, something called citrus greening disease. Huanglongbing it's a disease. That's a dude. Yeah. Yeah. Seattle is Bruce Lee movie jail. Uh, he was uh, the um, uh, citrus greening disease is a disease of, or the bacteria were bacterium blocks the vasculature of the orange tree and it's spread from tree to tree with something called a [inaudible]. It's an insect and there's Jillions of them and this thing bites one infected tree goes to another and now spreads that bacterium that can live in that tree for five years before there's any symptoms. And then the tree just gets sick and starts to die. Um, we've got an orange industry that is half as big as it used to be and we need a solution. And that's why we're, um, and so if our, it's our breeders are making everything they can to, to

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       generate new trees, uh, accelerating the process, everything they can. And if they can get that new tree after they spent millions of dollars, some of them from the Usda to identify a solution, there has to be a way for some of that funding to come back to the program to invent the next generation so that now we're ready when the next threat comes. So what would be the solution like say if you have some sort of a bacteria that's infecting these, these plants and killing these oranges, what could be a potential solution to that? And will it be the ramifications of you didn't come up with a solution? Yeah, so the, the cool part about this is that being where I am at the university and I'm the chairman of a department that does everything from organic and sustainable, uh, biology all the way through space biology.

Speaker 2:          00:33:24       You see people attacking this from so many ways. We're changing the plants, nutrition or changing just the root stock. So I'm citrus trees are a bunch of routes in us in a science. You Glue together, you graft them together, talk about a Frankenfood. Um, we're building root stocks that can generate resistance to the bacterium so that now when you graft on a scion, maybe it will be resistant. Um, we're doing everything from insect control. We're doing everything from a essential oil treatments, uh, novel drugs that are used in humans and approved for humans being applied to see if they can kill the psyllid ordered an antibiotic or something like, well, um, it's hard to do antibiotics because of the resistance factor that people are resistant to using antibiotics or on trees because they're afraid they'll get. So this is why this is the defensive, weird science environment that we have to work in as public scientists were trying identify compounds that are approved for use in humans or approved for use on food that might have a shot at it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:23       And we're trying everything. The one thing, some of the things that have worked very well, our GMO solutions. And so as a company in Florida that is looking to commercialize a spinach gene in orange that solves the problem, we have a couple of them at the University of Florida for at our Lake Alfred facility where there are genes that directly affect the bacterial growth and uh, they work well and they're not harmful to humans. And the trees are now five years old with no symptoms. So here's an example of a GMO solution. It's not Monsanto. We can't solve this problem with breeding, uh, not easily anyway. And here's something that we can solve this. In five years, thousands of families, thousands of Florida families, thousands of California families are watching. They're watching their groves, waiting for the yellow symptoms to appear. And we have solutions, but people will fight us tooth and nail from applying them. And that's where I's a public scientists. That's why I want to be here to talk to you because I'm looking to appeal to people's intellect to divorce the technology from Monsanto, divorced this technology that that you have in the public sector

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       that can be used to solve public problems that are important. So there's a, there's a tremendous amount of fear that's attached to the subjects. And with that fear there's often very little investigation, which is unfortunate, but it's also very rare to get a person like you to sit down and talk to them and explain this and it takes a long time. And so I really appreciate you being here for this, but there's, there's a lot of fears that people have that are founded in fact and founded in actual consequences like mercy. You know what, Marissa come from it. It's a medication resistant strain of this horrible staph infection that people get, but it's staff. I've had staff, it's horrible, it's nasty. And the, the antibiotics, he take a ruthless and they leave you like a Zombie. The DF. I had a headache. I felt terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       I mean, it was like, it was really weak. I could barely open up a jar of pickles, you know, the feeling, the, the medication has created a resistance to this medication. Bacteria that have survived the result, the medication and have grown stronger because of that. And that is a fear that people were worried about, that there's a balanced in nature and that when you screw around with that balance, there's unintended consequences and oftentimes they can be deadly like Mercer. And this is something that I think people are, I mean, it makes, it gives them cause to worry about someone putting antibiotics in their food, whether it's in their chickens or whether it's in there, which they've started to do less and less of. And I think it was Tyson foods that, um, uh, publicly stated that they were going to significantly decrease their use of antibiotics and try to cut it out entirely because of public concern.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       I think it was Tyson foods. See if that's true. Um, but this is a real concern, right? I mean, doesn't that make sense? That people were worried about that? Well, absolutely. I think, and I'm not so worried about the, that the meat industry in antibiotics, like that doesn't phase me too much, but the idea of Murcia okay. And all of our, uh, resistant bacterial strains that comes because of an overuse of a silver bullet technology. These things come about because the mom has a, a screaming kid who says he must have an ear infection. So I'm in a demand from my doctor that I can get antibiotics. Um, it comes from, uh, you know, those of us saying not taking them correctly, you know, taking them for a few days and then not taking the whole bottle as we're supposed to bill. See, I've been told recently that that's not the case.

Speaker 1:          00:38:01       That that was what they had discussed. They had believed that for a certain amount of time, but now they no longer believe that it's necessary to take a full, uh, that doesn't do anything bad to create a, uh, or to take a shorter dose of it. Okay. I don't know the literature on that, so I'll have to kind of get back to you. So much science I tried to shoot from, you know, the stuff I'm really solid on, but the, the long story short is, is that in, it came up a lot online. If we can segue into that. They talk in the Twitter feed before we talk a lot of concerns about the super weeds issue. And it's the same idea that because

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       the roundup resistant technology has been so successful for farmers that it's what they overuse or they constantly use. Now you see resistant weeds that invade those fields that are resistant to the, to the compound just like in Murcia. Um, and it's from using a silver bullet technology. The reason that that's a problem is because the process to come up with the next generation of, of solution is so arduous and so expensive that we stick with the old technology and we can't come up with something new

Speaker 4:          00:39:06       fast enough. So the silver bullet technology, this antibiotic that we've created to deal with very specific infection infections, it works. It's very effective. So people use too much of it. And because of that, then it creates this medication resistant strain of this and there's not enough research done to fight off that medication resistant strain of it because it's so cost prohibitive to do the, the work to create a medical, a solution in the first place.

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       I think you're right. And I think because the main issue, remember go back to this idea that DNA has natural mutation and natural problems in this replication that give new information in a cell. And when you get that Murcia infection, those cells are dividing every 20 minutes and you have millions of them. And so the chance of one gaining the ability to metabolize your antibiotics is actually pretty good. And when you're talking about billions of cells over many generations, that's where these things come from. It's kind of funny because actually I have an appointment on Wednesday morning because something out of my lab, I have something that looks like it would be a potential ability to make the next generation of mercy. We're actually going to test it on Murcia. Um, and something that I came up with plants that that work process we're patenting that makes new compounds that could be very helpful against other creatures outside of plants.

Speaker 4:          00:40:25       Okay. One of the things that troubles people the most about, um, genetically modified things, whether it's foods or whether it's animals or anything that were messing around with is the potential health risks for the people that consume them. That is a, the biggest problem. Probably the biggest concern. People were worried about cancer and I've seen people tweet this at you. You're a scientist but you're not an oncologist. You're not a cancer expert. You're not dealing with people that get sick from certain things. What evidence if any, is there that medication? Uh, or rather that I'm genetically modified foods cause diseases in people cause sickness and people. Yeah. So this is the, is the

Speaker 2:          00:41:03       big issue. Let's start, let's look at that backwards. We've been growing these things in eating them now for 18 years and studying them a lot longer. 30 in terms of feeding them to animals and everything else. There has not been one case of one single health effect that's been attributed to this. Um, so it looks like it's, I mean, in my perspective, this has got to be, these are some of the safest products in the history of humans. Um, and so we haven't seen anything come out on the other side of this. These are some of the most tested crops in the world. They start on the drawing board. When you say you're going to take a gene that from bacillus thuringiensis bt gene, um, the thing that we use in, it's actually called cry one a or whatever it's called cry is the acronym.

Speaker 2:          00:41:48       We, we'll get into details. You take this gene from the bacteria, a bacterium that's used to protect organic produce. It works fine there and you take that gene, which encodes the protein. So it's the information from the cell that allows the cell to create this protein that targets the gut of a lepidopteran insects. So the Caterpillar of, of certain birds, I'm sorry, not birds, butterflies and moths. And uh, now the plant makes this protein. You can do the tests in vitro. You can say, does this protein affects cells? Does this protein effect animals? When you feed it, does it affect animals that you feed in a tremendously high levels? All those tests are done ad nauseum and this is a natural protein that's digested just like any other protein. So is there any risk

Speaker 4:          00:42:34       at all of messing with food and introducing antibiotics in food, whether it's in the tree of uh, orange, uh, and the, the, you know, is it, is there any risk for humans that consume that?

Speaker 2:          00:42:47       Absolutely. Absolutely. So I have to answer it like a scientist. Okay. All right. You should, you can never say there's no risk. And what we have to say is, is that there's risk in anything we do with genetics, but we live in a time where we have this unbelievable sensitivity to detect something in a plant. We can look at the metabolites that are, we can change. Take a plant as it is, add a gene and see what changes with unbelievable resolution. We can look at every single protein. We can look at, uh, every single gene that's turned on or turned off. We can look at where the gene that's added is integrated. We can understand metabolite profiles are screened for specific carcinogens. It is so easy right now to be able to do a very careful assessment. You know, I'm not in this ballgame to hurt people and farmers aren't either. I mean, they're there. They want to produce wholesome food for people. Um, my job as a public scientist is to use, you know, my ability to dream and think of ideas and solutions for public benefit. You've got tens of thousands of me out there. Uh, the person who found something wrong would win a Nobel prize for it. It's that much of a big deal. If there was something wrong,

Speaker 4:          00:43:59       but to play devil's advocate, sure. If there was some sort of a reaction and 1% of the people are less than what, let's say one 10th of 1% of the people that was deadly, but the company, whether it's the big M or you know, some other company is making $1 billion a year off of this, there would be a tremendous amount of pressure to continue that money flowing. Whether it's through, I'm not saying it's through scientists. I certainly wouldn't think it would be through people like you, but I would think that somewhere locked away in some office high and a gun

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       turret is some evil asshole who owns a giant steak of the corporation and he says like, let them die if they eat our colo care. It's not about money. There's there's that. That's the thought. That's the big worry is that they would hide it. Like you know, the story of GM and the ignorant shit condition switches. A great example. They hid the fact that their ignition switches were faulty and people died and now they're being sued and it's horrible. AndW th that's GM. I mean they made the corvette, they made the Bel Air. I mean this is, how is this possible that people that make Cadillac would be evil? The first two letters of GMO? No. Right. That's the conspiracy. There's also GMT, which is just a time. Yeah. Oh, but the big deal is I, I, and I, I agree with you. Like when you start talking about money, you can look at many examples throughout history.

Speaker 1:          00:45:23       Whether you're talking cigarettes, you're talking, you know, where you see examples where money has bought influence and sure. But the beautiful part of this is that science always wins and that you do find out the truth comes out eventually. And for these companies that are producing these products, in my opinion, and I'm not with these companies, I can't tell you how they think they stand to make a lot more money by making a product that's thoroughly tested and being clean with anything they would find that would be problematic. The other thing that's really important here is that we know, so when you say you're going to move, let's say, uh, now we're gonna move, talk about rice that you can add a jeans too to make it, uh, have high Beta carotene content, higher vitamin eight, kg of golden rice and rice. You know what those genes do cause we studied them and carrots, we understand the products they produce.

Speaker 1:          00:46:13       So there's a plausibility aspect to this too, that when we take this from carrot and put it in rice, what's the difference? Now, maybe there are some differences and we can test for those, but it starts out with the plausibility. This isn't magic and Voodoo and weird back room. My, you know, let's, let's see what this lever does. So the idea is that if you eat carrots and rice together as food, that's not much different than splicing carrots and rice together and likely if you're not allergic to either one of those things, you're not going to be allergic to this rice though. You create. Absolutely. And even if you are allergic to carrots, taking one gene out of it that doesn't have a immunological footprint. And then on a antigenic footprint in, in humans, uh, like the jeans associate with Beta carotene production don't have, you'd be able to move those into rice and have no problem.

Speaker 1:          00:46:59       That's a good point. The, the point of allergic, because biodiversity is, is, is a huge issue when you're talking about foods in general, that some people have extremely different reactions, whether it's to peanuts or to shellfish or to a variety of things that most of us enjoy. But there's a few people that have severe reactions is very same thing and this is natural, completely, totally natural. Um, this is the question when it comes to certain types of, if you're dealing with these outliers, if you're dealing with this one 10th of 1% of the population where this, this chemical reaction happens inside their body, completely natural. Um, we, should we stop the production of peanuts? Should we stop the production of shellfish? I say, fuck no, I love peanuts and I love shrimp. But if you're dealing with a medication that does the exact same thing and reacts with the bio diversity of the exact same percentage of the population and could potentially be fatal like shellfish, Ken, like peanuts can be fatal.

Speaker 1:          00:48:04       People have died from them. Um, what do we do about that? Yeah, and this is, this is actually the dilemma, right? Well, it is, but it in a way, it's a dilemma that this kind of trenchgenic or GMO technology can solve. Um, what's really interesting about that is we know what the food allergen proteins are very well. Uh, you know that the protein and peanuts, the proteins and soy, the proteins in wheat that cause, um, uh, that cause allergies and you can turn those off and make them go away. I'm using transgenic technology and it's been done. We have allergy free peanuts in the lab. So there's peanuts that people have commercially available. No, no, because people are afraid of this stuff. This is what kills me. Oh, here we are making solutions. We have, there's wheat that still makes decent bread where the gluten and Gilad or the glutens are the gladden and the other one lieutenant had been shut off.

Speaker 1:          00:48:55       Um, it still makes decent bread. You'd have soy that you can decreased specific allergens. We know what the allergens are in food and can turn them off and sometimes it makes the plant a little different or makes the product that, you know, like the wheat when you take out the major glutens, it could change the bread structure, but it still seems that the other ones kind of ramp up to, to compensate. So we can make a better product using this technology. But we exist. I mean, these things exist. Show they're not, they're not, uh, some wild fantasy of the future. It's just that they would never be deregulated because of the costs. And because the industry is associated with them, the peanut industry says, no way. We don't want people boycotting peanut butter just so just have a few kids, you know, have problems with the allergy instead.

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       To me, that's a total injustice that drives me crazy. So you feel like this could all be eradicated. Um, but in nature, these things are radicating and in a much more disturbing way and nature of the people that are allergic to peanuts eat them and die and it's no longer expressed in, in the genetics. That's, that's the natural method of doing it. The, the concern with any of these Jamal genetic modifications to the lay person, which I am most certainly lay, um, is that you are creating something that shouldn't be there, but you are creating something and you don't want the consequences of this. Like the wings of the butterfly and the create the hurricane. You know, that stupid fucking, that shit drives me crazy. That's not how goddamn hurricane is made. Assholes. Water flies. Don't make hurricanes. Shut the fuck up. No, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       It's a chain of events. It's no, it's not. No. It's fucking weather system. It has to do with the planet. It has to do with the atmosphere. It has to do with magnetics and us do a lot of different shit. It doesn't have to do with butterflies. And See, that's exactly it. We can sit around all day and talk about, well, what are the unintended consequences? And you get this all the time. What are the, what if? What if? What if, and I can tell you that today on June 4th, 2015, 20,000 people are going to die because of insufficient nutrition. That's a problem that I can tell you exists. I can tell you that kids will have allergic reactions to peanuts. Here. I can tell you that there are 60 million, uh, citrus trees dying and these are problems Monsanto is going to fix. These are problems that I need to fix, that guys like me, people like me need to fix.

Speaker 1:          00:51:12       And we're being handcuffed by an irrational fear of a good technology. And do you think that this irrational fear of a good technology comes about because of what they consider to be a greedy corporation? So there's fear of greedy corporations because we, like we talked about with GM, I mean we could talk about, we could talk about other corporations that have moved into, uh, countries that are poverty stricken and taken over and abused their natural environment. And that we associate money with WWE, especially corporate entities with this idea of constantly needed to make more money every year to justify what they're doing to their shareholders. I mean, this is the reality of these businesses, these infinite growth businesses. And we associate them with callousness. We associate them with not caring about the people who work for them or the people that they affect in the environments that they build their plants.

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       And this is one of the main concerns that people have, is the diffusion of responsibility that comes with being a part, a single piece of a large entity that has ultimately doing at least some bad, right. No, I understand that. You know, and as in the old punk rock guy and he says that your, wait a minute, hold on. Slow on. You were an old punk rock guy. Yeah, I played in a, yeah, I played the guitar for insane war tomatoes for a, for awhile. Yeah. Insane Ward tomatoes did send me, sent me a little insane more tomatoes. How did it go? Like, oh well our best ones were called Iraq. You suck a rock. Yeah, we had a, we did Tom called spirit of Elvis where a giant dancing dead. Elvis would come out on stage. And uh, and uh, did you get the name? Uh, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       I know it was, it was a, there was we, while we were called dangling units, but then someone already had that. So it was, it's kind of spinal tap. So we were in saint [inaudible] tomatoes. We were the coolest band that no one ever knew of. Fucking video. No. El Yeah, there you go. High Rock. You suck. Oh, that's just longer. So in this you'll sure that's, I live in an asshole. I like how you didn't say the word cause you're respectable now. Well, I am a professor. I know. This'll do. What did you do in this band? I played guitar for maybe the first few years and then switched over to bass. Did you sing it all? Uh, I think you can hear me up right here.

Speaker 3:          00:53:25       I do. I have a little thing here

Speaker 5:          00:53:30       coming up in a second here. Kind of Motorhead he before. Well, not bad. This is good workout music. This is me here where you jumped in there and then here. That's you. Yeah, that was me. What year was this?

Speaker 3:          00:53:54       No, this was a 1989 maybe 88 how old were you back then? Uh, I don't know. 22 I was 20. 22 how old are you now? 48 yeah. So we, and we played all over the place. We did a lot in, uh, in Wisconsin. We were real big and we had the costumes we had. I'm like, I had a Gene Simmons outfit that I wore with gigantic high shoes and the guy who was the singer dressed as a tomato and lit himself on fire and it was before great white, um, wow. Uh, all homemade gas pyrotechnic show, she was fantastic. And the eight people that came to see us loved it. You got eight, we've got eight and they were all put in. The best part was we would pound our audience with uh, produce at the end. We throw tomatoes at him. Will you will involve in, in agriculture back then?

Speaker 3:          00:54:41       Um, not really. I was, I see. I haven't even been until very recently. I was a basic scientist. I studied the nuts and bolts of DNA and nuts and bolts of plant physiology. And um, but at this time, if you're 22 back then, you presumably had gone to college already. And were you studying agriculturally? What was the connection to tomatoes and people throwing vegetables at you? Oh, it was that just luck? No, just coincidentally it was cheaper than throwing jars of pickles was and, and uh, but you know what I'm saying? Produce was involved in your, even in your punk rock. So we've gone full circle. Yeah. It's odd. I didn't have an egg. That's a coincidence. More than, because it's a funny one, isn't it? That's a good thing. I didn't want to study reproductive physiology, I guess, you know, throw ovaries at the, but we'd be the best thing that could throw, I would think.

Speaker 3:          00:55:28       Dick's. Yeah, but, but going back to answer your question, but, so, so the guy in me who, who doesn't, who hates his cable company, who hates his, you know, the people who sell them gas, all that stuff. Um, I look at companies like Monsanto and others as being the way that farmers who are my real clients are enabled. And, uh, so whether or not I like who they're buying it from, there, the folks who are the ultimate beneficiaries of the technology. And the other thing that's really, um, uh, and so the other exciting thing for me is when the small companies can use something like GMO technology to gain a unique market niche, like a Oakenoggen specialty fruits. They make this apple that doesn't turn Brown when you cut it and they have four full time employees. Are they from Oregon? They're from um, Washington State Canada. Is that, what is Oakenoggen mean? Does that, uh, a location or an Indian word? Yeah, I think it's both. I think

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       it's uh, but they, um, they grow, they have this apple that when you cut it doesn't Brown, which is a great trait. It uses an apple gene to turn off an apple gene and a, in other words, the GMO modification puts this gene in backwards so it shuts off the, in the innate con, uh, construct DNA a gene. It turns off that gene. And then, uh, the apple doesn't Brown when you cut it, which is a great trait if you want to have apples and process products or apples as, you know, sliced apples in bags or whatever. Uh, four full time employees. So my whole thing is go ahead and hit your Monsanto march against him, whatever. I don't care. But do you realize that when you dress like a B and lay on the ground and go into convulsions and say that this is biotechnology that's bad, that now you're affecting the people who would buy that apple, the people who I would come up with a solution for, for the the people who need bananas and Uganda or the people who eat rice and southeast Asia that needed more nutritious rice that by mixing together biotechnology and agriculture and conflating that with companies and things companies did or didn't do, you automatically take technology out of the hands of the people who in the people in the solutions that we care about how things like the environment, things like farmers, things like the needy.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       We have those solutions. And that's the thing that just by the, by the Monsanto phobia is dangerous. Well, I think a good part of what the problem is, it can be attributed to the, the idea of people not being responsible for actions because they're part of a collective group being concur. Completely unnatural. And I think that if people had actual PR, if the idea of a corporation was, uh, was not that that corporation would be immune to the actual people being involved in that corporation wouldn't be immune to responsibility for everything that the corporation does. And it's one of the reasons why businesses get an LLC, right? Uh, limited, whatever it is, corporation, the idea is to protect you somehow or another creates some sort of legal definition of you that's different than you outside of a corporation, which is weird. You know, it's like people, you're, you're a fucking dude.

Speaker 1:          00:58:34       Okay? If you're a dude, if you call yourself Kevin Folta Llc, I'm still talking to you, man. You're right here you sit. You're the same guy. But if you do something under the guise of your corporation, there's a completely different legal ramification than if you do something on your own, like bankruptcy, things on those lines. You're not as responsible for debts. I think that might be the problem though. The problem might be like, I know that you're a decent person and a nice person and I know that what you're trying to do is noble and just and true and in the vein of science, I I 100% believe that. I think that what people worried about is when someone like you gets to working for some big giant group. This is why people keep saying that you're some sort of a shell or that other foot, let's say take you out of the equation, but other folks that are working for Monsanto, they're doing and they're money, but the corporations give a fuck about people.

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       That's what we have to stop. We have to stop this idea that a bunch of people together collectively can do something that's really unethical and they can do it and ruined in natural environments and not be responsible like the BP oil spill. I mean everybody knows there was all kinds of fuckery and shenanigans that went on to protect the people that were involved from that BP oil scandal. Those people that had been profiting in insane sacrilegious amounts of money for a long period of time. When it came time to pony up that money and clean that fucking mess up, boy, did things get weird? You know, boy did things get legal and complicated and people were giving nondisclosures to sign to make exorbitant monies for clean up and people were paid off and there was a lot of fuckery involved. That is what people worry about when it comes to genetically modified foods.

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       What we're worried about is the, the method of action that corporations have been proven to take. That is to protect the corporation as a it, as a unit, and to do so an act collectively in a way that you would never act as an individual. No, I agree Joe. But I guarantee you that 90% of the people that went to march against Monsanto drove a car that used oil that may, it came out of a BP. Well, sure. And so here's an example though. You know, go ahead. Hate a corporation, but they're still using the products and uh, and no one's trying to shut off. No one's going to the gas station and knocking the pump out of my hand when I would go to stick it in my car. Yet there are people who would feel very comfortable depriving farmers have the right to buy the seeds that they choose.

Speaker 1:          01:00:55       And so for, to me, again, if there's a social business issue here that needs to be remedied, there's gotta be another mechanism to do that. And I'm fine with that. Go ahead. Hate any company you want. All I'm saying is, let's not talk about that. It's not put out the, the bullshit that says that Gmos caused cancer. Gmos are causing autism. That the uh, uh, the herbicides associated with it are cause autism. All of that is crazy talk. That takes us out of our problem solving mode. It distracts from what the good things that we can do with technology. What is collective evolution.com? Is that a, is that a reputable website? Not so much there, there one that has a, they, they're also one that isn't really, uh, excited about, uh, biotechnology and other corporate stuff. I mean like nation, a change. There's a whole bunch of them and I read those things and I would say 50 to 60% of the stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:01:48       I'm right there with Ya. You know, I'm a politically a lefty. I'm a American college professor. You know, I, um, I love seeing social justice. I love seeing a social progress. I love those kinds of, I mean it's stuff that I fight for, but these are examples where I see the technology that can actually enhance those things and that we can wrestle it away from the big corporations if we only stopped making a fabricating information about them. Yeah. Well obviously this doesn't have anything to do with social justice or anything. Um, but there, there's this study linking

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       Gmos to cancer, liver, kidney damage and severe hormonal disruption, disruption in rats. Right? Uh, that was one of the collective evolution had written a story about, well, they covered it just like everyone else did. And what is, what was the study and what, what's wrong with the study? I think they're mixing together two different studies there. Um, but the main one was one done by Sara Leeny in 2012 and they used a limited number of rats, which are called Spragg Dawley rats, the rats that are good cancer models because they're prone to cancers. And so as you're testing different compounds against them, you'll have a model which is a at least susceptible to developing tumors. And so if you're testing the, the toxicity of different compound compounds, you would use this rat strain. The problem is that by two years into the study, 75% of the rats have, or 77% have tumors.

Speaker 3:          01:03:11       So Sara Leeny chose this to do a two year study. He showed that the rats got tumors and in in the paper they even show in the table two in the control aisle that even the controls got tumors look at the same amount of tumors. Well, they, it statistically, yes, I mean they, they showed fewer. But you know, when they talk about like, you know, they talk about five versus eight versus nine, um, statistically the numbers were too small to say that that was a significant difference. So when you say five, eight or nine, you mean percent or number rod and out of how many? 20. Okay. So that could be just an issue with the particular group of rats you had as opposed to you would have to do a much larger study to get a good baseline. Is that what he was in the statistical noise?

Speaker 3:          01:03:55       So 20 rats seems like a real low number to test things. Almost 200 overall. But it was broken into groups for this. But the main thing in this though and the place that really colors it for me and I don't know, do you have the picture of the lumpy rats on your screen? No, I'm sure it's in your show. Know the famous picture of the three Loci rats. Um, note that the author's show, three rats, one that got GMO food, one that got roundup, one that got GMO food plus roundup and they call it GM. Oh by the way, which scientists would never do. We'd put in the transgene name, the neglect to show you the control rat edge control. Rocco fucked up too. Well, insignificant number of them did. But if you show us, but I can, how do they, how do they, what do they do, you know, how do they show that picture of these grants that are grotesquely malformed?

Speaker 3:          01:04:45       Which if my lab rats go to that, yeah. There they are. If my lab let rats get to that stage or any, any lab in the United States, let their rats get to that stage, they'd be shutdown. That's animal abuse, um, to, it's inhumane treatment of animals. Is it? Well, I mean, that's something that I feel pretty strongly against. I, I, I really severely disliked the idea of testing things on animals in the first place. But it seems that that's where a lot of the big improvements in medicine have come from. It's a real moral dilemma. I mean, I

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       think using animals, especially intelligent animals, like I'm, I'm, I saw a fucking seaworld commercial this morning. They made me want to throw a Mug at my TV and they were talking about how happy these whales are in a fucking swimming pool and this guy's like, our whales are happy and we love them. Like, fuck you. You do. We haven't stolen a whale from its family and over 30 years. It's like a slave colony telling you how these people been born. Slaves. Don't worry about it. They're happy being slaves. We loved them here. If you had that exact same Goddamn seaworld commercial and you had it about human beings, you would think those people would be thought of as some of the most evil Fox on the planet. But they don't think of Orcas as human beings. Even though we'll have a cerebral cortex, a 40% larger than a human beings, even though they have dialects, they have a bunch of different words for all sorts of things.

Speaker 4:          01:06:06       And we didn't even understand what they're saying. They have super complex methods of communication. They're very human. Like we, they deals don't alter their environment. So because they don't all turn their environment and they can't smile at us, you don't have articulating lips. We choose to think of them as being inferior to us. And it's acceptable to have them in a fucking swimming pool, you know? And I think that's dark. And I think that's really evil. And I think one day when we figure out a way to interpret what they're saying and have like a Google translate for killer whales, it's going to be a mess. Seaworld, they're going to go to jail immediately. I don't even wanna watch him, man. It's fucking horrible. We love them. Fuck you. You do. I don't love them. If you love them and they were people, you'd let them go.

Speaker 4:          01:06:48       I figure out a way to let them go. You fucks. I even look at zoos when I go to zoos and you'll see that Cheetah, this damn thing is supposed to be running 75 miles an hour after an antelope and it's sitting there laying on a shelf exam and all its reward system. It's genetic reward systems are there. They're not satisfied like a, like a lion killed a woman and the woman who is a game of Thrones expert editor to hear about this, she was at a surf park and the fucking hard irony of it is she's a conservationist. She loves these animals and she, she wanted to take photos of them and she wants to protect them from poachers and she left the window, open the fucking lion. God her jumped in the cage, uh, jumped into the car and pulled her out and killed her in front of everybody.

Speaker 4:          01:07:32       And it's, it's, it's horrible. It's horrible, horrible thing. But that's what lions do. I mean, that is their reward system. That's why they're here in 2015, they have a Predator prey reward system. That reward system isn't being recognized at all in zoos. That's one thing. One aspect of their life. It is probably as satisfying and is primal is intercourses to them and they're not being allowed to express it. And that's a fucked up thing. I mean, zoos are, I don't care what anybody says, they're doing all this great work to do all this great work. They're doing it the wrong way. They're doing it the wrong way. You know, it's just, you can't lock a monkey in a fucking cage and people just stare at it. That's gotta be torture for that little thing. There's a monkey had, I think it was the Colorado, the

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       one that I think it was Colorado. I forgot which is do, it might've been the one in Griffith Park, but whatever the fuck it is, there's a monkey that was howling like a, a like a mad man. He was just holding onto his cage going

Speaker 6:          01:08:30       just

Speaker 1:          01:08:30       screaming into the night. And you're like telling me that's any different than some guy in a psych ward who's trapped in aliens with giant fucking watermelon sized eyes are staring at them all day. How is that any different? It's not, it's not. I agree. I mean I have a hard time with, especially with mammals, like I can't, I don't, I choose not to get involved in that. I know there's, uh, you know, educational aspects of zoological terror. Um, and you know, turtles. Maybe I don't freak out so much about, you don't seem to give a fuck. Oh, they kind of like it. I mean, you know, it's like a food water brings or that, that doesn't seem to get too weird, but I can get it to chimps and shit. Even big cats. You just see those things that bears, I had a joke about it though that some animals, the zoo doesn't seem to bother and lecture graphs to Raf don't seem to mind at all.

Speaker 1:          01:09:17       Like they let them feed babies because the joke was that their drafts to like another day with no lions and the like, if somebody came up to a giraffe and said, listen man, um, I'm going to give you free food, there's going to be no predators whatsoever, but you can't walk as far. They'd be like, fuck yeah, let's do this. Because it's the giraffes life is goddamn terrifying all day. So for giraffes, the zoo doesn't really seem to bug them. Like, especially if you go to like San Diego, which has an awesome wildlife park, it's huge. Like as far as zoos grow, that places top of the food chain because that place gives them enormous spaces. But again, the predators aren't allowed to express being a predator. You know, we, there was an Iraqi zoo footage, see if you could find this. They let it go loose and an Iraqi zoo and this is how they feed their lions and soldiers.

Speaker 1:          01:10:02       This is how soldiers film this at the beginning of the war and they just, they just have a goat and the goat. It's fucking Triassic park. The goat is just a lead out of this gate and the goat walks up and the lions realize that the goat is there and then wound. They're all on them and they tear this fucker apart. Yeah. That's how zoos are supposed to be. That's what his God damn zoos should be. What we're doing is bullshit. You give them a plate of meat. You know, we're at a zoo, Portugal on. My wife and I were there a few years ago. I was there for a conference and we went to their zoo. It's a really nice zoo. The zoo in Lisbon and one of the monkeys, you know the big cage full of monkeys, like a million of them in there. I was like 30 or 40 monkeys in one cage and then one of them comes out between the bars and starts walking around.

Speaker 1:          01:10:45       They just came out of the cage while walking around. And you know, it was pretty funny because all the parents are letting their kids touch it and stuff. Jesus Christ, bad bed, primate decision, you know that's a sh. Yeah, you're the dummy, not the monkey. No, here it is. Look at this. These, these goats, they just opened the door and they let him out and then they released the lines. They open this gate and the lines just come Sharjah and then, cause they know exactly what the fuck is going on. And you know, Eh, I remember people watching it saying that it's cruel.

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       This, the reason why you think it's cruel is because we have been sheltered in some weird way to think that our way of living should be imposed on animals. And that's crazy. That's crazy thinking. The idea that you should give a look at this, the lines just jump out and boom, they take these goats down and they all jump in. They all know what they're doing. This is what they do every day and this is how they eat. But the idea that this is somehow brutal, God dammit, this is what it's called being a cat. This is what cats do. What you're doing is brutal by giving them pre cooked meat. They're not allowing them to express this charge. They must get the bond and community that they generate together because of killing and surviving off that kill together. Human beings have it and I guarantee that lions have that as well. And you're not allowing them to bond in the same way. So part of establishing the pecking order in the communities as well, who is the better hunter? Learn from that hunter. Look how he bites that neck. You know, they all, they all learn from each other. They, they, the mothers teach the babies how to fight. They teach them at a trip things and chase things. How do they, they play with each other. You know, they, they trip each other just like they want a trip game and we don't, we don't allow that. It's fuck

Speaker 3:          01:12:29       now nature is cruel. I mean it's the way it, the way it works,

Speaker 4:          01:12:32       it's more cruel to not let them express their nature. This idea that you feeding them an animal that somebody killed nowhere near the cat is somehow or another more ethical than letting the animal kill the cat or the cat kill the animal.

Speaker 3:          01:12:44       It's true. It's just fucking idiotic. It's a crazy picture. This video rather, it's just, that's what they do, man. Well, don't say the Iraqi's never gave us anything and that they gave us a little bit of that. But do you think that there is, there's an ethical way to do tests on animals that would satisfy everybody almost? Is there a way, I mean, what, what ethical way would there even be? Yeah, I think, well, it then, and I think we have to go back, and this isn't my area by any stretch, but animal testing is a really important part of biology and really important part of pharmacology. Um, when you look at how animals are used as drug models, like round, right now we have, we have animals like mice that express or don't express a gene associated with brain function that we know is impaired say with als in humans.

Speaker 3:          01:13:35       So essentially we have these mice that will develop als. So now you can use compounds to see what solves that problem. You can build these models or f cancer models are many in animals where you have these animals that are predisposed to specific kinds of cancers or ailments that now allow us to do testifying them. And I think that's a really important role for this, that, uh, that animals can help us identify problems that help the human condition, which then can help us help animals. Is there a way to do it though that's going to make everybody happy? I don't think there is one of those things we have to say we're better than you. Well, or, or that we have to say that these are a, that this is a, it's just

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       like when we raise animals to eat them, I guess. I mean, we're, uh, it, it's, it's, there's a purpose for these animals that we bring them into our provision. We raised them humanely and we are various, and these animals that are in these drug experiments by definition have to be very carefully, uh, um, uh, they have to be happy. They have to be as happy as you can be in, you know, as a rat in a cage that happy well because there's physiology that's involved. And if you start seeing, if you have rats that are living in conditions that are subpar or animals that are mistreated, they won't give you adequate results from your experiments that you need to have incredible control with animals that are well cared for and a, and give you a solid physiological baseline where the only way, the only information being introduced is through your treatment.

Speaker 1:          01:15:00       Do you know, uh, being a speciesist is, have you ever been accused of being a speciesist? I got a feeling I will be shortly. This is speciesist thinking the thinking that you and human life is more important than other animals.

Speaker 2:          01:15:16       Yeah. No, it it, I don't know if that's necessarily the case that were more important, but we certainly have more faculties to be able to control the hours outcomes

Speaker 1:          01:15:25       of certain situations, but of rats were smarter than us then decided to do tests on humans. It would really suck, wouldn't it? So screw them, let's, we're not very smart, right? I mean, we're very smart for, for other animals, but we're not very smart in terms of, there's a lot of shit that human beings do that we probably shouldn't do collectively, like pollution, destruction of the environment, so on, so forth, proliferation of nuclear weapons that that's not smart. There's a lot of stupid shit that we do. So I think that we're incredibly smart for being an animal, but we're not necessarily smart in terms of the universal potential of intelligent life. We're not, we're idiots. That's why, I mean it's like there's a million fucking arguments you could make all day long. The gay marriage thing, the marijuana thing, the war thing, there's just so many stupid contradictions.

Speaker 1:          01:16:09       The way human beings exist and live their lives. If there was something that was far more intelligent than not. It's like as intelligent as we are to pigs or as we are to things that we think are smart, like dogs are fairly smart. What come test would they do to us? You know, you ever think of that doesn't know. I never really think about that very much. I guess the analyst Lady sees this. Yeah. There's only one way to get that smart. You've got to fucking keep fucking pink pigs and let the coolant, I think that he wouldn't needles and shit. The main idea is that we've, uh, we've evolved as a species for a long time away from our common ancestors. You know, the other primate ancestors because of our ability to control situations and because we make decisions that ended more favorable outcomes for whatever reasons, those are for us.

Speaker 1:          01:16:51       And so even though we're not, even though we do a lot of dumb stuff, and I'm with you on that, I think we do an awful lot of smart stuff too. And I think the human capacity to create change that's favorable for humans is, is immense. Maybe you can do your own documentary. You know how Al Gore had that one, the inconvenient truth about uncomfortable truth and the uncomfortable truth being you got to crack some eggs to make an omelet and a, there's a lot, there's a lot going on and try to keep human beings alive and sometimes you have to make a decision. I forgot who Nick Depaulo, one of my buddies, hilarious standup comedian had some joke, I don't want to fuck the joke up, but it was about, uh, doing tests on a monkey to find, you know, to cure aids. And it was fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          01:17:33       But he is, I don't, I don't, I don't remember how the joke went, but it was something about battery cables and it was very funny. But the idea of being, it's like, yeah, yeah. I'm saying I'm more important than a monkey. I'm saying my mom who's dying of cancer is more important than a rabbit. I'm saying that, I'm saying that a rat is not as important as my children. I said it. Sorry, I'm a speciesist. No. But, and, and, and I think that human progress has shown that sometimes the pendulum swings swings a little bit too far the other way, you know, we can think of examples. Um, but yeah, as soon as, again, as soon as you look at instead of whether it's money or the results being more important than the actions of the individual and the actions of the individual not being ethical, not that's not important.

Speaker 1:          01:18:15       What's important as a results, that's when we run into problems. But that's, and so even the circle it back then, you know, this is why being a scientist is so cool is because I'm bound by data and I'm bound by a hypothesis that I test using the best available tools. And being a public scientist is really cool that the people who choose to do this like me, and there's a lot of them in this country. We are really operating in the public's trust, in the public's best interest. And I think that when we see, um, uh, unethical behavior, when we see, um, um, let's say, uh, interpretations of data, which suggests that maybe we're going the wrong way, these things are caught in the peer review process. These things are caught when our grants are evaluated and they're debated in the scientific literature. And so when we making steps in progress, these are very careful guarded, um, uh, uh, reviewed rereviewed steps that we're doing as, as a public science enterprise.

Speaker 1:          01:19:14       And this is what's why I wish we had more support. Um, I'm not here to complain about that. Um, I wish we, and that, you know, people say that, you know, oh, you're from Monsanto and we, you know, we're, we get nothing compared to what they have. I mean, we're a university, we get something like 3% of our support for corporate entities. Everything else comes from grants that we go out and get. And so this, this is what's so important about having an active public science enterprises to keep all that other stuff in check. I think it's also important to try to understand the whole process that's involved in, in science that the average person who doesn't have background in it, the average person who didn't take science other than the classes where we dissected frogs and high school, it's, there are ignorant of the process there.

Speaker 1:          01:19:59       You know, the process that creates this data and, and they don't understand where we are, where we come from and what we go through. Um, if you talk to anybody, they'll tell you, well, you know, universities are just paid off by the companies and the companies, but somehow that sometimes that's the case, right? Well we'll, universities do have contracts frequently with companies. Um, it happens all the time, but that's because we're the experts in other fields. It's a much bigger issue financially. Like it's been a big issue in the setting of regulations for the stock market and things like that the people did at university. You know what I'm talking about? Those, uh, economics professors who have made recommendations and then wound up getting these huge jobs with the banks after it was over for millions of dollars. And that's wrong too though. I think what's really important though is that a lot of the companies, pharmaceutical companies will come to a medical school and say, we need you to do this clinical trial because you are the experts.

Speaker 1:          01:20:48       You're the ones who know this. We trust you. And if it doesn't work, you give better. Tell us no one's giving us money to make them happy. No one's telling me. And this, this one pisses me off all the time because out of everybody you meet in science, you know, there's so many of us that really do claim to have integrity as a first level. Um, I would never do something because the company told me to do it or because a company paid me to do it. The punk rock and you would not, that's right. You fight that power. Oh, I fight the power. No, because, because seriously, at the end of the day, you know, I'm not a religious guy. I'm not, I don't believe that there's some great reward for me. Um, you know, what I'm leaving here is, is a, a legacy, you know, like a product of, of my work and my record and I don't want that tarnish.

Speaker 1:          01:21:34       I believe you 100% and I'm, I'm, I'm certainly not questioning that. I want to tell everybody if you, the thing I was saying about mathematics professors, you should watch a documentary called inside job or an inside job. It's all about the financial crash. It's fantastic. It's really, really, really, really well done. Documents that, but people aren't worried about people like you. You seem to be a great guy. What they're worried about is evil scientists. That's what fucks up every science fiction movie. Did you see 28 days later, no, 28 days later and one of the greatest Zombie movies in the history of the known universe. My personal favorite starts out because of a medication that was created, something called rage. I forget what, why they created it for soldiers or something like that. It infects these chimps and then these chips get it. They bite people, the people get it, and then be the Zombie outbreak takes over the world.

Speaker 1:          01:22:23       And kills everybody except for a few cool human caterpillar. Yeah. Well this, um, that's different. But this a, I think you mean senopy human centipede. Yeah. Don't watch that. Don't, that's different. Um, now this is a, this is a fucking awesome movie. Human centipede was a goof science, Fun, evil science, but he was an evil sign. Yeah, that's a good point. But the 28 days later was about a medication that they had intended for human beings and it went terribly wrong. Well that's, that's the kind of scientist that people were worrying about. People were worried about the evil people that are creating. I mean, look, there have been scientists that have created a weaponized drugs or weaponized a biological weapons rather, that they can use on people's, you know, certain, I mean,

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       those are created by scientists like poisons that have killed untold numbers of people were also created by scientists. So absolutely not just guys like you were worried that people are worried about people that are way fucking smarter than them that might be plotting some evil shit. Yeah, that's happened. Well, it's happening. And then you look at, people always bring up in the GMO discussion. Agent Orange, yes. Which is an herbicide called two, four D and a number of herbicides were combined and there was this whole rainbow of herbicides. It call your agent Ballou agent Green Agent Orange was this two, four d stuff, two, four, five t there they're what they call synthetic auxins. They make plants grow to death basically. And the government was able to weaponize a legitimate product for a warfare and nothing to do with an evil scientists necessarily, but it was implementation potentially by people who had an agenda to be able to, uh, expose an enemy in a jungle atmosphere.

Speaker 3:          01:24:00       Um, along with the purification of those products. Two, four, five t, um, was the main one was dioxin, which is what kit which would killed people in her arms, harmed, harmed our own soldiers. That is one of the scariest things about human beings that were willing to kill your whole forest to find you just stop and think of how fucked that is. We're looking for a man. We can't find them. We're going to kill. Everything was going to kill every fucking tree, every Bush, everything. We're going to kill the whole forest and flush them out. Yeah. The daisy cutter, you know, basically, you know the chemical daisy cutter. God, that's so crazy that someone, okay. Dot. Someone said, yeah, you can ruin the entire ecosystem. Yeah. Go and go there and kill everything that moves so that our boys can go in there and kill the people that are hiding in it.

Speaker 3:          01:24:45       But this was a, but this is an an an interesting example that here you had something that a rather a really great scientist came up with. Arthur Gauston came up with two, four, five, two, four d to control plant growth and control weeds. And it's a relatively useful compound that we've had for 70 years. But yet people will say, you're using agent orange on corn. You know, we're not using agent orange. Here's a, it's a growth regulator that was part of Agent Orange that humans decided to weaponize against other humans. So the, that was, that was the created first. And then human beings took this and said, well, there's some sort of a weaponized application of this very beneficial discovery. Right. And then in, in a, in a compound that can be used safely in an agricultural context and has been since the 1940s, see, against not people worrying about the scientists are worried about the evil people that control the scientists and take that stuff and turn it into this and then spray it in Vietnam. Yeah. If it, but we can't go forward worrying about the, about the small number of evil people that might be out there cause they're going to do it there. You know, there's always going to be some guy who finds a way to, to, so Obama knew his underwear, but that doesn't mean we outlaw underpants. You know, we have to, we could. Um, but, but the idea is, is that we need to think about what the science allows us to do and not about the, I mean,

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       certainly be aware of malevolent uses. Um, people could genetically engineer viruses and I, I believe I've heard about the Russians doing the sit back in the, during the Cold War days to, uh, say engineer a antibody that would attack Human Myelin, which is the stuff that covers your nerves so that you could essentially infect people with a virus that would kill them because of paralyze them. These kinds of things were discussed and biological agents and biological weaponry is there, but as it has power in that dimension, I think that the main conversation here is, is really how do we take the same technology and use it for good? Essentially what we're talking about is really what I was saying before is that I think a lot of your hate comes from people that are terrified that they don't understand what's going on. You know, and that's me. I've, I've been into that, but I asked a lot of questions and I, I trust you.

Speaker 1:          01:26:55       So I go, all right, it seems to make sense. But realistically, when you're talking to me about the expressions of genes, my brain has just gone. Those are a bunch of noises that represents some things I don't totally understand. Well, let's talk, well, let's talk about things that we can make talk about. No, no, no, no, no, no idea. Not saying that there's anything wrong with it. I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I guess I'm kind of giving you an opportunity to say what are things that you care about that I could fix or scientists could fix? Like what are some, what are some concerns about food that you, um, the interview interviewee becomes the interviewer. Um, what, what are some things that you would worry about in terms of food or maybe food abundance or, you know, what would you like to, abundance is always a big concern for everybody, especially when you look at parts of the world where you see these.

Speaker 1:          01:27:40       Like I have a good friend named Justin wren. He comes on the podcast and he, uh, used to fight in the UFC and now he works in the Congo building wells. He's an amazing God. And he does this thing called fight for the forgotten. And he goes to the Congo and he did it with some money that viewers generated to, they built a bunch of wells that are listeners of the podcast generated through bitcoin and then I matched the donation and he built these wells. He's just this guy, guys dedicated his whole time to doing that, to give these people clean water like that. I think maybe that's not even scientific other than the ability to, somebody obviously had to invent these water pumps and filters and figure out how to make these, these wells portable and functional. The, that's really what needs to be done.

Speaker 1:          01:28:25       We need to figure out a way to take the worst parts of the world and bring them to a higher standard of living and give people the opportunity to not live on dirt floors with a drinking muddy puddle water. Yeah. You know, I mean the fact that that it takes a guy like Justin to go down to the Congo and dedicate his life to that and a bunch of other brave people that are doing the exact same thing, but that country's never talk about it. They'll talk about all sorts of issues that are going on in the environment, all sorts of things about the, what happens if the ocean rises and we lose Malibu? You know, like everybody's freaking out, but no one's freaking out about these poor babies with distended

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       bellies because they're filled with parasites. This is a huge human issue and if they were white people that live, they looked like they were from Norway and this was their problem. If they were all beautiful people that live over there from the game of Thrones and they all had distended bellies, everybody would be freaking out and they want to go over there and save those folks. And it's, it's, it's one of the more disturbing and sad or aspects of humanity. I don't know. I mean, science can help certainly with medication, with antibiotics and antiviral drugs to help these people that have all these parasitic infections, which is incredibly rare in these tropical rich jungle environment. You know, that's, I think what would be the thing that I would look forward to the most depicts the world and stop this whole killing other people. Shit.

Speaker 2:          01:29:44       Let me, let me, this is really a perfect example. I'm glad you brought that up. The the especially with Uganda, with Congo, um, because Uganda is the one who I just met a scientist this weekend and uh, he's a a plant breeder by trade who he said, I'm here in the United States. Everybody is screaming that they want choice, they want GMO versus non Gmo. He says over by us, we just want food and a very sincere man who is desperate for solutions for his country and I'm going to work with him and there's three things that could really help Uganda right now and that are actively on the ground there. Three solutions for problems they have, they have something like 70% of their calories come from or carbohydrate calories come from bananas and a, not like bananas we have, but African bananas and bananas get to have two problems.

Speaker 2:          01:30:33       One of them bill to bacterial pathogen problems. They get what's called does anthem Mona's they get Phytopthora. There are genetic engineering solutions that are in place that can solve both of those problems. There's also an issue that people there have vitamin a deficiency. So there are going blind along this golden rice line. Um, you're looking at 250 million to 500 million blindness as a year. Um, and most of it and kids and half of them die within a year. And it's all because of a vitamin deficiency because of vitamin a deficiency. And now they have bananas that have the genes from a banana that produces vitamin a that's kind of agriculturally useless, but they moved those into the production banana from the Congo. And this is from Uganda. And this is a, a gates foundation sponsored stuff. And other people have done this. So now they have a banana that produces vitamin A or B, well Beta carotene, which is converted to vitamin A and then, um, it resistant to the two main diseases.

Speaker 2:          01:31:29       And it can't be used. And you've got Greenpeace and other activist organizations on the ground. They're fighting it and they're telling people that this is just the westerners coming in to take over and give you the food and the technology they reject. I'm saying that will cause sterility. Who's resisting like this, whose, whose these are, these are very wealthy western funded organizations that are opposed to genetic modification. They know that if you Ganda Develops these products and is allowed to give them to their people and they solve a problem that now the house of cards in the Western world falls

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       down. So you really believe that there's a conspiracy to keep these bananas out because if the bananas go through and do good, which they think with you think they will for sure the science says they will and that these people think it will as well. And we'll open the door genetic modified foods going into these countries and they'll lose the battle. So because of that, they're willing to sacrifice. He's people getting this vitamin a rich banana. It's not a conspiracy. It's, if that sounds very conspiratorial, it's true. It's, it's clear as day these, uh, and, and uh, in China they tell people that it will cause infertility. Well that is a conspiracy. When you agree, well, I guess a conspiracy as inspires and arrangement of it, I guess that is a concern. It's unethical and it's untrue. Right? Um, but it's, it's something that is, um, yeah, and it, but it's a, it's very transparent is what I guess I'm going for.

Speaker 3:          01:32:45       This isn't some secret clandestine operation. This is something that is very well understood that this is what they're doing. But to play devil's advocate, isn't it possible that they really truly are concerned that a company like Monsanto would get their monetary hooks into a country and start fucking around there and doing a bunch of unethical shit? Sure. That's what they're worried about. And I think that's something that they would be worried about. But let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. Well, no, let's not. Let's not, uh, accept phantom fears for real fears. We got people that need problems and let's not say, well, maybe Monsanto will be involved, so let's not allow it. Um, let's let them use the best technology. And what have you tried to license this technology and profit from their use of it? No, these are, these have, it's so funny about this is that these are laboratories there that said we want biotechnology and they're developing their own labs and their own stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:33:35       Um, this, uh, professor I met this weekend, I'm going to go there next year to help him set up a lab to grow coffee in, in a culture. I'm not GMO coffee, which may be an interesting idea, but their issue is, is that they can make a tremendous amount of money by growing coffee for farmers or farmers can grow coffee and have a very profitable operation, but you can't grow enough plants of the types that are resistant to the diseases. And so we're going to help them do that, um, in a in tissue culture where we can propagate tens of thousands of plants very quickly in a jar rather than by seed. Um, he's actually going to sponsor a student to come to my lab to do that and I'm going to go there and help him. But this is the kind of place where we can, where you can solve a problem with this kind of technology and where we're being blocked.

Speaker 3:          01:34:23       And to me as a scientist, I think of the 20,000 people who die. Um, I, I talk about it when I give talks and I can't help but get tears in my eyes. When you think about the malnourished people I've met in my travels who, um, who changed me, um, you meet them one time and it, it, you know, you wait, especially when you shake their hand and feel how weak and small they are and you dedicate yourself to, um, how you're going to fix it. And to have people say, well, it's all Monsanto. It's going to give you cancers and all this stuff. That's not true. You block the investment in technology and the application of technology that can help. And so when, when we have this kind of conversation, I think about the allergy free peanuts, I think about the golden banana as the golden rice, the, uh, you know, all the applications we have there.

Speaker 3:          01:35:12       So there's countless and we can't use them because of a fear of the technology. And you feel it just an ignorance with technology and, uh, they've an ignorance of biology and genetics. But you also think that this there, they have to be aware of this too, in order to make this grand conspiracy, to try to keep this illegal, to keep this out of this country. They have to be aware that they are preventing good. They have to be aware. Yes. So that's, that's Kinda fucked up. Yes. And I, and I, and to be on the good side and I supposedly the progressive side, the rightful side, the side that everybody wants to support and anti GMO causes everybody's terrified of Gmos. Yes. And, and that's why in the, and the reason for this has been so, you know, we've, uh, you talk about the companies that, that do it, they totally failed when they rolled out this technology.

Speaker 3:          01:36:04       They didn't say, here's how it works and let's, let's, let's, uh, take care of your fears. They rolled it out and said, here's what you get. And, uh, people equated this with Frankenstein and, and, you know, evil scientists, uh, we didn't get good education upfront. Then over the years, there's been a machine of documentaries, uh, books, uh, the people who sell the books and documentaries about the dangers of this. They're the ones who are making the profits. They're the shills, right? They're the ones that if they can make a dollar by scaring you, uh, with their product, uh, and so they've been running free. Scientists like me have totally screwed this up too because the first time I talked to a public audience about Gmos, 15 years ago, I sat down and I, I bombed them with science and I told them about how it's done and details that they didn't need.

Speaker 3:          01:36:53       I turned off more people than I, than I converted. And only in the last three years really have a scientists got together and said, this is a crisis that our technology can't reach those who need it. And we need to rethink the way that we talk to them about science. And it's not about beating people to death with the Science Hammer. It's about sharing ideas and things that we all really want and our solutions that we can use and, and really separating a technology that's very good from companies that, you know, good, good, bad or whatever we need to know the technology is good. Yeah. What do you think initially caused the fear of Gmos? Do you think it was, was there any particular story that came out that misrepresented it, that became viral or what, what was it that started off this big fear of this aspect of science and I think there's always been an environmental movement that has decried the use of uh, any kind of chemicals and farming and good reason, good reason. And I understand that cause you got DDT and all these great examples

Speaker 1:          01:37:55       back know a guy who's got bone cancer and all these kids who grew up with had cancer as well because they all live near a golf course and this shit that they used to the use the spray on the golf course got into the well water and cancer was rampant in their small community. These examples are in, you know, when you go out, I went out to Hawaii to talk to them and they all talked about, you know, back in the day when the, you know, they would, they would, you know, grow the cane and they would use all these chemicals and whether the stories are true or not, I think there's a certain level of understanding that we did things differently back then. And we weren't in places like South America, they still do this. Um, you know, and uh, if a little bit works more is better.

Speaker 1:          01:38:34       Um, here the regulations are really tight and how you can use a compound and how it's allowed to be used and the residues that are present are all very well monitored. And, uh, I think that the times are changed. But, but going back to your question of, you know, where did this come from? I think people had, it was an environmental movement that was certainly on guard and I'm glad they're there. I'm very happy about that. The problem is now that anything that any of their former foes in the environmental movement would produce. You know, Monsanto Coulda came out with, uh, you know, the duck that makes gold, the golden eggs and they would've said the gold is poisoned. Anything that comes from that company is going to be tainted just by name. Um, and, and, and that's where I think a lot of this comes from and that when they came out with, um, uh, the tomato and back when it was on the market or any of the products that they've made, it hasn't been, let's think of what we can do with this.

Speaker 1:          01:39:28       But here's just another way that this company is rolling out a product to gain world domination of a food supply and make money off chemicals. It's because of what we discussed earlier. There's, or I should say it could be because of what we discussed earlier because people have an inherent distrust in folks that are willing to copyright life. The idea that you own the copyright to some corn and I know that you genetically modified it. I know that you changed it, but what it is now it's life and if you do that to a pig, what happens then? If you do it to a pig, why can't you do it to artificial livers? You know? Why can't you do it to all sorts of things? You could, you could all of a sudden copyrighting entire human body and own a trademark on human bodies. You could specifically design a type of human that the only way you can get your kid to be Alpha Beta 16 is you got to get the Alpha Beta 16 Monsanto gene inside of your kid.

Speaker 1:          01:40:22       I mean this is not outside the realm of possibility. This is within a hundred years from now, there'll be doing shit like that. That freaks people out that a corporation could own human life. Well, yeah, I mean it's an interesting, actually, it's kind of a little bit off topic, but they have that now three parent kid, you know where they've missed the mitochondrial par with what in the actual fuck is going to happen with that kid. The file. What if he comes out evil? Then what? Then what? Well, what if he's, what if he's one day they're going to fuck around, create the antichrist, right. I mean this is where it comes from. It's an interesting thought. You know, plus you're buying

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       more presence at Christmas for your, you know, multiple parents or when a kid will. Yeah, a lot of burden on the kid. If the parents get divorced, the custody, the custody will be a mess. And if they disagree with the way they raised the child and then you'd have to like agree like it's hard for a husband and wife to agree on specifics as far as language to be used to how to handle certain situations. You got three people in, in trying to be the dad of the good news is child support will be half of the price. How many dads and how many moms? It broken down. I don't think it's two mothers cause there's a mother that provided the nucleus and a mother that provided the rest of the cell Goo and then the dad just sperm. Good luck with all that. That guy is a pimp by the way.

Speaker 3:          01:41:32       But, but the whole idea of, but the cool part about this though, as we wander into the mad scientist realm, again, let's think of things that have been done that are really positive and then even our patented technology. So you've got a pig that was made that has a better ability. It has a gene that it makes saliva that breaks down phosphorus better in its food and phosphate. So what did, what it allows the pig to do is have less toxic waste. They called it the and viral pig and it has a cause. Pigs, uh, you know, they're, they're uh, effluent is, uh, is a problem and to have keep it out in the environments a good thing. And so they made the inviro pig and a, at the viral pig is a, is a crushed idea. Now they, they're only a few embryos left in the tank of liquid nitrogen.

Speaker 3:          01:42:16       Um, they made, this week I heard of a salmon that they put a salmon gene into a salmon to make it grow twice as fast. Um, it was originally developed in 1989 and that the company that's been trying to get it approved has been added since the 90s. And they've got all of the approval but it's never been finalized. And the beauty of this fish is it grows to harvestable size as I, you know, a farmed fish in half the time. So you're using half the stuff, half the food, half the resources to eat, make the equivalent amount of protein. But what of these fuckers get out into the wild? Yeah, they thought of that spawn trout. Oh they're all females. And Dan, they're triploid so they have an extra chromosome that makes them infertile. But design is how every bad horror movie stars. Absolutely. One of those things.

Speaker 3:          01:43:06       And all of a sudden it becomes like a crocodile man. That's like the creature from the Braca goon let's, it could be a salmon that you guys fucked with. It turns into a person. But this is it. See that. It's so funny cause it, cause we always spin off into this and you, especially when we go into this idea that my fault and I'm sorry but this is a, it always goes back to what is the way that this can break bad. That's how I look at things and and being an eternal optimist I think of what are the good things we could do with this? Well I expect no less from a guy who had a song called I live in an asshole. I would think that you would be the eternal optimist to its social commentary from a, you know me just obviously we're having fun but it is the kind of thing where my job is to sit around and figure out how to solve problems.

Speaker 3:          01:43:51       And so when you can come up with a fish that gets to eating size and half the time, which could in theory really relieved pressure on wild salmon fishing and put of put food into the high protein and good food into the hands of people who don't normally afford fish like me, I don't buy it. The cereal aisle, logical stuff like that scares the shit out of people. It's like, you know what a lager is, right? Sure. You saw of Napoleon dynamite. It's a cross between a lion and a tiger. It's an enormous, enormous cat. It's the biggest cat we know of. Right? I mean, I think something happens in the jeans. Uh, I believe it's a male lion and a female tiger. I might have it backwards, but the, the, the gene is for regulating the size of the growth is not, it's not the same.

Speaker 3:          01:44:37       So something happens in the cross where it becomes infertile because it's a hybrid, but they grow to enormous sizes. Like look at the size of that God thing. Yeah. It's, it's some weird genetic modification, but you know, not through a scientist in a lab through just crossbreed. Yeah, that's a hybrid vigor. Yeah. It's um, it's a case that when you mix up, um, genomes that don't normally match and Jesus Christ, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be grabbing it like that. Cause it, Lord, what does she handing it beat on the stick? Some food. Well, you got to keep those things soup or fed. Yeah, I've like really, really, really fed like so they don't even think about eating you, but it goes back to our corn. You know, this is why we have great corners because there are two genomes that wouldn't normally get together that humans put together.

Speaker 3:          01:45:26       Seedless Bananas, which are all the ones we have are have an extra set of chromosomes. Your seeds. Seedless watermelon hasn't separate set of chromosomes. Um, we've been mixing together plant chromosomes in ways nature could never intend for decades. And here you add a PR with great precision one gene that we know what it does to a salmon, we can monitor it, we understand it, and it has a beneficial product that can help humans. And they grow these things in tanks and Panama. They can't escape. They're inland Tan. One of them is going to get super smart and figuring out how to crack the and evolve really quick and get legs and leave dude, solid movie, but see that. But that's the, that's the, there's all these precautions that are put in place to make sure that, that these things can't happen. And of course, you know, you can, we can always think of the example in all the thalidomide, you know, now you got flipper babies, you know, um, you can always think of examples where it didn't work, but what we tend to dismiss are the hundreds of thousands of chance of things that worked better than expected.

Speaker 3:          01:46:24       You know, the, uh, the thing that makes your computer grow better, that you can have the equivalent of the Apollo landers a firepower in terms of computational ability on your wrist. You know, even more than that and these, but these are the kinds of breakthroughs that we take for granted. And we, and we ignore a always, but we have to stop worrying about the what ifs and start worrying about the what cans. And that's

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       where I really want to try to get people to refocus. Does Gmo discussion? What are your pressing problems? What are the things that science can do for you today? And I think that that's where this gets super exciting. But you can understand why people are worried. People who don't understand the science or it's never been explained to them. Certainly I don't know anybody like you and they could sit down with like if we do this for three hours, is that even enough? I mean it's not really like you could probably explain this shit to me for months and I would just be be slowly working its way into my understanding. But people worry about what they don't understand and they really worry about human beings, quote unquote playing God and manipulating genetics and manipulating life even though that's kind of what we always have done.

Speaker 4:          01:47:36       Yes, and there's a great radio lab podcast on the Galapagos Islands. It's really fantastic. And one of the things about it is their attempts to keep invasive species from entering the Galapagos islands and the plant species. We're going there from the bottom of people's feet where they had stepped in seeds and then they stepped on the grass and these new species of grasses grow and pirates had left goats on the land so that they could come back and they have a food source when they would land on the island again. So they had these invasive goats species that were living ultra and they realize like there's no fucking way you can't, like everything used to be somewhere else and then made its way across. But when we start monkeying with those, everything's, that's when people are worried because of certain outlier examples. When you forget about all the crops that we plant, oh, there was a totally unnatural, right?

Speaker 4:          01:48:27       I mean an orange grove is like the most unnatural shit ever. You've dug a hole in the ground, put some trees that were never going to be there and you, you, you got to have whole irrigation system and good of Napa and look at the Wa, the wine vineyards, that's fucking totally unnatural. That should just doesn't exist. You're never going to walk through the wilds of some uncharted land and find a fucking wine vineyard doesn't exist. You have to grow that shit. You have to make that apart of the environment. But sometimes it goes terribly wrong. Like they introduce rabbits in Australia and they don't have predators. So the rabbit just fucking went crazy and ran through the entire country. Like they have a huge rabbit problem. So then they brought over foxes. They will bring over foxes and cats and we'll kill the rabbits.

Speaker 4:          01:49:10       But then those foxes and cats don't just kill rabbits. You fuck, they didn't. Jeanette genetically engineered foxes that can only look at a rabbit as a Predator, as a food source, rather, they kill everything. So they were responsible for like 30 something extinctions in the entire country of Australia. It's fucked. They have these fucking foxes running around just killing everything. So they, they're so bad that they have a problem with their sheep were the foxes are grabbing the baby sheep as they're coming out, which is apparently like standard Predator behavior. And this is freaking people out because they, this is all because humans metaled introduced an animal to a place where it didn't belong. Then you tried to introduce a Predator to

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       compensate for it. And you see this chain of events that it's really a problem and a managerial nightmare for people that, or they'd have to manage the wildlife down there. Yeah. But this is so, but all these examples happen and certainly things do sneak out of here and there. You got to go with that. But you know, when we want to talk about releasing a new plant variety, and we're not talking GML, we're saying let's say a new elite strawberry that we know, um, or sorghum or whatever that comes to our university. What's a sorghum? Cause I like strawberry. It's a kind of grain crop that is indigenous for Africa. They use it for a biofuel now to try to, but strawberries or whatever, we have, uh, the evaluation it has to go through. You have to grow it for many seasons, multiple locations. Evaluate. Is it invasive or does it have the potential to be invasive?

Speaker 3:          01:50:31       And if it does, we can't release it. Um, we have to evaluate all the different metrics. And these are not GMO crops. These are just regular crops to, these are just selectively bred crop selectively bred. So you would establish that the seeds will grow this big, fat, juicy apple size strawberry. They're super juicy and delicious and you have to do it consistently and continually an isolated and have it down to one. See that you could give them, they can test themselves. Well essentially we are one plant essentially the see the strawberries are another good example where you can't take strawberry seeds from a strawberry and plant them and get any two plants to look alike. That's so crazy. So you guys, how do you get those seeds then? Now you, every, every plant comes from other plants. They make the little runners. And so one plant that the strawberries that you get, the strawberry plants you buy, they're all clones.

Speaker 3:          01:51:21       Just like the bananas, just like a blueberries. Oh, I see. So they're not grown with seeds. They're grown with a segment of the plant that you then replant that you're replant. So they're vegetative. Oh Wow. So it's like weed. Uh, yeah. That's how I know about clones. So I hear, I know dudes who grow it. That's the idea is that we're able to vegetatively as they say, propagate these things. But all of this stuff is so carefully evaluated and what GMO it goes through FDA to make sure you can eat it. Then it goes to EPA to make sure that it's safe for the environment and they look at how does it affect insect populations are pollinators or whatever. And then that goes to a USDA who then test for farm application and invasiveness and the farm. So these things are crazy tested and all the what ifs are really well established.

Speaker 3:          01:52:10       Because if there was, and I always have kind of the way I think about this as if we do want, assume companies are money grubbing and horrible. Um, if something were to go wrong, it would be the end of the company and gigantic lawsuits. And so in self preservation, let alone profit to make a decent product. These things are extensively tested. So what, what do you think is one of the top unwarranted concerns that people have over genetically modified foods? Well, I'm glad you asked that because I don't mean to be just um, uh, hate when I come off as being just a, uh, too excited and ambitious the technology. Cause there's downsides to everything. Um, but you have to weigh the risks versus limitations or bed, which versus benefits. And some of the things that we've seen is this resistance to weed, to herbicides.

Speaker 3:          01:52:57       So one of the most useful GMO crops is this roundup ready or really what it is, is glyphosate resistant? Glyphosate is the chemical roundup is the brand name. It's off patent now. So many companies make glyphosate. So I tend to go a glyphosate when we discussed the trait, what it allows a farmer to do is plant, say soybeans, you plant the soy beans and then as the soybeans start to grow and the weeds start to grow, the farmer goes over the top with a, with an application of the stuff called glyphosate that kills the weeds. But the crop keeps growing through it and as the crop grows it shades out the weeds. So then the crop is the only dominant thing there. The amount of glyphosate that's applied is about um, you know about a mug worth per acre in terms of active ingredient. It's a very potent chemical that disrupts a very specific part of the plant's biochemistry.

Speaker 3:          01:53:48       It can't make me no acid, so can't make proteins specific proteins and the chemistries, well known, we understand what it affects in. You don't have that pathway. So it's a very safe chemical for humans. Lately it's come under a lot of fire. I'm actually now that people aren't attacking the gene insertion process or the portraits themselves, they're going after the chemicals used in the process of using just that chemical over and over again on, on on land. We've talked about this idea with Murcia and what mutations and with the one that happens to figure it out surviving, there are weeds that can grow through glyphosate. And when that one we'd can grow through because of a mutation, now it drops it seeds and pretty soon you got a major problem because all the rest of the competitors are gone. And these weeds take over and now you have to come up with other methods such as plowing or uh, other herbicides to get rid of them.

Speaker 3:          01:54:43       So this is still confusing to me. You, the plants are all coming from clones, but you sell people seeds. So where do the seeds come from? Why am I dumb? No, no, no, it was this confusing. Well, we're, we're literally literally talking apples and oranges. So we're talking about clones. We're talking about things like strawberries, oranges, apples. When we're talking about soybeans or corn. So if somebody buys those, those strawberries, yes. If you like, you make this mega strawberry, how does someone get a seed to plant for those mega strawberries? If it's all clones, new clone seats, I know that they just take the clonal plants. So strawberries make runners. So you have a plant that then makes a little daughter plant that comes off it and then you just get those daughter plants and plant those in your field so you don't sell them seeds.

Speaker 3:          01:55:31       You sell them plants. We sell them. Well not we, not me, but um, but our nurseries. So if University of Florida comes up with a new strawberry, that's fantastic. They'll take that foundational plant, do many years of to make sure it's good and consistent and many different places. And then that plant will go to a nursery where it's propagated by by experts who make billions of plants and a couple of years and then they sell those plants back to our farmers. But when a person would go to the store and they would buy seeds, like say heirloom tomato seeds, how would they make those seeds? Yeah, those are seeds that come from heirloom tomato. So that comes from what you think of as single seed dissent. In other words, you have a tomato that has some good qualities than its seeds. Also have the similar qualities they've been inbred so that essentially there's no genetic diversity within that fruit, that every gene, rather than having a copy from mom and a copy from dad that are different, they're all the same or at least very narrow.

Speaker 3:          01:56:27       And so this way you can have seeds from that same parental plant that look very so that what you plant will come out to be very similar to the parent that it came from. But this is where it gets confusing to me because you were telling me that if someone took like one of those tomatoes and grew, uh, took the seeds from it and tried to grow tomato plants, they would not be similar to the initial tomato. Well, the heirlooms probably would be because of those, because they're so well in bread. Okay. Okay. So, but a regular tomato of Monsanto grown regular tomato, a hybrid tomato that came from two very distinct parents, that thing's going to be a genetic mix of many different traits. And that thing will give rise to many different progeny. So if you got a tomato from the grocery store, one of those Pale, funky tomatoes, the cut up and like Carl's junior and you get your burger, that just looks like or sad if you took the seeds for an that you could possibly grow different kinds of tomatoes.

Speaker 3:          01:57:21       Yes. Wow. Yeah. And so, uh, but, but with things like click and suck, the could be like, or Cooper or it could be the next, uh, the next best tomato you've ever tasted. I mean, it could be that the chances are no, because they've been breeding out all of that stuff. Um, we do have tomato plants at home. Yes, I do. Yeah. I'll send you some seeds for one that you will start. None of this is, this is amazing. So a guy at my, uh, in my university named Harry Cli, he, they did sensory tests on hundreds of people and they asked them, well, what do you like about a tomato? What? And they tested all the heirlooms on them and they tested what heirlooms they liked and which ones they didn't. Then they took apart chemically what's in each one of those kinds of tomatoes and they analyze them by, by maybe what the consumers were tasting in the volatile components in the acid balance and the sugars.

Speaker 3:          01:58:09       And they were able to come up with a recipe for the perfect tomato and then they made hybrids that would fit that expectation. And they came out with two new tomatoes called garden jam and garden treasure, which are just going to be used in the whole market, but there tomatoes that have exceptionally high flavor and it's one of these heirlooms, Brett, against the University of Florida, um, uh, production tomato. So one of the more regular tomatoes and the result is outstanding. It grows in Florida where nothing, everything wants to die in Florida. Uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       it's a really harsh environment, but now these are tomatoes are fantastic and they do really well out here. And how do they establish those seeds? Then they just do it enough generations of very specific tomatoes where they're confident that the seeds will yield the same type of tomato while the two parents are very well the eye, very, very standard genetically. And then those two parents get sent to a place like, I don't know where they did these, but it was some place like Costa Rica or something where you can generate huge amounts of hybrids where you have people who will hand pollinate flowers with the one pollen from the other and then generate the seeds. And so that's how hybrid seeds are made. So they're making these seeds by hand germinating or hand Paul and hand pollinated rather. Yeah. And, and the result is fantastic because it's a combination of the best of the heirlooms versus the best of the production traits.

Speaker 1:          01:59:33       And this is what's exciting for me as a scientist is that we understand more about what the consumer wants now. And we also are understanding more about the chemistry of fruits and vegetables. So even without Gmo, we can understand the genes that cause people to like tomatoes. Like, what are the components of a tomato or a strawberry that people just love and then identify those compounds in breed them back in just with traditional breeding. What is the pollination process like? Because I watched this thing about, um, in China they had areas where they had decimated the bee population so badly that they had a hand pollinate a lot of their plants. And by sheer luck they found out that hand pollination is far more effective. And if they paid people, whatever the owl hourly wages is actually more cost effective to fucking get rid of the bees, which is horrible to find out what these people, it was way better cause apparently bees are just kind of random.

Speaker 1:          02:00:31       You know, they're not, they don't do the best job, but they don't know what the fuck they're doing. They don't know that they're carrying pollen on them, you know, they're just, they're just kind of doing it. It's not like a very specific goal for them. But when it's a specific goal, and I usually like these artistic paint brushes and brushing pollen on it, the effectiveness was like way, way better than just allowing nature to run its course. Yeah. It may have been the case in China and it depends on the crop too because a lot of things are wind pollinated. So if you eat maculate, all of the plants that you plan to be the female parent, if you cut out all the little stamens and anther's the male parts, you know, you had to take out a all rude. Yeah, I know it. You have to be careful when you look online how to do this.

Speaker 1:          02:01:08       And you should look up pictures of Bruce Jenner pop up, Google emasculation it. Uh, so you'd go to [inaudible], you pull out all the a star, he's a hero, you pull out all the time of her, you pull out all the stamens and then now this plant can only be fertilized by what comes from, you know, you plant the adjacent rows of the pollen donor and now bees and wind and everything else will take care of that. So these people hand pollinate these plants, then grow tomatoes specifically from those plants and then sell those seeds or use those seeds to grow more me. How many generations do they do it? They're confident that they can get a seed that if you get it, it will grow that same specific tomato that you guys engineered. So the seed that comes from the tomato that results from that pollination, those seeds are hybrids.

Speaker 1:          02:01:51       They have the combination of the mothers, the mothers traits and the father's traits. That seed is the one that would go to you as the consumer that now you would grow a tomato plant that would produce outstanding tomatoes. Wow. After that, it's a crap shoot because genes in cells, when you're uh, you know, making your, your gametes are male and female reproductive components, you're um, going through homogenization is that now you lose control of what genes are in the next generation. So that's the problem. I think this is a mind blower for people. This one right here is for me because I never really thought that the tomato that you got, like if you've got an heirloom tomato, wouldn't necessarily grow heirloom tomatoes from its seeds because it's just not the way it works. I mean, I would have always assumed that you would be able to get it that way, but you telling me that you, you what you guys had specifically done, that you had a hand pollinate in order to ensure that that would create those certain types of tomatoes.

Speaker 1:          02:02:46       That's fucking nuts. That's it's the way it goes now when you make hybrids and, and, but there's so much more cool stuff in plant genetics that we can do because of this kind of thing. It's very cool, but it's disturbing again to dummies like me because then all it comes up like, whoa. People are in charge of the process of creating this very specific form of life. I mean that's really what that tomato is. It's a living thing. It's a very specific type of vegetable or fruit, right? Technically it's technically a fruit, a fruit like botanic that human beings are you, you guys are the mothers of these special tomatoes. I mean essentially it needs people. Oh sure. Ask me about seedless watermelons. I mean [inaudible] the fuck is that about your to hear though? Is that worrying what came first? The chicken or the egg?

Speaker 1:          02:03:29       It doesn't make sense. There's a case where you're using chemicals to change the number of chromosomes in a cell. So now this plant has twice as many chromosomes. So now when you cross it against one that has the normal amount of chromosomes, the other results, so we'd have let's say a two, two times to chromosomes and the next generation you would cross it with something that has the normal set, the resulting ones have this weird intermediate set that can't be fertile. Okay, I'm going to play the part of the dumb hippie man. It just doesn't feel right with you. Just like fucking with nature and not knowing the results. I mean, the world has like a a biological system and you're just tampering with it without totally understanding ramifications of what you're going to do. And there's all sorts of cancer and autism that exists today and a lot of it is because of scientists. Ignorant to think that they're so smart. You're smarter than nature, you're going to play God with tomatoes. I just think that's fucked man. Yeah. So that's my, my role. It was pretty good. Right? Well I've met that guy over and over again. What do you say to that guy? Well, the thing that breaks my heart is that I liked that guy pretty much to, I mean, you know, he, he, he's, he's not in my, not up in my face about anything else. He's doing

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       his thing. We listened to the same music. Probably we, you know, we're both in the worrying about the environment. You know, we're on the same page with 90%. It's just that he worries about this in this one aspect of food production, that humans have always changed food and we've just now learned how to do it with precision. And so this is what, where he's got a kind of, you know, have a little come to Jesus moment here and say this is science working for him.

Speaker 4:          02:05:03       I think again it goes to that is is a very, very complex issue that doesn't have a lot of black and widen and it has many, many shades of gray and like all things. There's pros and cons to the application of it, especially really complicated things like anything involving biology, there's pros and cons. There's variables that we can't control with with our consumption of food. With the are the level of pollution that we allow in the environment. I mean there's, we have like dedicated numbers or, or, or dissed prescribed numbers that you shouldn't go over. Like if we go over this when we fucked up that area, we've got to get out of there. I mean there's spots that human beings can't go to right now because of chemical dumps or because of nuclear reactor accidents. There's spots that we've totally ruined and this is just a Po, but we also have fucking power everywhere.

Speaker 4:          02:05:54       Right. You know, we also have elect you me, yeah, this some bad shit has happened, but look at all the good shit. It's 7 billion people on the planet. There's never been numbers like that. Just don't, the only reason why there's numbers like that is because 100,000 of them are smart as shit, and those really, maybe a million might be a million at a 7 billion, right. That have been responsible for putting together this amazing society. It's not me, but those people that have, yeah, there's been some mistakes along the way, but I think without that innovation in that thirst for improvement, that people seem to just, we just have like inherently like a guy like you when you're talking about these, the application of these technologies and the application of this science and this work, you get all jazzed up. I May, Sr you almost started crying when you were talking about these people that you had met that were amazing, hated you have a deep connection to this and then so you, you're fucking important as shit, dude. Well, you're more important than Jay Z. I just said it. I'll take that.

Speaker 2:          02:06:52       But you know, you know, who is responsible for a million of those 7 billion? Do you know a named Norman Borlaug? No. You see the guy that created golden rice? No. Norman Borlaug. He did more than that. Norman Borlaug was a, a wonderful, simple, uh, it came from a farm background, uh, became a scientist in studied ways that he could try to solve problems on the face of the earth for the hungry and especially in India and Mexico. And his idea was to take the kind of plants that may never be able to, uh, uh, makes naturally and make some crosses a dwarfing varieties. So plants that were lower to the ground that would have fewer problems. And he made these crosses that really would go to feed a billion people. And, um, you know, scientists, me, you know, I look at him and I, he's like a, he is the ultimate hero to me.

Speaker 2:          02:07:38       He is a guy who should be a household name here. Um, you know, I stand on the shoulders of a giant and he passed away in 2009. And, uh, those of us who have heard about him, I've read about him, who, who had a chance to see him speak. It changes us because it was, it was his, his compassion to take care of the needy that drove him. It wasn't about making a dollar. It wasn't about Monsanto. It was about being the guy that when he came to the village, everybody said, let's, let's take them out to our best restaurant because here's a guy we like. Um, uh, he was a guy who insisted if you visited his campus to carry your bags to your car, um, despite the fact that he was a Nobel laureate. Um, that's the kind of role models that we have in science.

Speaker 2:          02:08:21       And this is the kind of role model that other people have to be aware of that for every Norman Borlaug, uh, it's going to take a few million evil scientists. We have to understand that. And he made that he made crosses that were, were amazingly diverse and that Brock plants together that couldn't survive, that would never happen in the wild and fed people because of it. See, he's the good scientists. You're the good scientist in the movie too. So when the evil scientist come and they tried to take over the world, we need you to be the ones that sound the alarm like in every good movie, like the day before tomorrow, whatever that is, day after tomorrow. Right. You need the good scientist to figure it out. The Shit's going wrong. Well, yeah, and then, but and then that's in there on surveillance. I mean it's not just me. There's thousands of me, much more on surveillance now than ever before.

Speaker 2:          02:09:07       Right before, but not just because we're aware of it, but because of the tools we have. And it would be, to me, it would be a career maker to find something wrong with a Monsanto product and report it in the best journals. But when you worry though, like a good Russell Crowe movie that would come after him. Not at all. You wouldn't work. I'd say the very least. I would say bring it on yet. No, totally. I'm, wow. I am fearless. I, I, I love talking to the Anti Gmo crowds. I mean I go into a, and I'm the one they call because they know I'm reasonable, but I go in the places and people will get in my face and yell at me. I'll have, uh, people come up and scream in my face about how my company has given their kid cancer. Um, I mean I get, I get some heavy shit and it happens often, but the idea is, is to get into those rooms and get into those spaces just like we're doing here and have a conversation and introduce people, the technology and get them to d, Monsanto wise, this talk about ways that we can make it work to make a plant products that would require fewer pesticides like the bt has.

Speaker 2:          02:10:07       How many people have come up to and yelled at you that you gave one of their loved ones cancer? Um, to, to, yeah, one of them was in Hawaii. It was a woman, beautiful woman from Brazil I think originally who had a child who had um, uh, who had cancer and she said, here's what your company did to my child. And, um, and I accompany, did she think you were representing? Um, I assume the big hammer, one of the big companies? Um, and the reason I was there was because I was invited by the companies to come to the island to talk to people as a neutral party because they were having a lot of conflicts by Monsanto. Well, no, I was invited by the Hawaii Crop Improvement Association, which is like a group of a whole bunch of companies. And they said they're not listening to us.

Speaker 2:          02:10:49       They don't care what we think. What about an independent scientist? And when I came there, I made it my business to not hang around with the Syngenta's Monsanto's dials. I didn't want to talk to the other scientists. Um, I wanted to talk to the farmers and I wanted to talk to the people who were afraid and the people who had concerns because I could help them understand. And, and, and that was what my goal is, to help them to talk to them. And, and anyone who was there, even people who are adamantly anti Gmo, I think many of them would agree that I was very, I was often, I mean it was very peaceful and very quick to engage them. That when I saw people in the audience at a farmer forms where I was speaking, I'd see them shaking their heads and going, no way, no way.

Speaker 2:          02:11:30       The minute I was done in the applause was over and the questions were answered. I chased them out in the parking lot and said, I need to talk to you because this is, this is where this conversation needs to be. It needs to be one on one over a pizza and a cup of coffee. It, he can't be, it can't be on the internet where there's noise from, you know, documentary sellers and, and, and people with agendas were, what about face to face and this woman is yelling at you that you're responsible for? Yes. Her child being ill. Like what do you say to someone like that? I said, I'm really sorry for what's happened and, and I would love to help you solve this problem or not let it happen to somebody else. And I, I said, if there is something here on the island that caused this, we need to understand it and we need to get to the bottom of it.

Speaker 2:          02:12:10       But as a scientist, it's not GMO crops. I mean there's nothing that I can think of that's plausible or no evidence that I know of that would point that way. And then I told her about the, uh, state USDA, the person I gave her the name of the estate, Usta Person. I said, here's the person you call and tell them where you live in and have them come talk to you about it and analyze the patterns. And you know, that's the kind of issue was this was from another country in Brazil. This was in a, she does. She was from Brazil. I think so. So was she living in Hawaii when this happened? Yes. So there's something that they had dumped in Hawaii, wasn't it? Was the United States. Yeah. That's the allegation. A lot of the people on the confused. I thought she was, cause she flew from Brazil to talk to you.

Speaker 2:          02:12:52       She was, um, I had a conversation with her and I think I got that information from her at the time cause she had a very strong accent. But there's a lot of very strong anti GMO sentiment on the island of Hawaii and in Hawaii actually throughout the state. Well, I mean how could it not be sure if you look at what they have, they have paradise. Yes. And they're like, what are you going to do? Are you going to fuck with paradise? Ah Dude, we're okay over here. Well down here, which are fucking funky bananas. But here's, here's the deal is that uh, our, uh, our, our, our farmers rely on on this because Hawaii, you can grow three seasons of corn a year, so you can use it, but they use it for seed production. You generate the seed that's planted in Iowa on Qy. Wow. That's amazing. Yeah. And so,

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       and you can do three seats, three seasons a year, whereas the amazing weather rather than to on the mainland or one. And so you're able to sell the farmer cheaper products or keep the cost under control of a product. Plus the environment's perfect. It's dry, the seed is of good quality. So they do a lot of seed raising on Hawaii and um, and, and very strong anti sentiment. And I understand that um, it is a beautiful place but it also employs lots of people on the islands. I think one of the things that you discussed and we talked about earlier that I thought was really fascinating was this idea that planting crops isn't really natural because I was a pass through Alberta this past weekend and I was driving through these enormous agricultural areas and I was thinking to myself like, well this is really crazy like that.

Speaker 3:          02:14:20       We do this, we just take over these giant swaths of land and fill it with shit we can eat. And then we run over it with giant machines collecting it and then bundle it up and sell it throughout the world. Like this is, it's a really bizarre practice and it is absolutely unnatural. Absolutely. It's a, and if you look at where the crops came from that we grow, I mean corn doesn't belong in the, in North America. I mean it was, well, I came from southern Mexico. Uh, it wasn't in the United States and Canada. Anyway, um, if you look at a map and I'll show you when, maybe later Urfi you look up crop domestication, our centers of origin of, of major food crops. You see that, uh, there are maps in Google images that show that you s you have sunflowers, maybe some progenitors to strawberry and blueberry and maybe some kind of brass cause that might be like canola.

Speaker 3:          02:15:08       But for the most part, there's nothing that comes from here. No two tomatoes are from South America. Potatoes, peanuts saw a citruses from Southeast Asia. Apples are from cosmic Stan. All of our, all of our cabbage, Kale, Broccoli, cauliflower, all that's from the Middle East and Mediterranean areas. So nothing's from here, dude. Kale is totally natural. Fuck off. Uh, yeah, so this is a good example here. This, um, but that talks about, you know, some of our major crops. I'm certainly there. Sorghum yams and potatoes came from South America. Peanuts, South America. Wow. African rice. This is nuts. There's lots of good example. Osh. Yes, squash came from a south. Well, it's also from, uh, Mexico along with beans. Uh, close to where I'm amazed was a domesticated. So there's some kinds of squash that were native to North America, but not many. Look. S Paga, what does that PE Peppo Peppo keep us flash. So people's like, uh, like, um, uh, the, uh, any kind of a Q Courbet's like a pumpkin's and like the squash is quickness is like we have, it's weird when you look for Yams. I know creepy little island in the middle of nowhere, but that this is, that they love that stuff. The HR something there that, that's where yams come from, but they take a, but this is the, this is all of the movement from those crops was human mediated. Humans drag

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       that stuff around. Chenwa and so all of our domestication that we've done has been human facilitated and the genetics change accordingly. Oh, so there's some yams that are also from South America, it seems. Oh, at central. That's South America. South America there. But what, but this is the beauty of this. If you look at strawberry, it's a great story because strawberry grows naturally on the forest floors of North America and also from Chile. But the two are two different species. So there's two different kinds of yams then. And it's like you different species that says it is. It's got two different names. Two different Yemenis. That always weirds me out too. Why does it have to fucking names? Look, it's got a rapper name. It's, you know, it's coolio as your name's not coolio. What's your fucking name? You know that guy? What's his name?

Speaker 1:          02:17:14       Two Chainz, Bro. That's not your name. It can't go on. You can't go on CNN and debate Nancy grace about pot. You don't even, you don't have a real name. Your name. See goddamn name. Yeah, but this is a cool story. If you look at it, look at this though. Like Yams. Why do we have to, what's this? What's your fucking name, dude? It's, no, it's d. What does it, how does, I don't even know. I don't even know what the genus is on, on that. But you know, gee, try, try for the d trip it up versus the Alotta and they're just, they're just reproductively isolated. And so they are essentially the same thing. Are they interchangeable? They're probably two species from the same genus. So they're related, but there's reproductively isolated. Why do they have wrapper names? They cause they can't cross with each other.

Speaker 1:          02:17:57       Unlike rappers say can't cross with each other. Why don't they have their name then? Why didn't we, why? Why do we have to dumb it down? Just call it Yam and Yam. Why isn't one D Trifecta and one d alerta [inaudible] what it is. It's the m one and m two or I've, but nobody thinks about it that way. You go to a supermarket, it doesn't say that. Well because the ones you get in the supermarket are probably just one kind. This other thing is probably, uh, some freaky. It doesn't work in production, but it is ultimately very fascinating to look at this map and think about what it must have been like, of course, to be people that were traveling all over the world looking for plants and looking for spices. I mean, that was like a big part of the whole trade where they would get on boats and travel to foreign lands.

Speaker 1:          02:18:41       They were trying to find plants and spices and shit. Oh yeah. Well, let me tell you, the strawberry story is so cool that they grow in the forest floors in North America. Like, you know, uh, we eastern seaboard and people were dragging them back to the, uh, to the, uh, to Europe on colony ships and 15 hundreds. There's lots of them going back and you can find accounts in the literature. Um, and then in 17, 14, there was a spy who is going to South America, French spy, who is going to Chile to look at, uh, of a Spanish fortifications. And he found a, uh, kind of strawberry that was being grown by indigenous peoples. And he brought this thing back to, uh, to Europe. And he wasn't. Then, unfortunately, these flowers were only male there. It's like you, you had a problem where these plants couldn't self fertilize. So these plants from South America and these plants from North America

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       made their way to the botanical garden in Versailles where a teenager essentially started to identify crosses between these two species that came in different places because of spies and colonists. And they're the pollen got together to make our modern day strawberry. Whoa. It's got, it's got four complete sets of chromosomes. So it's a genetic mess. Um, but it's something that we all love and enjoy. And in my lab helped and sequencing the genome a few years ago. It's a, this is, this is how cool that, that plant domestication is. There's so many stories. Every one of these plants has a really cool, articulate, articulate story about the way it came to be on our plate. I just think plants are absolutely fascinating. Like I said,

Speaker 4:          02:20:13       I know guys who, uh, grow marijuana and they use clones and I, I had no idea what that even meant until I went to this guy's greenroom and I was like, wait a minute, you take a, okay, so you take a piece of this plant, you grow more plants. So he had gotten arrested, he was on the first guys to get arrested for uh, the medical weed and Tom Mccormick and his, um, his setup, the way they had charged him for individual plants, they had said it's clones were individual plants. But if there were like in bulk, if there was all on one plant, it would be legal. It would be less, less illegal. Like to take that plant and clone it, then it becomes a unique object in and unto itself. Cause that could be used to drove, grow more illicit drugs.

Speaker 2:          02:20:56       Right. It's an independent entity. Yeah. I always thought it was seeds. Now it's funny because the, so my main research, we didn't talk about that stuff, but I work with identifying genes associated with flavors and strawberries and things like this, using genomics tools. But I also do a lot with light. And so I do a lot with led and a lot with how you are able to change plant traits using lights. So make them taste better or change the way they grow. Wow. And, uh, I've been getting emails. I was kind of one of the first folks in this, well shouldn't say that I was in the space early back in the late nineties. And, um, I've been getting emails from like, you know, stoner eighteen@aol.com for years and, uh, people asking about how do you grow a plant that you would want to grow under what color lights? Because there's so much of, um, of that production, which has been brought into controlled environments. Um, I'd never was able to answer the questions very well because we're forbidden to work on such products, um, you know, at our university anyway. Um, and, uh, but, but there's, but the using light to control those aspects of plant growth and development is something they're really interested in.

Speaker 4:          02:22:00       That's fascinating. Is there any benefit to growing plants in sunlight as opposed to artificial light?

Speaker 2:          02:22:06       Well, this is, um, this is actually a really big part of my program is I do what's called plant whispering.

Speaker 4:          02:22:12       Wait a minute. You probably that music, do you play your, your punk rock next to them and they grow aggressive? That's right. I'm sorry. What's fight or fight? The power plant was Flint with Sprig

Speaker 2:          02:22:25       is basically where we use light as. So if you think about a plant, plants have 12 different light sensors at least that listened to different parts of the spectrum. So plants can see red, blue, green, even the red light that's off the end of the spectrum that we can't see. And they can see UV. And so when we give different pulses or different treatments at different times of the day, we can change the way a plant grows. What metabolites it accumulates. Maybe the flavors we can make. Cilantro tastes absolutely horrible. If you, if you know, if you like it, we can make it taste. So cilantro really, it's a difficult to eat. Um, but we can change plant flavors, we can change their colors, we can change any of their attributes. And now we're trying to understand how we can give light treatments to plant materials like harvest strawberries, treat them with light before they go into the supply chain, before they go to the store and through all the refrigeration and have them change their gene expression patterns so they come out the other end better and last longer in your refrigerator or last longer in your countertop.

Speaker 2:          02:23:28       So our idea is is to essentially change the gene expression in fruits and vegetables using the language of light to dictate how they decay. And my feeling is is that we've got um, you know that you saved 7 billion. Now we got 10 billion, three more billion coming. We have to use the same space right now if you buy a tomato at the store or you are, let's say you pick a tomato off the plant in Florida, the odds of that tomato being eaten by a person are one and two 50% of our food is wasted. And one because it goes bad, it either goes bad or, or, or, or spoils. And in the developing world it either spoils or gets a infestation. And one place where we can really solve the problem or address the problem of the 10 billion is in postharvest technology, but they called postharvest and this isn't GMO stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:24:16       This is the other thing I do. We, um, we're really dedicated to the idea of getting more food for people by having a, uh, by having a more food last longer and using these kinds of light treatments and other kinds of, uh, uh, Ma mild chemical treatments or washes or whatever. This is one part of it. Make what we have last longer. So would this involve artificially growing these plants and their artificial lights or what did it involve like growing the seeds from the plants grown from artificial light and how would it be done? I think if you, that you'll see a lot of this online these days that there's a lot of companies that are starting and abandoned warehouses and places where they use led lights to do what's called vertical gardening, where they grow plants in city centers, um, where you don't have the transportation costs and the carbon footprint. So you can bring plants to market cheaper and maybe even higher quality products. So, um, what I think about it, and this is where we think about this versus Gmo, Gmo, we change one gene. We know exactly what it is. We understand it emo or environmental modification of plants, which is what I like think of plant whispering. We're changing lots of

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       genes in ways we don't necessarily understand, but we enjoy the outcomes and people don't really care. But that's what freaks people out because people know that like light is not an artificial lights, not necessarily good for human beings. Like if you live in a, a room filled with fluorescent light, you'll get vitamin D deficiencies, right? Yes. Oh, is that similar to the light that we use for plants? And if so, is there a concern that there's a similar negative reaction somehow or another in those plants where they wouldn't be as healthy as they would be in natural sunlight? Sure. That you can have cases where, uh, plants since your whole metabolism is driven by light, the whole material photosynthesis, that if you have problems with your light sensing, that's why you have 13 different light sensors that control, um, your growth and development because you're paying attention to every aspect of that ambient environment and making very good, um, let's say predictions or conclusions based upon the information you get from the spectrum.

Speaker 3:          02:26:18       And that's where, uh, we've been actually thinking where we've applied the idea of manipulating the spectrum to change the way the plant grows. Ultimately, anything that isn't beneficial, we're not interested in, we want to grow better food that's more nutritious and last longer so that we're able to grow things more sustainably. Are these lights normal lights or are these lights like some very specific growing type lights in? They give off a very specific spectrum that's not like normal led or fluorescent lights. Are there specific combinations of LEDs that are computationally controlled? So it's controlled at a certain, what would you say amperage? Like what would you say as far as wattage? Well, there, what is the light? The, what's that media? You kind of got it. It's um, these, they're all at different. Um, in the light business we call it fluence rate the number of photons that are produced per cubic foot or per square meter.

Speaker 3:          02:27:08       The idea is, is that some of the photons we produce that gift plants information you can't see, so you can't really call it that, uh, you know, intensity. Um, the stuff that's in UV and off the end of the red part of the spectrum, it, it has information for plants that's really potent, but it's uh, not information that you can see, but the plant makes, if you put a plant under far red light, the stuff off the end of the red part of the rainbow, the plant goes buzzard, it gets, starts growing really lanky and long. It accumulates specific pigments. It, yeah. It allows you to manipulate the plant size and body of the plant. And does it have any consequence on the actual product to the plant produces that's consumed by humans, whether it's a tomato or an avocado or whatever. Is there anything about this light that changes the actual food that you eat? Oh sure. Yeah. And we, what we use it for, and we've done most of our experiments on sprouts, like Kale sprouts. We can make Kale sprouts changed the level of glucose scintillates which are the anticancer compounds. We can increase that stuff just by using light. We can change, probably give you cancer when that be ironic. Well yeah, you also can change the uh, like the attractive colors, you know, make things that are purple or green. I can make a others a kind of lettuce can grow

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       under eight different light treatments. That gives you essentially eight different kinds of lettuce leaves that taste different. Look different, tastes different, look diff. Wow. And is it discernible to the naked eye? Like would I be able to walk in there and know which one is given off? Which thing? Or was it just a no, it's just, it's a recipe of light that gives us a given output. You know what I'm saying? Like if you had four different rooms, you are growing for different kinds of lettuce, would I be able to walk in those rooms and discern that there's any difference in the light of each individual? Sure. Oh, you would like crazy. Yeah. Oh, okay. It's um, there's a lot of this stuff you can even find online with like, uh, if you look at like led and plant growth, you'd see all kinds of different ways that people do this.

Speaker 1:          02:28:58       The problem is that most places stick plants under a purple light or under a pink light and they get some effect. Um, what, we don't want to just grow a plant, we want to tell it how to grow and I think the future of growing plants in controlled environments will be deeply rooted in this ability to control how they grow. The keyword is control, man. I know what you're trying to do. Trying to make lettuce. It fucks with my head. I know what you're doing dude, with your light fee. I just seems like that's the thing that people would be worried the most is that there would be some sort of nutritional deficiency. And something that's grown with artificial light that growing something in the sunlight is somehow or another better for you. Does that make any sense at all or is that just total nonsense?

Speaker 1:          02:29:37       It could be true, but that's the idea is that we might not be, well, what we're looking for is, again, we're not looking for like the uh, the, you know, the, the, the, the deleterious result. What we're trying to do is what is the combination of variables that we can control to make something that's better for people. That's what I'm dedicated to. That's where I want to go there. So it seems to me that there's just a giant positive aspect to this about keeping food for longer, feeding more people, giving people nutrition and areas where it's unavailable. It seems to me that is a massive, massive positive benefit of it. What can we do to medicate or prevent any negative aspects of it? You know, the, the negative aspects of it being that somehow or another, it could harm people somehow or another. The corporation's behind it would act in a greedy way that would be detrimental to the area where the crops are grown or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:30:28       What can be done? Yeah. I think in, in, I guess I'm kind of a tooting our own horn here by saying we need to support public science. You know, we've got this group of people like in the land grant university system, this was a brilliant idea that came out of the moral act back in the 1860s where they established a university in every state that's job was, was to take care of the public need, where you train the students, you help to farmers, you do the research that puts you at the cutting edge to help the farmers and train the students. And that's a model that's still here today. University of California Davis is the best in the world at this and a, and they're amazing at the things that happened there. The problem is, is that as a nation, we've been less excited to fund science right now. If I write a proposal to the USDA or National Science Foundation, um, the odds of it getting funded are between five, 10%.

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       And if you think that they have these competitions once a year, you know, you may go 10 years without getting a research award. A lot of labs are closing up. We're not training students like we used to and it's because of there hasn't been this public demand to fund science. And I think a lot of that comes from, they go, well, people are scientists. They're are just in the pocket a Monsanto anyway. Why do we care when that's totally not true. The best defense against an evil empire is your public scientist and we're, and we're struggling for tools right now. How does one get hired? Like if one is going to college and you're graduating, you're getting your master's in, whenever you're getting it in and you get recruited by a company like Monsanto, has that happened or do you go to them and look to get a job?

Speaker 3:          02:32:07       Like how does a scientist become a good scientist like yourself or an evil scientist? Like, even the most evil we would think the guy who created the atomic bomb, but Oppenheimer wasn't evil at all and he was actually really disturbed by the whole event, the thing that he had created. She was a part of this scientific process that ultimately seemed necessary. The time being the first person to come up with this bomb. So how does one get high, but that's very distracting. But how does one get hired like out of college and how many scientist as more like a company like Monsanto employed? Well, Monsanto is I think 24,000 employees. But Dick, how many of them are scientists? I don't know. I don't know. Probably a good chunk of else just takes out the garbage. But, but to be honest, that, you know, I know lots of, I do know lots of people who work there and lots of our former students from our program have gone there because they're hiring, you know, universities aren't.

Speaker 3:          02:32:59       They are. And uh, but just to give you an idea, you go through at least four years of undergraduate. You require sometimes a master's degree, sometimes as a phd. That takes you four to seven years. Then you're talking about post doc time where you're looking at between one in six years. So you're 35, 36, 37 years old before you ever even get a job. And that is insane. And that's if you in, in academia where I work, it's so rare to get a job. Um, it's really tough getting academic positions. Um, but the companies are happy to take these people, especially people with good backgrounds in plant breeding because Monsanto at the end of the day, they're not a GMO company. They're not a chemical company anymore. They're a plant genetic improvement company and they're working on breeding plants so that then you can add that gene to the elite background.

Speaker 3:          02:33:48       There's only so much you can do with a GMO transgene the rest of that has to be done by breeding. And, uh, lots of plant breeders, like people come through my lab, uh, the two plant breeders to my lab, one of them got snapped up by one company, another one got snapped up by another. Um, right out of the PHD, each one of them into a six figure plus salary plus all kinds of benefits. Do you ever think about going over to the dark side? I've been recruited many times and forces with you, but it's my mission. You know, I, I like, I, I like, how are you staying with my star wars terminology? I could, I could, you know, um, my, my Yoda said, stay in university. You must. Um, I was, um, my, my whole thing is I think I like being in the public sector because I don't like to have secrets.

Speaker 3:          02:34:33       I don't like to have proprietary information that I can't share. My whole thing is, and I've, and I've been this way my entire career. When I got the first little bit of strawberry sequence information with $1,800 grant that I got from the Florida Strawberry Association, um, we got the first little bit of strawberry information. We gave it away because the idea was to spark more research and more discovery. We could've sat on it and use it just for our lab. But you guys live the Elon Musk's of strawberries. That's the idea. You know, you, you make it, you distributed your work faster, open access, open source as fast as you can. And, um, so, uh, but, but this is the main thing with the companies. You know, for me it's about, it's about that role and I like to work synergistically with the companies. I don't, you know, I have good relationships with Monsanto employees, Dal employees, you name any company because we have the same clients, you know, my job is to make sure, uh, farmers know how to use Monsanto products, Monsanto seeds.

Speaker 3:          02:35:30       So I need to know what the company's up to. Well, it's just, it seems so crazy that it's so easy to get hired by a giant corporation and difficult to get hired by public universities it seems, but it's totally logical. Obviously there's going to be way more people that are pursuing a degree in science and there are openings. So is that difficult to encourage young people to get into science because of that? When they look at job prospects, is that a real issue? I think it is. And, and really one of the funny ironies here is that back in 1999, Monsanto actually gave my university some money towards a position. So they said, you guys are short on faculty here. Let's start one there. And they hired a guy who's never done anything for Monsanto ever since has done some beautiful science for the public good.

Speaker 3:          02:36:17       And, uh, we're always criticized about that. People say to me, well, you've got that position in your department. That must mean everything you say has to go to. It's like, totally not that, you know, I'm grateful that companies do anything for us. If, if anything, you know, like if, if anybody wanted to build a new building on our campus, I wouldn't say no, but that doesn't mean they're going to get any favors. So when you, okay, if you are involved in any sort of a project, will any sort of a scientific analysis of something, are you required to release the results to your superiors before you go public with them? Or is there no obligation whatsoever? You could just tell anybody at any time what, what you've discovered. He had no obligation. I research, I research what I research and um, w what I can raise money for from USDA, NSF, Nih, wherever I can get money from public sources, uh, even strawberry industry. I can do some strawberry industry sources that give me some funds, but that no one goes, there's no filter. And

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       sometimes it's good to have people read just to make sure you don't say something dumb, but there's nobody who ever says, no, you can't publish this. And if they did, I'd publish it anyway because this is about science and the truth. It's not about making anybody happy.

Speaker 4:          02:37:30       Well that's the big conspiracy. It was always the big conspiracy in almost anything that's in the public eye when people are allowed to scrutinize something from the outside. And guess what the process is. I didn't know. And that's what I had to ask you. You, you could have easily just said to me, I mean, as far as I knew, you could have easily just said, well, everything that I do has to go through a board and they have to devote on whether, I don't know, I have no idea. And most people in that same place. Yes, I've been accused of uh, like with different jobs that have had different shows and even working for the UFC have someone telling me what I can and can't say. And that's just not the case. But most of what I do is super simple. I'll just talking about fights, like if someone told me not to talk about something, it would be like not much significance. Okay. It's just about a martial arts event while you're talking about is these discoveries that could potentially impact untold thousands of people in a very beneficial or in a very negative way. So everybody's got that worry people. But again, it's being on the outside. That's what

Speaker 2:          02:38:34       I totally get that because when, and especially when we're in a country where we're all pretty comfortable and we all have plenty of food and we have a few bucks in our wallet to do stuff that we do tend to focus on the, the worries and I'm the what ifs because everything's fine. We're afraid of something upsetting the apple cart. But I can tell you as a scientist that if I were to find something like just through some process, through some experiment, find something wrong with a Monsanto product or a dow product or whatever, I don't like to just pick on the big m I find something wrong with a product in agriculture that would shift the paradigm, that would change it from something safe and used everywhere to something that we better have some alarming care with. Um, that would be something that it, when I published that it would be on the best journal, it'll be in science or nature and then it would be replicated by other labs right away. As soon as it was published, I would get huge notoriety. I'd get grants forever. I wouldn't be in that 5% anymore. I'd be getting leading grants because I was the guy who broke the rules. I was the one who broke the paradigm and probably get a Nobel prize out of it.

Speaker 4:          02:39:37       So you don't, you don't think to do would be any negative repercussions before it was clearly established that you are correct. I mean, if you're, what like we were talking about before, if it's involving a corporation that's profiting in the billion dollar range and making an insane amounts of money and you have some information that would put a monkey wrench into the gears of this incredible moneymaking venture, you don't think would,

Speaker 2:          02:39:59       could repercussions. No, I'll tell you exactly what would happen. And I'm sure this is what would happen. The first people I would let know would be the company that makes it, gets your product off the market. Here's what I got. And then your brakes would fill in your car, arsenic would show up. Tuna fish. Well,

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       let's see. That's the kind of stuff that you only movies and, yeah. And then once again, going back, you know, Dr Evil, you know, um, but, but it's, I think that a company who would make them, who, if someone were to reveal a mistake, they would be the first ones who would want to know. And they might, because they would have proven though by history and in an ancient, and when you go back and you talk about, sure. Things like hobby GM, right? How about this whole fucking ignition thing? We talked about it earlier today. They knew and they kept their fucking mouth shut. No, it's a good point. You know, and it's, and it, it ties in with my kind of naive idealism sometimes I think everybody's going to do the right time. I know. Honk rock hippy, I know, but at the same time, but the other side of the coin is, is that, uh, if I were, if I was the guy who discovered the ignition issue and I were in, I was an investigative reporter and I was able to put together seven or eight cases of this and we'll tie it to the ignition and did a study that analyzed the mechanism of failure.

Speaker 3:          02:41:08       And I went to GE or GM and said, this is a problem. This doesn't work. And they refuse to respond. I'd put this in the newspapers that I would look at it, I put a blog that everybody would see. I'd come here and talk to you about it and I would blow the lid off of that and I'd get a Pulitzer Prize.

Speaker 4:          02:41:24       Right. An awesome book. And the book would get published and you'd make kazillions

Speaker 3:          02:41:28       well hopefully, and it's a, but this is how it should work is that we got to have, but those are scientific processes that go through a series of steps to develop evidence that's analyzed to come to a conclusion and then we can shape policy based on that. And that's where I get excited about, about what we can do at sign.

Speaker 4:          02:41:45       Well there, I mean there's reasons that people were worried though about information leaking out that could harm companies. I mean he's reasons why people shield their identity when they're leaking certain information because if they get caught and then those, those companies get really pissed off and they, even if it's just lawsuits, I mean any company like Monsanto could cripple any normal person just with lawsuits. You would never be able to keep up. They're just smash it with lawsuits. When you are in charge of this kind of information, obviously we're not talking about the conspiratorial stuff we're talking about like the nutritional things, like the bananas that you're passionate about, that the vitamin A and m. Um, what is that feeling like when you, you, you're being ignored or you're being, either it's a conspiracy by these companies that they don't want, or these people that they don't want to open up the door for genetically modified foods or it's ignorance to the science involved with these people and they're, they're massive amounts of blindness. What does it feel like to be the guy who knows? Because that seems that's gotta be a crazy place to be, to be the scientist who actually understands the mechanisms involved in the creation of these very organic products that were manipulated by human beings and how they could benefit human beings. Nobody understands you. They're all thinking you're fucking crazy, or you're a shale, or what does that feel?

Speaker 3:          02:43:07       And it's horrible. But this is why I appreciate you so much and letting me do this and why people like Kara Santa Maria who has been so helpful and talking about the GMO issue. Um, it, it is an opera. Anytime we can talk about this and get people to understand, you know, where I'm coming from, that there's trust here. Um, Joe, every night I answer 30 minutes to an hour of emails from the concern public who asks questions to me about this. I was watching your Twitter today, your feed between yesterday when I announced it, you were going to be on and today, dude, you've been nonstop. I mean your tireless with this stuff. You have a real, an incredible passion for this. I've done Reddit's where, um, I would say I'll come on with an ask me anything for, uh, two hours and I'll stay on for six.

Speaker 3:          02:43:49       I'll stay on, I'll answer a thousand questions. Every one of them hand done. What? I mean, I'm not cutting and pasting. I'm addressing that person's concern because this is how we're going to change it. It comes from talking to people who have concerns and and people who are worried and help them understand the science. Because if they get this, then they're less likely to worry about the real problems and ever. That's why we were that the artificial problems and start focusing on the real problems. And how important is it to fund more public science and to try in some way to make more people attracted to what you're doing as opposed to going over to these universities. Because if people really are concerned, like probably that's the best way to deal with it. The best way to deal with sciences to fund science. Yes, 100% it's the fun science and make sure that public scientists have the tools they need to maintain.

Speaker 3:          02:44:42       They don't get corrupted. The idea of being corrupted seems so tempting. Well, but it, but you know, when we had to have to be careful because, because companies can't fund individual laboratories or programs or universities and, and it doesn't necessarily mean corruption. Of course they can be very beneficial and then they can help us a lot. And, and I would love to have Monsanto hand me a check for 5 million bucks and say, have at it. Do what you want. I bet it's on the way. Right? I been waiting an awfully long time Joe and people have been saying it for, for 20 years now that I should be getting everyone ready. They're ready. They're writing that check right now. They're just licked the pen. But a movie. The other really cool thing though that we can do is, is I think get kids fired up about science and with kids.

Speaker 3:          02:45:22       I find that this idea of genetic engineering isn't a big deal to them. That they kind of get it and they see it's kind of like molecular Lego's. They kind of get the idea that you can, uh, take something out of one thing and move it to another. You can move traits. You can. Kids have this kind of, uh, uh, modular understanding of the world anyway, that they're comfortable with bits and pieces coming together in different ways to make different products. And when we talk, I spend about maybe two or three mornings a month with third to fifth grade or seventh graders, mostly third and fifth. That's, there's a lot of fun. Third graders have the best. And we talk about how to solve the citrus problem. And I told her graders, yeah, how many of them say magic? Uh, well, you know what they say even crazier stuff, which is great.

Speaker 3:          02:46:09       Well, and start us, I'll give you an example. Like I show them my way. I teach this as I show them what the problem is, that there's a, an insect that moves a bacterium to a tree that get sick and it dies from bad nutrition. And I'll say, what are the, and I'll show them all that and I'll say, okay, stop. Now you guys are the scientists. Give me a solution. And the hands go up. And one of them will say, give it better nutrition. And then another one will say, uh, maybe you could cross it with a tree that doesn't get sick. And they get that, you know, they're, they've, they've got sex figured out. Well by then, um, then you talk about, um, uh, then one of 'em will say in the funny one was build them in a dome under the sea where the bug can't get to them, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:46:45       And, and the challenge for me, that one's awesome. Yeah. Well I, I told the teacher to keep an eye on, the cool part about that though is that he's right. If you could isolate the things from the insect. And so my challenge as a teacher in that scenario when I'm interrogating their interest in science, is to somehow never tell one of them that they're crazy, that I have to take whatever answer they give me in somehow loop it back to, well, here's how you're writing, how it just might work. Oh, I see a hundred percent attempting encouragement of curiosity. I am getting kids to creatively solve a problem and a dome under the ocean at Dome under the ocean and you know what? And, and when you do that, but then when you, then I should do that. Then I go forward into the slides about how we are solving the problem.

Speaker 3:          02:47:32       I can say, you know, Dave, you raised your hand and said, use better nutrition. Look at how they're using nutrients to make it better. Someone else said you control the insect. Here's five ways they're controlling the insect. It shows these kids, they validate that their suspicions about science and that their creative juices that solve the problem were correct. So how do you address the kid but the dome onto the ocean? What do you cause there's so many fucking problems with that idea. Well, I tell him in school, but there's a whole photosynthesis issue. There's oxygen. You'd run out of air. Yeah, there's Kranz and paint and things in the world needs artists. And I kind of can steer them that direction. So what do you I I, I'm very like Stephen King, like the Dome Mu Three road. I made a whole fucking ocean garden that way if there's ways to tie them back in.

Speaker 3:          02:48:14       But I think the whole idea is, is that they're so used to their teacher saying wrong. That, here's a case where I set up a situation around a real problem that's in their state, may be in their yard that allows them to actually exercise their science muscles as little kids. And I think that's a big way we changed this. Yeah. That is a really important point when it comes to human beings, little children is figuring out a way to not make their curiosity in negative, you know, don't scold them for having a ridiculous imagination, you know, express the issue with it or how it could be. Right. And why it's probably wrong, you know, but, and you got to figure out a way to reward them for taking that chance to come up with this dome under the ocean. Cause that, who knows, that kid might have three of those that suck, but one of those that everybody goes, hey, wait a minute. Well that's the paradigm shift. Goddamn point. Yeah. That's what we want. And there's a great video, a great ted talk by named Alison Gopnik

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       and Alison, I forget where she's at, maybe Berkeley. She is a a scientist who studies the way kids think and she shows that children when they're born and through the next few months are actually the smartest they've ever going to be in terms of their ability to test hypotheses and synthesize information. And she shows the way kids do this. And so, uh, that maybe I don't want to be like an indictment of the way we train people, but there's a certain amount of curiosity and exploration that we tend to break out a kids. And I think, um, as, as an educator, as someone who was really committed to education, that getting to kids is the most important way to get science to improve, get them so excited about the cool things we can do. And uh, it breaks my heart when I have a kid show up at the march against Monsanto who's holding a sign saying, your science causes autism. It doesn't. And here's a kid who's going to now go through life thinking science is evil and done by evil people with evil intentions. When, uh, when really we're, we're trying to get that kid may hold the solution to the next big citrus crisis.

Speaker 4:          02:50:13       Yeah. It's, it's unbelievably ironic that so many anti-science websites are online. I mean, just the idea. How the fuck do you think that computer got built on? Exactly. All natural, all natural is an apple. This is not an all natural computer you're typing as recipe through. It's, um, yeah, I think it's really important that people recognize that science has brought us virtually every single thing that you enjoy today, uh, outside of the natural world outside of coconuts falling and you eat them. You know, there's, there's so much that we have relied on science about the way we stay warm, the way we keep things cool, the way we communicate with each other. And this fear that people have about foods being modified, I think is, it's, it's a big one and it's one of the biggest ones in this country. And so to have a guy like you come on and express why we should be concerned and why we shouldn't be concerned. And why, what, what the positive aspects of our, I think, I think it's really, really important, man. I think a lot of people need to hear what you have to say and they need to be able to listen to it from an objective standpoint and understand that this is a very complex issue. It's a very complex and it's very important.

Speaker 2:          02:51:25       I appreciate that. We'd have time to talk about it because it's something that I really encourage people. There's places where you can get great resources. Um, there's a blog called biofortified.org which is written by scientists who are independent scientists and it really is just an information hub about this particular topic. And, uh, some of the articles are, articles are clever. They're all written very softly. There nothing is, you know, [inaudible] it's all really about the science and it's independent. It's not funded by any of the companies.

Speaker 4:          02:51:55       Have you ever thought about doing a podcast cause you'd be excellent at it? I would love to do it. There's some funny things about that. Um, uh, he can't talk about anti podcast clause and your university contract or something. No, I have a podcast.

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       I do, but I don't do it as me. Oh, you son of a bitch. I do it as I do it as a character. And it was no dare you, you can't talk about it. And I can't talk about it because, did you mention it for them? They're going to find it. They're gonna find it. And I guess the problem is, is that wants things from me. I know what the, once the cat's out of the bag, the funny part is, that's too bad. The reason I wanted to keep it secret though, and maybe here's my appeal to, don't go look for it. Okay. But it's still secret. What's it about science and you're a character on a science podcast. Yeah. Ooh, I'm a moderator who taught him. They're gonna know that. And I guess I'll figure it out, but I'll keep it going anyway.

Speaker 1:          02:52:42       I mean, keep it going. Don't admit to it, no matter what Colbert did it for how many years, you know? So, uh, and it's very much along that line. It's very much along that line. It's a, it's, it's a lot of fun talking about the play a dummy or a smart guy, uh, a dumb smart guy. Oh, so you play a guy who doesn't understand the science and you have to correct people or they have to correct you. Is that what happened? Or something like that. So you played the antagonists and so they come along and then they have to use you as a tool to get to the root of the problem, the ignorance of people that was signed essentially. Yes. And then some stuff that's completely off the wall and it's, but it's, it's, it's really fun because it's a great way to get the science out there and it allows me to have some fun as a, uh, as, as a character that I couldn't have as a, uh, established professor and chairman of, of, of a, of a department.

Speaker 1:          02:53:28       Totally understood. Yeah. That also is now linked to a great song online. Well, you need his rapper name, you know how yams have their own separate name. It'd be Yam. And then they have the other thing. You need a rapper named dude. Yeah, I do have one. I like, what is it? Write it down. I'm not going to say it. I hope it's like Kaiser San Jose. Most things are, it's one, it's one better. You can even, you can even look it up online here. Okay. That's it. I can't talk about that. Don't talk. It just doesn't violate your trust. I think it's good because the thing is, is that I do want to talk to people who don't agree with, um, technology. Well, why don't you do this? Why don't you have a podcast where people, instead of like you've seen you, I've seen rather you spend so much time typing.

Speaker 1:          02:54:11       I'm sure you can type or you can talk while they're quicker than you can type all that shit out. So why don't you just take those questions and have people send them to you every week. And if they're not redundant, just that way you can choose, you know what you've already dressed and you could say, hey, we covered that in podcast two or three. You would have a kick ass podcast man, I'd be happy to support it too. Well, why don't we, why don't we talk about that and I always so easy to do. The one I wanted to do was the uh, crop domestication podcast where I talked about finally someone's doing that. I wanted to know the one we talk about this, the strawberries and the yams house stuff. I wanted to talk about each one of their stories and how they came to be an interview, the experts and so great idea and it, and so all these things are kicking around.

Speaker 1:          02:54:50       The problem is is I have three full time jobs. I mean I'm an administrator, um, for a department of 59 faculty. I'm a full time research scientist and I'm a full time science communicator. And so, um, I literally do work 6:00 AM to midnight seven days a week. And uh, and except for exercise time, you know, the stuff I do there I am, uh, I'm, I'm in this, what are you hiding from? What are you running from running from something? No, I don't know. I guess. I think a lot of work, I guess I guess when I'm running from is uh, I'm, I'm, I'm running from, um, I'm waiting for one of these things to wear out where I can just cut it back to two. That's an amazing work ethic that you have and I can understand why you wouldn't have enough time, but if you have enough time to do all these tweets, I'm saying even if he just did a half an hour once a week.

Speaker 1:          02:55:33       Yeah. If you just for a half an hour once a week, just got a collection of maybe you can get an intern to collect some of the best questions. I'm sure somebody be happy to do that. You press record on an iPhone, that's all you need to do. I mean, the, the, the quality of the recording you get from a regular iPhone is pretty much worth it. You can hold it up to your mouth and just go over the piece of people could hear you turn the paper. Okay. What do we got here? Okay. This one, this is important and just ramble into the microphone and I'm telling you it would be popular as fuck and you'd be able to quit your other jobs. None of that. And that works great. Actually, I have used the iPhone in my character issues dot and a, and they got a nice mixer at home.

Speaker 1:          02:56:09       I pumped, punch it through the mixer so you know how to do this stuff. This is all second nature. I mean, I used to be in a band, you know. Oh that's right. I know. But I imagine there's a couple things I would, and I love doing this kind of media stuff. It would be a really easy thing for me to do. It's just a question of where to wedge it into a full schedule. You really gotta try it. You really, I think you'd be excellent on it cause you're were really great today. I really, really appreciate talking to you. Do you ever feel like moving out of Florida? Cause it's too stupid. Um, you know it the first be honest. No, I, I, I, I've actually, I really love Florida. I really it, you know why though? But it's my job that does it.

Speaker 1:          02:56:42       I never planned on being there. Um, I only Gainesville, yes. I used to live in Gainesville. Yeah. My Dad went to the University of Florida. I didn't know that. Yeah. My stepdad went there for architecture or something. Well, I, I totally admire the faculty there and when I had the opportunity to apply there, I applied and thinking there's no way I'll ever get the call. And I got the interview and then I interviewed and I thought, there's no way I'll ever get the job. And then when they called me for the job, um, you know, I showed up and I, I've always felt like the, uh, the guy on the all star team who just gets to put on the team because he's, you know, the, uh, his team didn't have anybody else. I, you know, I'm so surrounded by good people. I always feel very dwarfed there.

Speaker 1:          02:57:21       But, um, uh, 12 years later, they are, 10 years later they put me in charge of it. So I must be doing something right. But you obviously have a real passion for it. And like I said, you're in Florida. You got to be the smartest guy in Florida by far. It's you and Billy Corbin. She get together. He would dominate Florida level. He is the director of cocaine cowboys. I don't know him. He's awesome. I thought you meant the smashing pump. No, no, no, no, no. The thing in Florida is every time the news story breaks about, you know, the, the guy having relations with a sandwich or you know, uh, Florida, I go home. Please don't be here. Please don't be a thing. If you've ever seen the Florida man Twitter account, no. One of the greatest fucking things the world's ever known. Okay, I'll watch your spare time.

Speaker 1:          02:58:01       Go to the Florida man Twitter feed and just read like fucking crazy how many morons or are in Florida. Yeah. It's all true. I mean, I, you know, I, I, I have a great relationship with the growers in our state and the people who are doing the farming and the people in those industries. There's a lot of great people in Florida. Don't get me wrong. No, no, I'm not. But there's a lot of morons too. Absolutely. I'm on the morons in California and that, but that's why it would be hard to pull me away is because you develop relationships with these people who are, who are seriously struggling. And you look at the citrus industry, strawberry industry, um, with the competition they're getting is unprecedented. And these are folks down the highway who are farming to feed us good food and doing everything they can to stay afloat.

Speaker 1:          02:58:44       And I am so glad that to be all the work with them, Kevin Fault. But thank you very much. And please do a God damn podcast where you serve. These people would love it. I think you could help a lot of people by answering a lot of questions like you did today. You were fantastic. I appreciate the hell out of you, man. Don't do it very, very much. People. You can follow him on Twitter. It's Kevin Folta, f o l t a on Twitter. Your website is k Folta at blog spot. It's a blog called illumination. Beautiful. Is there a link to that from your Twitter feed? Um, but yeah, just somewhere in there. Okay. Okay. All Right, ladies and gentlemen. That's it. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Big Cast.

Speaker 7:          02:59:15       All right.
