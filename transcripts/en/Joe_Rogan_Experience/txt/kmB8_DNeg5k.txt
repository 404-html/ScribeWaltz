Today we happen to have Aubrey, the CEO of [inaudible] dot com with us, so he could tell us lots of groovy shit about on it. I'm on on it right now. I'm wearing a tee shirt and I'm hopped up on Alpha brain, some fucking Alpha brain dreams. Last night, son, go good googly moonlight. I took Alpha brain with dinner and uh, I went to bed about four hours later and had paula deen wrestling dreams. I was wrestling Paula Paula Dean on a psychedelic rainbow is the most bizarre shit there was skateboards involved and it was the drippings at. Even if you're going to get an animation of that now, the birth of that into the ether, one can only hope if I'm even if Alpha brain didn't, it didn't enhance your cognitive function, which it does, and now it's been clinically proven to do so. It's worth taking just for the fucking dreams, man. I believe it's Coleen is a Columbian.

Speaker 2:          00:06:07       Coleen helps regulate the rem state in your sleep. And Rem state is the dream state. So the more acetylcholine you have, generally the longer and deeper your rem states going to be. So the crazier dreams can get,

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       so whether or not even want to take Alpha brain, double up on that Acetylcholine and go for a wild ride and it's a safe ride folks. Okay. You're not going to die. You might think you're going to die, but I'm pretty sure you can die in your dreams. Has that ever been proven can die in your dreams? Right? You just wake up. That works. I don't know if that's a fact. Yeah. No. Yeah, because you could lie about it. I thought in my dream people will be like, well the fucking. But if.

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       Well usually the adrenaline of the pre death moment usually wakes you up. Okay. Yeah. Like,

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       yeah. Yeah. The other thing I've found with Alpha brain that's really interesting is that lucid dreams are much more. They're much more durable. Like I've always found that whatever. I've never taken any lucid dream, uh, courses. I've never read any books and lucid dreams. Apparently there's a lot of strategies that you can use and one of them have done that I saw in one of those silly movies, like the secret one of those movies. What was the rabbit hole or whatever, what the bleep do we know? I think it was where a guy was saying, go to every door that you walk through and before you walked through a knock on the wall and say, am I dreaming? And do it as a habit so that every time you go through a door you go, am I dreaming? One time I did it my dream and it was like, whoosh. Oh fuck. Um, and so, uh, I really did wake up in the middle of a dream and it was, but it was very, very durable. It was really interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:07:41       Yeah. You can stay in it and play with it and see what, see where you can take it. Yeah. That's not normal. Usually I go, oh my God, I'm dreaming and I wake up and then it's gone parties over instantly. Like I've had a few where I was flying for like 15 seconds or something like that. But the Alpha brain dream. How long does it take for you to turn to lucid dream into sex? Because all, instantly, instantly I find someone and just start a rape fast. You know, in the dreams they all want to fuck, which has reared in your mind. It's my dreams. Very exciting since

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       I've been here last. We were finally able to publish some of the, uh, the first of a series of clinical tests and the first one on Alpha brain. So tell, tell some people about that because it's pretty exciting.

Speaker 2:          00:08:27       Yeah. We did a pilot study just to kind of prove the concept with the Boston Center for memory and a double blind placebo controlled study. People took to Alpha brain pills, which was kind of hard to figure out because we did a survey and a lot of people take three, but the majority is still take to some people or some people take one. A few savages take for you in J. Hawk take for fees. Averages take four. So we went with two and um, you know, and did a study testing a bunch of cognitive markers and even with a small sample size we had 17 people total go through. We're able to achieve statistical significance in a couple of key tests, stroop inhibition, test, executive cognitive functioning, some verbal memory tests. So some really good indications that the Alpha brain is having the desired effect that you know all the people who take it and you know, everybody who likes it as has been talking about now we have some science to back it up. So we're currently in a followup study with about 80 patients that's halfway through right now. It's kind of a rolling enrollment and so hopefully we'll get some of that data at least to us by the summer. And then you look at the publication and presentation scheduled, but they're stoked. I actually found out after the results came out that they didn't expect it to work. Not The people who are doing it. They're like, Whoa, shit.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       It's really worked well for folks who don't know before we did any studies on on it. There have been studies done on the individual individual ingredients of Alpha brain and that's something like people go, there's no forgiveness is snake oil. It's not at all. Snake oil did the. The concept behind Alpha brain was just that they would work synergistically, which has proven to be correct, but the ingredients, the individual ingredients, there is science behind it. There's research and references. All of it's available at [inaudible] dot com, so go there if you're interested, what on it is. Even if you go there, you're like, what the fuck are these guys doing? They're preparing for war were a human optimization website and what that means is we're trying to sell you things that can enhance your cognitive function, enhance your mood, enhance your physical fitness, enhance your body's ability to do work, enhance the way your body functions, and there's a lot of stuff out there that does that, whether it's new mood, which is a five htp and l tryptophan supplement that actually can enhance your brain's ability to produce serotonin.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       It's pretty spectacular stuff. It really does make your mood better or whether it's strength and conditioning equipment like the Zombie bells and kettlebells are a primal bells, which are kettlebells that we had designed by Steven Steuben Junior. That's how I say his name. You got it. Steven Shubin Junior. That's fucking awesome. Artists has made us these incredible kettle bells that are also works of art. I know people that have these that don't even work out. They just have them because they're fucking cool. It's just a cool thing to have laying around your house, especially the gorilla. He's my all time favorite. I just love working out with that gorilla man. It makes me feel like, like I'm doing something special. I just set the top secret monster bell series. I know that that's coming out in 2014 by lots of bells. I've seen some of that. I've seen some of that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       the Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 3:          00:11:50       Try My podcast by all day.

Speaker 1:          00:11:57       First of all, Robert Greene. Thank you very much for doing the podcast. I really appreciate it. Pleasure to meet you. Pleasure to have you in here. Um, I've heard many, many, many fantastic things about you, but this guy over here raves, rants and raves and I know you were recently on the warrior poet project podcast, which is his podcast and he couldn't say enough good things. So, uh, had to have you in here, man. Had to have to learn some stuff. Have to figure out what you've accumulated for all your years of research and writing books and your books all seemed to be about getting your shit together. About producing results.

Speaker 4:          00:12:33       Yeah. Starting with the 48 laws of power, I basically decided to enter the self help genre with a lot of trepidation because I think it's full of a lot of bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       Wait a minute, hold on. What are you saying?

Speaker 4:          00:12:47       I'm saying that it's filled with a lot of tree stuff that's gonna make you feel good about yourself. That's going to boost your ego a bit, but doesn't get anything. There's nothing real behind it that there's, there's some things about life that are harsh. There are people out there that are dirty and mean that you need to know about. There's all sorts of things that aren't being discussed in these books. And I know for instance, when I started out, like in Hollywood, I used to work in Hollywood, um, I was really shocked by all of the kind of power maneuvers and the kind of passive aggressive games that were going on. What did you do in Hollywood? I wasn't horribly successful. I was a writer. I was assistant to a producer, assistant to a director or a researcher, a story developer. I basically did everything.

Speaker 4:          00:13:41       So you were where you were connected to the machine, you were in there? Very much so you got to see the gear span. Very much so. And nobody writes about what really goes on in the world. I got so sick of it. I see, you know, all sorts of weird games being played. The one director, this one producer who wanted to direct his first film and basically it would look bad if he was the director of something that he had sort of put together, just wouldn't look good politically. So what he did is he hired somebody he knew would do a terrible job, a director, first time director, he knew the guy would fail and then he could go in and rescue him and become the director on the project. But in the meantime, totally destroying this other person's reputation on and on. I could list 100 other sorts of games like that. That's quite clever. Move all sorts of things right out of the art of war.

Speaker 1:          00:14:30       That's basically, that's just what I can jump in here and give a bit of my story. I found that book, Robert Greene's 48 laws of power before I had met you and I was in kind of a dark time in my own work climate and I started reading it and I started realizing all of the things that were happening. Like, Oh shit, that's what's going on. That's why this bad shit is happening.

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       That's why I'm being thwarted in this, in this goal that I have. You know, because you go in with these good natured intentions thinking, I'm just going to do my best. I'm gonna wear my heart on my sleeve. And it's all gonna work out bullshit, it doesn't work out, it's all his. But you can kind of get lucky and get in touch with the right people to be, yeah, or be in the right in the right situation. But a lot of times if you're in a kind of politically charged situation or a situation with a lot of ego, uh, his book was like this, this wake up call of just sheer, unabated truth about what the fuck is going on. It's not so that I could do it myself, but at least so I could see myself and see it and identify it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:32       So the, this, this move that this producer did in order to. And that surprise you at all when you were, you like, oh, you must have

Speaker 5:          00:15:40       fucker completely. Because he never told me. Obviously it wasn't going to confide that this was going on. I, it's my interpretation later on. So you're sure that that's what happened? Or completely, 100 percent. And I've seen him do other things. So I saw, what's his name? What's that? I can't date you, shouldn't he? He's, he's no longer among us. So I don't want to fuck around and he wasn't, it wasn't a totally awful person, you know, he had a good side to him that is ripe with that stuff though. What really annoyed the hell out of me about the Hollywood businesses that people would pretend to be so liberal and wonderful and good. I love your project. You're wonderful, you're great. But at the same time they were so fucking power hungry. Yeah. Then nobody really talks about the power hungry side and about what people are really up.

Speaker 1:          00:16:30       I worked with a guy on my very first sitcoms. The first time I ever did any acting at all. I was like 20 something, 25 I guess, or 26 and I was on the show on Fox called hardball and there was a guy that was on the show that would insult people right before it was their time to perform. Like you would say something about what are you fucking gaining Wayne here? Like something, what's going on with the gut? And the guy would be like, what? And then you'd see the guy perform with this. Like he would fuck with you. It's pretty good. I've seen it. It was really interesting to watch. It was bizarre, but it wasn't pretty good. It was really shitty of them, you know, you did it to me once and I went, what, what the fuck did you say? And then I cornered him and I said, dude, I go, don't insult me.

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       I go, because you're an ugly fuck, you understand who you are. I go, we could just start talking about what's wrong with you? Fuck this in. The guy would go, come on, we got to film the scene. I go, no, I go, this guy's a dick. I just kinda likes to talk shit to be. But right before they. And everybody was like, what is he doing? He's calling out the thing that, you know, this guy's doing like, you're not supposed to do that. But he would be like really subtle about it. You know? He'd be like, who picked out that shirt? Like weird shit to girls to man. It wasn't just a guys, but this was his thing. He would be like really catty and he was always reading like entertainment weekly. He was always reading, I would call the devil's rag,

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       like the Hollywood reporter, all that Shitty, but read those things and you'll see the little fucking power wheels spinning in his devious mind. Luckily he's dropped off the face of the planet fortunately. So you could read some of Robert Green's books, like strategies of war maybe and probably find some tactic in there that this guy was applying in order to weaken his, his people that gain power probably. Right? I mean, does anything come to mind Robert?

Speaker 7:          00:18:13       Oh, several come to mind. Mostly passive aggression

Speaker 6:          00:18:16       creatively though that stuff is very ineffective because I firmly, absolutely, wholeheartedly believe that if you put your effort into diminishing others creatively, it diminishes your own creative ability. I really do believe that. I also believed that performance wise, if you try to diminish someone's performance, like as an actor, this is one of the reasons why this guy sucked. He was so transparent, like he's such a shitty person. You know the guy that he did it with, a guy called fat to wanting to kill him. I had to talk the guy out a calender like you want this big fucking guy, like you know, it shouldn't call them fat. Even if he is fat, like he was doing it to fuck with the guy right before it's seen because he wanted to shine. He wanted to. He wanted to be the guy in the scene that was really on top of the ball. Yeah, so the key thing is to know these strategies so you can do with what he puts in there. It's called the reversal, you know, like how to be aware of it and then reverse it.

Speaker 7:          00:19:06       Well, the main thing is to never get emotional in these situations. If you're in control of yourself and you can do like Joe did, you can sort of see the game behind the game. Then you're in the position to do something that strategic like he did to to play the same game back at. It's mostly like a warrior. I call it kind of a warrior pose where if you're calm and centered and you're aware and in the moment of what the other person is doing, then you've got strategic options to play the game back. But if you get emotional, you get angry, you get intimidated, then forget about it.

Speaker 6:          00:19:39       So yeah, I would probably today respond very differently, but when I was in my early twenties, it was scorched earth. Every time I was, I was going to def con nine. Every time I'm like, let's see who can hold their breath the longest. I'll drag him in a pool. That was always my strategy just because I was always nice to people, but as soon as people weren't nice to me, I just said that's a good way to be very bad way of handling it. Um, but that, that thing that people do seems to be not just calculated, but it seems to be something that's been going on since the beginning of time. As soon as people invented language and they invented the ability to deceive,

Speaker 7:          00:20:17       you're touching upon the subject of my next book. That's why I'm smiling. What is that? It's tentatively called the laws of human nature and essentially I'm saying that somewhere around 10,000 years ago, maybe 6,000 are nature was set because we've started living in groups that were larger than 10, 23, the size of a tribe, and once you put 100 people together, all sorts of political game start happening and things like envy and passive aggression and basic

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       irrational responses. They already occurred in the time of the Bible and so there are these laws of human nature that are so deeply ingrained in the third grade, just like a chimpanzee will react a certain way under certain circumstances, and I'm going to show you what these were. These laws come from why people are envious. Wife, people are insecure. Why? Somebody who has a certain exterior of face that they present to the world wide, it's generally hiding the opposite on and on and on, so you have. You can understand where people's behavior comes from and not be surprised by it anymore. So

Speaker 6:          00:21:23       what you present is steps to recognize cons.

Speaker 4:          00:21:28       Yeah, but you know what? There's a little bit of cut and everyone and all of us, including myself and you guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And those who deny it and I hopefully you're not. One of them deny our are actually are actually crypto club.

Speaker 6:          00:21:43       I was so excited. That's a greatest word. That's a great band name by the way. You can use a crypto conscious. Yeah. If I was going to start a band, it might be the crypto can just end up getting arrested just so they'd have to talk about it on CNN. Like they did pussy riot, but it was my favorite thing. Favorite thing about pussy riot was great. Them talking about it. I can name see riot. The members of pussy riot. I was like, stop. This can't be real. This is a beautiful time. Beautiful time in history. Those girls are fucking bad ass man. Not just bad ass for their. Their ability to come up with an awesome name, but they get arrested. They spent fucking how many months in Siberia they get out and start protesting at the Olympics. Horse whipped. Those chicks are fucking gangster.

Speaker 6:          00:22:29       They're so gangster. I love pussy riot. I'm a huge fan of their music sucks and I don't even know if it does. It probably does live performance on Jerry Pussy riot make it happen. So the crypto con, so that's just my next book. Yeah, everyone. Does everyone have content in them because they're reacting to other cons or do you think that everyone has like a selfish aspect to them that's undeniable? I mean, what? What is it about people that you think everyone has a little bit of continuity? Is it reactionary or is it. Is it actionary set?

Speaker 4:          00:23:03       Both. It's both. I suppose there might've been one saintly figure in our history who doesn't have any of this, maybe a Jesus or something, but pretty much the. The underlying philosophy of all my books, particularly the 48 laws of power is it human beings have a primal need for power and we've. We've used that word power in the wrong way. When we think of power, we think of white men up in the White House controlling the world. I try and bring power down to an everyday level and say the feeling that you have no control over your life, over your destiny, over the people around you, your children, your wife is the most miserable feeling that any human can have, that you have no power over them, no ability to them and so stunned in the age of one, two years old, we have had this feeling of insecurity, of weakness and we want to have control and power over the people around us, the events that go on in life, and that is the source for a lot of our manipulative behavior. Some people are overtly manipulative and very dangerous that way, but all of us, all of us engage at some point or another in something that teeters on manipulation and my books are about. Let's just be honest about who we are. Instead of trying to imagine that we were somehow descended from angels instead of primates. No, we're descended from chimpanzees. If you studied chimpanzees that are pretty machiavellian creatures, that's where we come from. Let's be honest about the human being. Instead of trying to pretend that we're all born like Gandhi,

Speaker 5:          00:24:36       well the the chimpanzee has one thing that we don't and that's language or we have one thing that they don't rather, which is language and language is where things get weird because you get deception. Yes, and you also get strategy. You were chimps, have some strategy, like you ever seen the videos where they chased monkeys, where they, they corner him on the sides and then other chimps rush them towards them and they climb up and they eat them. It's pretty radical stuff and until the 19 nineties, people didn't even know that champs eight monkeys, you know, they thought these beautiful berry eating friends and they eat bananas. Like curious George. No, not really. They fucking rip monkeys apart. Needham alive and engaged in warfare. Yes they do. They engage in warfare against other chimps. They get engaged in it in a very strategic sense. They have lines where they're not allowed to cross and when they do cross, they they, they take action. This is actually an interesting topic because if you read Chris Ryan, he's had proposes a theory that this behavior that they've observed, the chimp warring was created by the artificial production of this food box in the, in the chimps habitat. When they were observing them, they would have food around that. They were giving the chimps. Right, so this is this. This is pretty well done. They didn't see any of that prior to the food box.

Speaker 4:          00:25:52       Oh No, no, no, no. I don't know who Chris Ryan is, but I, I think that's very wrong.

Speaker 5:          00:25:55       Well, Jane Goodall observed this, but to keep the chimps around, she had a box of food. So this is a fact. Right? And after that it created this zero sum game where the chimps were competing for a limited resource of food, which actually goes to the argument that when you create a civilization and it's not just tribal and it becomes a zero sum game, that's when the war and the strategy gets to a peak because you're creating a zero sum game. There's a limited amount of resource, a limited amount of crop, or in the case of the chimpanzees a limited amount of food that was coming out of this box, so only a certain number of the chimps would get the food. So kind of interesting. I just thought I'd bring that up and when Dr Ryan's on here, you can certainly bring that up next week. He'll be on the 11th. What was your issue with what he said? Well,

Speaker 7:          00:26:44       it's always a zero sum game. Why isn't it a zero sum game and it's always limited foods, but there's always. There's more resource you can go to. You're not competing for one very specific section. You can go to more acres, more hectares of land and find the grubs or the fruits or whatever of that, of that area rather than competing over. I don't want to argue with somebody that had on red, so maybe he has a very valid point. I haven't read it so it's not fair for me to. But it does. It doesn't affect your. It doesn't affect your theory that once you're in civilization, these games begin and the tighter the resources in that civilization I bigger cities and the more closely people working together, the more fever pitch these games. Well, I don't want to, I don't want to get on a tangent here, but there's a writer, a scientist named Eo Wilson.

Speaker 7:          00:27:29       I'm a biologist and he's pretty much demonstrated that are our earliest human ancestors going back to Australopithecines. Um, we're engaging in forms of warfare. Sure. So he wants to sort of debunk the notion of the happy, peaceful savage that that goes back to Jacques Rousseau, etc. That we do have very violent roots. And so maybe chimpanzees, iT becomes a zero sum if there's overpopulation and they're fighting over smaller territories, which we humans we're doing as we became more populous. So he was trying to debunk the notion that it's only at the advent of agriculture where we started living in settlements and became civilized at warfare began. And he shows very clearly that the beginnings of warfare go back hundreds of thousands of years. Well,

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       it seems unavoidable. It seems like all animals who compete for breeding rights, who compete for food, they, they engage in some form of combat. Deers regularly kill each other, you know, that happens with elk. It happens with stables, stables, with those crazy big horns that they have. They fucking, they spear each other and they kill each other. Um, I had louis throw on the podcast yesterday and uh, he, one of his documentaries, he had this african hunting camp where they sort of, these canned hunts where they have these high fence operations and they breed all these animals and they have these samples in their fucking murdering each other. They knew eAch other and gouge each other when, when the females are invalid, are staples that they're like, it's one of those crazy fucking deer things. You pull up a picture of a sable jamie. It's a one of those african dear, like creatures with big crazy horns.

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       They have these fucking murder weapons or if they have built in their face, you know, that's really what they have. Um, but the point being is that yeah, there they are. Those guys murder each other. It looks like an oryx similar. Yeah, there's a. There's a lot of those different types of antlered horned animals that they clash heads. I mean that's what they do. They go to war with each other. It's. It seems to be a part. I mean it's also part of genetic selection. It seems be unavoidable and I've always felt that when we look at the timeframe between now and 6,000, 10,000 years, whatever it was, when we started having these civilizations, these were wearing a very small window between then and now in such radical change has taken place between them and now then and now, but yet genetically not much. A few variations, variations have been observed between us and people that live thousands of years ago, but god not that much when it comes to need, when it comes to sexual desire, when it comes to greed, when it comes to automotive, motivating factors, it all of the reward systems that are in place and the other thing being that we don't have release anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:30:27       The physical release that a human being is essentially hard wired. Every chimp there swinging from branches and they're. They're working out all day, I mean they're, they're constantly getting this release of energy

Speaker 4:          00:30:40       and they're also getting a release of some of their aggressive energy as well, which we don't seem to have. Have a lot of

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       exactly what I'm talking about. I think people are essentially leaky batteries of aggressive energy mean when someone's in their car and they start fucking freaking out because you got in front of them and fucking honking their horns. That's a leaky battery of aggressive manner.

Speaker 4:          00:30:58       The other day this mild mannered woman in her forties or fifties cut me off and she just turned around and get. I'd never seen a woman show that kind of absolute chimp like aggressive bearing where teeth at me in a car. It was shocking.

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       I haven't been to the post office stamps.com. Yeah, it's a. It's a weird thing and it's also. There's the cars, a very unique environment in that because of the fact that you don't, even though you see people, you don't feel them. You know, you're not in front of them. Like I'm looking at you right now, and if I said something that hurt your feelings, it would bother me, but if I didn't know you when you're in a car, I'm like, fuck you dude. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. You know people do that all the time. I've seen people cut in front of each other and raced down the street in front of each other and just madness that you wouldn't see in a line you wouldn't see. If you're waiting in line to go to a movie. It's very rare, but you see it there because this, all the social cues are missing.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       All the human interaction that is missing. It's like there's this wall and this filter up. Same thing on the internet. Yes, more so on the internet because you don't even see the person and they're hiding behind. You know, dick fuck. Sixty nine is their name and whatever it is, they're not real, and so they can reach out to Robert Greene and go, you're fucking bugs. Or for faggots posts, youtube comments, and go fucking crazy on your block. Like people, like a friend of mine writes a blog and someone was like, why don't you have comments on your blogs? Like, well, what do you read comments? Do you read comments on blogs? Why would you want anybody to write where you're writing? You know, if you had a painting, would you allow people to, you know, paint underneath your painting what they think about your painting. You'd be a lot of dick's pointing to your painting, piles of shit with flies.

Speaker 1:          00:32:46       That's what they would draw in. Not not all people, but enough people to where it's a problem because they haven't earned the ability to communicate with you like that you, you choose who you communicate with in real life for the most part, especially who you surround yourself with on a regular basis, but online, you choose nothing online. It's the beautiful thing about being online is that everyone gets to say something and it's the horrible thing about being online is that everyone gets to say something and do so anonymously. Yep. Which is another part of what's weird about our progression from this ancient society where we hunted and gathered to eventually agriculture and then civilization in quotes to where we find ourselves today. So your books essentially, and this new book especially is sort of recognizing these traits so that you can move away from them.

Speaker 4:          00:33:39       Well, you're talking about my new book that hasn't been written yet. The point of the book is that this is human nature and it's an animal nature, and to be truly human, we have to overcome these traits in us to be truly rational, reasonable. I'm empathetic, abbott creatures. We have to overcome these various aspects of our own nature which are embedded in each one of us biologically, genetically, such as our propensity to feel envy. The propensity that envy is basically at its root. The fact that we humans are constantly comparing ourselves to other people. Look at your own life on a day to day basis and be honest with yourself and try and calculate how many times during a day you're actually comparing yourself to another person. He's got more money. She's prettier, he's got a better job. You're doing that's so completely human for various reasons, which I'll explain in the book to reach a higher nature, which is the goal of my book. You have to be aware that that's happening and you and you have to find a way to disengage yourself from that need to constantly compare yourself to others to find your own value, your own self worth from within on. These are all kinds of cliches, but I'm going to show you in a very real fashion how you can overcome them once you're aware that they're inside of you.

Speaker 1:          00:34:59       Yeah, but the book is not written yet. It's a beautiful point though. That's the beautiful point of being aware of them instead of denying them instead of getting all fufu chimes and indian chance. Thank you. being aware of them. Yes. So when you started reading all of the self help books and started recognizing that there was all this horse shit going on, what was your immediate reaction to try to write something that you thought was more realistic and beneficial or did you. How did you. How did you deal with it?

Speaker 4:          00:35:33       Well, there's a lot of anger. I have, you know, I have less now. I'm older, but I had a lot of anger back then because it really pissed me off that no one was talking about it. people were pretending that this was the world we lived in. There'd be books in the business section about management, how to manage people, which is a very primal, a topic of discussion. You have a group of people and you're a leader. How do you manage all of theSe insecure egos who are thinking of themselves, and these books were essentially dishonest. They weren't confronting the fact that when you put 10 people together, those people generally have their own agendas. they're thinking first and primarily of themselves and their future and their careers and what they can get for themselves, and if you start from a basic false premise, you're not gonna get anywhere.

Speaker 4:          00:36:17       So I was dealing with. I wanted to cut my soar through all of this thick bullshit and say this is what really happens in business, in the music industry, in hollywood, among lawyers in politics, and if some of it was a little brutal, maybe I gave myself a little bit of literary licensed to exaggerate ever so slightly, but for instance, I have a chapter in there about how to create a cult. Um, and it's obviously ironic. I'm not telling you you need to go out there and create a cult. What I'm saying is we humans are very gullible and we're very easy to mislead and we're very easy. We want to believe in something. We want to believe in a cause. This is, these are the strategies that people have used in history to create a cult like following. and I'm going to sort of reveal that to you. Um, these are things that just aren't in self help books at least in 1998 when the book came out.

Speaker 6:          00:37:13       So when [inaudible] writing about creating a cult. Yeah, what do you, what are your strategies? How do you go about doing that? Well, you're trying to wrap yourself up in this sort of mystical vale. The chapter originally already fucked that part up. You probably haven't because you have a cult following and therefore you like different though from what then called cult like is different than cult because I'm not, there's no organization whatsoever. Not trying to get anything out of anybody. Trying to tell them what to do. Oh, there's, it's different. I'm not trying to benefit from it. What you'd want to have as many followers as possible, as many people shouldn't have as many as possible. Quality over quantity is very important business. And I'm sure you're right though. I keep hearing you say content, colton, that we're done with con, you know, once you, uh, what was your term again? Crypto. Crypto con? Yeah. You fucking knocked it out of the park.

Speaker 4:          00:38:13       Uh, basically if, if somebody is using numbers, now I know I have the 48 laws of power so I couldn't be guilty of it. Thirty years.

Speaker 6:          00:38:20       Three strategies. Law probably

Speaker 4:          00:38:24       starting to create a cult because that goes back hundreds and thousands of years. Not that I'm not hundreds, thousands, but hundreds and thousands take you. Yes,

Speaker 7:          00:38:36       uh, giving us sort of mystical edge to what you're doing. You're trying to make people think that you're creating a religion without a religion. Um, and they're, you know, I, I show you the steps that people go through five steps in order and you can pretty much, if you see those steps happening, you know, that this person is creating a cult like following and one of the steps towards near the end is creating an us versus them dynamic. It's us 1000 followers against the whole world that doesn't believe in our theory of how the know of how aliens landed on the planet and started the human race. So whenever there's, they're creating this false dichotomy of us versus the nonbelievers and you know, that you're on your way to a coat.

Speaker 1:          00:39:19       That the. Yeah, that cult of thinking is very common, isn't it? Yes. The us versus them is really a, that's the big one that is the big.

Speaker 7:          00:39:26       And that goes back, I'm going to say in my new book, which hasn't been written yet, um, that, that goes back to our hunter gatherer ancestors where we're separating ourselves very violently from us, from them. That tribe over there, they're evil. They don't believe in the same gods that we believe in. They don't practice the same rituals. We have to go kill them. It's a very primal human thing.

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       Yeah. That seems people have this really seems inescapable. Need to be a part of a group. Yes. Whether it's a group of mac users or you know, whether it's a whatever the fuck it is. So I like fords. I like chevy. You know, if people get, they get really crazy about that and it's a very weird aspect of human nature. People want you to be on the same cell phone provider as them. Like what are you doing with t mobile man? Come on over to the t and t.

Speaker 2:          00:40:14       Well the, the, the companies have used some of those strategies. They've created this us versus them mentality to help make people feel like that, you know, all of these advertising practices that you see, you know, generally you can find a lot of their roots and you know, some of these larger scale strategies like look at this map versus this map creating this antagonism that actually probably helps both sides and it's, they're all just shaking hands like that plane ride where the republicans and democrats were playing yahtzee with each other and having a big laugh.

Speaker 1:          00:40:45       I remember the think different Ads. Do you remember the things she ants for apple where they use all these dead people. It was like, does that guy, even though he's in an ad dead, this is weird, you know, think different with the apple logo and that everybody wanted to think different. Effective, very effective, but almost, you know, kind of deceptively so in some weird sort of a way. You know, you will. You're just fucking computer man. Yeah. Which you have is a computer. It's not thinking for you. It doesn't. You could write the most racist, horrible shit on a mac and it doesn't stop you. You can totally plot your agenda against whatever and they fill in the blank, anti homosexual, anti woman, anti, whatever. You could just write the worst shit ever on a mac. It doesn't discriminate. It doesn't have any effect on how you think. Like it's, it's such a dumb ad. You think different. Think different. How was sitting in front of this thing going? I'm not thinking any different. I think it's also grammatically incorrect. It is differently. Think you're right. Yeah. It's fucking dead wrong, but yet effective. Yeah. I guess it's that the need to be a part of a group is a, it's one of the things that people definitely play against

Speaker 4:          00:42:00       that was completely social animals. Um, and uh, that's the source. If you think about the human being, go back a million years ago where we were incredibly the one of the weakest animals on the planet. um, you know, we were just barely learning how to stand up on our two legs. We were slow, couldn't run very fast, didn't have teeth to kill another animal with no poison, no clause. We were the maybe one of the weakest animals on, in, you know, in the, in, in africa, and yet look at us now. It was from our, so becoming the preeminent social animal. We learn how to work in groups to hunt in groups to cooperate out of that came language eventually so you can't divorce are extreme social nature from who we are. And because of that, we have a tremendous propensity to conform to, to want to think like other people.

Speaker 4:          00:42:55       I don't know if you're familiar with the milgram experiments about authority and obedience. It Was in the sixties. A yale professor had people come in for an experiment where they were made to give electric shocks to other people. If they didn't answer a question correctly, they weren't really giving a shock. It was all a plant that he was trying to see how they would respond to authority. And the most mild manner housewife would be given those shocks to people when they gave the wrong answer. And he was showing how inbred rna, how we are all wired to obey authority. Um, so these are things embedded deeply in us as a social animal for the good, for, for, for a good thing or our ability to cooperate, but also it's a very dark and negative side, which is our ability to engage in group think and are mindless obedience.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       40. Is that where that's coming from? When someone with a mild mannered housewives are hitting that button and shocking people, is that worth coming from or is it they finally have some power over something because I feel like there's a lot of people out there that feel incredibly power, less and frustrated and they feel like they have this backlog, they have a leaky battery for that. Like they want to have some fucking power over people. and when you finally do, like, what was the stanford prison experiment was the same? Was it the same thing?

Speaker 4:          00:44:14       There were two professors who were friends and they kind of,

Speaker 1:          00:44:16       oh, bullshit heads pointing out how to make people evil. The stanford prison experiment, I mean they caught them off after they cut the experiments short because people were being so evil. they had fake prison guards and prisoners. Um, I, I, I personally experienced that on a personal level when I was a security guard. I worked as a security guard at great woods, which is a concert center for the performing arts in Massachusetts to nashville, man manfield, I think, man, man, mass, wherever the fuck it is man field, I think it is, it's a, this outdoor venue and there was a lot of crazy shit going on. They had all these nutty concerts there and all these fights would break out and it became us versus them, us as a security guard versus them. And I saw some really mild mannered people do some mean shit to the people that were, uh, were guests.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       They're very interesting. You know, I saw a guy that would never hurt anybody, punch somebody in the stomach because the guy, I forget what the guy did, but I remember watching him hit this guy going, wow, this is crazy. Yeah. And it was because of that, it was because he was wearing a security jacket. He was security. The guy was a drunk asshole. And but where he would normally, if you ran into this guy in the street would never hit him, but because he was in this position of power in quotes, you know, he, he hit this guy. I mean, I don't know if the guy pushed someone or something, but it would, it was avoidable. He didn't have to hit them. Yeah. And I remember that mentality being very clear, the us versus them mentality.

Speaker 2:          00:45:46       So the key to avoiding these dark characteristics is you have to be honest, number one, which I think he's very good at doing, but then also understand and identify him, not be able to look and say, this is why this is happening. We have this us versus them dynamic. It's creating this, this thing. And unless you can identify it and become aware of it, it's pretty much powerless to break it. So the knowledge that these books give give you, at least in my opinion of, of one of the reasons I loved him so much, they give you the power back by saying you're not just a leaf at the mercy of the wind, of these forces of human nature. And the forces of other people wielding these power games and the forces of seduction by these people who are desperately trying to date and how they've got you all wound up inside. You're no longer powerless because you can see, aha, this is what's happening. And you can take some of that back and then chart your course with your own intent, with your own morality. How you want to Do it.

Speaker 7:          00:46:41       Yeah, that's, that's fair. Thank you. That was very well put. But I have a book. I should have you just do all the answer. All the questions plugs busy. I did a book with fifty cent a rapper called the 50th law. And basically what I did in that book was I wanted to figure out what made 50 so interesting, so powerful. And after hanging out with them I decided that the guy was fearless. He had a just incredible fearless quality and philosophy of life. So the book that we wrote together was sort of a meditation on fearlessness and the and the whole point of the book was being fearless isn't a question of just going out there and saying, fuck you. I don't care what anybody does, I'm going to push you around and I'm not afraid. That's about fearlessness

Speaker 4:          00:47:31       is first coming to terms with the fact that you are afraid, you are afraid of death, you are afraid of other people getting one up on you. You are afraid of being alone. You are afraid of people thinking that you're different. Okay? Look at it in yourself. Be aware that that's existing, that it's. It's happening in your body before it even hits your mind. Now that you're aware of it, now you can start conquering your fears. So I say we say it in that book, for instance, napoleon bonaparte or general patent, two men who were incredibly brave who would be on the front line of battle, take bullets flying past them. These were men who were very afraId in the beginning when they first went into battle and we're quite ashamed of the fear that they saw in themselves and they became aware of it and then slowly they overcame it by exposing themselves to the very thing that they were afraid of. So that's sort of the paradigm you're talking about. Becoming aware of the process of these, these sorts of qualities we don't want in ourselves. Seeing how they operate inside of you. Instead of saying, oh, it's always the other person. It's not me. I'm not afraid. I don't have these problems. No, you do have them. Let's, let's confront it and let's show you how you can rationally and in a intellectual and mindful way. Overcome. Overcome them.

Speaker 5:          00:48:52       Yeah, because it truly is no managing of anything that you're denying. If you're denying that it exists, you cannot manage. That was well. Put two guys are much more eloquent than I am. We take a lot of mushrooms. Robert grant helps us confront these interference. Ever. Taken mushrooms. Robert? Yes. Deep breath. Of course he has, but I took a lot of pot. That was my drug of choice. That injustice. Good? Yeah. Go. Just talk about a way to show you the fears that you didn't realize you have and help you confront them. You know these things. They're really a great mirror to reflect upon yourself. Hallucinogenics. I mean, I think that's one of the great values that it brings is, you know, you don't know exactly what our deepest fear is until you do iowasca and then it's like, oh yeah, that's it. The thing that you've been showing me for the last three hours, I guess I'm most afraid of that.

Speaker 4:          00:49:42       Well, the thing with pod is you never knew what was going to happen. You never knew whaT one trip was never the same as another. So you always had like, trepidation, like, whoa, this could be really ugly. I don't know what's going to happen. And you had to deal with it.

Speaker 5:          00:49:55       How did you do it? Do it in traditional native american setting?

Speaker 4:          00:49:59       Uh, no, no, I was in berkeley college. Uh, we would take the buttons and you take off all the little white, stringy poisonous bits and then you cut it up and you either put it in a shake or a peanut butter sandwich and then you go find a nice safe place. Traditional peanut butter sandwich. Exactly. I mean, they would eat, they would eat it. They taste horrible. It's just, it's not the taste is that consistency and unless you're a native american, it's hard to stomach it, you're just going to vomit it straight up and you don't want to vomit it because then you're not going to get the trip. So you got to trick your body into like digesting it and so you have to put it in a smoothie.

Speaker 5:          00:50:42       If you brominated it doesn't work. No, you're vomiting out immediately. All of the stuff you just didn't pay attention because it works well if you vomit based on the taste, it hasn't had time to assault it later in the trip based on it trying to clear your body. that's a different. It's already assimilated. So, um, anyway, so do you feel like those pod experiences help form your view of things?

Speaker 4:          00:51:07       Very much so. Very much so. And you know, it just made you kind of put, connects you to reality where there's things where you're just in a fog all the time because we're so conditioned to think in certain ways and to have something that draws you out of the same rut of thinking and confront you with really the real world. This amazing world. It's aroUnd you, uh, has had a huge influence on my writing and I know this next book hasn't been written, but I have another book after that that has not even begun to be even thought of as written. And that's going to bring together all of my experiences on that level of book, on what I call the sublime, which I've written about in the 50th law. And we'll write a whole book about at one point.

Speaker 5:          00:51:54       so the 50th law is the one that you wrote with fifty cent? Yes sir. Now what was the motivation behind that?

Speaker 4:          00:52:01       Well, basically my early books, meaning the 48 laws, seduction and war to some extent were very popular among hip hop artists. Yeah. Basically because you know, the music industry, I described you hollywood. Well, hollywood is kind of like kindergarten compared to the music business that they are. The real sharks are in the music business. They are pretty nasty, pretty machiavellian. Um, and people like 50 jay z and their managers in the late nineties, early two thousands were coming to grasp with the fact that they, they wanted to control their own work to have some power and some money and become entrepreneurs and, and dealing with these sharks in the music business was something that nothing, not even any kind of street life prepared them for 50 would tell me. He hustled on the streets dealing crack, saw people being knives and killed and dealt with a lot of danger and nothing prepared him for the sharkey horrific games that he saw in the music industry with columbia and interscope, etc.

Speaker 4:          00:53:06       So they were reading my book to help them deal with this. They did. These are not people who went to harvard business school, they didn't have a book out there to help them understand how manipulative these people could be. And so they gravitated the 48 laws of power. Fifty was one of them and he contacted me at some point I think, oh, five or six wanting to meet me because he liked the book a lot and then we met and we had a really interesting synergy. Obviously we're not, we don't come from similar backgrounds. We don't look alike. They don't see that on the street. I'm from history, but I'm not the street or you're born in the field. Everybody's born from the street. Uh, I'm uh, you know, I come from a middle class jew, jewish background, so I'm not quite the same as, you know, south side queens.

Speaker 4:          00:53:53       But uh, but we had a really nice energy together. Like we think alike. Like I told you about, that hollywood director, most people in hollywood were getting so angry with him and so angry about the games that they never took a step back to figure out, oh, this is the strategy that this guy applied and 50 was the same way. He said, I took a step back and said, this is what the guide in her scope is really doing. So we thought alike and we thought let's bring two minds together that think alike, but from totally different backgrounds and see what happens.

Speaker 1:          00:54:25       Fascinating. The, um, the music business for folks who don't know, it's been a, it's really a fascinating operation and it's kinda been gutted because of the mp3 influx and napster was the first blow. And then from there it's like, really now it's kind of interesting because the performers actually make their money from performing more than anything else. It's very difficult to make the millions and millions of dollars that the rolling stones and what have you. All those bands in the past made from selling records. he, there's not really that, that doesn't exist anymore in the same way. But courtney love wrote a piece about. I'm sure she probably didn't really write it. Probably they said it was ghost written. I agree. It's pretty fucking smart. And I've smart woman. Yeah. Okay. I believe you, but I don't know, maybe not anyway, whether she. Let's say she wrote it. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       Let's say she wrote it. It's, it's insane. If you've ever read it, that piece that she wrote on the music business and how it really works and how they extract everything from your profits, everything, promotion, expenses, all these different things. By the time the artist gets paid for the records, they have all this weird way of doing math where it shows like no money, no money has been made and they use that for not just the music business but hollywood trudeau. I have a friend who produced a television show and it's a very successful television show and it's not just, can you stop doing that start crunching thing, sorry. It's really distracting. The television shows not just successful nationwide. It's syndicated across the world and the company that made this show, the production company is claiming that it doesn't turn a profit. I mean, I'm not talking about one country, it's in 16 different countries and there's like several versions of it with different hosts all throughout the world and they're trying to tell him that it's not always suing them and there's like this crazy fucking lost.

Speaker 5:          00:56:23       Lawsuits are just course for business. It doesn't even scare. It doesn't even make people bad an eye in those industries,

Speaker 1:          00:56:29       but it's pretty sad. It's weird, like how has it not making a profit? Did you get paid? Did you get paid? like where's there's got to be a fucking profit here because there's all this money, like a movie that can make $100,000,000 can be said to have turned no profit. Yeah. Wow. That's bizarre. Where's that money going to? But this fuckery, this, these shenanigans are sort of a lot of the stuff that you're talking about in 48 laws. Yep.

Speaker 5:          00:57:01       Yeah. Courtney love was a big reader of the 48 laws of power. She used it in one of her lawsuits against the music industry. She held up a copy of the book and said, this is what you guys are using against us.

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       You bad motherfucker according lab. Did you ever see that documentary that claims that she killed kurt cobain or had kurt cobain killed? No. One of Them was fucking bizarre documentaries ever. Like someone fucking set out to prove that courtney love was responsible for kurt cobain's death. Oh, all right. Are you sure you're not sure? Yeah. That's a pretty fucking crazy statement. You know? How can you just. You can just do that and you can just say that. Yeah. Nobody tried her for that. Like can you sue someone who says that you're responsible for the suicide of your fucking husband. Awful off track. Obviously back to the book. So this, this business, this music business is just an example really of what happens when power structures are created. When people who were in these power structures understand the game and then take these people that are just coming into it fresh and especially artistic types. People who are creative, people who are artistic types, oftentimes not very good with money, not not sound financial thinkers, and just the opposite of these business sharks that are involved in interscope or whatever the whatever the label is,

Speaker 5:          00:58:27       katie themselves to the mastery of their craft and this whole other craft. This business sharkey genus is this other whole skillset that it's challenging to be able to master both. You know, so getting the cliff notes is awfully helpful to be able to sort that out because that is to be as where they are at that point and obviously he'll go into his book mastery, but that is a relentless pursuit of excellence in a well defined niche that doesn't allow for a lot of time to explore these other things unless you know you're forming some bridge. If you were going to recommend your books to someone, what, what order would you recommend them in? Well, it depends on what business you're in and what point you are in life. Okay. How about you?

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       How about me? I'm a comedian. Yeah. Which I do

Speaker 5:          00:59:12       you, you who are already so successful. Well probably mastery in some ways because maybe it'll take you to the next level, but I don't know if you're dealing with a

Speaker 4:          00:59:21       lot of political stuff. If you are, then you're going to want 48 laws or maybe the strategies of war. Uh, it depends on who you are, what your weaknesses are, what your strengths are, where you are in life. If you're 22 years old and you're just graduating college and you're about to enter the real world, um, I'd say mastery for reasons that maybe will. Hopefully we'll get into a. But if you're a 25 and you're now working at goldman sachs, god bless you. If you are ever saved you, I think you're gonna probably want the 48 laws of power because man, that's a power hungry, nasty, manipulative, machiavellian environment. If you're in the music industry as well, if you're a person leaves a fairy afraid, you've got all sorts of great creative ideas, but you're never going to the next step and starting that great movie or project you have, maybe the 50th law would be good for you so you can get over some of those fears that are holding you back.

Speaker 4:          01:00:13       If you're some guy who just can't find a, you know, ken is really bad with women. Art of seduction, obviously it would probably be just so it depends a little bit on who you are. Now you wrote the artists deduction to help people get laid. Is that the idea of. No, I didn't know. I know it sound great. I know I probably have 8 million people buying the book tomorrow and now I'm only going to get like 15, but the truth of the matter is artists deduction is about how to seduce people, how to get them to like you or love you. It's all about creating a spell, so if you want to just get laid, you know, maybe neil strauss or the pickup artists, that's probably more your speed. It's got all sorts of gimmicks about how to sell a woman's something in a bar and melt her resistance and etc.

Speaker 4:          01:00:56       I'm more about the longterm, how you can take that woman or it can be a woman seducing a man obviously and get and play a mind game on her. So in the course of three months, she doesn't want to just sleep with you. She wants to give you everything she has. She creating stalkers a could be and I have and I'm afraid I'm ashamed of it, but more likely I don't believe you at all. When you say I'm ashamed of it, you're fucking proud of that shit. I said, oh, I don't like stalkers because really the book is about casting a spell. Okay. You know, let's say, let's say this is the goal of seduction. When that woman leaves you after the whatever night you had together, the date or whatever, or just an encounter, she's going home and thinking about you. Okay, now you're starting to seducer you.

Speaker 4:          01:01:43       It's a mind game. It's a mental thing. We humans are sex drive and our mental process are really interconnected and I'm kidding you to play on that and you play on psychology and melting other people's resistance is getting them to lower their guard because everybody's very got their guard up constantly. Particularly in this modern world. Nobody is opening up to you or nobody wants to show vulnerability. It's just you're just dealing with a million porcupines out there showing you how to get those resistance levels down and give room to finagle your way into their head. And the converse

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       of course too, you know, which is a lot of people are getting these things played upon them constantly. And again, it goes back to the same thing. If you're not aware of the tactics that somebody is using, you know you're defenseless against them, you're just completely vulnerable and you'll get sucked into this lure of this spell that they're creating by this push pull tactic that they're using and whatever strategy that they're using and you'll just be helpless to it. And you see guys fall for these all the time. You know, it's something that bums me in you out personally a lot. When we see friends and people we love caught in this spell that someone's woven where they can't let go despite so many other things going bad in their life. They're just trapped in it and reading something like the artist's deduction says, oh, she's using law number seven as her primary means and 13 and 17 and now I see you now. I got you a bitch. You know, like you can switch it back and say, okay, now what do I want? Do I want to keep you around? Do I want to or do I want to just release myself, you know, remove these hooks, these invisible hooks that you've created, and just be free to chart my own course. Well, thank you all for you.

Speaker 1:          01:03:28       I find that a lot of people enjoy the struggle of relationship struggle because it distracts them from their own life, just distracts rama, distract them from their shortcomings and achieving their goals. They put up obstacles almost on purpose. They create these inner personal relationships that are going to ensure conflict so they don't have to deal with success, so they don't have to deal with a fee. They have like a built in excuse for failure. Yeah. That's very common. Yep.

Speaker 7:          01:04:00       Freud called that air full angst. I'm basically. That means fear of success, which is something I talk a lot about in my book.

Speaker 1:          01:04:08       That's real, right? It sounds like it sounds ridiculous. It sounds like an oxymoron, but it's real.

Speaker 7:          01:04:16       Yep. That's a main main. One of the main points in mastery about mastery is basically a book that's trying to get away from all of the political stuff I've described in my previous books, and here I'm going to show you how we humans can attain excellence in this world, how we can be really, really the best at what we do because I think that's the highest form of power we humans can reach when we're so good at what we do, then all the political games in the world can't topple us from where we are. Um, and what holds a lot of people back is that they're really self sabotaging, their finding all kinds of excuses why they can't go through this process. They believe in the myth that people are born talented, are geniuses, are simply born that way or that they didn't get to go to the right school where their parents were mean to them or yada yada yada. Or my girlfriend is that, you know, whatever. As you said, they get involved in drama games that. So fill up their mind that can't think of anything else. So I'm going to make you

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       as this book as well aware of what's holding you back and these fears that you're using to sabotage yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       That is one of the most frustrating things to me when I'm talking to someone and they have these built in excuses for why they can't do what they want to do.

Speaker 4:          01:05:32       Give me some of these excuses that you hear.

Speaker 1:          01:05:34       Well, I have a friend who wanted to be a comedian. He wound up not being a comedian. He doesn't have children, he doesn't have a wife, doesn't have a mortgage, so he's not. It's not like he has this job that he has these responsibilities to feed his family. So he stuck in his job, but he was like, well, you know what man, I. I've missed the boat with comedy. If I had started in the nineties, everything would've been great. I go, what are you talking about? Is people that start right now? There's, there's open mics right now. Good. The tuesday night to the laugh factory is a fucking line around the block. They get there at 9:00 AM and they wait in line. You should do that too. If you want to do comedy. A mannequin, do that. I'm 30 years old. Do you think the orion gives a shit and how old you are?

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       Man, the line has no idea about your age. The line is there. The microphone is on for an 80 year old man. If an 80 year old man talks in that microphone, it makes noise just like a baby. If a baby cries into that microphone, it also makes noise like, what are you talking about? And they're like, he and I got into this crazy debate about. He's like, look man, it's easy for you to say you're already successful. I'm like, look dude, it's not easy for me to say. It's hard for me to hear because you're fucking yourself. You're you want to be a comedian and if you think you're funny, and by the way, you don't even really have to be funny. You just have to have the ability to figure out how to become funny and that self analysis, objectivity and work, that's what it is, but you are already creating this insurmountable barrier. You didn't start in the nineties, like, what are you fucking talking about it

Speaker 4:          01:06:55       in the book mastery, I interviewed nine modern masters to sort of embed them in months. All the ancient masters that I talk about and one of the nine modern masters I interviewed as a woman named temple. Granted, I don't know if you've heard of her. No, to emigrate and it's like a very famous animal behavior scientist. um, and she was born with autism and at the age of two was basically going to be put in a mental institution for the rest of her life because she was a severe autistic. She couldn't learn language. He was just the kind of kid you see. It was just banging their head against the wall. She was severely autistic. And through a process I describe in the book with her mother's help and the speech therapist, she slowly got to the age of four to be able to start speaking and going to schools. And I show the process that eventually led her to become a great scientist. Now, if somebody's born with severe autism, at the age of two is going to be institutionalized for their whole life, can become a master, then there's no fucking excuse for some 30 year old who has nothing, no barriers like that at all to ever get to that point. It's really the reason I put it in there. If any. If somebody like that can overcome their limitations and there's no more excuses. Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:08:09       well there is one excuse. He's a weak bitch. Well, that's the excuse and my eyes don't be weak, bitch. It's so simple. Break it down to that. Yeah. My other advice that I always give out is be the person that you pretend to be when you're trying to get laid. If you can Just do that and just be that guy, what would that guy be? That guy and let it become you. That was something I never covered in the artist seduction. Damn. Be the person. Be the hero of your own movIe. that's the other thing I say to people when people were there, feel like their life. Pretend you're a fucking loser in A movie. You woke up today the same scenarios. You always see guy wakes up, makes a fucking blender full of pizza or whatever they do, you know, get their life together and smoke a cigarette and realize that you're a failure. You're, you're the bills are piling up. The phone's ringing off the hook from bill collectors. What would the hero in the movie do right now? Do that shit and it works. It works at some people, other people that find excuses to not do it. I got that

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       vice from a, from a family friend one time and I was. I was terrible at dating until I was about 22 or so, 21. I was awful. I was way too nice. It was so doting and it wasn't even the real me. I was just being playing this overnights person and people hated it. It was the most repulsive being nice, the most repulsive thing I could have done. And so he told me, he's like, just analyze your actions and what you're saying. And ask what would Bruce Willis too

Speaker 1:          01:09:32       at that time? At the time it was, that's who is like the big action hero or whatever. My advice That helped changed the game for me. Stay nice, but be willing to walk away as soon as you expose that someone else is not nice back, be nice always, but then as soon as someone's not nice backside. All right, good luck. Take it easy. Not need them at all. If you don't need them to know. The problem with nice people is they're needy motherfuckers. It's not just nice. The reason why they're being nice is they need you to like them. You can be really nice and not need people to like you and if they don't like you or they didn't want to be around you, you're fine with it. Then they freak out. They don't know how to handle that. Like shit, I missed a nice guy.

Speaker 1:          01:10:11       He was nice. It slipped through my fingers. Personal sovereignty. It's one of the most important things to have in this life. The ability to be yourself, to be by yourself and why would other people like you if you don't even like yourself. You got to do things in life that you would admire. You got to be the kind of person that you would like and if you're not, why would you expect anyone to like you? I have this argument with guys all the time where the talk about women and you know, the fucking girls want money. They want this, they want that. You know, women always like, you know, I just, I'm not so good with women's. I always say this, would you fuck you? Fuck you. How dare you, you know, it's not just physical, it's mental. It's the way you behave. Or are you a kind of person? Are you fun to be around? There are people that are just genuinely great to be around. You know, they don't have to be good looking, you know, they don't have to be, they don't have to be, they don't have to be

Speaker 5:          01:11:13       well read, they just have a quality. They have quality. And do you not have that quality and if you don't have that quality, can you, can you acquire it?

Speaker 4:          01:11:22       Well, what I try to do in our seduction is a. I'm saying people who read a book and try to seduce, so usually the worst seducers or who've taken some advice because they're not in the moment. Um, and there seemed like they're kind of being cold and calculating and the trick to seduction is to appear or to be as natural as possible and to at least appear natural. Um, so everybody has a different style. Some people are funny and great to be around, but maybe you're just not born that way. Maybe you're just not widi. Uh, maybe you, but you have other strengths. You have other qualities, something naturally seductive about you. Um, that could be you're very social and you know, you can think about what the other person wants. It could be. I have one of the types in the, in the book. Maybe you do have coquettish qualities. What does that mean? You can blow hot and cold

Speaker 5:          01:12:16       coquettish ooh, new word. Cocaine, cocaine, reddish. Never, never heard anybody say that. Tree. French coquette. Isn't that amazing? You could live 46 years on this world. I've taught you several words. You have. Thank you so much. Crypto. Contemplate a favorite word. Everything you're free to use it, use it, announced in the world that kind of what you're saying, it kind of reminds me of what you talk about it, but go ahead. Sorry. No, go ahead. You can finish what it reminds me a little bit of what you're talking about. In mastery of going with your natural inclination, that is going to be the best thing. Like going with that vocation. Whatever makes you that unique individual, it's almost the same and seduction as it is in mastery, pursuing that channel, that venue of what is going to bring you out, your highest qualities is going to lead to the greatest success. No matter what it is. SedUction or mastery. Yeah, I've tried. I make

Speaker 4:          01:13:11       the point in mastery that you have. You're born with a key to success. Every single human being is born that way. I'm not tried. This isn't some new age bullshit that I'm trying to pedal here. What that key is, the fact that you're, you, you're, there's something unique about you. Uh, your, your dna is unique. Your brain is wired in a unique way. They've done these really interesting studies on newborns and infants one month to six months and they've been able to show that an extremely early age, infants are already distinguishing between things that they like and don't like. I'm very particular levels like foods and colors and sounds, so when you were really, really young, you had what are recalls, and I call them the book, primal inclinations. These, there were things you were attracted to that are very, very unique and distinctive about you.

Speaker 4:          01:14:07       IT could be sports, it could be competing and winning. It could be working with people and social situations. It could be music. Whatever it is, if you're able to stay true to that or rediscover it when you're older and mine, what's unique about you and your tastes and your way of thinking and your whole spirit, you are going to fucking succeed in this life. You're going to create a business. You're going to create a book. Some have a podcast that reflects your weirdness, your uniqueness and people will come to you because it's true. It's authentic and it is nothing else out there like it. How do you do that? How do you stay true to that? How do you fIgure out what your life's task is, as I call it? How do you keep connected to those primal inclination set what that's what the book mastery is about, but you first have to be at least aware of what the root of your possible success in life is, and I try to make the point that if you aren't pursuing something that's personally and emotionally connected to you, you're never going to actually succeed in life.

Speaker 4:          01:15:10       If you go into law and you are meant to be a writer, you might be able to bullshit your way for 10 years or so and be a pretty good lawyer, but eventually because it's not something you were meant to do, you're going to disconnect. You're not going to be into it. You're going to emotionally disengage. You're going to start drinking. Your hair's gonna fall out. You're gonna. Start seeing hookers

Speaker 6:          01:15:30       getting on drugs. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You were good. Up until that point. I lost ya. Well, because you're not

Speaker 4:          01:15:36       pursuing what you were meant to pursue and your life's going to fall apart. You're not

Speaker 6:          01:15:40       have a good time with hookers and drugs. Well, you can. I see. That was. You're right. I probably lost you there. People are probably going. That's what I really want to mastery is you become a lawyer when you're really supposed to be a writer. Then you get hookers and drugs and hookers and drugs are fun. No, no, no. I'm just playing. I, I fully see what you're doing. And I do think that that is a very important point that people do sabotage when they're unhappy. And I find a lot of people that tend to work jobs, they find very unrewarding to be exceptionally materialistic because they're trying to reward themselves with these material items in these material items. Become goals for plowing through another daY doing this shitty job. So

Speaker 4:          01:16:28       it's a real dead end. That's like one of the worst traps that people fall into. Now. I have nothing against money. I like making money. Um, but the goal of your life when you're in your twenties, for instAnce, should be learning as much as possible. Developing skills in differenT areas and not worrying about how much money you're making, giving yourself the freedom to make mistakes, to explore, to have some adventures, to try things out that don't quite work for you. And then when you reach your thirties, you've got all these skills and experiences and you're going to make that money eventually. But the path to mastery, you look at somebody like steve jobs, you can hate them or you can like him. You can think he's great or not, but he ended up being one of the wealthiest men that ever existed in on our planet.

Speaker 4:          01:17:13       Um, he never thought about money. He never cared about it. He lived in a, in a house that was hardly decorated. He just, you know, it was just, was never on his hierarchy of values to quote maslow there. So if you're, if you're obsessed with money, you're actually going to find all sorts of problems in life. you're going to become hooked to that paycheck. Let's say you're 32 years old and suddenly you're downsized or you're fired from your job and you've been addicted to that $80,000. 100,000 dollars a years that you've been getting, now you don't have the mental freedom to take a job for half that price where you can now maybe start learning some skills and moving on and really finding your way because you're addicted to all that luxury to the things, into the ego that you have connected to that paycheck.

Speaker 4:          01:18:01       So money is one of the worst chaps and the reason people get into that trap generally is because of their parents. Their parents tell them, johnny, susan, I have whatever your name is. You've got to make a living. You gotta, you gotta, go get a job. That's luca. If you've got to become a doctor or a lawyer, you know, you got to go to yale and get this degree and go into the business school, et cetera, and then you're not listening to yourself. You're lIstening to other people in their and their values. So you call that a counterforce in the book. It's things that work against you and to pushing work against you from finding what you call your vocation, which is like what is going to make you the most happy and doing and being and when you're in your vocation versus just doing a work.

Speaker 4:          01:18:39       When you're in your vocation, your passionate about it, you love what you're doing and so you're going to naturally be more inclined to be great at it because you're going to put way more energy, way more passionate into it. I mean, think about the people who have achieved greatness and in any different field. All the people we know, you know, even the bowhunter, he loves it. He loves whaT he's doing. He's found success in doing it, but yeah, he found his vocation and he's just stuck with it and so he's become a master, but if he was trying to do some legal job or some accounting job, he would suck. Suck

Speaker 6:          01:19:13       at it. Probably actually has a day job which he fucking hates. And when he describes it, he talks about dying there. Feels like he's dying every day when he's at work. Yeah. But yeah, you're absolutely right. Um, is, is there a benefit in experiencing that resistance early in life so that you stay, you steal your resolve against it? Which resistance? The resistance to do what you actually want to do. I mean, I feel like a big part of my motivation in life and the, the strength of my resistance to getting other people happy or to doing what other people wanted me to do was that I was pressured in a way that I didn't towards the direction that I didn't want to go. And It was all the course. Yeah. I mean, one of the things that I would hear all the time when I was starting out and stand up is my mom telling me that I wasn't funny. My mom was like, why are you doing this? You're not funny. Like this is not a smart.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       And I would bite down on my mouthpiece and fucking plow forward because of that, because I didn't want. I didn't want to hear that. I didn't want to hear, finish your college degree, get a, get a normal job. Stop being a dreamer. I didn't want to hear that because I had heard it and it strengthened my resolve.

Speaker 4:          01:20:25       Yeah, very much so. It's definitely a theme in the book. I mean, if your path is too easy, if you just fall out of the womb and suddenly you'll note this is what you were meant to do and that 18 year doing it, you're going to have other problems down the road. It's good to have resistance. It's good to have people's fucking with you and saying you're not good at this, et cetera. Um, I know, for instance, in my path to writing the 48 laws of power, I kind of knew I wanted to be a writer, but I went into forms of writing that didn't suit me. I started off in journalism, did that for several years and really kind of hated it. And at one point an editor, um, had lunch with me and he pointedly said, robert, you never going to be a good writer.

Speaker 4:          01:21:07       You just don't have the chemIstry for it. You're just all over the place. You're not disciplined. maybe go to law school or something. And that got me out of journalism because I've made me realize I really hate the assholes who worked there, who was just got to stick up their butt and can't think about what real writing might be like. Got out of that and wandered around europe and tried writing novels and all sorts of things that didn't work either that I tried hollywood and I tried television. That through that process I discovered what I loved. When it came to the chance to do a book, I suddenly the heavens blew open for me. Yeah, a book I can have total control over it. There are no assholes telling me coming in like in hollywood and changIng everything that I write. There's no writing for an article for one week that disappears.

Speaker 4:          01:21:52       I've a book, but it was only through this process of finding what I hated. So when people come and tell me I don't know what my vocation is, I don't know what it is I should be doing. I often say, well, what is it that you hate? what are those things in life that you don't like? what are those jobs that you've had that suck the life out of you? They're going to. They're sort of indications of maybe something that you should like. You don't like working for large groups of people. You should be an entrepreneur. You should be working for yourself. You're. You're shaking your head. You look very skeptical.

Speaker 1:          01:22:24       No, no, not at all. I'm agreeing with you wholeheartedly. The total opposite. Okay, so I'm like, no, please on. No, no. I'm just. Yeah, so I love it. You got to have the resistance

Speaker 4:          01:22:33       and the worst thing that happens are people who get successful at 25 and then think that they've got the golden touch and they don't realize that they don't have the golden touch that, that they were. They were kind of lucky and then they keep thinking that they have to repeat the same thing that they did. Let's say they became a comic at the age of 25, became hugely successful, but they didn't have the resistance that you had. Now they start not listening to their audience or to other people or to their who says they're not really

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       that funny and they just think everything. They do, everything they should. It's just wonderful. By the way, that's very common. Very common. That's a huge issue with comics. Yeah. A huge issue with comics. As they become successful, then they start to suck. It's a real issue with some of the greats. I won't name names, but what happened to woody allen? I mean he's an older guy, but you know, I disagree with you there because his movies, his, his movies are fucking brilliant, man. Blue jasmine was great. It was a great movie. Midnight in paris was fucking fantastic. It was a really good movie. I think he's just a crazy pervert and then that's the problem. I think what we don't like to admit it, but what fuels woody allen is he likes getting his dick sucked, you know, and he likes. He's a freak. You go back and you ever seen woody allen's young standup when he was hilarious.

Speaker 6:          01:23:50       He was really good. I thought he was much funnier back then than he is now. He certainly is, but he also wasn't exposed like you is now. He isn't hated and vilified like he is now. I mean, he became a pariah. I mean he became like a real freak. Yeah. We were talking before the podcast, I was saying that the sound of clicking, I was putting something on twitter and I was like, I'm going to miss that. If they ever get rid of that, like the sound of clicking. It's like so a real rewarding to me or something like that. Woody allen does all of his typing all of scripts on an old typewriter and the way he edits, he takes pieces of paper and if he changes a scene, he'll print it on a piece of paper and then cut it and then staple it to the other thing or tape it to the other thing.

Speaker 6:          01:24:37       Like he's like so old school in his approach, he uses the same typewriter that he's always used for everything. Yeah. Well it's probably because he's fucking terrified to go on the internet if he googles woody allen is a. I mean, you know, whoever you are, jesus is a first word, is going to be con. You know, if jesus ever gets online and googles his name, but for woody allen, I mean the fucking hate and the vitriol that that guy must experience on a daily basis. Just looking people in the eyes at a restaurant must be like really pretty fucking intense. Yeah. I think that phenomenon that you're talking about with comics, it applies to pretty much everything. Athletes, entrepreneurs, because if you use this resistance of your struggling trying to get to the top, people telling you you're not going to make. You'll never be a champion.

Speaker 6:          01:25:22       You'll never start on the basketball team. You'll never do this, and then once you get there and once you achieve that, that kind of opposing force that allows you to bring out the best can can kind of go away. It's why it's hard for teams to repeat championships and things like that. It's, it's an interesting phenomenon. It's almost like you need this kind of heat and resistance to create the greatest out of yourself and when that goes, you have to look elsewhere and find it and other things. Yeah. You can't make steel without fire. That's right. I have a story in the book of freddie roach. He was one of the modern masters that I love. Freddy freddy's amazing guy and the story of freddy's really kind of a

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       a model for mastery in a way and basically I'll summarize it quickly. He, his father was a fighter and he got all his boys into boxing and the age of four. They were already in a ring boxing away at the age of four and so matt, age onward. Freddy was boxing and an amateur level and at one point in high school, just like your mom, his mom said to him, freddy, you're not really very good at boxing. why are you doing this? Your brother is so much better than you. And I got him really pissed. So he went back into the gym and he started training twice as hard and he suddenly got better than his brother and not only he started getting really good, got on the olympic team, became a professional, I think it's around age of 18 or so, and he had a boxing career as a professional for about eight years and he was good, but he wasn't great.

Speaker 4:          01:26:52       He was kind of slow and he started taking a lot of punches and it had an effect on him. And finally at the age of 26 people were saying, freddy, you better retire. Something really bad's going to happen. And so he retired at the age of 26 and if you think about it, for 22 years, boxing was his whole life. That's all he ever did. And now it's finished. It's over. His career is over and it's just, he's ready to go on a downward spiral to suicide or something bad. And he gets a job in vegas as a telemarketer because he'd been living in vegas and fighting and he's drinking heavily and in the day in the daytime because his jobs at night. And then he goes, does it tell me it's, he's on a fast track to suicide and one day he decides to go back to the gym where he used to train under his old trainer eddie fudge.

Speaker 4:          01:27:43       And he's just watching the fighters. They're like, he used to be trained and he decides, hey, I'm going to maybe help this one guy out. He's not getting any attention right now. And in that moment he just, he sort of realizes, wow, I like teaching. Like maybe this is what I was meant to be. and he starts coming back every single day. He's not getting paid. The trainer isn't hiring him. He comes on his own and he starts helping out the fighters and he slowly realizes that training is the ultimate job for him. He loves competition. he loves winning, but he doesn't have to take a punch as the trainer. He can in the training area with his large myths, but no punches to the head. He can strategize, he can win, he can compete, you can do all the mind games that he loves and he can give these years of experience.

Speaker 4:          01:28:34       The reason why I consider this a model is it took him a path where he sort of looked like he was going downhill where there was nothing left for him to do and suddenly just a chance encounter, made him realize what is real task in life was and all that experience that he had now could be applied to becoming the greatest trainer, a boxing trainer of our era, and also a mixed martial arts trainer. Um, and so people always say, well, you know, I, I can't make it. I don't know what my path is. I, I don't, I can't figure it out. I'm too old, etc. It's not a question of what age you are. This, you can always take the experiences and mistakes that you've had in life. And if you still got some guts and you're not a whiner, you can find a way to apply those skills.

Speaker 4:          01:29:25       In a new way that's going to be something that more engaged as you personally and emotionally because in fact, he really wasn't meant to be a boxer. His father had pushed him into it. What he was meant to be was a teacher because he's fucking brilliant at it, so that's sort of like the model of the path that god has for you. It's not all rosy. It's not all instantly finding the perfect job. It requires some pain, some defeat, some loss, some really tough moments, and then it's going to click together. As long as you don't give up

Speaker 1:          01:29:57       here, here, and it is important to to experience the loss. It's exploring. It's very important to feel the lows. If you don't feel the lows you want appreciate the highs. People in this day and age, they want instant coffee. You know they. They want instant gratification. They want everything to come to them with very little work. They want to win the lottery. Winning the lottery. It's probably the worst fucking thing that could ever happen to you as a human being. I think bAck, I played the lottery wants. I want a free ticket. I played it again. I lost. I'm done. That was it. I never played the lottery again in the same way, but what if I fucking one man, what if I want 100 million dollars when I was 21? I would be the biggest fucking loser of all time. Now I probably would. I would. The money would be gone.

Speaker 1:          01:30:38       I'd be suicidal because I blew through $100,000,000. But it's what happens. There's a reason why so many lottery winners burned through that money and it's because you don't know what it is. You didn't earn it. It's not yours. It's crazy. What you've done is you've found a weakness in the system. You've exploited it because the system is designed to steal money from people and get those dummies to spend all this money on a fucking lottery ticket. It's legalized gambling and the state profits from it. Not just once but twice because they don't just take the money. Your tax dollars. Okay? The money that you received after you spent all your money on taxes and all that, just what you've got left over. Then you buy a lottery ticket. Well guess what? All that money goes into a pool. The government takes a piece of it always, and then when you get paid, they take half of that. They fuck you every way coming and going, and you get all that money and you still blow it. You still blow it. You can't keep it with almost no one does. You can have a million other fucking parasites trying to steal it from you and because they know you don't deserve it, it's a. It's a mad, mad pursuit. The way you appreciate money, whether it's a dollar or a million dollars is when you earn it, you work hard, you experienced the loss, you go through the trials, tribulations, and then you get it.

Speaker 2:          01:32:01       when I look back at my path, I'll just say real quick, when I looked back at my path, you know I've got out of school and I didn't know what the hell I was. Gonna do and already felt terrible. I had some idea that I was already gonna be in my vocation doing something great. By the time I finished college. Well, that didn't happen, you know, I was successful in a variety of different things. I kept trying but not really nothing that I could really hang my hat on. So I was really anxious and antsy and I kept trying things. I started a marketing company. I sold fake vaginas. I worked for a pharmaceutical company, plus fleshlight, the largest fake vagina company. This is a tangent we don't need to go to for what? For stick your penis in them, you know, and I was working with oil and gas companies, but every single thing it was like the universe came and just bashed me on the head.

Speaker 2:          01:32:48       Something didn't work out, you know, I'd even get options in this company that was going to strike, you know, they were fracking some gas or something like that. I didn't really understand it at that point, but if that would have been successful and worked, I would've made a huge amount of money and that would have deterred me from this path I am now. Which now I truly feel I'm in my vocation. But if I look back, all of these things that I was fighting for for success, if they would have come and they would have come lucratively, they might have deterred me from what my real vocation is. So all of these things, all these bashes on the head, like the universe takinG a fucking hammer and saying, wack not going to work has kind of led me in this weird path to actually doing something that I truly now feel is my vocation. But those things are blessings. Those failures. I think eventually you would have found your way because it's just who you are. Maybe. So like maybe

Speaker 1:          01:33:41       it's easy for say when to say when someone's successful. I know that's like the secret. My issue with the secret is they only talk to the ones who worked. Like I was hanging out at the comedy store once and my friend kelly, kirsten, very funny, standup comic had a friend that came with her to the comedy show. She seemed like a very nice person. And she was talking about the secret and this is the first time I met her and she was going on about, you know, I'm going to have this and I'm going to have that and because I discovered the secret and you know that movie where it tells you to manifest your own destiny with your imagination and you can make things happen. She had decided that because she had this belief in this system, this, this secret thing, that she was going to somehow or another be super successful and find the man of her dreams and be rich beyond our wildest imagination.

Speaker 1:          01:34:30       Then I ran into her many years later. She came to another comedy show that I had a at the ucb and I remember she was very nice. So I was talking to her. I was like, hey, how you doing? I hadn't. I talked to her once and then I talked to her twice. Those are the only two times I ever had an interaction with this woman. She seemed very nice, but I'm talking to her and she's like, I don't know why it's not working like my relationships with terrible. I can't cut myself off of these bad relationships. My father is always wants money from me and he's always broke and he drinks and it's like she had. She was like, I thought that I was going to be able to create my own life and it's just not working. And the secret, when you watch those fucking shows, it's only the people that succeeded there. Like I drew a picture of the house that I wanted in 10 years later, I'm living in that house. I set a goal. My goal was $10,000,000. I have $10,000,000. The secret is real. Well, there's a person out there that drew a picture of a fucking castle on the moon and they're still in pasadena. They're like, where's my fucking castle on the moon? He ain't getting there, bitch. Okay. It's not that simple. And when you, you're, you're dealing with a very biased profile. You're only talking to the people that are successful.

Speaker 4:          01:35:42       Yeah. Well, I mean, one of the things in the laws of human nature coming up is this idea that if there's something that's easy, uh, that someone's trying to pedal, it's a deception. It's a con game. We want to believe we humans wanting to believe in something quick and easy and simple. And if we believe in something that means it can't really be real. If we believe that because of that, um, in other words, we want to believe that we can, that god will grace us with, you know, if we do perform certain rituals or that we can make a lot of money by just following the secret. The truth of the matter is that to get really successful, to make money that lasts, it takes hours. It takes 10,000 hours, it takes 20,000 hours. It takes a lot of work, tedious work, drudgery, boredom, moments of challenge, two feet.

Speaker 4:          01:36:38       That's the reality. So anybody that's trying to tell you that, that is not the case, that there are shortcuts. They're con artists, okay? That's just pure and simple there, connors. And one thing I'm trying to tell show in, in, in mastery is that we humans are geared towards pleasure. We don't want to do things that are naturally painful. We are immediately attracted to things that offer us some kind of pleasure or reward. And the problem is too many things nowadays offer pleasures that are immediate, instant rewards, um, you know, a movie or a video game or something like that, or a drug where without much effort, we get a feeling of relaxation, pleasure. and what I'm trying to show in mastery is that there's a different kind of pleasure that you want to train your body towards, aiming at. And that's a pleasure that comes from conquering yourself, from learning something deeply as you're taking up a or you've been doing archery for some time. It's probably not too satisfying the first few days that you were doing at our first few weeks. It was a challenge. There wasn't much creativity involved, et cetera. But if you keep doing this for five years, 10 years, suddenly it's reach a level pleasure

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       that no video game could ever, ever begin to supply you. And I want to reorient your whole value system towards this other kind of pleasure that comes from conquering your yourself, getting discipline, getting skilled at something, becoming really good at it and feeling incredible sense of fulfillment as opposed to all those immediate rushes that our culture tries to pedal.

Speaker 1:          01:38:21       That's such a huge point for satisfaction in life. I feel most relaxed after I've worked out really hard and not just physically because I've blown off all this steam, but because I did it, you know, I'm, I'm a big fan of being uncomfortable and I tell that to people and I go, what are you talking about? Like, look, nobody likes sleeping in more than me. I mean, maybe you do, but I doubt it. I love it. I love sleeping in, but I don't do it. Okay. I get up, I get up and a half to get up unless I can, you know, did all my shit. But my point is in when I have something that I have to do when I do it, if I don't want to do it, it feels even better once I've done it. And that's, that's the fan, that's the fan of being uncomfortable, that I liked that feeling.

Speaker 1:          01:39:09       I liked that feeling because that feeling of shaped me. It's rewarded me. It's one of the reasons why pursue so many things that I've never done before. Why I got into archery. Why, why I'm enjoying it. I'm enjoying it because I fucking suck at it. You know, I like sucking at something. Yeah. Because you suck at it. And now I don't suck out as much as I did three weeks, three months ago. Whatever the hell it is. When I first bought a bow, I'm better at it now for sure. I put pictures online of my, my fucking my patterns that I can hit my, um, the uh, you know, arrows in the bull's eyes and shit because I want to reinforce that in my head to keep doing that. And also there's a discipline involved in something that's very difficult to do that requires all of your concentration. That clears the mind. And I think that that's. You can get that in gardening. You know, you can get them running up hills, whatever it is. When you're running up hills, you're not thinking about too much other shit when you're absolutely exhausted and your heart's pounding your chest and you know you've got 300 yards to go and you don't think you can make it. There's, there's a. there's a beauty in that.

Speaker 2:          01:40:12       Yeah. You're talking a lot about zen philosophy almost too, as well as using some modality of movement, which is often it is or anything to find a, a sort of presence of mind, you know, returning to that state of openness of consciousness and archery is one of those main channels and in the art of archery, great book, I've read that and you know, you, you work for these moments, they call it satori where it's these moments where you have this really mindless shot that you take in archery and everything is just completely in the moment. And I think the masters have found a way to duplicate that more. You know, more often more. They have a almost a formula that can allow them to get

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       these moments where they're really in the zone as you would call it, or flow the flow. Yeah, getting these flow states, which is really, you know, hearkening back to that old zen philosophy of being of no mind and that is the the experience that best describes martial arts at its best as well. When you're fighting, when you're competing, especially if there's anything on your mind, anything else besides the task at hand, besides dealing with the other skilled person, you're going to be diminished. You will be diminished. Your skills will be diminished. Your mind will be diminished. It's one of the reasons why so many people talk trash. They talk trash to fill your mind up with other tasks. They fill your mind up with insecurity and doubt or anger, which is just as bad. Fill your mind up with all those emotions. You might be able to win with anger if you're fighting a less than skilled opponent, but if you fight a real master and you have anger, you're going to make mistakes.

Speaker 1:          01:41:46       You're going to open yourself up, you're going to fight with that anger, and in fighting with that anger, you're gonna. Expose yourself. You're not gonna fight with perfect strategy, unless you're Mike Tyson versus michael spinks were is fuck. No maTter what he does to tyson could come into that fight on cocaine, angry, didn't matter. He's going to kill you because he's just so much better and less that, but when you have to mike tyson's, you know what you get, you get Mike Tyson versus evander holyfield. You get a guy who was fighting with purity and a guy who's going to beat your fucking ass. You're not going to take him out of there with one big rush in the first round and you know you're going to wind up getting knocked the fuck out, and that's what happened to holy wood to tyson. When he fought holyfield, he fought a real master. He fought a master when he wasn't a master anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:42:30       Yeah. This. I didn't include them in the mastery of an inclusive in my next book, but I was reading phil jackson's most recent book and he said, master himself, and he discovered then dealing with all these incredible egos on the team as he did with the polls and later with the lakers that if he tried to get them all wired up before a game and emotional, which is what a lot of coaches would do, gala, we're going to rip the guts out of them. Let's go kill the lake or whatever, that they would play much worse. So his job was to imbibe in them incredible peacefulness and calm this so they would meditate before a game which no other coach ever did before. And he wanted them completely to be mindful in the game so that they could focus on the task and not use all that anger to push them.

Speaker 4:          01:43:18       And some players could use the anger a little bit, but most people like dennis rodman. He would make them do all sorts of terrible mistakes and look at the results. you know, there's no coach who's had more championships or more success than someone like phil jackson, but the thing that I tried show in mastery, because I have a story of a great zen master, a man named hakuin, uh, because I myself practice zen meditation had been for many years. This man, if this was in sEventeenth century, 18th century, Japan, he was reacting against all the zen practices that were going on in Japan that we're trying to promise you enlightenment through something very simple. All you had to do was sit in what's called zaza and seated meditation and enlightenment would come to you. And he said, this is such bullshit. I hate this. This isn't the way to mass, to enlightenment.

Speaker 4:          01:44:09       They've gotten away from the true essence of zen. You have to have pain. You have to go through 10, 20, 30 years of tortured doubt, misery. The zen master hitting you over the head with that stupid stick. Every time he saw that you weren't concentrating and then you would be enlightened. And so I'm trying to show you, even if it's enlightenment, which seems like the most material thing you could think of requires the same process of going through a practice of having pain, of having resistance, of having a teacher tell you that you're fucked up, you're wrong, hitting you on the head, on and on. It's a life. Is that okay?

Speaker 5:          01:44:46       Greatest teacher of all life will hit you on the head. It's sure if you don't have any teacher with an actual stick, you better believe that you know life itself will handle that.

Speaker 4:          01:44:57       No, I mean the. What I try and say is I'm grounding you in what the human brain was evolved for because our brains aren't, weren't wired for ipods and iphones and twitter. They were wired over hundreds of thousands of years of hunting, of dealing with extremely radical, dangerous situations in which it the one moment, if we're not careful, the leopard will come and eat. Us and early humans were being eaTen quite often by large cats. I'm very dangerous environment in which your awareness, your focus, your ability to understand your environment as if it were on your fingertips, to know every square foot of that very dangerous african savanna that you're on. That's what the brain was wired for. Focus, seeing something deeply, understanding your environment, not being distracted here and there and looking over there. That's not how the brain was evolved, so all of these disciplines, from boxing to zen enlightenment, to archery, to music, to whatever, they're all connected with the same brain process that we all have to go through in order to reach this point where we've mastered our environment. Whatever that might be.

Speaker 5:          01:46:13       your work in meditation, what, what type of may saId zen meditation. What type of zen meditation do you practice?

Speaker 4:          01:46:20       Well, I've done mostly renza was called rinzai. There's soto and rinzai. I used to go to a place where I was trained and now I do it on my own. What's the difference between the two schools of thought? One of them is more of a passive process where you're just sitting there trying to completely empty your mind and that's sort of the easier, slightly easier path and the concept is if you're able to reach a state where you're not thinking at all and you've your mind, enlightenment will come to you. The other school is more active. You can't just, not just so passive. You just can't empty your mind. You have to do something else. And that something else is. I'm simplifying it my junior, but that's something else is, is more discipline and going through learning these various coeds, uh, for instance, the most famous koan is these are usually a series of questions they'll sound of one hand clapping, but the one that I've used for years is. The question is, does the dog have buddha nature? And the answer from the zen master is move, move, meaning no, but it means more than no. It means like nothing just nothingness. And it's the most powerful zen koan ever written. If you ever try and think about it deeply, you will reach enlightenment. The different school of thought is you meditate on that koann almost like a mantra and try and figure it out until it opens up a gate in your head. Um, that's a simplified version of the two different types.

Speaker 5:          01:47:53       So the idea being that this preposterous question becomes sort of a pattern that your thoughts go into and you become empty because there's, this pattern becomes you. You say it over and over and over and over again. You recite it. You think about it over and over again until you reach a state of mind,

Speaker 4:          01:48:14       until you become so absurd that the words fall off of you. Zen is trying to teach you something that's wordless. We're so trapped in language and words and thinking that that's, it separates us from our natural state of know of original mind, of the nonthinking mind. I know that sounds strange idea, but um, so through words, you're going to realize the absurdity of words that they're not. They're disconnecting you from reality. And so at that point you realize that move means everything. There's absolutely nothing real in this universe that can be encompassed by a word. My talking about it here is absolutely completely counterproductive and and ridiculous because people are going to think, oh, I'll just repeat the word move over and over again. No, it takes months of, of thinking very deeply about this is trying to cut you off from that chatter in your head from, from thinking constantly, linguistically about. It's a total physical form of enlightenment, zen. It's, it's most physical form of enlightenment you could reach.

Speaker 5:          01:49:25       I keep getting reminded of that bill bradley story that you told, you know, and kind of repeating the same thing bill bradley was, he was a terrible basketball player to start big, gangly, slow, not, not terrible, but it wasn't good, but he had the most relentless pursuit of improvement of anybody that I've ever read. You can probably pick up the story, but he, you know, dress, dribbling the

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       ball constantly. Eight hours, nine hours a day, you know, again, over and over and over again. And that kind of repetition, you know, it's, it's all part of this same pattern of doing the same thing over and over again.

Speaker 4:          01:50:01       well, I'm glad you bring up music is a great story. It's kind of another like freddie roach type thing. You take the skis, he's a white guy who happens to be tall, but he loves basketball. He's like nine years old, and I know this myself because I love basketball when I was a kid, just the sound of the ball swishing through the net. He just loved that, that side of the sound of that, the feel of it. So we had this sort of visceral love of the game, but he stunk at it. He was tall, awkward, slow. There's no way he'd become good at it. so he decided he was gonna train himself from a very early age and I call it, um, you know, they have a concept in called deliberate practice where you learned to practice what you're not good at because we often, if we're taking up archery or basketball, we find something that we're good at and we tend to just repeat that.

Speaker 4:          01:50:50       And tHen our practice becomes very one sided, deliberate practices to practice on what you're not good at. I call it resistance practice, actually practicing it. What is painful in enjoying the pain? And that's bill bradley. He put these special glasses on his head that prevented him from looking down so he could. He would dribble on a court for 10 hours or 10 hours, three or four hours, and he couldn't look down at his feet which trained him to dribble. That's the worst thing. You can have fear always looking down. You're not able to see where what's going on on the court. So he did. He did that. He went on a cruise with his parents across to england and he didn't. He wanted to build a practice there. He brought his basketball and below deck. There were these incredibly long alleys that would go from one end of the shift to the other that were very narrow.

Speaker 4:          01:51:43       He would put on a special glasses and he would dribble back and forth in this narrow area so that he could dribble with absolute complete control. He devised all of these other exercises where he could train himself to see almost behind himself or at least way over to the side on and on and on until he became so good that by the time he got into college at princeton and then later he played for the New York knicks in the seventies with all the great champIonship teams. People would look at bill and they go, my god, this guy is. He's a born. He was born with a basketball in his hand. He's naturally gifted. He is so graceful. He has eyes in the back of his head. He could make a pass to walt frazier without even looking. They didn't realize that he had gone through the most insanely rigorous, painful, deliberate form of practice ever invented by a single human athlete. I'm at a very early age, um, and it made, it, made the game fun for him. It was sure it was a lot of pain, but by the time got good and he was in high school. All the girls were admiring him. You know, he got invited to go to princeton. I mean, it paid off. And he got a huge level of pleasure and the game became incredibly fun, but it was all based on these insane moments and periods of of pain that he put himself through.

Speaker 1:          01:53:03       That's a beautiful story. I love that story. That's amazing. That's such a huge lesson for young people coming up to learn and here to instill that into your mind and to use that as a template.

Speaker 4:          01:53:15       Yeah. Particularly nowadays when you're just so inundated with immediate pleasures and so many young people are disconnected from what I call, you know, the, the, the pattern that our brains were built for. If you're going against that pattern and trying to get things quickly or immediately, you're just going to fail. You're just going to be a loser in life. there's no you can't. You in your short life, can't suddenly move against 2 million, 3 million years of evolution. I'm sorry. It's just can't be done.

Speaker 1:          01:53:47       That's a beautiful statement, man. That's so that what you said is so important and that story, that bill bradley story is such a powerful story because anyone can do that with whatever you're trying to do. Exactly.

Speaker 4:          01:54:00       I mean, he just happened to be born tall, so if you hadn't ended up being six foot six or seven and he wouldn't know, but that's all.

Speaker 1:          01:54:07       What about muggsy bogues, he was a great bass player. There's plenty of examples of people who exactly. They physically weren't built for. I mean, Mike Tyson was one of the smallest heavyweight champions of that modern era. You know, he was five foot 10. He, you know, he weighed 215 pounds in his prime look, go back to primo carnera who was a heavyweight champion and the fucking twenties or thirties or whatever the hell it was. He was like 300 pounds, you know, I mean, mike tyson's, in my opinion, the greatest heavyweight of all time, and it wasn't that big. It wasn't a big guy, you know, and the, the cool part is that ultimately, you know, we've talked about it before. Any master that you meet, they're generally a real true pleasure to be around. You know, if they've worked through all of these country egoistic attitudes that they may carry along.

Speaker 1:          01:54:50       And it's through this, almost overcoming this physical resistance in the very heart of the mastery that they're doing. It doesn't matter, ping pong, bowhunting, comedy, whatever, basketball, whatever it is, you reach a certain place by pushing through that pain and going through those hours and doing those things that almost tempers your spirit as the, as the main thing that's happening. And it just, the skill kind of comes along with it sometimes been focused on the sometimes not though unfortunately sometimes focusing on that skill becomes to the detriment of all other aspects of your life. And there are people that achieved mastery in very specific things that are fucking total shitheads ty cobb. Great example. It was famous shithead. You know what I mean? There's a lot of people, Mike Tyson in his prime, you know, went to jail for rape. There was a lot of. I mean, I don't think he did it. He says he didn't do it and he's really honest pretty much everything else in

Speaker 6:          01:55:44       his life. But the point being, you know, he was a wild, crazy fuck. And that was one of the reasons why he was being successful. There are very many examples of people who become so selective in what they're trying to do and so obsessed and focused to the detriment of personal relationships to the detriment of their own personality. I mean, steve jobs would definitely fall under that. I agree. It doesn't have to be that way though.

Speaker 7:          01:56:10       it doesn't have to be that way. Then I always say I'm even with ty cobb or steve jobs, they were probably miserable to be around, but he had a pretty hugely satisfying life.

Speaker 6:          01:56:21       Maybe. I don't know man. I don't know that guy now. I don't know. I think it kinda goes to your. Use the bathroom real quick, please tell you. Hey goes to kind of one of your final points which is on that path to mastery. The final level is building bridges back to nature, back to different and making other connections. You know. So if you stay too focused in that one thing, he never looked to build a bridge to anything else you can probably result in some of these issues.

Speaker 7:          01:56:46       Yeah, I mean, for those who don't know the book, essentially I've laid out kind of five or six steps towards this ultimate form of mastery. It's like a path and it involves first discovering who you are, what you were meant to do, then going through what I call the apprenticeship in which you develop all of the proper skills later in life. You have like a real firm basis for becoming creative. And part of that apprenticeship involves working with mentors and masters and it also involves learning how to work with other people and deal with their weirdness and their political games and then showing you then how you reached the creative level and then the mastery level. And it's a loose path. It's not like a straight line, uh, but I'm sort of showing you the various steps that get you there. And as he poinTs out, um, particularly nowadays, uh, it involves the kind of a well-roundedness.

Speaker 7:          01:57:46       You're not just some asperger's guy in silicon valley who's great at a logarithms and creating the ultimate, you know, facebook or whatever. you also have to have social skills. And I have a whole chapter in mastery of social intelligence. You have to learn how to deal with people. You have to be socially fluid, you have to know how to be empathetic, how to understand what other people's feelings are, how to handle the assholes that will inevitably cross your path. So sort of the people that that joe's talking about who are a little bit one sided, they've kind of bypassed some of these other things that I'm talking about because I'm trying to get you to that well rounded form of mastery,

Speaker 6:          01:58:31       which is true mastery mastery over your whole life, not just a specific task. very much so. Do you. You were talking a lot about meditation. Did you ever spend anytime in an isolation tank? I have.

Speaker 7:          01:58:42       Do you do iT on regular basis? When I was living in New York years ago as a journalist, they asked me to write an article about isolation takes. This was when they were just starting out early eighties. They were around before that. They were, but they became a recreational thing in the early eighties. The yeah, they were around as a cia experiment and the people know john lilly, the guy john lilly, but, but for the general public, it really became like a fad in the early eighties. Uh, so I, I was asked to cover and I got kinda hooked and I did it for awhile. I haven't done it since then, but I was quite. It's a great experience.

Speaker 1:          01:59:21       I think that was because of the movie altered states. When did that movie come out? Because that was how I found out about this. I think you're right. 81. No. Nineteen 80, 80 altered states. Exactly. Yeah. It's, isn't it funny how a movie can just start a trend like that? Um, I found out about altered states when I was in high school. I watched the movie in high school or right after it came out. I actually saw in junior high because there's 80. I wasn't in high school yet, but uh, I got into isolation tanks when I first came to California because they had them here and I never knew that there was a place where you could get into one and through talking about it on the podcast, the, the entire industry has got this massive bump now and there's isolation tank centers opening up all over the world that credit me talking about it on the podcast and youtube videos that I talk about it. I have one of my banks meant, oh man. I think it's. How often do you do it? All the time. I think I was in yesterday. I think it's the most important tool. Actually, yesterday, not online day before yesterday. I didn't go yesterday. I think it's the most important tool that I've ever discovered. How often should it? I at least an hour. I think an hour is the right amount of time.

Speaker 7:          02:00:32       Is there somebody that wakes you up and gets you out?

Speaker 1:          02:00:34       No. I have a timer. I set a timer if I have to, but sometimes I go in there if I don't have

Speaker 7:          02:00:42       sense of time. You have no idea, but an hour is

Speaker 1:          02:00:46       kind of. Yeah, maybe. I don't know. My brain seems to know when to hours is two hours seems pretty standard for me. Like if I, if I don't have any time constraints, two hours seems to be what I really, depending on whether or not I'm sober or not when I go into it, never drunk. But marijuana is usually the, uh, intoxicant of choice, especially edible marijuana, which provides a much more hallucinogenic effect. Yeah. Yeah. I think it enhances the experience of the psychedelic state inside the tank. You don't freak out or. I like figuring out, freaking out, freaking out. It's important. I'm a big fan of freaking out because then much like, you know, the stress of exercise or discipline through the experience of complete freaking out you. There's lessons to be learned. Confront your demons and stuff. Yeah. The psychedelic state that you can achieve inside an isolation tank. I'm edible. Marijuana is pretty, pretty

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       fucking intense. Wow. But it's just the data environment for meditation. I mean, there's no better environment ever created for meditation. In fact, it's the only environment like it on earth. You're a successful man. How come you don't have one of those?

Speaker 7:          02:01:54       I don't have a basement, but the basement. well, I don't know. my girlfriend would want

Speaker 6:          02:01:59       edit our hub shit. Get a new one. New girlfriend. Moving on. She tried to keep you from having an isolation tank. What's she trying to do to keep you from enlightenment? Yeah. All right. I'll try that. Honor the artist talking about your own laws. You're violating them right now by saying that. Did your girlfriend tell you what kind of car you can drive to?

Speaker 7:          02:02:22       No. Oh, but sometimes you got give in to the other person. You know relationships a little bit about that.

Speaker 6:          02:02:27       Compromise. Not if it's about an isolation tank. No, you're right. You're right. and no fucking reason. I'm sorry. I'm beating you over the head with your own work. That's all right. Everybody does that.

Speaker 7:          02:02:39       But zen meditation is sort of like the the isolation because the point of it is, is to cut off all stimuli and you're not. You don't have to rely on this environment that you're putting yourself into. So your eyes are open when you're meditating, but you're not looking at anything and you're not getting in any stimuli at all, so you're not hearing anything. I mean there can be sounds outside, but you're not paying attention to them and you enter the state that's similar to what the isolation take is. I can enter a state like the isolation tank without the isolation tank because I cut off all stimuli and I enter my own mental space and incredible things can happen. So you just,

Speaker 6:          02:03:22       nor the stimuli until the point where it's not reaching the mind, is that the idea behind it

Speaker 7:          02:03:27       training it's years of meditation where you're not good at it and still to this day, thoughts invade your head, which probably don't so much. Well they do when you're In an isolation tank of course to do. Um, but if you go, uh, it's called samadhi and somadi is a state where your samadhi tanks. No. Yeah, that's the name of the company, right? That's right. I remember tanks. I remember that. Well, somebody is a kind of mindless state or that's not exactly the word, but you're, you're, there's no thinking going on and it's just incredibly euphoric. You could reach that through medItation, but it maybe after 20 minutes or 25 minutes you get to that state, but you're cutting off all stimuli

Speaker 2:          02:04:12       and the reasons they founded yoga was to make it so that there was less stimuli coming from your seated ass, you know, and the law, the way that your legs were folded when you're meditating because all of that noise that an isolation tank filters out. And I love, I love the tank. It's most effective for me. but you know, they would do yoga so that they could sit in that pose and have less of that stimuli yelling for longer so they could reach those in which they

Speaker 6:          02:04:38       could find that wow. So personally find that yoga releases some form psychedelic chemicals in the mind that it's, its own practice and gotten high, like legitimately high from yoga to the point where uh, not I don't want to say intoxicated like, um, like diminished in some way or affected like I can't form sentences or anything like that, but like I feel like a chemical effect or a biological effect, some sort of a real tangible effect from yoga definitely. Which I have always wondered. I mean, my thought process was why would these people do all this for so long? Like what, why would they have this practice for thousands of years unless there was something to it and there's something to it.

Speaker 7:          02:05:21       I do a lot of swimming and I find swimming the x absolute ultimate form of exercise because there's nothing, there's no stimuli. I mean You're not sitting there thinking about the water anymore and your brain just zones out and after you do long distance swimming, you can reach very interesting alpha states.

Speaker 6:          02:05:41       Yeah, I agree. I find it incredibly, I'm not just beautiful in that sense where you achieve states, but it's really taxing. it's really hard to swim like most people think of swimming is like recreational activity, like I do a lot of swimming with my kids and we play around, but when I do laps like fuck. It's fucking hard. Yeah, swimming is hard to do, man. You look at it dude, like Michael Phelps. That's a bad man. That guy has achieved this incredible ability to move through the water. Like a fucking fish. That's not an easy. That is a real legit difficult accomplishment.

Speaker 7:          02:06:18       Yep. I like the pain, the mental pain involved in swimming because I like to swim long distances where you're like, I just can't do this anymore. It's so boring and it's so painful and I'm just going to drown. I kept. I'm taking whatever, and then you just push past that and you swim two miles and you get out. Man. What a great feeling.

Speaker 6:          02:06:39       Do laps in the pool over and over and over again. You're not one of those crazy fox. It gets in the ocean. Are you?

Speaker 7:          02:06:45       I would love to, but I live close to the ocean and it's cold and polluted. If I lived in Hawaii, I'd be swimming in the ocean and then they get radioactive shit come from Japan. Says if I lived in the yucatan, I'd.

Speaker 6:          02:07:01       Ah, there you go. That's it. That's the spot. Long ocean swims moved to the uk. That is a beautiful patch of water though, by the way, to loom you ever been into loom? No, I've been to teach an eatsa chinita. Yeah, it's amazing. Yeah. Incredible. Yeah, that's freaky spot. You know, being around those ancient ruins is one of the most bizarre moments I think I've ever had. Just walking around knowing that people were playing football with human heads where I was standing scant 1500 plus years ago or whatever it was. Um, so this, uh, these, these altered states that, uh, you achieve with zen meditation, do you, do you find them to be psychedelic? Do you find like that you can hallucinate, do you?

Speaker 4:          02:07:46       Well, they, you're not supposed to. That's not the goal. They have this word called, which means a demon. And what it means is after a certain point in, in meditation, demons start appearing in your brain where you've cut out all sensory stimuli and suddenly images start coming up that are just weird and random and somewhat frightening. Uh, and I, that happens to me all the time, like a almost or like in a dream state, you know, how in dreams their thoughts and images that it seems so random and sometimes scary by how random they are. You're consciously getting that in your head as you're entering deeper and deeper into this state, but you're trying to push past that. You're trying to push to the state where there's nothing coming in at all and you kind of transcend the, this sort of thinking state that you're constantly in. Can't really put it in words. I don't even want to try and put it in words. So the goal isn't really to have these vivid hallucinations, but they happen and they're very interesting.

Speaker 6:          02:08:51       That's fascinating though, that it's thought to be demons.

Speaker 4:          02:08:54       Yeah. And in the traditional zen form, they, that's what they call them. Um, and uh, I know that, um, they have in japanese iconography these very frightening looking demon like figures and then they do actually have a concept of hell, uh, in, in japanese culture that came into zen buddhism and I know hakuin talks about these very vivid images of demons that he had when he was a child that he was so afraid of them that he decided he had to get into buddhism and zen to overcome them. So I don't know exactly. I'm not going to be hallucinating these japanese demons that were probably very much in their minds and in their culture. Uh, but if, you know, it's interesting. This is a total, I don't know how far we're getting away from things here, but there's no getting away. Okay. This is concept in ancient times.

Speaker 4:          02:09:50       So there's a great book called the bicameral mind. I don't know if you're familiar with it. I never read it though. The ideal is in this book is that for ancient people, consciousness was almost like a voice in their head and it flipped them out and they couldn't understand it and they were constantly like on drugs. Hearing their own thoughts and that's why they had to project it onto gods and demons and other things that are out there in the world, but literally hearing their own thoughts was almost like a continual trip for them. It's hard for us to imagine because we're so used to the chatter in our minds, but originally, according to this man, this was how they experienced consciousness with this in the early days of language. Is this a

Speaker 6:          02:10:31       fairly recent? Is that was the idea

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       behind it is 6,000, 7,000, 10,000 bc. It's a, I can't remember the writer's name. Julian something or his last name is julian. Great book. Um, but if you read books like about buddhism, which I do for racially, uh, the history of it, uh, early people in meditation, early adherence to buddhism, we're constantly talking about that chatter in their mind as if it were hell. It was like hearing this noise of thoughts was just awful. It was claustrophobic and frightening and they had to get into meditation and buddhism just to calm the mind down and not hear that voice in their heads. Now, this is a totally alien notion to us because we're so used to it and it's almost not a good thing that we're so used to it. Um, but I think that that's sort of the idea of the demons constantly hearing this voice, these things in your head that aren't, you're not willing them, you know, like you're not willing these thoughts that are constantly coming up into your mind.

Speaker 4:          02:11:38       Where are they coming from? There's a great zen cohen called, who is the master? Where are your thoughts coming from? Who is the master calling up these thoughts in your head, particularly in your dreams or particularly when you're not, when you're maybe tired and suddenly this image comes up, you're not calling it up. Well, where is it coming from? That's where I think this idea of demons is, is connected. This reminds me a lot of going through a psychedelic experience like iowasca in, in that path, you reach this very visual point in the experience, which is generally, it can either be incredibly beautiful or it can be incredibly hellish. Like would make well incredibly hellish. For example, I'm, I'm, I have different spiders going inside of me and laying eggs and exploding and bugs are coming out of me. There's eels coming inside, eating through my intestines and eating all my organs coming out.

Speaker 4:          02:12:32       I'm sliding naked through a va, down a vine of thorns. It's ripping up my flesh. These are all images that happened in moscow trip or incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful colors you've ever seen. The most beautiful lights, images, things and you know, I get a lot of people asking me about these trips and for them that is, you know, who haven't done it very much. They focus very much on those visions, but those visions are almost like the fireworks and the chatter to what's going to come after and what comes after is this kind of oneness with your thoughts and your, your highest consciousness in your highest being that has passed all that and maybe that brings up resistances. Things you can overcome. Maybe it helps you with some thoughts, but the real value of it in Iowa, oscar dmt or any kind of psychedelic is that period after were these demons, are these visions. And everything goes away and to me that's the real end goal. That's the real gem. Well that's really similar to the zen meditation because you're going through. So I meditate for 35,

Speaker 7:          02:13:32       40 minutes, the first 25, I'm having those demons. I'm hearing my thoughts. I'm trying to get over. And then I finally reached that state only lasts for 15 minutes. That's the best state. It also sent a similar process. That's it. Yeah. So it's not so much about the visions, it's about what happens after the vision. So it seems to me very much like what you're saying.

Speaker 1:          02:13:52       Yeah, the that state after very difficult yoga sessions, it doesn't last very long, but there's a period of intense relaxation and enlightenment that you achieve where you kind of have a better perspective of things, but it only comes through this very difficult work of the hour and a half of yoga that you have to do to get to that spot. And if you have acid anywhere along the way, you don't reach that spot. I don't reach that spot every time. You know, I reached it a lot, but I don't reach it every time. It's very tricky, isn't it?

Speaker 7:          02:14:22       Yeah. You'd ever know and they're like, I don't know if it's the same with archery or the things that you do like that, but when you start the meditation you bring a mood and it's never the same sunday for no reason. I just falls into place and some days you don't know why this anxiety is not on your inside. You never could figure out what you bring to it. It's interesting.

Speaker 1:          02:14:45       It really is. What do you have a very rigid schedule when it comes to your meditation and your discipline? Like how do you structure your days? You're obviously self employed, you know you're a writer. So do you. Do you have a structure? Like I must write for this amount of time. I must meditate. Like how do you, how do you do it?

Speaker 7:          02:15:05       No, I every morning I wake up and I meditate for 35 minutes and nothing will stop me. I'm sick. Or even if I'm traveling or whatever, every day. Do you sit in a particular way? I have the proper pillows and I have a little place and I have a little clock that goes off with bells and I sit in the lotus position until my legs are like screaming

Speaker 1:          02:15:32       really, that you can pull your legs up. Yeah. It's hard to do, huh?

Speaker 7:          02:15:37       Yeah. I've been doing it for many, many years, but then I recently broke my foot and I couldn't do it for about three months, so now I'm fine and I can do it. So I'm back to having some pain again. Uh, but the pain is good as we all know. Um, and then I, uh, then I, I'm not usually writing because my books require so much research. Uh, so right now I'm in a research period where I'm reading for racial sleep books about human nature, psychology, etc. And then in Nevada year I'm going to start writing and then I go onto a kind of a different routine where I'm a, I'm a little more crazed and hard to be around.

Speaker 1:          02:16:13       That's fascinating. So you researched for a full year before then, right? Yeah. You discipline the research aspect of it.

Speaker 7:          02:16:19       Oh man, I'm so disciplined. It's probably bordering on ocd. I read, you know, three, 400 books and I read them, I don't them. And then I go back and I do these note cards and it's the note cards that's excruciating. That's like the bill bradley part. I put every book onto maybe 10, 20, 30 cards depending on how good a book it is. And at the end I'll have two, 3000 cards and I can written handwritten and I can take these cards and move them around and in the book is created out of the cards.

Speaker 6:          02:16:52       So the cards are the beneficial aspects of whatever book you're reading or what strikes you or.

Speaker 7:          02:16:58       But I'm able to break a book down that can be chaotic. So for instance, for this new book, uh, I have it a love a niche, a lot. I've never loved them since I was a kid. Uber manch the uber manch. This is a book about the uber match. My next book, and there's a book that I've read for him, uh, early book called human all too human. That's just the most amazing book, but it's chaotic. It's all over the place. He's got all these aphorisms and these thoughts and it's just like entering a rat's maze. I with my cards can organize all of his ideas and all of his thoughts and bring some order and show you the amazing pearls of wisdom this guy has gleaned out of his mad syphilitic brain. The syphilis. Oh yeah. He, yeah. He went mad at the age of like 44 and the best spent his last eight years and basically too much pussy, huh? no crazy. Well, he probably not enough pussy really? So you got syphilis. Pussy. He got. He probably went to a prostitute when he was in the prussian war and then got syphilis and then he. He didn't get laid enough. I was certainly probably his problem. That was why he was obsessed with uber. Manch a syphilis. That's probably why he got. It's probably not the not getting laid.

Speaker 6:          02:18:12       What'd they do? Back in those days when you had syphilis, there was no cure, right? You an apple or something like that. That was before penicillin, right? Yeah. Nothing much to do. I think some, some people were smart enough to start trying silver. I think silver had some use in some of these things, but it's not verY effective. Not like, not like an antibiotic. Yeah. It's fascinating because I was trying to explain to my kids the plague because we're reading a book and my five year old and my three year old, we're sitting in bed reading before bedtime. And the story involved the plague a plague upon you was one of the lines and uh, you know, they were like, what's a plug? That's shit. Before doctors, when they didn't really have doctors, when all doctors could do is like cutoff broken limbs. They, uh, they had diseases that would kill giant chunks of people. My kids are like, what the fuck? I'm like, yeah, not that long ago by the way. They wrote about it. So they had language and we were, were, were, were talking about earlier about the evolution of civilization and the amount of time, the very brief window between us and when we were animals in relationship to the length of time that things have been alive on earth. It's smaLl.

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       We're going through the most crazy and chaotic time pretty much ever. When the wheel, you know, descrIption that mckenna used to use about the exponential growth of technology was about sending a ball around the top of a funnel and then it takes a long time to get around the top, but that we're somewhere towards the bottom of the funnel now where that fucking thing is going around the tunnel going around the funnel so quickly. it's just, it's hard for us to really wrap our heads around. But when we talk to children about it, when I talk to children about it really sends it home. When I tried to describe to my kids what would a fucking plague is,

Speaker 2:          02:20:05       as you know, and just. I just remind, reminded myself of when you read actual accounts of the true pirates like blackbeard and things like that. One of the things that they would barter with for the most, like when they were making deals with, you know, the british ships or different thIngs and striking deals was venereal disease medicine. Like syphilis medicine. Like it'd be like we'll give you all the gold, but you have to bring over a chest of, of a medicine to cure that. Venereal disease, I think that was a probably a much bigger problem in ancient history than not. We're not completely ancient, but in past civilization than we give it credit people first venereal disease. I don't know. I have no idea how fucking dirty trick,

Speaker 1:          02:20:50       you know. I mean think about how few diseases kill you that you catch it just walking around like the flu, but you know, I think it might be nature's way to keep the population down a little bit. Most likely, right? Yeah. I mean it seems like what's going on, there's always a battle, right? Just like we were talking about the battle between discipline and success, the battle between being uncomfortable and doing things that are hard to do and the reaping, the rewards of that seems to be a battle nature of trying to fucking kill us so we get stronger. You know? I mean, we don't like to think that, but it's been directly proven that many plagues and many diseases have certain traits have risen through those, through those diseases which have made the human race actually stronger.

Speaker 7:          02:21:31       Although they say our cro, magnon ancestors, for Instance, lived longer than we do.

Speaker 1:          02:21:39       Really? Yeah. I've never heard that. Wow. That's amazing. And they've died at like 12.

Speaker 7:          02:21:45       Um, I mean, I know in the bible, but who believes the bible? Oh, 600 years ago, like moses died at the age of 193. That's a little shaky. I know. It is.

Speaker 1:          02:21:55       They didn't know what a year was back then. Now they're making shit up now. The calendar suck written on a rock that you can't really. Yeah. That's a lot of shit in the bible. It's fucking tough to swallow. Yeah. Um, so where did you read the cro? Magnon lived longer than us.

Speaker 7:          02:22:14       Uh, well, for one thIng that's for certain, they were bigger than we were real. Uh, they had a, they were taller. That's a known fact. Agriculture. Uh, we did not have certain diseases that we have now talked to the paleo people and they can fill you with, with all that stuff. Uh, but before we started having grains and all that bad stuff, people were perhaps living longer. They were certainly bigger.

Speaker 5:          02:22:43       magnum was five foot seven, five foot nine.

Speaker 7:          02:22:46       Oh you're, you're, you're, you're showing me wrong. But they were taller than the people that came after them.

Speaker 5:          02:22:52       Oh, okay. Well, there are. That's the average, but large males stood as tall six foot five. Not really taller than us. Okay. But taller then the people living than the humans of those after

Speaker 7:          02:23:07       in ancient Greece or whatever. Nothing like the internet to be able to show that

Speaker 5:          02:23:11       wrong. You know, 10 years ago there was no way you would've been able to prove me wrong. We've had many examples of people stating, I know you're not doing it, but there's been a lot of people that have bullshitted us. Yeah. Unfortunately, and I've spread information, so now I have to be diligent about that. What does that wikipedia. This is wikipedia, but it has references. If you'd like me to find the scientific references there in there as well. Don't get crazy. I think that. I think the path back between what we're talking about is that life itself needs resistance. Just as masters need resistance, you know? I mean there is no, there is no life that's worth living. IF everything is like that Alan Watts video, if we could make everything absolutely perfect and nothing is a surprise and there's no resistance out there, it doesn't become what it is.

Speaker 5:          02:23:58       It's not as rich anymore. It's not filled with the magic that life can be. I mean, resistance is an intrinsic part of that. And the fact that nature is constantly looking to, you know, pick us off is part of that resistance and the fact that all of these forces are aligned against someone who's trying to become a master. The pain sacriFice, whatever people are saying, all of that, that is required for a master to be created, you know, that's, it's all part of the same thing. you know, it's this kind of dualism of force and opposition. The average liFe expectancy of cro magnon was 35 years. Alright. Alright. So I met, I meant the high. Sorry, did most of them. I've got something. I've got something that's maybe on chromat. I better shut up. 40th five would be exceptionally old for cro, magnon math. So if I was crow bag now, might be the fucking old wise man in the village she gets compared to the people who got into agricultural settlements after cro magnon they didn't live to be 35 years old. That age is also factoring or infant mortality for things like that. Things don't happen. Disease mortality, you know, it doesn't mean that the, a healthy crow bangin wouldn't live longer. That's the, that's the big things. Factoring infant mortality. That's a big one, right? Yeah. Mother's dying in childbirth. Shit that doesn't happen anymore. You know, that raises or as much. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:25:21       Um, but when I came back to what you were saying in the preface to mastery, I try and say the times that we live in, first of all, I, I make the point that we need masters in the world now. This is a time where we have incredible opportunitY largely through the internet where access to information, the ability to learn things, to develop skills, to have an isolation tank, to learn archery, to do all of these things. The world is opened up and the ability to develop skills and master something and create something is just completely unprecedented at the same time. The distractions and the resistance that we have to go through is equally unprecedented with the internet, with iphones, with all the other things that are making it so much harder for us to focus, and I want you to think of all of these things as the kind of the water that you have to swim against and if you're able to swim against all of these distractions that the world throws at you, you're going to become a real kick ass master in whatever it is because you've overcome something that 90 percent of the people in this world just submerges them under because they're too weak.

Speaker 1:          02:26:35       But there's also the clIche and it's very important to point out that there is no end result. That it's a journey and this journey does not mean becoming a master. There's not. There's no end point. You continue to get better at everything you do or you start to suck and that that's what happens. You will get better if you do not continue to get better. You are getting worse.

Speaker 7:          02:26:57       Yeah. Yeah, it's true. And uh, you know, you take someone like einstein, one of the greatest masters, he discovers the second theory of relativity at the age of 26 and nothing after that, he tried to do his unified theory.

Speaker 1:          02:27:11       You know, why? Why posey again? All that scientist was too much. oh, you mean he had too much? So I was a famous pussy out. A lot of people don't know that. It's true. It is true. Yeah. Einstein loved it. He was smart. So it was fine. When you know, two guys with the most brilliant minds of the 20th century, love pussy, don't want to go to baptist. A big old smile on einstein's face, wacky fucking image going on him and loved him. He was like, yeah, why wouldn't you? I mean, you talk about all the favorable traits for evolutionary success talking about one of the most brilliant men scientifically ever. Yeah. I would think that a lot of women will want that seed inside of them. You know, look at it. He's like, see this, look at that lady's fuck gene simmons. Look at that as the tongue of a fucking super genius with his own hair. He was, excuse me. He was a very unique individual in that that uniqueness. I'm sure there was some motivation behind that, not just the scientific motivation, but the actual natural motivation to be exceptional for breeding purposes that you know, women would find him exceptional. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          02:28:24       but you're right, it is a process so that you never can sort of rest on your laurels and say, oh, so the way I do it, I'm not saying that I'm a master, so don't misinterpret me, but the way I do it for myself is every book that I write, I'm back at square one. I, I'm nobody. I have no history of no fault readers. I'm not successful. I have to make it's death ground. I have to make my next book work or I'm. I'm a total loser. So

Speaker 1:          02:28:51       that's exactly the same process involved in standup comedy, standup comedy. You put out a new special and then once you have that new special, you throw all that material out and you start from scratch and you write all new material and if you do it that way, and that's the only real way to do it in this day and age, because too many people have the internet. Too many people. I mean everyone has the internet. Obviously too many people have access to your previous work, I should say, and in comedy you constantly need new material unlike in music. So rough. It's not. It's great. It's rough, but it's great. The roughness is the great part of it. yeah, but that, that whole process of mastery, you know, you say you're not a master. I think you are, but I think there is none. This is what I think you are a master, but there's no ultimate mastery.

Speaker 1:          02:29:40       A master is someone who is very good at the process, but there's no end. Yeah. The end doesn't exist. There's no. There's no where it becomes easy. There's no golden age of retirement. That's a bunch of horse shit that they fucking sell you to keep you in your job. There's no golden age. You're fucking dying, man. You're going to get old and you're going to reach that point where you know you can't really work anymore so you don't have to work anymore, and then you've got to watch your money. You know this, this selling point of one day and you'll retire and everything will be groovy the fuck it will. It's not going to be groovy. There's that whole half waiting for something to drop on you. Even the religious belief that you go through this life and just do your work and then you get to heaven.

Speaker 1:          02:30:19       Yay. You know, or you go through. If it's not religious, this capitalist belief you, you work in this job and it's gonna suck, but then you get to retire. No bullshit. You got to enjoy that every minute along that path that you're going on or choose a different path. Fuck the money. Fuck everything else. Do what you love to do the whole time and you'll smile at the end when your, when your time is up. Yeah, and if you do use the wrong motivations, you will not get the results you desire. You know, I know a guy who has been trying to get famous forever and he's trying to do it in all the wrong ways, you know, it's trying to become famous instead of focusing on whatever art form you choose to make you famous just wants fame and it just escapes them like sand through your fingers. You just can't hold onto it. You just can't, can't get a quantifiable amount in your hands and the motivation is incorrect. It's like the motivation was just on his art. I think probably he would be far more successful, but instead the motivation is based on the green demon of looking at all these other people becoming successful and not being able to find out why he can't achieve it himself.

Speaker 7:          02:31:27       I mean it. Attention is never the goal in. In mastery, it is actually a negative. Yes, but learning, learning is what gets you high. LeArning is what you love. If you love the attention more than the learning, then you're fucked. You're never gonna make it. Yeah, and that need, that need

Speaker 1:          02:31:43       for acceptance and it's like, it's the very opposite of what you should be striving for. Yeah. You know, and we were talking about people that become really successful and then lose their way and how you can learn so much from that. And in comedy. My um, my guide for that was always sam kennison because I think that sam kennison was the greatest comedian of all time from 1986 to 1987. I mean, I'm not kidding. I think maybe before that, you know, I found out about 86. I mean probably it was the greatest and 85 and maybe even in a four, but that's it from then on it's dog shit if you try to listen to sam kinison from 89 or 88, it's terrible comedy. I went to see him alive. He was awful. I saw him live several times because it was such a huge fan of his work and 86, but the dropoff was.

Speaker 1:          02:32:31       So there's guys who have good cd's and you know, they'll have hills and valleys. I myself, I have stuff that I really love and then stuff I was like, well that wasn't my best one, but then more motivation to do better than the next one. There's just sometimes creative glitches or what have you. A part of the process, but with kennison there's this fucking monster peak and then this crazy drop off of coke and hookers. A coke, a lot booze, a lot. You know, we had mark marin on the podcast who was palling around with kennison in the hay day at the comedy store when mark was a young kid and he told some amazing stories about this, the amount of substances. Mark hung out with kennison and he had to escape. He left la and he hit it So hard that he was hearing voices in his head for like almost a year.

Speaker 1:          02:33:23       Like literally he was psychotic and I met mark soon after that I met mark in boston like after he had been hanging out with kennis and after kennison was, you know, riding the wave and you know, he, I met mark I think in [inaudible]. 80 eight was when I started and I met him soon after that, so he had already gone through all this and he was a young guy working at the comedy store and he got to see this, the overwhelming amount of substances that kinison was consuming and massive and it just destroyed him. He never recovered from this cocaine, alcohol. I mean that. It wasn't writing either. His brother, his brother wrote about it. There's a book called mY brother sam was a great book about kennison written by his brother, who was, I think also his manager at the time who wrote about how there was a. He wrote about the tangible, tangible dropoff in his writing. It didn't write new materIal anymore and was sort of like, just partying.

Speaker 7:          02:34:16       Yeah, I mean there's, I talk in

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       the book about this myth that drugs will just instantly make you more creative. In fact, it's often the opposite. um, and I have example of coltrane who was probably maybe one of the greatest jazz artist who ever lived and he got hooked on heroin for awhile. When people have this myth that that's what made coltrane so great was the drugs and the heroin and the coke and in fact he, he said it was the worst. He did his worst work in that period and he got off of it like in 58 and never touched the drugs or drinking after that and did is better. Workout is much better. Work to create something requires so much discipline and so much mindfulness and focus that you just can't do it if you're constantly drugged out. Yeah. Especially those to those very depressive ones and very like. Coke and heroin are probably two of the worst, but there seems to be a connection between heroin and deep soulful music. Like maybe it helps them for a small time, reach a state, but then ultimately the abuse of it destroys your body so much that you can't keep it up.

Speaker 7:          02:35:26       Yeah. You mean like a velvet underground or something like that?

Speaker 1:          02:35:29       yeah, like there's something will hendricks and well people will argue dangerous wasn't really into heroin, but if you look at that photo behind me of his mugshot, that is from the fucking toronto police department when he was arrested for heroin, so it was a little problem with that little heroin in his system. I don't know what drugs. I mean, I know he was also involved in acid and You know, morrison was into heroin. There was a lot of alcohol involveD with a lot of those guys as well. But the ability to escape your inhibitions was they were chasing the dragon in a sense. Yeah, but look how long it lasts. Twenty seven. They're all died at 27. Janice joplin, hendrix, morrison. It seems to be the most dangerous

Speaker 7:          02:36:10       path to embark upon iF you're looking to gain something. I think one of the things I got from one of your books was the story about theater or dusty was that in was that in 48 laws of power where it gets in the 33 strikes for add in the 40 lows. Well, basically after he would be successful with a book, you would find that he was unable to really write and he didn't have that creative fire anymore to create another great work so he would take all of his life savings and go to the casino and just gamble it away in the night so that he was desperate and hungry again. He waS penniless, penniless, and at that point he had to write something great to get himself out. You know, so these, these people use these different strategies and he did that over and over again. That takes guts. You got to be a fucking crazy person. That death ground, putting yourself on death ground. It comes from sun tzu says a general with deliberately put his army on death ground, meaning he would deliberately put their back against an ocean or a mountain and they either had to defeat the enemy that's confronting them or they would die because they had no escape route, no safety net, no safety net, no escape

Speaker 6:          02:37:16       route safety nets or something that I've argued against ever since I was a child, which was another thing that my parents instilled in me that I had to have a safety net. And I've always told everybody who would listen, don't ever have a fucking safety net because if you have a net you will fall. You might not make it without the net, but you will not make it within that. So there's that. There's that.

Speaker 7:          02:37:37       Uh, I had an interesting experience with mastery, uh, were in writing the book where I've written four of the six chapters, but I was getting really late in delivering the final result. And the publisher basically said, you have like 11 weeks to finish the book, or we're canceling the project or, or postponing it. And they were, the, the two chapters left were the longest, the hardest, the most abstract and the most important. And it was like, there's no way I'm exhausted, I just can't do it. But I had no choice because if they cancel or postpone it, all of my hard work would be thrown out the window. So that was death ground. And finally, after three days of torturing myself and whining and bitching at myself, I decided, all right, I'm going to do it. I'm just going to try. Let's just do what I can.

Speaker 7:          02:38:27       And it was the most incredible writing experience I've ever had in my life. I was, I had to work harder than I've ever had to work. I got on this high where thoughts were just coming to me and my dreams and my, you know, I'm having sex every. It's just the most amazing. And they worked. And I was sitting there writing about creativity and intuition while they, while this was happening to me. And it just demonstrated to me that the limits that I thought I had are just sort of self imposed. And if I stop complaining and stop saying that I had these limits, I could explore beyond them and explore what I was capable of that I never thought I was capable of. Prior to that.

Speaker 6:          02:39:08       You know, hunter thompson wrote hell's angels. You finished the last x amount of chapters in like two days on cocaine? Yeah. Like you just got cooked up and fucking, he like, he had a deadline and maybe I should have tried that. Have you ever seen. I could have written it in two days. Me being maybe need adderall. Have you ever seen, um, the uh, the hunter s thompson documentary. Fear. not fear and loathing. Fucking was it called what? Yeah, gonzo years ago. Like what is it? The life and times of a hunter? S thompson is of the name of it. I got it saved on itunes. I should just pull it up on itunes. The documentary just from a couple of years ago. Have you seen that a couple years ago? No, I have. It is a fairly recent documentary, but god damn, it's good. God damn. It's good thing it's gone though the life and work of hunter s thompson. Is that it? Yeah. I watched it in a hotel in seattle and fucking spent it. That's it. I'm liking the woRk of dr. Hunter s thompson. I'm so good. It's so good. A seven point eight kit. That fucking blast me off there. It's not a 10 that just shows you. There's constant matter what you do in this life. That's that documentary, that Goddamn

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       10 and incredibly inspirational and I watched it in seattle at a hotel room and just on a whim, just larry will watch this. I was alone. I was doing some work and you know, I, I fucking wrote all night because of that documentary. Got on the keyboard and just smashed keys all night. Oh nice. It's those things that, you know, you catch these bursts of inspiration and thompson who's a personal hero of mine, used to call them fuel, you know, and he said that he personally believed that with the right song you could drive further in your car and your car would figure out a way if the right song was playing to go to go miles past the and theoretically obviously not even theoretically he was a, it was just a metaphor. Metaphor. Metaphor, right. Thank you. Thank you. Metaphorically he was, you know, just great at figuring out how to put these abstract ideas into a tangible form that you mind accepted and never met a deadline. And his whOle thing was like putting things off until the last minute. And then this fury of fucking teeth gnashing, slamming against the keys and this fucking. But it's almost like he forced himself into this, this back against the wall. What would you call it? The death ground. He forced himself into a death ground.

Speaker 2:          02:41:35       Well, in order to complete. I wish I'd done that. I would've included it among you. Do so. You know, I've know you've talking about comedy, you like following someone like joey diaz who is hilarious, right? Because you've talked about how that makes, you know, that would make some people a little bit scared and a little bit nervous, but you like it because it's going to bring out your best following somebody. That's that great. You know what I mean? Haven't you kind of mentioned isn't there something there in that same philosophy?

Speaker 1:          02:42:02       Maybe, but my philosophy in that is that I think that not foe, not working with funny really, really funny people is a twofold problem. One, it's famine thinking like they think that there's, there's a lot of really selfish comedians out there and one of the things that they like to do is they like to stack the deck so they'll bring this guys had a national touring headliners. They bring the worst fucking comedians you've ever seen in your life to open for them because these guys go up there and eat dick for half an hour and then you go on stage. The crowd has been tortured, waiting for actual entertainment and you're the hero. You're the conquering hero. So nobody out shines you this, but it is incredibly common and I think it's gross. I think a disrespect to the audience, first of all, I think it disrespects the fact that these people have paid money to see you.

Speaker 1:          02:42:48       They deserve entertainment, not just from you but from other people as well. And you shouldn't be scared of other people being funny. It doesn't take away from you being funny. The only way it would take away is if the person on before you is stealing your material or what it's called, stepping on your material. Like say if you know you had a very particular subject that you were famous for. Like jim gaffigan likes. Talk about hot pockets. He does this whole hot pocket bits. Really hilarious. If you went on before I even started talking about hot pockets, you would kind of step on his bit. You know you would and people will do that. The same shit heads like that actor that I told you that we'd like to go up to my friend and say it was fat right before he would go and read his lines.

Speaker 1:          02:43:26       That's that same sort of thinking, that same sort of famine thinking you like another person. Success should be inspirational to you. It shouldn't be detrimental to you. And so I. Um, and then the other thing is I'm a fan of comedy. I want to laugh. So I bring joey diaz who I personally think is the funniest guy who's ever lived. I bring him to open for me because I want to be. I want to be in a hilarious state before I go onstage. I want to be laughing. I'm not worried about not being funny because if I've done my job, I've done the work, it's going to be good. Like don't worry, you can't worry about that. That worrying is the enemy of comedy here. Yeah. It's just, it's pathetic. I bring murderers with main man everywhere I go, duncan, ari, jo. I just bring the biggest killers that I could find.

Speaker 1:          02:44:14       I take headliners at me. I've taken greg fitzsimmons on the road with me. I mean, I like doing shows with guys who were fucking awesome. I think it's reaLly important. It's, but it's not because I want to die something because we want to put my back up against the wall. I want the audience to get their money's worth and I want to be around my friends and I also want to support my friends. Part of the reason to bring in joey and ari and duncan on the road with me all these years is it's selfish because I want to have a good time and I want to be with them and I want to enjoy myself. So there's that. But also I want people to know how good these guys are and a lot of these guys are good in a really fucked up way.

Speaker 1:          02:44:51       That's not it. It's not really palatable for comedy central. It's really hard for them to get on hbo. You know, for a guy like joey diaz, the only way for that guy to get famous as the internet. That's what made him famous and my help, you know, helping get him out there in front of thousands of people that would never have had an opportunity to see him and telling people as I introduced him basin. Gentlemen, please welcome the funniest motherfucker that ever stepped foot on earth, joey diaz and I would bring on stage like that all the time. I tell everybody is funnier than me. He's the funniest guy ever. Doesn't mean I'm not funny. You know, it's just, it's not bad for things to be great other than you. It's good. There's this. You should be inspired. The greatest people want those people who are great alongside them to push us.

Speaker 1:          02:45:37       Although bird and magic were nemeses, you know, you talked to him now how thankful they were that they had each other on opposing teams. Oh, for sure. Which are all of these. All of these people you know, you need greatness around you. You need them. You need going to get to have yang. You need which one's good, which one's negative, and which ones pumping. This once again is passive. Gang is active, man. You need that yang to have. Again. You need both. Yeah, it makes yang. The university has, you know, the tide comes in and goes out. Bill o'reilly, you know, it's, it's, there's something.

Speaker 6:          02:46:10       don't talk to me about bill o'reilly is not the greatest fucking. Okay. Carrie, you can't. You can't explain it yet. She can't you fuck. It's called gravity. They figured out a long time ago. Shit you've ever seen. That thing that he did where he's talking about god talking about the tie goes in. The tide goes out. You can't explain it like, you know I'm going with god. It was the so disingenuous from a harvard graduate. He said, yeah, to

Speaker 7:          02:46:30       fucking have. I have my own bill riley's story. Please tell it to me. Well, 48 laws of power just come out in [inaudible] 98 and bill o'reilly decides to have me on the if o'reilly factor, which was big then, but not as big as it became later on. And so I'm like, this is like one of my first shows I've ever been on you. No, no, no, no. Nothing like this ever happened to me before. And basically you go to a studio in los angeles where he's in New York and you're in this room and there's nothing around you, and they put an earphone in your head and you're staring at a camera. You don't see anything. You just hear bill o'reilly's stupid fucking voice in your ear asking you questions. It's like you're on drugs and it's so disconcerting. It's like the guy who's trying to put you off your game before and you're already put off your game the moment you start.

Speaker 7:          02:47:21       Anyway, he interviews me and I prepared like shit for this interview because I knew the questions coming. It was all about monica lewinsky and clinton and the scandal and the 48 laws and I nailed it. And he said, oh, that was a great interview, robert. I'm going to have you on again. Okay, wow. And so I'm feeling pretty good about myself. So four weeks later I trudged back to that office and I sit in that same chair with the little earphone in my head and he proceeds to just rip me to shreds about what a. Well, essentially he hated the 48 laws of power, he liked the writing or whatever, but he was just using his game. He was completely, he was just using it as a way to attack clinton, which I wasn't wanting to do that. So anyway, sorry. He was just like totally messing with me and I was so expecting the opposite that I was like woo.

Speaker 7:          02:48:14       And then he goes, uh, and then he says, well, what about this law about use selective honesty? And I said, weLl, it's something that politicians and business people use all the time. Like lyndon johnson for instance. And then I was about to explain how lyndon johnson, he cuts me off. Yes, yes. The same man who said 58,000 men of our young men to death in Vietnam, let's break for a commercial. And that was the end of the interview. So he like made me look like a. I was supporting lyndon johnson, massacring 58,000 americans in Vietnam. He manipulated me and humiliated me and like, and um, the whole thing was he hates the 48 laws of power because it's all about manipulation and ugliness and he's the most fucking manipulative interview you could ever imagine. Look how he manipulated me, be completely set me up by making me

Speaker 6:          02:49:08       think this was going to be like a softball interview where we were just, you know, well, he's a hater. He just hated that someone else wrote something brilliant. That's all it is. That guys a fucking hater. He's, he's the ultimate hater. And it was a, it was a special type of looking glass that allowed people to see bill o'reilly for the fucking monster that he was. Yeah. And I find it just the book incredibly ridiculous that that guy got to interview a obama, you know, not that I think obama's particularly unique and special human being relatively to what his position is and what could have been done by a guy like that in that position. But I think that, you know, having an obama being interviewed by this fucking buffoon, I think obama has the most thankless job probably in the history of the world and maybe the most impossible job.

Speaker 6:          02:49:52       I don't think he's done the best that he could with it, but I don't think anybody can. I think you're set up. That's what I've come to. The more I think about being a president and more think about dealing with the house and dealing with congress and the senate and all the fucking laws and just just look at what's happened to his hair. The gray. Yeah. Well that happens all the and gray. But like in this course, it's like a year. It just suddenly turned gray. I don't think we can even imagine the kind of pressure that you'd have to be to be the leader or the supposedly commander in chief of the greatest superpower of the world has ever known, which wants to consume the earth. You know, this crazy super power that literally thrives on consuming the earth. I think we can gain so much from listening to eisenhower speech about the military industrial complex when he was leaving office, that intense speech warning the people about the military industrial complex and the dangers of it and the influence of it.

Speaker 6:          02:50:44       I don't think we could even imagine what that is actually like when you're in office. I mean, I'd like to think that obama, one day we'll write a book explaining everything and we'll be like, oh, I get it because I don't get it. I don't get how he could have made the decisions that he's made based on what he said before he got into office, unless he's totally full of shit, which I'd like to think that he's not that set him getting interviewed by a fucking buffoon like bill riley. It's just like it's watching that and just that he's one of the most popular people, but it's so silly. It's so silly that he's one of the most popular people on television. It's so fucking silly. It's just, it's just you'll get no argument from me. Well, it's, it's unnecessary and I think I personally believe that that style of television is like fucking silent films where you debate a very important issue on a split screen for six minutes and you know, people yell over yell, yeah, well bill, that's not the case. And rambam fracking doesn't produce any negative results. We'll be right back. No, we won't be right back. This is not the way to talk. This is not the way to address complex issues. It's just not the way to have interesting discussions. Did you ever see John Stewart on the firing line years ago? We almost five minutes. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:52:02       I was supposeD to pimp something that I forgot to. What he supposed to been, um, some special offers for getting the book mastery. Yeah, that's right. Didn't somebody emailing that or something like that? Is it too late to do now? No, not at all. Now we've probably lost everybody by now. Everybody's still here. If people still about still in, you'd be amazed. These people sticking into the end, most of the people listening to this or commuting or they're on the treadmill or on a plane or something like that, but a huge majority of them are, are hanging out to the very end. You'd be completely and it's like archived. And they listen. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. For this will reach fucking probably close to them, but we have all sorts of offers for the book and for special bonus things that I used to give away when the book first came out and you need to go to power seduction and wore the and is spelled out power reduction in war.com/joe.

Speaker 6:          02:52:58       Yes, I got it right here. Um, I'll put this up on twitter right now. A copy link address and what is the special offer that people get? Um, there's some things that are not included in the actual book itself. So the full intervieWs that I had with some of the contemporary masters like freddie roach, uh, some material that never got included in the book for reasons that don't have anything to do with the quality of it. um, and then this kind of essay that I wrote about the writing of the book itself and things that I explained today about my deadline and how would you explain it? a tweet to give it to people. Like, I'm writing a tweet right now. How would you explain it? Explain what, explain what this offer is. What is like free. You're getting free bonus material that's not in the book itself.

Speaker 2:          02:53:48       Okay. He really gives insight into some of robert's process because I've looked at some of these, gives insight into his process, how he did this plus bonus content and stories that almost didn't make the cut. Kind of like the director's cut. Thank you. It just got out to one point, two, 8 million people. For those of you thinking about more than five, for those of you thinking about reading mastery, I've read it and it's been an invaluable tool along with the rest of your books. I'm really, you know, you allow people to get the best out of themselves and that's something that I'm incredibly passionate about and I think these are incredible tools to have and you decide what to do with these tools. You're a unique individual, but there's no doubt that knowledge is power in itself and you can use that. Power for however, however means you want to do it. It's up to you, but the books have knowledge and when you consume those books, that knowledge will translate into your own personal power cliches.
