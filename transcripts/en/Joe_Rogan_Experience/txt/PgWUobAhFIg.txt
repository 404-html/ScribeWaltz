Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches, uncomfortable for short bursts, don't eat so much

Speaker 2:          00:06          exercises. So everything you just said, you know, there was a really interesting study that just came out, um, a couple of weeks ago where they looked at the rates of aging in young adults. So they looked at different time points. So they look at, they took the, there was a whole, I think it was like over a thousand people and the study started when they were like 26 years old and they measured like 18 different biomarkers of aging. So they looked at like DNA health. They looked at telomere length. So tila mirrors are those caps on the end of your chromosomes that protected damage. There are markers for aging. They looked at hdl cholesterol, they looked at c reactive protein, which is a inflammatory mediator. They looked at 18 different things and they looked at these people that were 26 years old and then it did it again when they were 32.

Speaker 2:          00:53          And then they did it again when there were 38. And what they found was that even though these people were all the same chronological age, their cells looked very, very, very different people age at different rates. Some people, if you looked on the cellular level, they look 10 years older and some people look 10 years younger than their chronological age. And I was looking at some of these graphs of people and you can see some people started out like they started out bad where they looked old and then they started getting better. You know, they probably started changing their diet, their lifestyle. Other people started going worse. Some people stayed the same, you know. So there are lots of different, very variables going on here. But I think what's really interesting. Oh, and by the way, that their physical appearance also correlated with not their chronological age, but their biological age, what is, what it's called.

Speaker 2:          01:40          So if the, if they showed their picture to people, random people and said, guess what age they are, they would guess their biological age, not their chronological age. So if a person was 38 but they look 28, the person would say, Oh, they're probably 28 and if the person was 38 but they looked 48, they just looked worn and you know, rough. Then the person would guess that they were much, much older than they were. So there was a correlation between physical appearance and the biological age. And this is. I found this really, really interesting because I think it is strong evidence for the fact that your diet and your lifestyle play a major role in the way you age.

Speaker 1:          02:18          You know, I, if I was in the movie world, I would call somebody, but Melissa Mccarthy will be the whale. Oh, how dare you. And she's the funniest woman around a. she's very funny. She's very physically funny for sure. She's a very talented. Yeah. It's funny because Billy Gardell is a funny comic. You know billy, right? Yeah. They don't like on the show. He's like, almost like a straight guy. Of course wouldn't want the husband get one over on the wife. What'd you joe? They don't allow that. Nicholas, why is that? What's on? What's up with that fuck has jerk offs run Hollywood? Is that what it is? It is what people want to see. The people want to see that. I don't want to see that you don't fucking. Holly has been hijacked by fucking feminist. Wow. Am I wrong? If you guys can't relate that I'm fucking leaving.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Do you ever noticed a pattern of emasculation and movies and in fact the last 20 years, I think there's people that are seriously concerned with coming off as progressive and even if they think differently than what would be the progressive choice, they will make the progressive choice because they get like social brownie points. Uh, definitely think that's true. But I don't think that pertains to sitcoms. I think like, it's not as funny if the dude gets over on the CIC for someone to come on. This is a story. I might have told you this on the last time I was here. I had a deal with a, this was years ago at Dennis Larry's company. And we come out here and take a bunch of meetings and I felt like they had a sitcom idea. And at first of all, every meeting, 75 percent of the room was female executives.

Speaker 1:          03:48          And of course the first question and every meeting was, what's the wife's role? Every fucking one. So by the time we got to NBC, which was the last one and I had fucking had it. And they're like, so what's the wedge I go. And again I was just kidding. But I go, uh, I don't know. I see like in the pilot she's pregnant and I push it down in the cellar stairs and I'm expecting like Dennis to start laughing and in Serpico Jimmy Syrup because. And they all just look at me. You could have fucking her and append. So the next day, next day, Jimmy Circle, we had to send a dozen roses to the lady from NBC. You wonder why I can't get a Gig. Thank God you throw me a news radio and a few grace under fire.
