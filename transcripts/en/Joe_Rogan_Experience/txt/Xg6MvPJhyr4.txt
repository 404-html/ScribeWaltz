Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Dream in here. We've got 6,000 people on this motherfucker. 30003000700 for really? That's what I'm saying. It takes a little while. Hey, and we're lively's gentlemen, we're live and we're live. This is the first time we've ever been live while also being live on instagram live. I don't ever use this shit. Do you ever use this? I have. I was for awhile and it was cool, but it's one, it's one way to get a lot of new followers because if you go to top live, which I'm sure you are, so who's ever live, it'll have top live with the most people who are tuning in and so that's where you are right now. And so people who don't follow you, we'll, we'll see you on top live. We have 760077007800 it's getting dark and crazy in here. Cameron hanes fresh back from Australian outback where he's out there wrestling crowd it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       See those reflexes. Photo is good and he moves the table. Didn't even come close. That's a years of Jujitsu, years of trying to keep people from choking me, my instincts. I'll do a little too jumpy. That's the problem. Right? Too much quick movement. There's got to calm that shit down. So the bonding, oh, right. Well, and he's the opposite. He needed the opposite and steady baby bow hunting is pretty much the opposite way of thinking than Jujitsu. Cause Jujitsu, you gotta fucking, you gotta keep you gotta constantly. You've got to constantly be protecting yourself and move in and trying to close the deal. Bowhunting is like steady. Yeah. Dude, you're out there wrestling wallabies I heard. Yeah, something like that. Jamie's ready to go. Jamie's he was saying that and he was like, I want to wrestle a fucking wall would be, I don't think you'll will be up.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       We saw a dead one and it has caused about that long. Do they're real. Yeah, I mean, so you can imagine and their legs are just obviously balancing all the time, their legs. It just got to be jacked into those big claws. I mean what I would try to relate it to is, have you ever tried to hold down a cat, a house cat that doesn't want to be half a man. Right. So they have little tiny claws match. Have a wall would be with those jack legs and big claws could do. Plus it's wild. Wouldn't be good. I just have a wild cat. I had a feral cat. Is that window? Wow. Your cute little fellow. Yeah. No. Whoa. That's not real. Is that real? That's really his teeth. Yeah. Jesus Christ. I'll look at the clause on those things. If I don't know if it'll show cause ever.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       I can't believe they have teeth like that. See those front? Because what the hell is the wall beat? I figured while B it was like eating nuts and shitty. No, I think they're murderers. Babies, so it looks like a little kangaroo. Yeah. Oh, they have a kangaroo tail and the whole deal. They're just, they're very similar to Kangaroos. It was not a real teeth though. That wasn't photoshopped. Google. Well, Google wallabies teeth because I just have a feeling that was bullshit. I just looked like a vampire there. I feel like they're like the ugly stepchild of Kangaroos because they're kind of more hunched over. I'm like, damn, we're losing viewers. What? Crazy. We're top live

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       though. We're losing viewers like crazy. We're down to 5,000, 900. We're dropping. Maybe I'll turn it towards me. Maybe that's a problem. Probably when it's turned towards Cam. Oh, jumping back up. So now we're up to 6,500. It is, it is your page. That's after I, that can't be real. That's the one we're looking at right now is like a vampire. Be Deer. I've seen those things before. Those vampire deer. That's a real thing. Right? But those deer with those crazy things. I think so. Yeah. It's real. But like, why do they have things like that? Like why does they're not predators. Very strange. Did you see that? Uh, they found for the first time ever a deer eating a human carcass at deer. Yeah. The scientist. See if you pull that story up, it was yesterday. All alright folks is very distracting. Uh, go to, uh, Joe rogan.live.

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       And you could see this whole thing. I would read this, but here's the thing about getting older folks. Your fucking eyes start to go, cameron hanes eyes are still excellent though. I gotta tell you this motherfucker, you know, Shit. He can see anything. Conspiracy theory. We're the same age. We're the same age and his eyes, I don't know why my sock, but um, it's just the way it goes, but my dick is getting bigger. I don't know what's going on with that either. No. Imagine tit for tat. People would trade in glasses for bigger deck for sure. Um, show feet. What is that? People are so weird. Some of the people put, they put weird comments just to get you to read them. And he got me, he got me this. Fuck. All right folks. I'm going to shut this off and we're going to, uh, just have a podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       Joe rogan.live. You can watch for streaming on youtube until we make this big deal with twitch. So yeah, Bam. And live video. Do I save it done? Nope. Didn't save it. Fuck it. You can save them as a little thing up in the upper right hand corner. But I didn't, I saw it right. I was, I was pressing and mid press sounding like what's the big deal? You know? Dunno. I Dunno dude. I'm so never before seen deer spotted eating human bones. Makes sense though. Like they would just think it's like calcium. Same. Yeah. They don't know it's a bone. It's not like they like fuck these people. So he's like finally deers Eaton beeble now. But we've showed videos before, um, of deer eating birds. Like, cause they eat birds all the time. Oh they do? Yeah. Yeah. Like literally actively going after birds.

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       Like the fallen out of nests dear. It's like following it and the birds trying to chase the deer off and there's like, yeah, whatever. I'm eating that bird. Look at this. So this bar, this deer is the other birds. They're like, get out of there, get out of it. It's a button buck. He's got these little tiny nubs and he's trying to get this ground nesting bird. He's going to go through the past, that tree and then the guy filming it. See? See the bird hopping around on the ground. So it's a bird that fell out of a nest. Oh, they don't have like the eat that? Oh yeah. 100%. Yeah. It's kind of, well he's, he's chasing it. I mean, he's going after a purpose. What a Predator is. Look at the speed, the speed that deer shows. But it just shows you how opportunistic live animals are.

Speaker 2:          00:06:13       Wild animals. Like some, something in that deer's body tells it to eat that thing. Hey, there's no compassion out there for animals. No watch animal. An animal. He's eating it. Oh, it's dark. Yeah. That's what he goes. Yeah. Life. It's life. It's just weird to see a deer for some reason. Eat a bird and do it on purpose. Like he's all excited. It's like, Oh yeah, this is great. He's good. There is a, um, some sort of wildlife thing. Uh, they, they were doing some sort of a survey and the captured these birds with a net. They had this net set up, uh, in this area where these birds fly just so they could capture these particular birds. But the deer kept eating the birds and they, they couldn't figure it out. They're like, what is going on here? And then they watched, they had a video of these deer walking up and picking them off the net and eating these birds while the birds like Jay's house.

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       I can't believe this is happening. Getting eaten by a deer. Yeah. You don't see that every day? No. That I'm not surprised. Yeah. I'm not surprised either. I've seen cows do it too. This video is a cows doing it. For the longest time, people didn't think that they thought that, you know, those are just herbivores. But no, they just, nature's just set them up to be super slow. But if something really delicious is in front of them, I thought it was an Eddie Bravo thing. Oh, this conspiracy. Yeah. He came up with it. No, it's not an Eddie Bravo conspiracy. Eddie Brow believes a lot of conspiracies, but he doesn't believe that. What does this one, oh, what does that an Eagle Jack and a bunny rabbit. That's a deer. Deer and eagles are so ruthless. Oh look at that. Bam. We can do this all day folks. You got back from the real wild man like when you were the instagram stories.

Speaker 2:          00:07:54       So Cameron Hanes and our buddy Adam Green tree and a few other fellows were up there in the north country of Australia and you guys took over the under armour hunt page and uh, it was epic man that the underarmour hunt page. Like the little instagram stories. Yeah. I don't like instagram stories. You know why? Cause they're only 15 seconds and the old teases. I want you guys to be like live streaming from up there. Yeah, it would be nice. Wouldn't it put up a super cool are you guys were at it was terrifying. Yeah. Kept showing these brown snakes these. Yeah. The second most deadly snake in the world. Yeah, that's what I'm told. Yeah. You sound like how many of them? Uh, four or five. Yeah, but it only takes one. Yeah. And you're dead, right? Like, I'd already watched dead. Well, second most deadly. Yes. Doesn't sound good. That's not good. No, no. And then there's, you know, big old spiders and crocodiles. Yeah. You guys saw crocodiles. Yeah. You even filmed crocodiles. They were right where we were, you know, super. It was,

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       I mean, this is still not even their summer, but it's still very warm. I mean, where we were up, uh, hunting buffalo at the top man is what they call, which is out of Darwin. It was 90 to a hundred degrees. So there's some film of a, now this is a freshwater crocodile, which is not as big, not as big or as aggressive as a saltwater Croc, but could still definitely do damage. And this was, you know, a mere feet from where we were sleeping. And this is the, where we'd go and take baths and uh, or just kind of cooled down during the heat of the day. That's where he was right there. And how big is that guy? Oh, I dunno. Six, eight, seven, eight feet, something like that. You know, he wasn't huge, but he definitely do some damage and get a hold of Ya.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       Did you guys see any of the salt water once while you're there? No. No. So when you were telling me about this a one pond that was near you guys, where you saw eyes at night and you didn't think of that was, that was, it was right there. So the, the first night we saw the one, just that one right there, we went over there and videoed him and, and checked him out. And then the next night Adam went down there to the creek and it was only about maybe 15, 20 feet across, just small, just very shallow. And uh, he looked down and said there was like six sets of eyes, red eyes, which is crocodile. So, and that was, you know, they'd moved in. So have you ever seen a live salt water one in the wild?

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       Um, I think we did the last time I hunted there, but I'm trying to remember. Or maybe it was, I think when we were flying. Yeah. When, when we were flying, we saw him. Oh, we've, cause so you have to take a flight from where Adam lives. Adam lives near Melbourne, right? Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales. You fly four and a half hours to Darwin toward these water buffalo are. Yep. And then w w last time we used a helicopter to get out of Darwin to, and that was four hours in the helicopter. Whoa. And so this time we had a helicopter and so we flew the country, kind of look at it and we saw some pretty big crocs from there on the river system. So how do you know like, where to stop? Like when your buffalo hunting, how do you know where to go? Um, well I mean basically it's however far you can walk, you know, I mean you kind of get, we were walking, I dunno, I want to say at least 10 miles a day. 10 10 to I think Adam and his guys. One time his camera guy walked 18 miles one day. So we were just, you know, we're always, you know, 10, 12, 13 miles a day. So just covering country.

Speaker 1:          00:11:41       It was, it was hard hunting up there right now because this is their wet season or the tail end of their wet season. And so the foliage was, was really grown up really thick. So it was very hard to see the buffalo normally, um, later when we went,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       Eh, it's all burnt up because of summer and said there's no foliage. And, uh, you can see the buffalo from miles basically. But with this grass, the grass is in some places, eight, eight feet tall. I mean, you'd have to be 50 yards away to see a buffalo and they're, you know, 1800, 1800 to 2000 pounds. So it's, it's makes it hard to find them. And then it also makes it dangerous to trail them, you know, if your blood trailing him or if you're, even if you just surprise one, um, you know, you, you surprise an animal that close a wild animal like that, and who knows how they're gonna react. Yeah. That's a huge animal. Yeah. And, and with that grass, it just, you know, as you know, Adam and I did a and the camera guys, we did a podcast up there and we were kind of talking about the challenges of the hunt and uh, that was a big part of it is um, just not being able to see very much country.

Speaker 3:          00:12:47       And so people never hunt buffalo this time of year. This is like, people say, why would you go, you're not gonna, you know, nobody goes this time and we just want to do, they go, they go later in the year, you know, when the, when there's not so much foliage. So they go like in their fall there. Yeah. It would be, you know what, last time I went is December, which is just before the West season starts. This is the tail end of the wet season right now. So we were thinking about when we want to take you up, there would be around November, October, November. Cause you don't want to get stuck in with the wet season, hit big rains. But uh, you, you want it. And, and also it makes it easier to find the animals because there's not water everywhere right now. There's water everywhere so they don't have to be concentrated to get water. But later in the year, all those lot of the water sources have dried up. So if you've got a good water hole, you know, every, every animal is coming there.

Speaker 2:          00:13:41       Well, so these are for people who don't know. Um, this is an invasive species of water buffalo and enormous Asian. And what is it called? It's just called Asian water buffalo. Like what is the actual name of it?

Speaker 3:          00:13:52       Thank it. Or yeah, there might be an ah Ha, I just call them Asian water buffaloes. That seems like there's a c in there somewhere. Asiatic or something. I Dunno. Maybe Jamie can look at Jamie. We'll look it up. But uh, it's uh, such a wild, cool looking animal. Yeah. Yeah. They're big. They're big in, uh, my bowl, um, it was a big old bowl on a, uh, we called him in using like a wounded calf call. Oh Wow. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:14:22       So this is, this is what it looks like. It's a female, obviously stepped in Asian water buffalo and yeah, that's it. That's what it looks like. Yeah. Um, go to Cam's a instagram page and there's a picture of the, there's is there. Yeah, there it is. Now that's Adams. Oh, that's how items, yeah. Then there's, yours is in the upper right hand corner, but you only see, right? Cisco the only see the skull. Yeah. And then that's a fucking head. People don't want to see that. What is he doing now, folks? That's how you make fine.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       There's only one way. There's another picture of it, I think when it's coming in and when he's coming in right there. Right above that, Jamie. Right. Uh, right now

Speaker 2:          00:15:00       the one with the far left. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right there. That's a him at full draw or would the that's looking through the riser of the bow.

Speaker 3:          00:15:07       Yeah. So that's that bowl coming in. Aggressive. He was, you can see his eyes. He was just pissed off and that's, he was coming, that's at under 20 yards and he's not stopping. And so I shot him there frontal through the chest and uh, had to, is uh, almost like self defense.

Speaker 2:          00:15:26       Wow. So these are animals that if hunters don't go up there and kill them, they actually hire people to go up there and killed him right there.

Speaker 3:          00:15:34       Yeah. They, I mean these things have, has spread disease up there. I mean they're, uh, a non native species and they, any water source up there is ruined any natural habitat has been ruined because there's so many buffalo. So they just want him killed basically. They're like, um, it'd be like similar to coyotes here, you know, kind of 2000 pounds or yeah. Yeah. Predators either. No, there's nothing else to kill him. And, and maybe a CROC could kill a small one. Right. But, uh, they just need, you know, in Coyote's down here in North America, don't ruin water sources and ruin habitat like these things do these things that are just wrecking machines and there's, there's hundreds of thousands of them up there.

Speaker 2:          00:16:15       So they ruined Walsh water sources for the native animals as well. I call the free things. Anything. Yeah. Cause they shit and Piss in the water. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's an, Australia is so strange and a as is New Zealand in that all these people imported animals, they're in the 18 hundreds and a, I guess even before was it, when did they establish Australia and New Zealand? I'm not sure. I forget when they these to see if you could find out when they established, we talked about this recently with Josh Zaps, didn't we? But they um, they brought in all these animals with no game plan. They just let them loose and then they let the crowd, Jesus. So in New Zealand they have these beautiful stags, these incredible animals and at some places they have to shoot them at of helicopters just to control the population, which we're it for people in America, it's like unheard of. Like how could you do that? Like that's that's, that's like an elk, like a majestic animal. You're going to shoot him out of helicopters to just leave them there to die.

Speaker 3:          00:17:11       It's way different. It's a, you know, up there, there's just not enough hunters because in all of Australia they say there's as many people as there are in la, the La area here in the whole country,

Speaker 2:          00:17:23       Saint New Zealand says it was a, okay. The first European explored a sight New Zealand was able, Jan's Zune, what name Jan Zune Tasmin on the 13th of December in 1642 but that's obviously just a European people been there for a long fucking time. Oh yeah. And Australia was 1788 and shortly thereafter then they bringing in all these

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       animals and the idea was that they were going to make it like a European hunting destination. Right. For, for rich, the rich, uh, w what Douche bags. So they released all these animals but with no predators. Yeah. And so people were going to come over from Europe and they were going to go to Australia and hot the rich people. And so I think that, and they told me that seems like it was in 1985 they're going to wipe out all the buffalo and they had some money funded for it and they were going to try to get rid of them and they got halfway through and quit. They killed like half of them. Something like that. Yeah. Wow. And then they quit. And so now it was just as I was saying, the whole country is about the size of the United States. You were telling me this, but I did know that the whole country has the same amount of people's live in la here.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       So there's just not that many hunters. You know, a small percentage of them are hunters. So there's nobody to control all these number of non native species. And that's from a water buffalo to the fallow deer that I was hunting to stagger. There's not as many stags is fallow deer, but um, all these species just, there's no measure for control really. Yeah. And they brought in a bunch of other non native species to, it's a, it's an exercise in conservation gone totally wrong because they brought in Katz to take care of certain animals and they brought in Fox and then the Fox and the cats are out of control and they kill all the ground nesting birds. And now it's Kinda fucked up to us here in America. But people in Australia hunt cats, they, them the way in the hold 'em up. Like, look, I got one and yeah, it's a cat.

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       Yeah, it's weird. It's like, that's fluffy with the fuck. Yeah, no, I, we saw a guy and uh, he had a rifle and he's walking on the road. They're just to, uh, he lives there, you know, I mean, that's, his home has lived here his whole life, I think. And he was walking on the, on the road. I went down there, I had my bowel and I, you know, I said, hey, what are you after? And he's like, aw, man, after, uh, a big black cat. And I'm like, uh, like, uh, just a regular cat. He's like, yeah. I said like, just a feral, you know, wild cat. He's like, yeah, it's a black one though. He goes, so there's a $10 bounty on it that the property owners around their head, if he'd make kill this black cat is 10 bucks, but they don't think anything about it because there's just wild cats everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       How weird is that? Yeah. It is bounty on a kitty cat. Well, people, um, that have researched it in America, just in North America, a cats kill somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 billion birds a year. Yeah. Billion. Yeah. That when they found that out, like apparently like scientists were shocked. The biologists were shocked is between 1.5 and three point something billion. And that's not even counting like mice and rabbits. All the other shit. They killed squirrels. I'll never forget, I had a cap. They used to. Um, I used to live across street from this park and uh, I had this one male cat and he was just a murderer. And uh, I'll never forget watching him walk across this a park with a squirrel between his legs. So he was biting down the squirrels neck, the squirrels dead, and the squirrel was his size practically, and it was in between his leg.

Speaker 1:          00:21:14       So He's straddling it and walking with it, dragging it along so you could show it to me. Oh, he was super psyched. That was awesome. He was like, Dude, look what I got. That's probably a large percentage of his weight right there. He was. It was probably no bullshit. At least three quarters the size of him. Yes. It wasn't a big cat and it was a fat fucking squirrel. Yeah. That, that probably would've been a nice battle. It's just weird. The adverse squirrel cats are the weirdest animals man, because they're cool with us, but they're straight killers. I know. But the only story I remember about a cat, I can't remember where I heard it or who told me, but that, oh, maybe it was one of my cop friends. But anyway, if, uh, if, uh, like an old say it's an elderly person that has a dog, they die.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       The dog is that people come and find the body that, and the dog's laying there with them. You know, just like a loyal whatever. And uh, if a cat, if they have a cat and they die, the cat eats our eyelids and, and lips. Yeah. Right away. If you stop feeding that cat, the cat's like, look, I'm eating it looked like knits owner. Yup. Yeah, yeah. So that's really all you need to know about a cat. They eat each other too. Um, like crazy old people. Uh, there's this one lady who was a hoarder and she had a bunch of dead cats. She had so many cats in our house and the cats had died and so she wasn't feeding the cats. The cats were eating the dead cat and Whoa. Yeah, it's hard out there. It's hard out there. Cameron Hanes, imagine be a cat living with a hoarder.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       He liked his pitch. Doesn't even let me go out, let me out of it. Kill some birds. Oh yeah. That animals just want to be out and live this. That's what we need to, we need to be out in live. I mean that, that two and a half weeks I was in Australia. That was, man, I took two showers a whole time. They'd be asleep bag and it must smell good. What a hey, that's just how it goes. That's what people are supposed to smell. I couldn't even tell. We're just used to it. Yeah. So, and I've just, for the viewers, I'm a clean pr. I'd take a couple of hours a day. But you know when you're hunting that's just the way it goes. But yeah, we'll you wearing wool? No I was no, he's warm. Oh right. But like a thin layer merino actually keeps it cool cause you sweating it and he regularly teat really well, yeah it was, you know where we are hunting deer in New South Wales, which is outside of Sydney. It was actually cold at night. I mean you guys are walking on like frozen glass. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is covered with Frost. But I mean it was night. It was freezing, you know, I mean it was like 32

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       degrees. So we were used to, we thought we were going to be hunting and 90 to a hundred degree weather. So, yeah, I didn't, you know, when you're laying in a sleeping bag that's only rated to 40 degrees in his 32 and sleeping on the ground, it's rough. It's rough. As you're saying that those deer were like super turned on to where like there were tuned in, like they were very skinny edge. They've been hunted and uh, you know, they don't have lions like we have here, which keeps the deer on edge, you know, cause we have lions are just killers, but uh, um, they don't have a Predator like that, but man, it's an antelope specie and or it's a, they can see so well and so fast reacting. It's just amazing. What are they, this is a fallow deer, right? Yeah. And what do they relate it to?

Speaker 3:          00:24:36       Um, for, I just said it right there. You said an antelope, but I'm not sure if once I said it I'm like, are they so don't, don't quote me on that. We might have to look that one up too. But all I know is the reason why I said that is because they can see, I mean antelope and a torres for having amazing vision, you know, 10 times what, what humans have apparently. And that's how these were, I mean, I don't know if the deer antelope or whatever, but they can see extremely well. So they were seeing you from like a long ways out. Oh you couldn't, I mean there was this one buck out of stock and I had a cameraman with me and that the key for stalking animals is always staying in the shade. If, if you stay in the shade and you got Cammo on, especially if they're in the sun, you know how it is looking, looking into, if you're in the sun, he tried to look into a house you can't see.

Speaker 3:          00:25:26       Right. So it's the same thing with shadow. So you always have mitch out of the, well, we were 330 yards away from this buck. I was stocking, he was feeding in this creek and we had this small patch of sunlight to cross 330 yards away. It's a long way away. And I told the camera, man, I'm like, we just got to get across here. Just stay low and get, you know, hustle through there. So we hunched over and got in seconds. We were through there, got to the shade, looked over at the buck. He standing there staring. I'm like, are you kidding me? How He's already, so we're in the shade. So then for sure we weren't moving. I'm like, don't move. And he's just staring, staring, staring and staring. And I'm like, don't move. He's like, I'm not, I go, don't move. He's, he's on.

Speaker 3:          00:26:13       He's just looking. Anything is going to spook them. He's like, I'm not moving. And he was crouched down on his knees. And so finally the buck like took a few, uh, um, bites or grass and I'm like, okay, he's feeding. Next thing gone. So all he did is took a couple bites of grass for the road. He's like, no, I already know about a year, but I'm taking this with me. And he was gone. That was it. Yeah, they're smart. That's long rifle range. We had bows. It's just a barely this. So, and we have to get close with a bow. And so you can imagine it just if that, that one example tells you what it was like basically.

Speaker 4:          00:26:53       So we were talking about um, different, both setups, like you had brought to both setups. He brought one for deer and you bought one for Buffalo. So for people that don't understand, there's two different ways that you were going to approach this. The buffalo is a giant heavy boned animals. He had a real heavy Arrow, which is going to go slower and those hours are just too slow for those deer. And the deer would actually move out of the way before the Arab.

Speaker 3:          00:27:20       Yeah. Yeah. Like Matrix, it, it Wa it was, you know, the, the thing with penetration with an Arrow is weight. The way to the Arrow equates to more penetration with heavy bone. And you know that we talked about the buffalo 1800 to 2000 pounds. So you need something that hits hard. Well, when you have a heavier Arrow, it's gonna fly slower. So those were flying at 245 feet a second out of my high poundage. Bo and I thought, well, good enough. I mean, I didn't, these will be all right. And I was shooting it so well. I'm so accurate, you know, practicing not to 90 yards all the time. She didn't really well. So I thought, you know what? I know it's supposed to be for Buffalo, I'm just going to use it for deer. So the first week there I tried it for deer and it was just like these deer were seemingly 10 yards away, but having the Arrow got two minutes.

Speaker 3:          00:28:11       I'm not talking a long shots. And I'm like, okay, maybe it was just a fluke, just a flu. They would see it, hear it, they would hear it and they would duck out of the way or just be gone. I mean, just like be 10 yards away. So they would move out of the way before the area got to them. Yeah. Yeah. And uh, so the finally I thought, well maybe it's just in a super calm. They're so, so quiet. You know, I don't know my bose or quiet a heavy arrow. It makes a bow even quieter, you know, it absorbs that sound. And the energy. So your limbs aren't just like that. There is more of like an, but it still makes an always on a super calm windless day, especially when it's cold, you know? I mean it's just that sound's going to get across her.

Speaker 3:          00:28:54       So I thought, well maybe it's just a fluke. Maybe the deer were pick something up, pickup some movement. So they were just on me and is whatever. And I'm not worried about it, you know, I'm not used to missing, I'm used to be very disciplined on my shots and taking high percentage shots that relaxed animals. If I do do my stock right, my, my goal is always to shoot an animal that has no idea on there, you know, so it's relaxed. And uh, so that wasn't happening here and I thought, well maybe, maybe it's just because they're high, strong and, and they were on me. So what would the, the, the time where I decided, okay, these arrows aren't going to work, was a wild boar. Was out there, big boar, 45 yards. Okay, this should be

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       slam dunk money. And I co camera over my shoulder. He had no idea. We were there. Drawback, shoot. And he had, he was facing, uh, his head to the left and he was heading back to the right probably a few feet away by the time the Arrow got there. Well, I didn't even have to even, I like shot and went, Oh man, are you kidding me? Is that gone? That fast spun and just gone. And so then at that time I, Mike, okay, these, this is not going to work. It's so crazy because although there's no predators, they're the hunters that are there are out there all the time. They don't have a season. No, there's no season sees. Animals are just tuned in there hunting every day. Wow. Yeah. And so it mostly rifle. So I mean, they're used to, if they see somebody that's like a danger because they've been shot at from, you know, hundreds of yards.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       So it's just, yeah, it was, it was challenging. Um, but, so I, I changed from those, uh, 245 grain arrows and I thought, well, I need to shoot my, uh, or not 245, 245 feet per second. That's 687 green arrow to a lighter arrow. And I thought, well maybe this will do it. And uh, you know, is it shooting 300 feet per second? At that time did you change products? Yup. Did you go to the tow car? No. You step with the solids? No, I shot a with above flow. And actually, you know, it's funny actually what I ended up killing the deer with two was uh, um, what were the magnus stingers and I also the, but they expand. I had that expandable head. Do you remember that one that I used on the bear? It was a grave digger grave digger. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       That'll ruthless name that head and that, that had flies so good. Oh, is money. So use that as well. Yep. So when you're out there man, like, so you're around Sydney, which is where people are. There's, there's those animals are hunted pretty, pretty regularly, but then you're taking that flight for four and a half hours and then a helicopter. And when you're in the area where the buffalo are, there's nobody out there. No, it's remote. That is a wild, wild place. When you think about the, the size of Australia, the size of North America with the same amount of people as Los Angeles, but the area where you're at, it's like that is as wild as it gets. Yeah. I mean w w you fly those four and a half hour from Sydney to Darwin and most of that there you're looking down at country with nothing. Nothing, no roads, no nothing. And, and that's, that's a large majority of Australia is like that and it's just overrun with Buffalo. Yeah. A lot of it is. Yep. And uh, what's crazy punch. Yeah. And that we did find some, uh, you know, some drawings up there too. Um, from the, from, yeah. I mean

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       all the natives. Yeah. Yeah. For the aborigines. And did you, did you know that those were there before you went there to doubt them? Know that there were the pilot, the pilot? No. Yeah. So we wanted to go see him. Oh Wow. So are they in a cave like where they're on? Um, the, for the, whether or not to get to them, it has to be on like the underside of a rock where we went and we filmed under there. It was like, you could imagine people getting out of the rain there and they're huge boulders and they're getting, and it was just a perfect spot to stay dry. And so that's, if the rain was, if they drew on a part of the rock where the rain was hitting, obviously it was gone. But in these, these areas, they were protected. So drawings were still there.

Speaker 2:          00:33:22       Last Time Adam was here, he talked about, um, some of the aborigines there and explain some stuff. But when we went back to my house, we, uh, we had dinner and we sat around talking and he told me some crazy stories about the horrors if those people face and how they had been wiped out. Like they had been poisoned. Like he went to this one cave and he found bones all through this cave. He's like, this is crazy. There's like human bones and he's like children's bones. You'd find children's bones. And then he had heard this story from one of the other aborigines that live there, that someone had brought food to all these people, all the aborigines there and just poisoned the food and just killed them all off. Yeah. It's, it's fucking dark. Yeah. It's dark. No, I dunno. So they don't know. They don't know who made those hieroglyphs are there or the cave drawings or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:34:13       They weren't. Or when they did it either. Now, now they say, uh, I put it up on my instagram page and I saw some comments there. And they're saying that the more brightly colored, the older they are. Huh. But I don't know. I think, I think the pilot mentioned 10,000 years old. Maybe. I was just guessing the Flexi. No, I have no idea. I think you just threw that out there. How would you know? I mean it's just something, I'm sure somebody knows. I mean, right. That studies that, I'm sure this is probably a few people. It seems like when you think about the actual numbers of how much land you're talking about, how few people live out there and how many of those things are probably there. And also one of the things that Adam was telling me that's crazy as you could have, the way, um, they refer to themselves, uh, like a aborigines.

Speaker 2:          00:35:02       They call themselves a mob like, and no, instead of a tribe, it's a mob and they're like, there could be one mob. And he said there could be a mob. He goes full kilometers away and they speak a totally different language. Oh, right. Yeah. Like what I go, how many languages are there? He goes, oh, hundreds what? Yeah, hundreds. I go, so they can't talk to each other. He goes, nope. Yeah, no written language. Yeah. They, they have different expressions for things. Yeah. Yeah. I heard that too. That's crazy. I know what I mean. It's really, it's like a tribal society, right? I mean, that's just the way it goes. Well, it's, it is like a tribal society, but it's also like you're, you're, I mean, right now there's culture and there's a civilization that is linked to who knows how many hundreds, if not thousands of years ago, and it will go away because there won't be people that understand it. There's not, no, not someone who is studying it. Yeah. And there's so many different versions of the way they communicate that it's just like you're, you're literally watching history dissolve, right? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:36:02       In front of you. Yeah. Yeah. I know. It's a, it's a Ma, it was amazing to be in that country walking in hunting in the same that, that they have for, you know, however many years.

Speaker 2:          00:36:14       And what did they hunt back then? Because this is obviously before the buffalo came in, before they brought the fallow deer, I dunno. Just whatever wallabies or while he's a native thing. Kangaroos and she, yeah, yeah. Wow. Yeah. But it was, it was cool

Speaker 3:          00:36:28       being under that rock and, and envisioning them being there too. Yeah. You know, that long ago doing the same thing we were doing.

Speaker 2:          00:36:38       That's, that's a, that's a real mind blower man. It's just so fascinating thinking about that. That particular continent of Australia that no, Europe used it as a prison colony in England. Brought a bunch of people over there and go, look, you people are assholes. Stay here. Dell is on, there's an island off of Australia, right. That they used for that. Well they used Australia for that. I thought, Oh God, what was that island? I know we were doing an island as well that they still do. I think that's what they tell immigrants. Right? Yeah. And they have to live there for a certain amount of time before they can come over. Yeah. They have some weird immigration laws in Australia, Australia. Like if people that are complaining about trump wanting to build a wall, listen clearly island way worse and it's like a prison. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:37:24       If, if I understand it right, it's like a prison, then they have to stay there for, you know, like I said, a certain amount of time before they're a citizen. Yeah. See if you could find that Jimmy, Josh zips actually brought it up to us and he was explaining how brutal the immigration laws are over there. They don't want to anybody moving to Australia, they understand. They have a good thing going on. Yeah. I mean if you haven't been to Australia, it is lovely. People there are fantastic. They're super friendly. They're really nice. And again, there's not that many of them. It's expensive though. Yeah. Very. You know, I mean there was a, um, amen. He, I think his house was like a two bedroom house, four or $500,000. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It makes sense though. You got to bring shit over there, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:09       They were saying the guy, uh, when I was in Sydney, um, the guy who driving us, I was telling us how much cars costs over there. They cost so much more money, especially like people, like a classic American muscle cars. And the guy was talking about how much like a 1968 mustang was worth. And he's like, it's probably worth twice what it's worth in a merrily. Yeah, because they have to ship them over there. What they have over there, which is sweet, was a Toyota high lux diesel trucks. Those are pretty sweet. What is it? It's just a Toyota Tundra as it like a ton. Like a, it's like a, they call it a ute. That's a pickup. Oh, okay. Utility vehicle. I don't know. Yeah, I dunno. I'm just trying to use it. Learn the lingo. But a ute is a pickup and it was a Toyota high lux diesel.

Speaker 2:          00:38:56       And is this what Adam was driving around in? No, I can't remember what his is. I heard is right there, Huh? Yeah, that's a, okay, so it's like a flat bed. Yeah. Hmm. I'm not sure what happened. Maybe Adam has that. I can't remember now. One of the things that I thought was weird when I was there, it was how many people have snorkels on their trucks? Yeah. Yeah. That one right there that's driving through water. Well, it's not just water, it's also dust. Elderly chokes up your air filters. So I have those things way up high so that it a, when the engine's getting the air, like apparently it mitigates a lot of the dust cause a lot of the dust is like a headlight. Hi. Yeah. When you're driving and that gets you a little bit more clear air there. Well that's out of my wheelhouse.

Speaker 2:          00:39:39       I know bow hunt down and running. Well you knew the name of it. No, I just noticed because they're cool. Well whenever you go to like Africa, yeah. Whenever we go someplace that's fucking brutal. You see a lot of toyotas. Yeah. Toyota's know how to, they know how to make a car that lasts. Do they do that? They're not. I mean here it's just like, you know Ford, Chevy, you know. I Dunno cause we were like American stuff. I guess so, yeah. But still you still see a lot of like old land cruisers? Yeah. I mean how many Fj cruiser there where we were on in the outback driving around. Everybody has those. Yeah. Every person has a truck set up like that? Well I guess you have to. Yeah. If you realize after time, like this is the only thing that makes it, yeah, cause Adam was saying when he drives from Sydney to Darwin, he know we took a four and a half hour plane flight, but it's three days.

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       So he have to have, your rig has to be bulletproof basically. Yeah. They have an expression. You could take a range rover into the bush, but you need a land rover to get out of the bush. Is that right? Okay. Yeah. They just, those toyotas. It's just, it's kinda crazy how well they last and when you really think about like for the longest time America did a real shit job of making cars that last, there's was a period in American cars from like the 1970s till I think till probably like the late nineties a 2000 they finally got it right. And now we make very dependable cars as well. But for the longest time we were making dog shit. Well, I don't know about all that, but I do know we're going to go up and do that. Hunter, me, you and Adam and we're going to do a netflix special. They don't, Netflix has a plan. Netflix doesn't know this yet. Why? Why, why Netflix? What? What makes you a little, well, it's good move. It's a good move. I want to do something

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       on the Internet. Yeah. I want her to be like an hour long documentary style fam hunting film, giving back, you know, killing Buffalo, taking the meat back to the community. Does the natives. Yeah. Yeah. To aborigines. Yeah. That's what I envision. That sounds like a great idea. It could be, certainly it could be done on Netflix or it could be done and you can just put it online. Yeah, that, that could be just as, I mean Netflix is awesome for sure, but there's some people that don't have netflix. Everybody has an online connection. Yeah. My, my, my goal is to sort of use you cause people, because I wanna I wanna I want hunting to be shown and the light that I know it to be, which is hard work, respect for the country and the animals and giving back. So with you involved more people care about it.

Speaker 3:          00:42:26       Right. And we want to have you involved because we like hanging out with you and like, well I was explaining this to Adam to um, when we did my podcast up there in the bush is like, ever since I, I've hunted way back when Roy moved to Alaska and I was left hunting a wilderness on my own. I loved it so much. I kept wanting to find somebody who would love it as much as I, so I could say, look how awesome this is. Isn't this awesome? And I kept taking people there and try to convince them how awesome it was. It wasn't awesome for them. So it was like, but you want to share something that impacts you so much with other people who appreciate it. So that's why that's, that's what I was saying when Adam I were talking is that, you know, you love bow hunting and so that's when, when you are so interested in invested in something and have such a passion for something, there's nothing better when somebody's then when somebody else shares that passion. Right. Yeah. So that, that was, that was why there's a few different reasons why you were going to be involved. Thank you. I'm excited about that.

Speaker 4:          00:43:34       I also think the difficulty factor is what turns people off. I don't think they expect it to be so difficult. No, no, no. If you try to introduce bow hunting to people, first of all, just shooting a bow, people think, oh well we'll see you pull the string back. You pointed the spot, you'll let it go. Good luck with all that. It takes some fucking years. It takes years to get competent with a ball. And, uh, I remember when you first started showing me how to shoot when we first shot in my backyard. And I immediately recognized, I think like after, first of all you've got a 90 pound bow, which I definitely shouldn't have been pulling back. My shoulder was fucking killing me after the first hour. Like this takes, you got to build up to this God damn thing. But then I remember thinking like to be accurate with this, like I just went down a rabbit hole.

Speaker 4:          00:44:22       I'm like, I just took my first step down a crazy rabbit hole and who knows where it leads because this is not easy and I'm a, I have a very addictive yeah. And I need to figure out ways to channel that addiction in positive ways cause I can get lost doing things that are not good. So bow hunting and archery itself. To me it seemed like, okay, this is a discipline. It's a worthy pursuit. It's fascinating and I'm very, very interested in it. But for a lot of people I think it's very daunting. Like, oh, I don't think they realize it. People think of hunting is like elmer fudd. Like you know, you'd go out there or they see some hunting scene in a movie where there's a bunch of rednecks and they're fat and they're was sitting in a tree stand or something like that.

Speaker 4:          00:45:07       And they think it's easy and they think it's a bunch of people that are just killing animals and they don't care. And then when you actually go out and do it, especially if you go do it with a person like you, you understand what this thing really is. And what it really is, is this incredibly difficult pursuit that takes immense amounts of hard work and dedication and you gotta be in fucking shape for it. And this is something that people are starting to realize now, and I think you're a big part of this, and over the last few years and all the platforms that you've gone on to tell your story is that people understand that big game hunting in the West and the western style hunting elk and mule deer, the type of stuff that you love to do is very, very difficult. It is a combination of athletics, of extreme endurance, of hiking, outdoorsmen ship survival skills, and then the knowledge of hunting.

Speaker 4:          00:46:04       And then you have to be a good shot on top of all that. You have to know archery. Yeah. Then you have to be able to keep, you know, with that adrenaline hits all of a sudden. And that's what's hard is people have invested so much into it and they've been thinking about the, the Mo, the crunch time for so long that when it happens it's too much. Yeah. So it's really hard when you've been thinking about something for years potentially, or at least all year, you know that, oh, here's my chance, here's my chance. And then you get it and you're not ready yet because it's just too much to, it's so hard to stay calm. Well, it's also something that you need to do a bunch of times until you understand it. It's like, I try to explain it to people about, we were talking about fighting earlier.

Speaker 4:          00:46:47       We were talking about, um, when Pete, if someone has never fought before and never competed before, the, the scary thing is not really the, what's nerve racking is not the actual fighting itself. Once the fighting starts, you're actually kind of like just in the zone and you're just doing it. I mean, you might be intimidated, especially if you're fighting a guy like Mike Tyson or Anderson Silva or something like that. You're going to be shitting your pants. But the real terrifying stuff is the buildup, the lead up. And that's kind of the same thing with hunting. It's the moment before the shot. It's your adrenaline is pumping. It's like if you had a shoot an eight ball across the table, long shot and your life was on the line, it's almost like that. And you don't get any warm up shots. There's no warmup shots. Just all of a sudden, here's this one shot for all the marbles and you've got to stay calm. Okay. Oh, and the animals might be moving. Yeah. Like, Oh fuck no.

Speaker 3:          00:47:42       I was saying that on this last hunt. It was, you know, we had me, Adam and remy warrant and supposedly we're supposed to be pretty good hunter, the best of the best and we were struggling to get something killed. And I was just like imagine how frustrating this would be for somebody, a new hunter. I mean it's no wonder people try to bow hunt and then just be like, are you kidding me? This is impossible. And it's, but it's, it's that challenge. Anyway, it's that whole journey, which is why I want to do that special and I want, I want to share all of us positive about hunting it to as many people as you know. And we are reaching new people these days. You know what I mean? Hunting, it's, it's in the cross hairs in some aspects I guess. But we're also other people are getting, cause I get, I mean I went to an archery shop up there, Benson's archery in Sydney and we just had a few hours notice saying, Hey Adam, Adam and I are going to stop by swing by, and quite a few people came.

Speaker 3:          00:48:47       I mean, it was, it was surprising how many people showed up, but a lot of them were vegetarians, you know, six months ago, listen to your show. A lot of people told me, Oh, I found out about you from Joe Rogan or I didn't hunt. All right, I didn't even eat meat. And all these different stories, all these different from all these different areas. So we are reaching new people and I want to make sure our message, the one of, of, of respect and reverence and awe and appreciation for everything out there and for survival and for just, you know, outside of the life outside of the city, I want that shown in a way that I know we would. So that's why I'm selfishly want this to be a big thing, just because I'm sick of hunting, you know, the elmer fudd thing or um, you know, I see.

Speaker 3:          00:49:37       I was watching a movie the other day and they showed a hunter and it was like the girl was on there and she was, oh, what was that? There's three girls that were kidnapped and one of them had hunted as a, as a younger girl. And so she was like, do you know what movie that is? Anyway, so she was had the upper hand, she was tougher and she was more prepared because she had been a hunter. And I'm like, oh, that's cool. But then they show her as a little girl hunting and her perverted uncle had molested her hunting, drinking beer. Oh God. That movie split Split. That's what it was. So the hunter in there with some child molester, I'm like,

Speaker 4:          00:50:19       why is the most misunderstood and misrepresented discipline? I think, uh, that we have here in, and it's, it's so confusing to people because when we think of a food, we think of restaurants and we think a supermarket. Yeah. We don't think of wild animals and the connection that people feel like they don't have what their food is. One thing that comes up all the time lately, so people are constantly looking for these farm to table places. I visit a farm to table place out here, um, called a peddler's fork. It's a really good place. They have great eggs, like you get the eggs, they were like real dark yoke and the food is all grass fed beef or from a farm if they have a connection to and they buy the meat from the farm. And there's a lot of that, these farm to table places where they, these restaurants have a great relationship with the people that actually grow the food.

Speaker 4:          00:51:13       So everything's organic. They know where it comes from and people are super connected to that. They love the idea that because factory farming is kind of freaking people out. And for the longest time it was happening without us knowing. You know, I think during the eighties and the nineties it was all going on and no one, no one understood. Yup. So now people are becoming more aware because of the Internet, because of information and they're becoming more aware of where their food comes from. And you're also seeing a higher number of people that their response to this factory farming thing is, well, hey, I'll go vegetarian all, hey, I'll go vegan. And Yeah, before I hunted with Rinella, that was my thought. I was like, I don't want to participate in factory farming. Yeah. So what am I going to do? I'm going to do one of two things.

Speaker 4:          00:51:58       I can either go hunting, I'm going to hunt for my own food because I knew there's something wrong. I'm like, it's too easy to just get a steak. I would always like pick up a steak and I go, this isn't me an animal like a, here I am at the supermarket now it's a styrofoam container wrapped in Saran wrap. Like this is fucking weird. It's weird that you could just do this. So my thought was if I shoot an animal and I hate it, like I didn't know how it was going to feel. I never shy. I've fished all my life. I never, but when I shot that deer and I was like, oh, I can, I get it. I get it. Yeah. I mean it was an extreme amount of respect. It's on video. I mean, you can see it on media or anybody who wants to watch it.

Speaker 4:          00:52:34       You could watch it online. The first time I ever shot a deer, it was intense. Yeah. You know, and, and then cutting it up and eating it that night. I was like, this makes sense. This is a, and then when you actually find out that, you know that these animals, the money that co gum from hunting tags and even from buying hunting gear, there's a percentage of money that goes towards conservation. And this is all very carefully thought out by people like you and by these people that really respect and care for these animals. And you get deeper and deeper into this and you understand what it really is. And then you see this whole community of these people like yourself and Remy Warren and these hardcore hunters that are also like deeply connected to the land and conservation and deeply appreciate these animals. And this is how they get all their meat. This is how they live. And like that was extremely appealing to me.

Speaker 3:          00:53:27       Yeah, it's uh, I think Steve or has done a great job make getting that message out in a, in a, in a perfect way really. I mean, he's a great spokesman and, and his show, I used to watch his show before meteor. Now, I can't remember what it was called within. Is that what it was? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And, and I remember he had just something about him that I'm like, okay, this is different. I liked I was a hunter. I, you know, I've been a hunter myself my whole life, but his, his portrayal was different than what we'd seen before. And so, you know, maybe the me and some of the other people you've mentioned and, and Adam have just carried that on and tried to do a good job of educating people who don't know any better. And I just, you know, it's like, I wish everybody could be out there.

Speaker 3:          00:54:16       I mean, that last day we were up in the mountains there, um, after I had killed my deer and we had a back strap, so we're picking up camp, getting everything away. But I had, I had, uh, awesome fallow deer backstrap, which is like the prime for people that don't know as a prime cut. And I cut it all up. I cleaned it all off every piece of anything that was on at hair. If there's any tree bark, anything that was on there was just a perfect clean piece of meat. I sliced it all up. We got a green stick to put it on. Um, skewered it on, on green, um, wood. So if it's, if it's dry wood that we'll just going to burn. And so, you know, you can't cook on that. So it's gotta be green and we put it over the fire there and it was, we seasoned it, it was so good.

Speaker 3:          00:55:09       It was probably some of the best meat I've ever eaten. And standing around the campfire, just pulling that off, that, that stick that we had cooked it over the open flame was, I wish everybody could know what that was like to know that that deer just previous to that was alive in the woods. We harvested them, which is Aka killed him. And then Adam and that's that circle of life or whatever you want to call it or just that moment that's, I wish everybody could experience it because I just think they'd have a different take on, on hunter hunting and hunters and uh, being self sustaining.

Speaker 4:          00:55:48       It's very different. Meat is very different when you've tilled it yourself. It's impossible to describe without experiencing it. I mean, I could try, I could give it my best shot, but I'll, I'll fall short. But I remember eating that meat that we ate, uh, when I was in Montana with Rinella, the first hunt and uh, it was so delicious and we're cooking and over at Campfire and Steven brought this little grill, not, not a grill, like a great, you know, that we'd sat down over the fire and [inaudible] and it's like, like if you buy a steak and you cook it, it's great. Tastes good. Or call this a good steak. This is nice. But there's no connection

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       there. No, none. When you are eating an animal that you killed yourself and it's difficult to do when you, you were hard hunting for many, many days for you got that deer. Yeah. So there's this intense respect and connection that I think we all, I mean, we, we harp on about it so many times that people listen to these podcasts, that Jesus Christ, you go stop talking about how awesome hunting is, is it's because it's impacted both of us in a very, very positive way. In a very, uh, there's a primal genetic sort of a ancestral thing that's happening when you hunt. Yeah. There's, there's a, there's some lights that go off the, you didn't even know where they're like, oh, I didn't even know there was a switch over there and like, oh, this is a part of my brain that's lit up that it was never lit up before.

Speaker 2:          00:57:11       And it's not, it's not what everybody thinks that the negative aspects, it's not a barbaric thing. It's not a cruelty thing. It's a very respectful thing. Yeah. And I understand the people that have bad feelings about it. I understand the people that look at it like animal cruelty. Like you don't have to do that. You can get food other ways. You can eat beans and you don't need to do this. I understand how they're thinking, but my thought process is very different. My thought process is what you're doing, what I'm doing, what all these people that do that hunt is your entering into the wild and you are for a small window a week or whatever it is. You're becoming a part of this crazy cycle of nature. You're taking something out of that and leaving something as well. You're spending a ton of money.

Speaker 2:          00:57:58       That money, whether it's a the money for the outfitters, the money for the tags and money for the gear, all that stuff. Percentage of that goes to make sure that the habitat is maintained. Make sure that the animal populations maintained, make sure that department of fishing game is well staffed with biologists, with people that are monitoring these animals because guess what? If that doesn't get done, it's, it's these animals are not going to be there anymore, right? They're not going to be taken care of. And North America has the best wildlife management program or, or management system of anywhere. And that's why almost all the species that we have here, there's more now than there almost ever has been. And even with shrinking habitat, because we're encroaching on, on where they live, but we're still the number still flourish because we're not, hunters aren't just, Oh, let's go kill life.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       I'm all out. I mean, we're, it's managed. It's fishing game as managers are funded by hunters. And what we pay that with, uh, with the tags and license. And so it's, there's a system to it, but at the end of the day, like they're in Australia, we were getting up in the morning out of the sleeping bag, grabbing her bow and taken off. We're hunters as it and that, that feels, man, it, it feels, like I said, I wish people could know what it feels like because I see people comment on my social media and they saved the susans of the 19th century anymore. You don't have to be a neanderthal or whatever, but

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       it's just, we, we are hunters.

Speaker 4:          00:59:25       Yeah, well most of those people of cheeseburgers and their instagram pages, which is fucking hilarious. There's so much of that. This one chick, she posted something mean when I posted a picture of some elk that I was cooking and I said, hey honey, I go, you got like call girls honey, because it makes them feel like I'm a sexist. You got a, you got to fucking blt on your page sweetie. And uh, she's like, well, that was just from four months ago before I was enlightened. I like, Oh, you became enlightened. It's always the most adamant vegans like just became one of the most proselytizing, ruthlessly aggressive once I understand where they're coming from. And I think that's very important for, to get our message across is that like it went on animal haters. This is not this. And it's, it's hard for people to understand that someone could love animals and love the idea of animals and love wildlife, but still eat them.

Speaker 3:          01:00:15       Yeah. You know, I, I always, I climbed up in this tree there, I found this place where the deer were coming into this field. And, uh, like I said, this area had been hunted, but I, I, I had figured nobody had ever a hundred out of a tree there, you know, um, not like a white tail back here, you know, in the, in the east or in the south, that Theresa 100 all the time. So I'm like, well, I think I can get up in this tree, these deer coming out in this area. I probably have a pretty good chance. So I was up there in the tree and, uh, these doughs and Fonz or out in the field and they were running around chasing each other plain. I mean, it was just like speeding all around in circles and bumping into each other. And, uh, it was cool to see.

Speaker 3:          01:00:56       And then this, uh, a doe and a spike, a young buck came out right under my tree. This spike was 24, 25 yards away, basically a chip shot with a bow, especially had no idea. I was there and I, there was a thought that we were getting low on meeting camp and, uh, I hadn't killed a deer. So, you know, I had said before, I'm like, I'm killing any buck that comes out. Um, I'm, I'm taking him. And then I was watching him up there and I'm just like, I just, you know, for me, uh, it's gotta be the right animals, not just like, I'm not some blood thirsty, you know, I still watch the deer. I still appreciate their beauty and that, you know, they're frolicking about or whatever you want to call it. And it's still enjoyed that this, this young buck was down and I had said I was, we're going to get meat for camp, but I'm not some bloodthirsty guy.

Speaker 3:          01:01:47       So I just said, well, no, I'm just going to watch him and you know, enjoy it. And he was there. And then the buck, I ended up killing, stepped out. And uh, you know, an old Bach, he was, you could see his hip bones because he was so run down from the ride and he was getting older. I could tell he was an older, mature deer. And that's, that's what I want to take. I want to take an animal past its prime that has done his job for spreaders genes for the health of the herd and was, that's the animals we want to take out. And so he, he was just a rundown

Speaker 2:          01:02:21       old Bach. That's why I took, yeah, people don't they, that's the problem is that people associate someone who wants to take an older big mature animal with trophy hunting. Like, Oh, you just want the antler. So you just want a big, but they don't understand that that is actually the animal that you should take. Yeah. And he's still a, he's still great me. Yeah, sure. Yeah. But I mean that, that's just, you know, for the health of the herd, that's the one you want, you know, if you're doing it right, right. You know, young ones, then we'll get a chance to fill his spot. Right. And that would be the natural position if there was an, this is the natural position. If there's predators, the natural position is the really young ones, like the Fonz get taken out and then the really old ones start getting worn down.

Speaker 2:          01:03:03       They get taken out. And then everything in the middle gets to breed. And then this guy who was eight years old or whatever he is, he's had plenty of opportunity to shed spread his genetics. And so his, his offspring will be everywhere and then they'll get a chance now. And the thing is nobody makes it out. Nobody makes the whole live there either. All by everybody. We're all dying. So I mean, just so if I wouldn't have killed that bucket, it doesn't mean he's going to live forever. I mean, he's going to die one way or another. It's not going to become a ferry. The fact that he died, I shot him and he was dead within seconds is guaranteed and people are always talk shit about this is the very best way he could go. Yeah. You don't want them starving to death or you know, dying because his teeth don't work anymore and literally can't eat food.

Speaker 2:          01:03:49       You know this, I've seen animals where you, um, you look at their teeth and they're almost none left. Yeah. You get a, like a really old buck. This is buck teeth were flat in the back. So it was just when you can't eat, they got to gum, they can't gum enough. Yeah. They can't talk a doubt. Yeah. So it's uh, you know, and, and Adam also found two bucks that had fought and got stuck. They were fighting, an offense was in between them, just a cattle fence. They got stuck in the fence. Died. Yeah. So it's just their life is, I mean, how many guys out here in the street, you know, fight and kill each other and gets stuck together? It doesn't happen. It's life in the wild is, I mean, unless you're out there and you witness things like that, you just live in, it's a, it's not real.

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       I think the real problem is perspective, you know, I mean, I think unless you're there, unless you are experiencing the wilderness itself, like a, I've talked about my experience on Prince of Wales island that um, you know, Brian Cowen and Rinella and I, uh, we were up there for sec, I guess. I think we camped there for six days. And you, your, your, your idea of what like life is, is the only based on what your perception is, like what you're seeing on a daily basis. Well, he, you're seeing Ventura Boulevard and you're seeing billboards and all new movies coming out and keeping up with the Kardashians. Here's a new season. And look at that new Audi. Wow. That's a sweet looking car. Hey, I got the new iphone. All right, and this is life. And then you're out there and you go, oh well this is life to total quiet like this.

Speaker 2:          01:05:26       No. Cell phone service. Rain animals. Yeah. And then if you die, no one's going to, no, no. If you fall and break your neck and die right there, something will eat you. No one will find you. You're nuts. That's normal. You're trying to stay warm, you're trying to get food. And there's more spots that on this planet, more spots like that on this planet. Then spots like Los Angeles. Yeah. It's uh, it's weird. Yeah. I don't know. It's just, it's, but that connection, I don't know, I guess there's no, there's no way to see it in, in front of your computer. No. But I want if we can film it right and share a right, I think people will get it. Getting it a little now get it more than what

Speaker 3:          01:06:09       right now. So, I mean, that's my goal with, you know, what we've been talking about and I mean, we talked about the difficulty. I did remember, I wanted to mention this. Um, that ha the hell was, I mean I've been on a lot of haunts and a lot of places over the years and uh, I hadn't struggled like ahead on this [inaudible] it was so difficult. I was telling the guys back there, I said, I'm, I'm questioning my life right now. What, what am I doing with my life? And it was just because I'm like, it's not going to happen. I'm not going to get it done. And the animals don't care about my goals that they don't care about that. Oh, we're supposed to be making this great film and portray hunting. They're like, now we're not, has nothing to do. They're just staying alive. That was it.

Speaker 3:          01:06:58       So it was just like everything that I've, I felt like I want her to do or achieve or my, it was just like, it's not going to happen. And it felt like, God, have I lost it? You know? I mean, I was, it was just like, this is hard, but when it works and you do it right in that shot happens, then it's just like, okay. And I don't know, it's just that doing something so difficult, um, and being successful, and I've said this before, has made me who I am, you know? I mean, without, without a challenge like that, I dunno. I Dunno where I'd be right now. So it's, uh, I dunno. Sometimes you cuss it and then, man, you were just so appreciative of the journey. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:07:44       Well those difficult moments, the only thing that makes success worthwhile if success was easy, if you woke up in the morning, first day yawn, have a cup of coffee, step five steps, there's the biggest deer that's ever lived, shoot one right through his heart. You wouldn't even feel it. It wouldn't, it wouldn't be like, oh no. And I don't think people understand how difficult it is to, because they watch these TV shows. Have you ever watched a hunting show? There were half an hour long. So you're watching 22 minutes without commercials, right? Yeah, and 22 minutes, you know, they usually build up for the first, you know, 15 minutes when you know, we came close to them but we

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       could not get a shot and then finally they get a shot, which you don't see is that these, it takes days and days and days of 10 12 hours hike up and down mountains up and down and up and down. And when I met you, the reason why I got in contact with you and the reason why I met you was because I was so confused as to why someone would need to run ultra marathons or to get ready for hunting. I was like, what the fuck is this guy doing? Like why is he lifting weights and doing all this shit for it? I didn't get it. I was like this. I was just getting into it and I was trying to figure out like I was, I would start to watch things on television though, starting to read certain articles and read certain books. And I was like, well, what is this whole fitness connection to hunting?

Speaker 4:          01:08:59       Like why do they need to be in shape? I'm like, I'm in pretty good shape. Like what's the big deal? Well, I went with Rinella and when I went with Grinnell, one of the things I realized is like, boy, I got pretty winded going up these fucking hills, like hiking, hiking, tires, you out, especially high altitude. And then I see your, your videos online. And I was like, what the fuck is this guy into? And then, um, as I go deeper and deeper into it, I realized like, oh, this is like an extreme pursuit. This is not just like something, you just go out and do this. It's something that's really hard to do. And a lot of people there, I've, I've, I've read this one article, but there's one guy who was unsuccessful 12 years in a row, elk hunting before he finally, I shot an elk like 12 years. Like how many times did this guy go out? How many days did he camp and the forest, how many days did he try to stock and get winded or snap on a twig at the last minute or, you know, the, the elk sees him and bolt it. Most people are unsuccessful. Yeah. I mean, nine out of 10 every year on successful. I think it's more than that. Hunting with archery, it, it's about, it's about 10% is it 10% yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:10:03       So nine out of 10 are unsuccessful. So people who don't hunt, who see, you know, dead stuff all the time, they think, oh, you just go out and kill an animal. Right? No. Right. Most 90% don't. It is really hard. And it's just like until you're out there, you got the bow in your hand and you're trying to close in on that animal and you're trying to do everything right from a to z with. And there's so many variables during that whole path as like it, it seems a possible sometimes, you know, even even for me after 30 years,

Speaker 4:          01:10:37       and this is a very strange connection that you get with nature and forget about even the fact that you're pursuing these animals to hunt them and eat them. But there's a very strange connection that you get when you're out there in that total quiet woods where they live, you're in their world and you lock eyes with them and you meet them and you see them and you're in this place with no cell phone reception with no people anywhere near you for miles and miles. Yeah. It's a totally different feeling. Life shows you, uh, another aspect of itself that you didn't know existed. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:11:08       yeah. And it's out there every day. Yeah. But we're just, you know, and living in our, we're muted were very nice.

Speaker 4:          01:11:16       You did. There's something about cities and this existence. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like it. I like a lot of it. I liked the fact that you can go to a restaurant. I like going to the movies. I like the fact that if, uh, you know, if your phone breaks, you go to the fucking mom, get a new cell phone, all that stuff's wonderful. It's not, not bad, but the other stuff is fantastic too and we're disconnected. A giant percentage of our population lives in these urban environments that have a complete and total disconnect from the actual life on earth. Like life on earth is not just urban environments. Life on earth has this broad spectrum of different ways it manifests itself and to experience all these different ones. To be in Alberta and see black bears in the wild to be, you know, in Colorado and see mule deer and being in the woods and the mountains and to be around these different animals, it's a different, it's a different understanding of the actual existence that living things have here on earth. That living things that share the air you breathe and the water you drink and the earth itself.

Speaker 3:          01:12:24       How was it that was the best part of that trip? Cause we would split up, uh, Adam would go one way. I would go another way in the morning. I'd have mark womack with me. He'd have a, jamison was his camera man's name would go with him. And the best part was at the end of the day, hearing what everybody saw and not, not, not what if you killed something. Cause we didn't care. I mean, were there a long time, it didn't kill very much, but just what everybody saw, you know, from the bucks being locked up that were dead. Two, uh, one morning we were up and a w heard something, a commotion up ahead of us and mark's mark says, oh, it's a bug rubbing his antlers. And I listen for a second. I said, no, that's two bucks fighting. So we took off up the hill and I got 25 yards away and these bucks, we're just going at it, just fighting, pushing each other around.

Speaker 3:          01:13:13       And I, I couldn't get a clear shot, didn't get out there and time to do that. But that story. And then Adam would say, well he called in three Fox, you know, he did a varmint call on three Fox came running in or he saw this many wild boars or he was close to getting inside a giant fallow Bach and however it didn't work out. And then I would share a story about what I saw, you know, about another brown snake or something like that. And that was, that was so fun just getting together over the campfire. Not talking about what we killed, but just what we saw and experienced, you know, and it's, you know, I was flew home last night and just got in this morning to La and I'm looking around in the airport. I was thinking about all the people, I wonder how many actually would get me, you know, cause I feel like an outsider a little bit, especially coming back from the hunt and I'm just looking at everybody thinking I

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       don't get them. They probably don't get me, but you'll at least understand what they're doing. I think, you know, I mean, when I was checking my luggage in it, I was flew virgin coming her back from Sydney to La and you know, the, the lady there, the check and she's like, oh, what's in that case? And I said, it's about a weapon. I go, could be, yeah, yeah, it's a bow and arrow. What were you doing? I said, hunting. She's in. She goes, what were you hunting? Oh, don't tell me. Don't tell me. She didn't want to hear it. Like you have leather shoes on. I was like, I was hunting buffalo. She's like, there's buffalo here. I said, well, not here, but yeah, there's, there's a lot of buffalo in Australia. And uh, she's like, well, I don't think you can fly with a bow and arrow.

Speaker 1:          01:14:59       And I'm like, I know you can't. Yeah you can. I said, it's just like I said, it's not even like a firearm or weapon type thing, it's just, you just check it in just normal. But anyway, I, I was thinking, I was like, Whoa, man. That's, how old was this lady? Oh, she wasn't old. She was much younger than me probably. I mean, you can fly with a bone. And what was she telling you that I don't know. She never looked into that. I said, I go, well, I ended up, you didn't have to do anything. She said, you're going to have to sign all this stuff because they're not allowed. And I'm just like, I said, listen, I fly with this all over the world as a lady worked there. Yeah, no, no. Oh, that's hilarious. So she said there are way more strict, which maybe they are verge. I was most true. That's where she said, she goes. I said, well, I've just flew quantis to Darwin and back, and nobody said a word. I said it, I've, she goes, have you ever been in Australia before with it? I said, yeah. I said, I've listened. I've been everywhere. It's never an issue. Trust me. I'm not trying to blow. I mean, just trust me. So anyway, but yeah, it's just, it's just, there's times that I'm just like, God, am I the outsider or, or what? I don't know. Well, you know, it's like

Speaker 4:          01:16:14       we were talking before this when we were on the way over here about a show. They wanted me to come on and talk about guns, but there's going to be like a large audience and is going to be a bunch of people on the panel and you talk for seven minutes and you go to commercial break and I'm like, I'm not interested. I'm not interested in doing that because I think that it's a long conversation that you have to have with someone and it takes a while for you to understand their point of view. It takes a while for them to understand your point of view. It takes a while to establish the fact that you're a very reasonable person and this is a very nuanced conversation. Much like when that guy in France ran over a bunch of people with his truck, I don't think the truck should be outlawed. And I think the real issue is human beings that are capable of doing horrible shit, blind people, right? Why are they capable of doing that? Let's get to the bottom of that and let's stop ignoring all the factors and just concentrating only on the weapon. Right. That kind of is a long

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       conversation that I think it takes hours and hours and you still might not get to the bottom of it. That's how I feel about like you talking to someone about hunting, like if you came over here, it's almost like, I don't even want to tell them. Like if someone says like the, you have a boat, like what's in the case? I got to bow and Arrow. What do you do? I practice our tree. Yeah. It's easier that way. I like to shoot at targets. Oh, you target shooting. Oh, that's cool. That's in the Olympics. Yup. I see New Olympics. Yeah, it's up my targets, they move and they have antlers. I nick. Well, they can't tell him that. I think I'm just like, it takes too long. Yeah, it does, but I don't know. I think I'm, I just don't like hiding who I am, basically. So I'm always, I just say, Hey, this is what I do. So yeah. She's like, don't tell me. I'm like, I was hunting buffalo. I'm telling you, I don't care.

Speaker 2:          01:17:59       They're an invasive species. They live there. You're going to hear, you're gonna hear what I was doing, whether you like it or not. Nobody wants to hear. Well it's Kinda Kinda like with my, with my social media, I like putting up stuff that so I can do weed the people out, you know, like holding, holding the buffalo head in the water. I'm like, okay, this is going to weed out so that people who I really don't want here anyway, they're going to get mad at you for sure. But they would get mad anyway. And there's a lot of people that listen to these conversations and they get a perspective that they would have never had. Like there's a lot of people right now that are listening, that are in their car, that are on there, you know, on the boss or whatever, and they've got the headphones on and they're thinking about this in a way that they never thought about it before because in their mind they've, because of the fact they live in these urban environments and they've never been exposed to hunting and they get all their meat from a store or from a supermarket or from a restaurant, they just never heard anybody talk about it.

Speaker 2:          01:18:55       And this is a, it's a weird part of our life. It's a d, it's a dangerous disconnect I think with life and death, the dangerous disconnect of restaurants and supermarkets. Well here's, here's one thing, I think people just get tuned in to what they're interested in. And that's it. I mean, even instagram does it. So on the explore page or whatever that is, what comes up is what you look at. So it comes up on my page is like a hunting and fitness and that's, so it's all that. So whatever you're looking at, whether it's gay guys are or cooking, that's what's going. That's what, that's your world. So that's sort of what our world is now as we only, we're only exposed to really what we want to be exposed to, you know? And that's why I'm like, no, I'm hunting buffalo, uh, that lady be exposed to something different.

Speaker 2:          01:19:48       Right, right, right. So, I dunno, it's just, um, it's comparable. Comparably know what my point is, but it's, what you're saying makes a whole lot of sense is that people, do they find these communities with likeminded people and becomes an echo chamber. Yeah, yeah. If you're preaching to the choir, and that goes all the way back to like a million hours ago, it feels like since we've been talking about why that Netflix thing is so appealing to me and having you involved, it's just because we've reached so many new people and hunting is so, is so important to me. And I think, I mean, just the, just so people can understand what motivates us and why it's important. I just want that, just want that shown. Right. You know, it's shared. Right. But there's definitely a way to do it. And I, I know where we should go.

Speaker 2:          01:20:36       I mean, whether it's the buffalo place or somewhere else, but I think it's a great idea to do. No, Steven Nellis show net is on Netflix. Yeah. Yep. And it has one star. Does people are so angry, either they find it and if you shouldn't have to eat me. Yeah. Anything you want from salary, people get, uh, they get super, super aggro. You know, you want to make people really angry. Tell them, tell them that there's a growing body of science that shows it. Plants are intelligent. Yeah. Yeah. Glance thing. They feel that the screen and all that fucking freak out like babies or you don't even have to say that this justifies eating meat. Just put that. No, when I put that on twitter, just the, the, the, the data about that and people will fucking go crazy and attack me for hunting. Yeah. Or if you talk about all the animals that die when they're one of their salads been made, you know, I mean, so it's different.

Speaker 2:          01:21:33       Whatever I, they, they put, they prioritize or put different importance on, you know, that we've talked about that too, that they feel like they're doing a good thing. And they also, in many ways, look, if you're, if you're shooing factory farm, you're avoiding factory farming and eating more salads in evening, uh, you know, uh, farm to table vegetables instead, you are definitely contributing to less death and suffering. 100%. Yeah, but you can tip it into some, they just are, if you will, grain. If you eat grain, you're contributing to a w for, first of all, what do you care about? Do you care about insects? Like where do you draw the line? Because if you don't care about insects, well then you're okay. But if you do, if you think that insects are life well, there's pesticides, they're fucking, they're there. It's a holocaust everyday out there fucking bugs. They're spraying those goddamn things constantly. I mean if you, if you want to have a healthy crops, there's a reason why they have these pesticides cause they want to kill these animals that are trying to eat the crops to kill these little bugs. And I don't know, I just keep going back to this recent trip just because I think about it and it's just like, here's another example. So those are the Brown snakes up there are second most deadly and we saw a number of brown snakes in the road while we were driving.

Speaker 2:          01:22:50       Adam swerves around them, you know, try to not kill him, not kill him. He wants him to stay alive while yeah, big spider. He had crawling on his face. I saw that thing. Why did you let that thing grow on his face? I Dunno, cause he's Australian. Just different. Free to but not killing

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       it. What's happened? Is that on his instagram, uh, it was, yeah, it is somewhere. So you got it. Adam. Dot. Green Tree. Dot. Bow Hunting. Now he changed it to just Adam Green tree. Adam. Dot. Green Tree. Why? Oh, I don't know. The bow hunting park. I think it was tutoring cruisy yeah, maybe. Um, I don't think he's worried about that at all. I Dunno. People, boy, that guy seemed immune to, to hate. Yeah. It's, uh, um, he's a great guy. He's a, but he, he is sensitive to, I mean he's, it's not, that's what I'm saying. It's not like we're just cold blooded killers. Right. You know what I mean? There was one time we did, we didn't have an argument, but I didn't believe him about something and he was so upset. He's like, I, he goes, I'm brutally honest, you know, and he's like mad that I didn't believe him. So it's like he's a warmhearted person. He's not just a, uh, not running over snakes and kill a robot. No, no, no. And so people think that we're just these, these cold blooded killers out there, barbaric or whatever. No, no. I feel like, and I don't want to judge people who aren't, but I feel like we are just, we understand the circle of life better. Yeah. I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          01:24:22       Well, you definitely more accustomed to being around it. You're definitely exposed to more. Yeah. You know, I think, like I said, I have friends that are vegans. I know a lot of vegans and people think that for some reason I hate vegans. I mock a lot of things. I make fun of things that are, that are targets and a lot of like the proselytizing nature of vegans in the angry self, righteous moral, high ground stance that they take. It's easy to mock. It's right there. It's easy. And I think, I think most of the people that do it, they do it for good reasons. Most of the, the, the, the, you know, trying the lifestyle and eating that way, but there's also health problems with it. You know, people don't like you saying that either. I know a lot of people that have tried it and they give up after awhile because it bought up my friend Sophie from the comedy store.

Speaker 4:          01:25:13       She just started eating eggs again. Yeah. For the longest time she was just trying to just go straight Vegan. She kept getting her blood work back and it wasn't healthy. Or, um, actually she wasn't, she wasn't a work. Sam Harris was the blood car. He went Vegan for a while, but his blood work was all fucked up, so he started eating fish and eggs and yeah, it's like there's people that buy different bodies are more adaptable to different kinds of diets and some people just don't do well and are all plant based diet and maybe they're not as disciplined as some folks. Maybe they're not doing it right. Yeah. I don't know. It's hard to say, but everybody, everybody's different. But I don't think there's anything wrong with going out and killing animals and eating them. And I think that's where we differ from a lot of people that think that you should not be allowed to do that. You not be allowed because it's barbaric. I don't think it's barbaric. I think it's spiritual and that's what what freaks people out. They get very angry if you say that. Yeah. But they, but they wouldn't get angry if he talked about native Americans doing it. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:26:15       it's very interesting. And the thing is is like the big difference is I don't care if they don't eat meat. I don't judge them for not eating meat, but they judge us for killing. You know what I mean? So it's, it's pretty one sided as far as they won't accept being a hunter and being self sufficient while any hunter I know isn't going on Vegan pages and talking shit. You know what I mean? I mean, so it's just weird how they're so hateful and so one sided, you know, up on our soapbox and I don't feel like we would do that. I mean, I know we'll do it. I know there's going to be people that say they're going to say, oh, first of all, they can say, how many times am I going to be on here as many times as he can come. Let's talk about podcast folks. What's the record of the most people on here for the most number of, I dunno, repeat guests, somebody probably knows. Probably Joey Diaz. Callan's probably pushed challen. Yeah, account. All the, all the fight companions and everything and he brought, well, oh that's true. Yeah. And then they'll say, talking about more boring hunting shit.

Speaker 4:          01:27:23       That's fine. I know you don't have to listen folks. I do a lot of podcasts. I've got one later today with Jordan Peterson. I guarantee you we're not going to be talking about hunting. Well it's, who's that? He's a professor at the University of Toronto. He might hut. He might, I don't think it does though. Uh, he hunts liberals, but he, one of the things is about, um, what we're talking about earlier that we were saying that people sort of find their area and it becomes like an echo chamber. And I think that's one of the issues with, whether it's veganism or even hunting, is that I think that people, they need to be had to have these dialogues with people that don't necessarily agree with that so they can find out how the other person thinks. And you know, if you do, if you are talking to a person who is a hunter and you find out that they're actually just a cruel psychopath, like, fuck man, I wouldn't want to hang out with that guy.

Speaker 4:          01:28:11       I mean, I've, I haven't experienced that, but I know they must be out there. So if you were sitting across him having a freaks and everything and everything. Yeah. And you were having a conversation with someone like that. I mean it would be, it would be disturbing, but I think that most people that, uh, are, especially people like yourself or a guy like remy warren or Steve Rinella, very well spoken, who was also an advocate for conservation, loves wildlife. If they sat down and had a long form conversation like this with someone who's a reasonable person who was a Vegan for all the right reasons, there's a vegan because they care about life and cause they, they want to be cruelty free and they want to live life with his little footprint as possible. I think they'd be surprised at how much common ground they find.

Speaker 3:          01:28:57       Yeah. I mean if you, if, if anybody spent a day in the woods with remy or Adam, they'd be shocked at how much not hunting. They know just how much they know about the environment, about, about where they're hunting about different species, about the animals and tendencies and in foliage. And I mean those guys are amazing.

Speaker 4:          01:29:23       Almost like we were talking about like with the aborigines were kind of losing their culture. We're losing out on an understanding of how these people live. There's a little bit of that could be said about the, the, the culture of hunting is that if it goes away and if it w w there was a trend about 10 maybe 1520 years ago, where from what I've read at least, obviously I'm pretty new to it. I've only been hunting for five years, but that they were considerably worried. They were really worried. There was a real thought that the next few generations that hunting was going to dwindle down to such a such a low number that the hunters would not have the same sort of impact in, in terms of politically where they could affect the retaining of public lands. Yeah. And, which is a huge issue with, with, with Americans today and you're seeing it with this trump administration where you're seeing the erosion of the environmental protection agency and the erosion of the status that protected status at some national monuments have and perhaps public lands have people were super nervous and you had a conversation, a long conversation with Jason Chaffetz, Chaffetz Chaffetz Chaffetz who had a very controversial bill that he had out that was pulled back.

Speaker 4:          01:30:38       It was a bill to sell off public land that was pulled back because of the activism of hunters in the people care.

Speaker 3:          01:30:45       Yeah. It was, uh, it was what they determine what they were going to, um, determine was disposable. Yeah. 3 million acres. Yeah. Disposable as well. That was, that was hr six 21 and then there's Hr six 22 also said there's two of them kind of back to back. Different, six 22 just took away the law enforcement on public lands, which at, and t and they wanted to take it from the, the federal government, um, to give it to the state, which people think that that's just a way where the states can say, well, we can't afford it, so we're going to have to sell this public land because it's a resource. And in the states have to, the states have to balance our budget every year. Federal government doesn't. So if the state has to balance its budget and it's not penciling out and they can sell x amount of acres and that's going to help, they're going to do that. That's all there is to it. So, um, yeah, that is, there's also wildfire protection. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,

Speaker 4:          01:31:45       bunch of issue fighting wildfires is all, it's a federal issue, but if it's private land, if the state sells it all, that shit's gone. There's no more federal protection.

Speaker 3:          01:31:55       Yeah. And you look at, um, I dunno, it's a, that's a big one.

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       And so sportsmen's really stepped up and that was through social media, how they can, now we have more of a voice than we've ever had. You know, before it was just these politicians making decisions and you know, the US little people didn't really have a say. Now we have a say. I mean Jason Chaffetz, you'd think, well, why would he care? He'd look at his instagram page. He might have, you know, I don't think he has 20,000 whereas we have pretty big numbers, especially you. So if you mentioned something about it, he gets overwhelmed with, Hey, are you looking out for us? Are you doing the right thing by us? Um, we, we won't vote you in next time. And so then it makes those guys think, Holy Shit. Did you see his town hall meeting? Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. It's all sportsmen and sportswomen showed up and they all people that care about public lands and they went crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:32:52       Yeah. That I don't, that was a kind of a goal. I was, I was, yeah, I was had mixed mixed feelings on that because the yelling and stuff doesn't, it least it sends a very clear message. It did. It doesn't accomplish much as far as there, but yeah, it, it sends a message for sure. Yeah. It's a dangerous and he's not going to be a politician anymore. No, I nuns resign and I don't know. I'm not sure. I haven't, you know, I see every once in a while he likes some of my stuff, so it's like, um, I hear he's going into male prostitution. That's what I heard. Is that true? Jamie, can you go google that? I just made that up. I know Jason, if you're listening, I'm a comedian and I'm sorry. No, don't. So he, he seemed like a super nice guy, but it's, it's a politician.

Speaker 1:          01:33:37       And I told him, I said, Lucy was, I go, listen, you're the first politician I've ever met. And he's like, Oh, you've lived a charmed life puzzled by representative Shavitz decision to quit congress. Ben Is that fucking deal going in that town hall and have all those people screaming. I'm probably thinking, what am I doing? Well, he's, you know, like I said, he seemed nice, but maybe that politicians have to be personable. That's how they get elected. You know, you ever watch house of cards now? I had show, she'll watch it freaking the fuck out if it's really like you should be scared. We should all be scared. So I'd like to, I'd like to learn more. I haven't, I haven't asked him, you know, what's going on or whatever. But yeah, I mean I was, I liked the fact that he at least took time out to talk about it, you know, instead of just, and I'm not sure why he did, but I appreciated the fact that he did. Well, it's, he's an interesting guy because he saves money for the people by sleeping in his office. He was a cot in his office that he sleeps in to save money on hotel rooms for the people. So it's like, yeah, it's not like he's a total piece of shit. No. You know, he didn't get that feeling. But, um, Rinella has a very bad opinion of him based on his record with defending public lands and Rinella thinks that he does not understand the significance of these decisions.

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       These decisions are, they are a step in the wrong direction that will snowball out of control and it will eventually lead to privatizing public lands and the loss of the access to them by the American people that, you know, it was all set aside by Teddy Roosevelt and all those people that had such great insight and foresight back in the day. And that's, you know, that was the worry with, he says, well, no, I'm just taking the law enforcement away, um, from these lands and gay, or not taking your way but giving it to the state. And like I said, with the whole budget thing, so people were thinking that when they don't have enough money, not just for the law enforcement, but for, uh, enforcing illegal timber, timber harvest and dumping trash. And so when all that happens that that lessens the value of the land.

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       So when the value of the land is lesson, then it's just like, okay, whatever. This is a garbage dump anyway, so it makes it easier. So they thought that was just a step in the transition of moving, taking that away from public land and privatizing it is opinion and maybe, maybe it was, I don't know. Well he seemed like Jason seem like a very nice guy when you were interviewing him. I don't know enough about that particular issue, but when you talk to God like Brunello who is deeply invested in it and very well read on it, he uh, is of the opinion 100% that it's an incredibly negative idea. Hr has six 21 which has gone and six 22 which he thinks is equally negative and he thinks it's essentially like a Trojan horse. Right. And that's, and I told him, I said, what I said too, as I said, you know, sportsmen don't support six 22 either.

Speaker 2:          01:36:35       The girls get mad when you call it sportsman probably. Is there another word outdoors? People towards, people can't say sports people. You're like, what? Lacrosse players sick of that. Are you, cause you're a man, your male privilege is showing, oh son of a bitch. I thought it was white privilege that too. Oh, you got to have it all. American privilege. White privilege. CIS gender privilege. Peanut butter, jelly ratios, peanut butter and jellies. Racist Take Fletcher had that on. I didn't even know what that was about. All I saw was your post and the headline, just like I didn't surprise me though. People think the peanut butter and Jelly is racist. This is how deep it gets because white people eat peanut butter and Jelly, whereas black people don't necessarily eat peanut butter and jelly. So to have peanut butter and jelly as a food choice in school for our kids is racist because other ethnic groups don't necessarily eat peanut butter and jelly.

Speaker 2:          01:37:32       What in the fuck? Well, first of all, who doesn't like peanut butter and Jelly? Uh, some communists. I think maybe Chinese folks. Uh, from of the stars. Yeah. Hunters probably don't. Yeah, that guy from that movie molested that girl. Um, yeah. Who North Koreans? Maybe the most evil ones. Maybe they don't like me to burn. The only, probably I don't, that's ridiculous. That's delicious food choice. People are just working too hard to be offended. So you are exactly 100% correct right there. People are working too hard to be offended. Yeah. Yeah. There's a, there's a lot of folks out there that just looking for something to get ticked off at. It's uh, it's too easy. It's too easy to get by, you know? And I think that's also something that happens when life is too fucking easy. Yeah. There's not enough struggle when we're talking about kids and about putting your kids through difficult things so that they understand accomplishing goals and they understand how things aren't easy.

Speaker 2:          01:38:30       You have to struggle through stuff. And how it's hard today because you know, you're doing well. I'm doing well. Our kids are fine. You know, they don't have to worry about where food's coming from. It's going to be there. You open the fridge, there's the food. Yeah. So you have to figure out like, okay, how do you get this kid to understand and appreciate the value of a difficult task? Overcoming that difficult task and feeling that good feeling that you have of building character and of and knowing, yeah, I can push through something like you had to do during that tough hunt, very difficult. Questioning yourself. Then finally success. Ah, and then you have that good feeling, good feeling of success and of accomplishment and of realizing that you will fight those demons in your mind and that you will stay the course and keep hammering as it were, get through on the other end with success.

Speaker 2:          01:39:19       And you've done it before and even though you've been doing it for fucking decades, those questions still come to your mind. That's, and that for me personally, that's why work as hard as I do just because you get wake up calls like that and you're just like, okay, I gotta be on my a game. Well, it's one of the reasons why I like doing really difficult things, which leads me to what you've got me into his running. Yeah. I've been fucking running lately. I run all the time now. One fucking hills. It's crazy. I run hills. I put a backpack on with a weight played on I fucking Walk Hills. I'm like, what am I doing? How often are you running? Several days a week. Really? Yeah. Depending on whether or not I'm home, like then route that we did. Yep. Okay. I'll do that route and I also do that steep hill near my house. I do that a does a couple different routes that I go. How's it? I mean is it easier than this year? But it still sucks the fat Dick. That's what was about to say. That's like, that's running. Hey, that could be a shirt running. Sucks a fat Dick. But I love it.

Speaker 2:          01:40:20       It's, it's, it's definitely slightly easier. Yeah, but they'll, you remember that fucking steep, Steep Hill once you get to the bottom and then you go back up as awesome. It is awesome. But it is always hard. It's never easy when I'm getting to the top of that thing, but I could make it all the way up to the top. Now. I don't have to stop it. Really? Yeah, I can make, oh, that's good. Yeah. That's awesome. It's fucking brutal. Yeah. I made sure that I could get there. Fuck, it's hard. But you, you did mention that it has helped your cardio on. Oh Dude. Well that's one thing that I noticed. Like I didn't, I didn't uh, kickbox for couple of weeks because I've been too busy doing other stuff and I wanted to keep with the running because I was getting some accomplishment. I'm, I was getting some um, um, progress out of it.

Speaker 2:          01:41:07       I was seeing progress and then, uh, I started, uh, going back into some of my other workouts. It didn't affect my weightlifting and all my Catawba Kettlebell workouts at all. But man kickboxing, it really affected it. It affected it a real positive way cause I'm doing all hills, so I'm basically sprinting a lot jacked spike. And so when I was a, I was doing rounds in the bag the other day, I was like, she is, I got a lot of wind. It's kind of crazy. That's awesome. Yeah, it was like deep into like the third and fourth round and I was still slamming the bag and I was like, this is weird. It's like I've got like an extra gear here. Did A, have you dropped any weight? Yeah, I've dropped a few pounds. Probably like somewhere between one 94 one 96 where I was, I was hovering around 200 but I've dropped down before just by my diet.

Speaker 2:          01:41:55       Gut shitty again, got shitty again. When I went to Mexico I gained like eight pounds in a week in Mexico. Yeah. Be Year and Mexican food. That's not good. That's not good for weight control. Where's definitely not taste good though. Yeah. Well I haven't been doing Jujitsu very much when I do Jujitsu a lot. I fucking, the weight just flies off. Really need anything. I could eat a horse, but it's a Jujitsu just so calorie intensive. Yeah, I mean, yeah, the way it burns. Just fighting for your life. Well, let's know, what's your running goal? Um, I don't have a running goal. I just, I'm definitely going to keep doing it and keep getting in better shape. And then if something, if I decide, okay, I need something to strive for, then here's my goal. Okay, I want to do the key. Pam Ran Five K next year and fucking kick ass at it instead of this year when I did it where I was like, oh Jesus, this is hard.

Speaker 2:          01:42:54       Well, the zero running. How about this guy? Almost 25 seconds short of the two hour marathon barrier. So crazy. He did break the world record though. It broke the world record. Two hours and 20 seconds. 25 seconds I believe it was. So he was only 25 seconds short of breaking what people think is this unattainable record. That's insane. He'll break it or someone like him would break. Somebody will. Yeah, but it's so close. So in Nike's apparently lied to you will invest. Yeah, I don't think so. I'm not built like that guy. They're all built the same way. Like

Speaker 5:          01:43:29       popsicle sticks, super humid. When he was running this too, it was like 70% humidity, which isn't like ideal. No hot water. Oh, that's high. Well that probably could have been the 20 seconds. Right? Oh for sure. Yeah. Maybe they could do that in Seattle in the winter. The course is running on is in Milan. I guess there's an article I just read yesterday. I think it was on tech crunch maybe or wired. Somebody like a for there was trying to break a half marathon and he wanted to see if he could break a 90 minute or half marathon and was his first time running on that course and he broke up like two and a half minutes so that there's something special about that course to take a mile and a half track. I don't know why you'd be able to run faster necessarily there, but punk can and those shoes they made two or what is it? What's the deal with the shoes? Something spus super special training. I don't know exactly. You can't buy him yet. You can like only when I'm off a raffle.

Speaker 2:          01:44:18       Maybe if you had under armor he would've won. That's it. Maybe keep hammering. Choose good under armour. Keep hammering shoes that you could get an underarmour.com can you get your key hammering shoes? Can you buy them anywhere? I don't think so. What the fuck under armour get on the ball if you can't buy my, my three five your shirt I always wear either. Yeah. Well that's a rare thing. Shirt with buttons. She keep that away from the public. That's super important. We are, I don't know what it's going to be released, but the Cameron hanes line is coming out the Cameron Hanes, underarmour UAA hunt. Ron. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's awesome. And you're going to have a say in how it's designed. It's awesome. It's the boots are amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Beautiful boots. Uh, Kamma shorts, pants, base layer, hoodie jacket. It's killer. And when is this?

Speaker 2:          01:45:10       All this stuff. You don't know when it's coming out now? I don't know. But they're in the in development stage right now. Yeah. I think that they texted me when I was in Australia and said they have samples. And for me it was awesome when you took over the UAE hunt page on instagram and you'll do more of that now. Right? Because I talked to Brian, you know, Brian, we're going to get on the ball with this. Yeah. I mean when I took it over the week that I took over there was, so if you look at impressions on Instragram it went up 3 million. Well that seems like a good thing Brian isn't I really wait, we're waiting for response looking at Brian off here. Looking at him in the camera. You can look at him up there. Oh it's up.

Speaker 2:          01:45:48       Yeah. So no, and when Adam took it over, when we're on that Australia hunt it, it went up like they went from, what was it, a 493,000 to 502,000 followers. So pretty good jump. Yeah, that's good jump. Yeah, I posted it on instagram too. Yeah. And it's just a matter of putting out interesting content. Yeah, well that's what I was saying. Like the instagram story was nice, but I would have really loved it if you guys were street. If there was a way to stream like more often, like you had like very specific moments where he's streaming and I think that as technology advances especially, did you see what a Ilan Musk is trying to do? He's trying to fill the world with one gigabyte Internet and he's going to do is launch satellites into the year that's going to allow people to have one gigabyte is fucking insane fast. And if that happens you can stream live from anywhere. But say goodbye to privacy by the way. It's going to be drones filming people right outside their window. It's going to get really crazy but live. But what's going to be interesting is you can in a place like

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       where you were and you could, you know, call people from your phone, you can film things, you could stream live and all that stuff would be available and you would have real Internet access in the, in the bush.

Speaker 1:          01:47:02       And that's what people, people like that, I mean they're already asking wins a film coming out, you know, we, we filmed this, mark womack with his company's sub seven, filmed it for under armour and we're like, we gotta turn this thing around fast. And I saw under armour put out, this can come out in the fall. I'm like, bullshit, listen, let's get this out. Fucking may know people came. People like, I mean the chop chop, people don't have patience anymore. I don't have patience anymore. I don't either. I would like you to finish the sentence quicker please. I T I saw, uh, I saw mark womack, we got off the plane together and in La here and I'm like, Hey, you get that movie done or what? He's, he's on the plane. He said he was working, he had been editing. So I'm like, all right, let's get that thing posted.

Speaker 1:          01:47:46       So I don't know. I mean, people are primed for right now. They follow along and in our super invested in it and it'd be, it'd be awesome to get it up close. And I'm your manager now, so I'm going to make some calls. We've already decided we're going to make things happen quicker. Yeah, you got me running. You got me doing a lot of shiny shit, dude. You gotta be do a lot of things I didn't think I'd be doing. Oh, that's awesome. So, uh, I oh yeah. Well good. So I want to make some cryo you to, for, uh, for giving me this. Just talk about landforms.

Speaker 4:          01:48:14       I really do think that it's made a big impact. And I think you and Rinella and Remy Warren and Adam and the people that I've had on it and Jim shockey and you know, real representatives of the noble pursuit, the, the real, the real hardcore enthusiasts that truly have a deep love of nature and they've given these people, this, this platform and giving these people this, this way to communicate these ideas. I think the, the millions and millions of people that have listened to you guys, it's changed perception. And I think that that perception is, there's a ripple effect and that perception is going to lead people to maybe read your book, um, or you know, read maybe Rinella, his book, meat eater or maybe listen to some of these books on tape or maybe, you know, look into Aldo leopold or looking to some of these people that have really been these huge figures in conservation and the love of wildlife and hunting. And they'll get a different understanding of it than people have had because of movies like that split movie where the hunters or purse,

Speaker 1:          01:49:19       yeah, the trade is a child molester. It's like it right now, you know that you said hunting was dying or you know the one that was the fear and now they're like in my instagram page is 20 year old guys, you know, that are our intuit and our, our buying bows and the bell rack back home is packed and you know, eva shockey and I will do appearances and we have a line that goes for hours, you know, young girls waiting for her, cause she's a, you know, and

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       her book coming out, taking aim as about that lifestyle. So I mean I feel like we're sort of turning the corner maybe a little bit and so we just keep that momentum going. I think for sure it's turning the corner. I mean, as far as what I see in the communication that I get with people online, I mean the bowl rock, is it, are they experiencing an up jumping sales? Yeah, I mean winked. Yeah. I mean, Wayne the other day, like, I can't even remember what day it was, but he sold something like 40 bows that day in a day. That's crazy. Yeah. For folks who don't know, that's like 50,000 plus dollars in bows in a day and bows or a specialized thing. It's not, it's not something that people, you know, it's, it's a very, there's a steep learning curve to get involved. You know, like we were talking about it, about if there was a hoyt academy.

Speaker 2:          01:50:37       Yeah. In California, if there's a place to go, there's not a whole lot of places to go. Like when you took Scott Eastwood, you went to that place down in riverside, riverside, our streets. Is that what it was? Yeah. There's a few great places like that, but there's 30 million people here and it might be five of those spots. Yeah. You know, I would love it if hoyt had a place where our, ideally they had more than one place. You know, where people could go and you would get fitted. They would find out what's your proper draw length. You know what, how, you know, what weight should you start at? What weight arrows should just start at. Someone can teach you how, what the proper form is, how to release an arrow correctly and really understand. But just, I mean, even if there's someone never wants to hunt, just understand the, the meditative and beautiful effect of just launching an Arrow at a target and have it hit that x, the witchery of archery, which re yeah. Is At witchery. That's a book. Oh really? Or the witchcraft of our county or zen and the art of archery is a great book. It's a book the witchcraft of archery. Cause it looked that up. Hmm. I'm almost positive. I read it. Really.

Speaker 2:          01:51:48       Jamie, come on. Help me out. You're leaving me hanging. I definitely craft of archery. Is it? No. Uh, yes. Nope. Yes. Come on. It's probably a only one copy guy handed to look at. I wrote this. Oh, you don't believe him? Wow. It witchcraft of archery. Here we go. Which craft of our tree, which craft posts? Archery. This is not looking good registry. Which Klaff page pagan, which splits in the which I'll work. Hmm. Um, not looking good. The witchcraft of archers according to the famous thing like that. All right, interesting. Okay. Does, can we edit this part out? Nope. Just kidding. The sorcery of archery. Yeah, it's fun. It's a beautiful discipline. I mean even if someone never choose, and honestly if

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       you really want to get into hunting, just straight up hunting, he'd probably just start with a rifle anyway. It's a far easier way to do it. No, no, don't say that. Or wear earplugs. If you do do it, you don't want to blow your ears out for sure. Another problem that I'm running into is a lot of people have been hunting for a good portion, a portion of their life have bad hearing. I know my ears ring all the time for when I rifle hunted. That's crazy. And it was just a kid cause I used to go shoot my 300 winchester magnum up at the rock pit bull. I mean that's thing was so loud. I used to love shooting and I was like, Oh, you're a pussy if you weren't. I mean, nobody wore here re hearing protection. Not Crazy. It's just like nobody wore bike helmets either. You know what I mean? Right. So it's the same type of thing. But now my ears, this ring all the time. Yeah, all the time. It shows you tasted music. That's why. Why Toy? Listen to some of your instagram stories. Listen to the music. You're listening with Jesus Christ now than it was raining when your ears are ringing. Sounds better.

Speaker 1:          01:53:42       What? The country or the rapper? Oh No, the RAF is good. Me and Adam, listen, we drove, drove to Sydney for two hours. I think we listen to a Kendrick Lamar, uh, his new song like probably 20 times. Wow. In a row. Yes. Did you guys like seeing the words along? It looks a word window if we still don't really even know words. Did you say the sing along with the n word or do you guys get silent during that part? It just kind of does. It's a funny thing, man. With white people. Like what are we supposed to do it? What are we supposed to do when it gets to that part of the song? It's called be humble. Be Humble. No, that's a song. Oh yeah. Humboldt and then be humbled to when the n word comes up, just cause that realize it's actually be humble bitch.

Speaker 1:          01:54:33       Be Humble. Oh really? Yeah. It's a good one. That's a mixed message. Do you know that one? Jamie? I was going to ask you, how'd they like that new album went down in Australia with the Kendrick will? Yeah. He know about it until you brought it up to him. Well, you know, he made fun of me. I always put in my instance, my music on the instant story. Rap a lot. No, a lot of rap though. Yeah. And country. That's kind of what I listen to. But then he had this song, I'm like, okay, Hey, where the hell do you think you learned a song from? From me. And what did he say? I don't know. Made something out. Yeah. Who probably lied. Are there any Australian wrappers? I think there are. I did not. Not that anybody knows, but I, I remember they had, we had the radio on down there and they, there was some rap on there that had no idea what it was. So it has to be from there. Well there's so many different rappers now though. There's no way you could know all that stuff. It's like we've reached a weird saturation point with music where there is no god. I mean every year that coming out with new music. Yeah, I know. But I mean you get used to the certain sounds or certain styles. And this was like something I had never. I've, I've listened to a lot. I was in Brazil.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       You were in Brazil with me. Yeah. Uh, but one time when I was in Brussels, listen to some rap music, some Brazilian rap, I was like, this is bad ass. Yeah. I hope what they're saying isn't stupid cause it's, I don't understand Portuguese, but it sounds bad ass. Yeah. It's a great, I think it would be great to work out too. Yeah. You don't know what it's not as distracting, right? Like if their lyrics are corny. Yeah. Yeah. I Dunno. I Dunno, but I think there is Australian rap, but it's not Kendrick Lamar. Be Humble. Eylea oh, right now my dig is Elliot. She's from, she's from Australia. She's white, white privilege. Black people over there. They do. Right. But my ex pats, American expats sneak over there. Yeah, I'm not sure. Okay. That's one of the few places I would live outside of America. Like if the shit hit, that's nice there.

Speaker 2:          01:56:39       Canada and Australia. Those are my spots. Yeah, it's cool. I mean Sydney traffic is ridiculous while they fucking drive on the wrong side of the road. They're all confused. Yeah. That's on the left. Like what are you doing over here or over there? Go over there. Let's switch this around everybody. That's probably why it's all messed up. Like look, the roads are in place. Everything. They got roads in the right spot. Traveling the inside. Yeah. Simple fix. Yeah, we'll fix. How's Sydney? So traffic filled. I mean how many people live in Sydney? 5 million. Whoa, that's crazy. Yeah. If 5 million. That's crazy. No, it took think of that because there's 30 million people in all of Australia or is it less? I think it's a little less, probably less. Okay. Let's say it's 20 million, so it's, that would be like if there was 75 million in Los Angeles. Yeah, no more centered and more than that.

Speaker 2:          01:57:34       It'd be more be like 80 million, 80 million people just in Los Angeles. Yeah. There's only like, like a few big city. I mean Melbourne or, I probably said it wrong. 23.7 million in all of Australia to five or in Sydney. Jesus Christ. That's crazy. 25% of the entire population. It's a beautiful city though. I love it. Sydney is really awesome. Yeah, no, it's great. It's just, we were going to go to the boat shop and I said, you know, I go to the butcher shops in Sydney, right? He's like, yeah. I said, how long's it gonna take to get there? So we did it on the map quest sang or whatever, an hour. That's like I said, this is like La. This sucks hours in the same city. I didn't expect that. Everything is fine. You don't have to worry about shit up there. You've got two lane roads and there's no cars.

Speaker 2:          01:58:23       If you don't make it through one traffic light cycle, you're like, what the hell is going on? Wait, this is bull shit. Yeah. Well you get used to a place like that man. You know, and he life, it's nice and calm and it feels different. Like life feels different in a small town. It's like there's a, I feel like, and this is some woo woo spiritual bullshit that I have no, uh, no science behind whatsoever. But I feel like people give off energy and I feel like cities, whether or not something's happening or not, the amount of humans in there, there's a certain amount of energy that you feel and when you're in a smaller town, you're calmer. Yeah. I really believe that. I feel like there's less, and I don't think it's just the activity, just this cars. And I think it's the actual amount of humans in an area. Like there's some sort of a psychic energy that they give off. You're not, Jamie's not buying it either. Maybe the which we have our tree. Ha Ha. Maurice Thompson. I knew it. I had that book. He teen 78. Wow. What is witchery? Is that a real word I told you I was right. You were right. I've redeemed five out of five stars in Barnes and noble, but it's a good book. Wow. So it's in Barnes and noble. Yes. Um, can I get it on a kindle finder if I can get it on kindle?

Speaker 2:          01:59:45       Yeah. Witchery of archery. It's speaking of a whole different, um, I dunno what you just said, but I'm going to be it. I'll be in Iq. Look cubicle tomorrow. No, you want it. You've got to quit that job, dude today. Yeah. Should I just call right now? Let me call for you. Oh yeah. You're my manager and your manager, Kendall. Nice. Five 99. I'm getting it. Thank you. Thank you. On Jamie, the witchery of archery and if my fucking kindle and I tried to enter it in, he's like, nope, nothing exists. I'm like, listen bitch, I've already gone through this. All right. Yeah. It's so crazy that you keep a full time job. It's just a, I don't understand how you do it. And that's also where a lot of people that get involved in hunting, the amount of time that it takes, like people don't have the time.

Speaker 2:          02:00:28       Like I was, I was listening to Jason Carter on some podcasts who's talking about pursuing one individual buck for like two weeks and I was like, Oh fuck is two weeks ago after one animal. Like this is crazy. Who's got that kind of time only like a real, like crazy before people pro type character. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. It takes time. I mean, it's just, even just the dedication to, to regular practice takes time for archery, but that's the next level. There is no mean archery is, uh, it's, it really is. In terms of hunting, it really is the ultimate pursuit, the ultimate in difficulty. But that's what I stopped at the compound thing. People go to troy, traditional archery component or truce for pussies settled down. Yeah. And that was enough fiber kill killer with a rock. How about you kill it with a rock layer?

Speaker 2:          02:01:19       Cake person did. Oh, you wearing shoes. Pussy. I always wanted to wear shoes. I always want to drink. Yeah, I know. I always wondered how anybody would kill it. The recurve where I was hunting, because I said my 245 feet per second bolus slow. Right. That'd be super fast for a traditional bow. Oh yeah. So I mean, I could imagine with this deer, they'd just, I dunno. It'd be very tough. Very tough here. You probably could. Oh wait, you didn't know you were there. Yeah. Yeah. But it sounds like the area you were in, they were very unnaturally hyped up, like unnaturally wired because there've been hunted by so many people think they're just normally wired, but when people kill them is when they're writing. Um, you know, so you're distracted because there it's a breeding season. Yeah. So this is post Rut. Those bucks are not even with dose at all. And there, you know, just, just tuned in. But during the ride it would, it would be easier just be like hunting elk during the road as opposed to not, or honey you do to the club with a boner. Right. People get distracted. I've never hunted a dude with a button. I'm glad. I'm glad to hear that. I was wondering. I have questions and sometimes I get, I beat around the Bush to get to the answer all I got. I got what you're doing right then.

Speaker 2:          02:02:35       Yeah, it is this, this, it's funny how these different animals have like different seasons that they come into. Like the idea that only one time a year they breed, like there are a mammal. It's not like a dog. Like dogs want to fuck all the time, but like deer one time a year. Yeah. Everything starts on hop in. Nature says, listen, this is how it works. You want to have a baby in the spring. It's a way to do this. You gotta do it in the fall. Yeah. Okay. In the fall you got to get cracking and then she's got take some time to cook up that baby and dropped that baby in the spring. And then, but it's bizarre. Yeah. There's actually some bucks that were, they call it croaking, which is grunting cause um, they weren't really the full Rut, but some doughs that didn't get bread the first season.

Speaker 2:          02:03:21       If they don't get bread, they come back into heat. They, we call them second cycle dose. They were coming in. So the bucks, I mean they'll, they'll do it whenever they just got to wait for the female. So the bucks were actually still sort of writing a little bit. We heard some croaking so that was full on. No, there's just a few doughs that hadn't been bred. Well that's one of the coolest things about elk hunting. There's nothing like the Rut when you hear elk screaming. Like if the people have never experienced that before, even if you have no desire to hunt, please go to a place where elk live during the Rut. Just to hear it. Cause it is insane. So wild. Yeah, there is so loud and the sound sounds like something from the Lord of the rings. Yeah. It doesn't even seem real.

Speaker 2:          02:04:03       And you're going to be in Utah this year. Ooh. Yay. Remember that? I'm very excited. Yeah. Well, we're definitely going to film some stuff there. We're definitely going to film some stuff. We'll do some instagram stories. We'll, we'll, we'll definitely get some footage and we're definitely, and when we got some footage from last year when you and I were into hone ranch that I put up on Instagram, some elk screaming, we we're pretty far away or a couple of hundred yards away and it's wide open. Whereas Utah's a little bit more wooded and we'll try to get a little bit closer. Yeah, those bulls will be coming close. I'm very excited. I can't wait either. I can't wait just to see you. I can't wait. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, thanks for introducing me to this man. It's changed my life. Really has. It's been, it's been great to share it with you and, and it's been great to have you on to share it with other people and just share not just that, but your entire disciplined approach to this whole lifestyle that you live.

Speaker 2:          02:04:57       I think it's very inspiring to people and think it's very important. And, uh, you're a, you're a shining beacon out there, cameron Hanes, so keep, keep hammering as it were. And your podcast, keep hammering. You've got a new episode that you just gave to Jamie, so it'll be up today. Jamie's gonna post it today. Young Jamie is on the ball. Yes, our ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back at 1:30 PM with Jordan Peterson and a, I'm fixing to go check out the new studio we got. We're signing the lease today, folks. So popping. I'm very excited. I'm going to show camp too, so we'll be back soon. And uh,

Speaker 6:          02:05:31       yeah, that's it. See you soon.
