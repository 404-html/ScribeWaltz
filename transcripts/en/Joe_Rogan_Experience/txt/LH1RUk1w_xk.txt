Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Three, two,

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       boom. We're live.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       How are you sir? I'm very good, Joe. It's good to meet you, man. Great to meet you and thank you very much for doing this. I've learned more about coyotes over the last couple of months reading your book and listening to your podcast with my good friend Steve Rinella, which was amazing. Whew. What a crazy animal that is. You know, I have coyotes all around my neighborhood and uh, it became a very, very close to me when I saw one of my chickens get captured by a coyote and I watched him hop the fence with a chicken in his mouth, like God damn as motherfuckers and just all around us especially. I live in a fairly rural area around here. I'm about 40 minutes outside of La, so it's, you know, the nights are quiet and you hear him screaming in the night and I didn't know much about them until I started reading your book, man.

Speaker 2:          00:00:56       Yeah, they're amazing animal. I mean, I think, uh, there's not really another mammal side from us that has a biography like these animals do and that's kind of one of the reasons I got fascinated with them. Uh, they were doing the same thing around me when I was a kid growing up in Louisiana. I mean, and that's sort of the beginning of my, uh, my getting captivated by these little small wolves because they were suddenly showing up in the bayous and swamps of Louisiana when I was 12, 13, 14 years old. And as far as I knew this was an animal that was supposed to be in the deserts of the West. And so that seemed to be something that, you know, commanded one's attention that this critter is, is appearing in places where you would never expect it. And now of course everybody in the country is dealing with them.

Speaker 2:          00:01:53       That is so fascinating that in our lifetime they have spread from the American southwest to every single state and literally every single city in the country. Yeah, that's true. And I just got A. Somebody sent me this yesterday, that somewhere in Georgia they have some sort of a bounty on these wolves. Coyotes. That's one thing a lot of people don't realize that a coyote is a wolf. Yeah, it's a, it's a separate species from gray wolves and red wolves, but it's out of the North American wolf line. Uh, I mean, coyotes are distinctive, laid North American animals. They come out of Canada evolution that began here five point 3 million years ago. So, um, yeah, they're, they're small wolves. And I sent you this, Jamie know, you found it beautiful. This is the Georgia coyote challenge. Apparently they're offering some sort of bounty for each coyote killed. Now what's fascinating about this, and one of the things that I learned from your book is that when a coyote yells, when they're doing their call in the night, they're essentially making roll call and when of them doesn't

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       respond, the female generates more pups. Yeah. It's, it's one of the, you know, one of the many things that's probably happening when they're, when they're howling, I mean they are taking a census basically of coyote populations in the area. And the result of, of that census can very well be, it produces some sort of a chemical or metabolic change in, in the females, the breeding females, the Alpha ones, and they end up oftentimes having larger litters of pumps, which is why something like this, you know, I was just in South Carolina two weeks ago and there was a lot of conversation about this, this Georgia bounty because in South Carolina it's another place where coyotes are, are fairly new. I've only been there in the last 20 or 25 years. They were arguing that, you know, and they had some pretty good science that coyotes are taking, you know, in some areas as many as 60 percent of the white tail deer fawns.

Speaker 3:          00:04:05       And so the hunters are screaming along a lot about this because it means it's getting harder to take a white tail. Um, so South Carolina hasn't moved to the step that Georgia has of trying to impose some kind of bounty and encourage people to go out and shoot these animals, uh, to take them in any way they can, but mostly shoot them. Uh, but, you know, I think the states in the south and in the east have a lot to learn by the western or from the Western experience because the truth is we've been trying to eradicate and I mean totally exterminate coyotes in the American west. Uh, we spent the years from about Nineteen 15 through about 1972 in an all out war attempting to exterminate them. And the only result of that, uh, as a result of their particular kinds of adaptations in their evolution in North America, uh, is that we spread them across the entire country.

Speaker 3:          00:05:11       We not only spread them across the entire country, I mean they're in every state. They colonize their 49th state, Delaware in 2010. So the only state, they're not in his Hawaii just because they have a stowed away and made it across the Pacific yet. And uh, you know, I mean if they do, you can imagine those endangered Naynay's on the big island are totally done for. But they are not only at every single state in the union except for awhile, but they are 7,000 miles now, north and south and North America from above the Arctic circle all the way down to Central America and beginning to colonize into South America. So the attempts to exterminate them, I mean I can explain how this, why this happens, has to do with their evolution in the particular adaptations they have, but the attempts to exterminate them or even to try to control their numbers almost always produces exactly the opposite effect.

Speaker 3:          00:06:08       So Georgia is going to end up with more coyotes than they've ever had before in their efforts to try to suppress their population. Isn't that fascinating? And it is. It's so contrary to logic and what you would think would be the solution for something like that. I mean, and when you go back to the American west, before the reintroduction of wolves into yellowstone in the 19 nineties, we had essentially extirpated them from a vast majority of the United States. There's very, very few left, right? That's true. And the, we'll see if he could believe, explained the relationship that the gray wolves had to the coyotes, which is one of the reasons that the coyotes became so adaptable. It's true. I mean, they didn't. Coyotes didn't become so smart, you know, and in the southwest, the Hispanics say the only thing that's smarter than a coyote is God, but they didn't become that smart and that adept, that surviving anything almost that happens to them.

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       Um, because of us, I mean, we've only been trying to wipe them out or control their populations for a little more than a century nouse. And that's too short a time for them to evolve these abilities to adapt and survive. They, they evolved those abilities because they were the small dog and a big dog's world. And I mean gray wolves have this very interesting story to gray wolves come out of North American kainate evolution, but they're one of the Canaan species that ended up leaving North America for a time and evolving for a couple of million years in Asia and in Europe. And they didn't come back. A gray wolves didn't start coming back to North America till about 25 or 30,000 years ago during sort of the height of the late pleistocene and when they did, coyote is of course had been here and had evolved into their present species about 800,000 to a million years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:08:09       And when gray wolves returned, I mean they basically just started kicking the crap out of coyotes. And so coyotes evolve their ability to survive being harassed and persecuted as a result of being a basically harassed by gray wolves. So this is why when you hear about the Coi Wolf that you hear on the east coast, this is a, a coyote that bread with the red wolf and, and other eastern wolves, correct? That's correct. Yeah. And that's, I mean, it's a very interesting story and it's kind of one of those instances where a modern event that we're all getting to witness the emergence of the Coi. Wolf has its origins in the evolution of mammals in North America, a million years or more because the raisin, I mean, if you think about this, the reason coyotes, red wolves and other eastern wolves like the Algonquin Wolf, uh, in eastern Canada and, and northern New England, the reason those animals can all hybrid eyes and readily do, I mean they, there are no behavioral barriers at all to them breeding with one another.

Speaker 3:          00:09:25       And so whenever a coyote shows up, um, and it's in the vicinity of a, an Algonquin Wolf, say a female that comes into heat, I mean, she'll readily pick a coyote as a mate. But the reason they do that is because those animals, red wolves, eastern wolves of various kinds and coyotes all seemed to have come out of a group of animals that unlike the gray wolf never left North America and they probably didn't separate from one another until 300,000 to a half million years ago. So that separation is recent enough that whenever they encounter one enough with one another today, they very readily hybridize. I mean, it's sort of the result of coyote spreading across the south has essentially kind of killed our hope that we were going to save the endangered red wolf as an independent species because red wolf so quickly and easily hybridized with coyotes that coyote genes swamp pure red wolf jeans.

Speaker 3:          00:10:29       So I mean that's something that you know, is millions of years or hundreds of thousands of years old and evolution, but we're getting to see it play out right around us in our own time. And meanwhile, gray wolves and coyotes in the West aren't hybridizing it all. And so that's the explanation is that gray wolves left and didn't come back until why left? Well, they, they just, they happen to be in evolutionary terms. One of the groups and jackals did the same thing that they ended up leaving North America and in their absence, while they were in another part of the world, they evolved into the present subspecies. We've got four subspecies of gray wolves in North America, all of which seemed to have come back to North America by the way, at different times. So they had sort of separate migrations back to North America. So the Mexican Gray Wolf, uh, the, the western gray wolf, the Arctic Wolf, these are all gray wolf species, but they're separated at the sub specific level and they all seem to have come back to North America at different times.

Speaker 3:          00:11:39       But they, they had left North America like about three and a half million years ago. And so they became different animals in Asia and Europe by the time they came back then they were different enough from coyotes that they not only couldn't interbreed with them anymore, but they sort of are mortal enemies of one another. I mean, when we reintroduced wolves to yellowstone in 1995, coyotes had, had 75 years in yellowstone without any wolves. I mean, and that served as a wonderful laboratory to study them too because it gave us a sense of what happens with coyotes when nobody is harassing them when people are harassing him, which of course we didn't in yellowstone park and when wolves aren't harassing them either. And what we realize is that they create these really stable territory's. They create very stable packs and their population rises to a particular point, the carrying capacity of the landscape based on what they eat, which is mostly rodents and rabbits and things and some fruit and berries, but it doesn't.

Speaker 3:          00:12:46       They don't. Their population sort of levels off and stays at a carrying capacity. And so we got to watch that happen in yellowstone for like 75 years and it's become sort of the, the example of what would happen if we just left them alone. I mean some people think, well, if we don't try to control them how they're gonna, you know, they're just going to be millions upon millions of them running everywhere, but that's actually. They only do that when you try to persecute them and they go into this colonization mode and generate more and more and more pups and have more and more pups survive. So yellowstone in that period from 19, 25 to 1995 was this sort of model of what happens when you just leave them the hell alone and they just kind of rise to a particular population level and are really stable at that level.

Speaker 3:          00:13:44       And uh, and don't really go beyond it and they don't expand their territory that we either know. They don't seem to. I mean, one of the things that has happened obviously in the last a hundred years or so last 75 years at least, is that as a result of persecuting them, we've sent them into this kind of colonization strategy where they, they have larger litter of pups when their populations are suppressed, it's easier for them to get the pumps that they do have to adulthood. I mean in yellowstone for example, one of the things we saw in that period when they weren't being harassed in the 60 seventies, eighties is that they would have a litter of five or six pups and they could only get a couple of them to adulthood. But whenever you try to control their populations and momentarily suppressed their populations, I mean, the result is that there's no more food for coyotes out there for the coyotes that, that have survived.

Speaker 3:          00:14:46       And that makes it possible for them to have a litter of seven or eight pups and get six to seven of them to adulthood. And then they have this, this marvelous ability, I mean, I talk about it a good bit in the book, it's called fish and fusion there, one of the few species and we happened to be one of the other mammal species around the world that does this, where they have the ability to exist as a social animal and a case of coyotes as a pack animal of course. But whenever they're pressured, they tend to split apart into singles and pairs and they scatter across the landscape and that's what sends them colonizing across the continent. The fact that they can do that is what separates them really from wolves. Right. And that's why they weren't able to wipe them out in the west.

Speaker 3:          00:15:38       Yeah, that's exactly what I mean. If you think about what happened with gray wolves, I mean we started, uh, the sort of in a decided effort to eliminate gray wolves from the American West in roughly. I mean, we started just ordinary people started putting out strychnine bait for them in the 18, 16 and 18 seventies. But was it ranchers at first it started that it was it because of livestock? Yeah, it was ranchers and just travelers on the Oregon trail, on the emigrant trails. I mean people sort of regarded because they came out of Europe with a background with wolves. I mean, that's, that's one of the things that distinguishes us Americans and coyotes is that we didn't have coyotes in Europe, so we didn't arrive with this preloaded preconception about the role that [inaudible] played in the world, but we did with animals like bears and wolves.

Speaker 3:          00:16:34       And so people just from the very beginning, whenever the Atlantic seaboard was settled, uh, there were wolf drives and wolf roundups and every kind of attempt to wipe out wolves as competitors with us, for our stock. So in the west, people just through strychnine bait out, let me. Strychnine was invented in Pennsylvania in 18, 48 and it was widely available, uh, in places like Missouri when you set out across the West and people would just buy a bunch of baits. I mean they would, if they hung around long enough to get the animal, they would skin it and try to sell the pill, but they just poisoned them like crazy. Then in starting in Nineteen 15, this government agency called the bureau of biological survey, which positions itself as the solution to predators first decides that it's the wolf that we need to take out and I mean they managed to take out the the last probably quarter million wolves in the West in the space of a little more than a decade and they do it as you just mentioned, primarily because wolves are such pack animals, so pack oriented that if you could kill our trap one member of a pack, you could use the scent from that animal and ended up catching every single animal in the pack, but coyotes responded to that kind of pressure in a very different way.

Speaker 3:          00:18:11       I mean, when you started pressuring them, they tended, their packs tended to break up. They tended to scatter and go into this fish mode and so indeed, as you said a minute ago, that's exactly why we were able to take out wolves. By the middle of the 19 twenties, we pretty much had resolved the wolf issue in the west, but year after year after year as wolf numbers a decline. I mean, I'll offer an example in Montana, for instance, 18, 99, the State of Montana boundaried 23,000 wolves. I was 18, 99, 21 years later by 1920. They only paid bounties on 17 gray wolves because they had basically wiped them out and then the government agency, the biological survey came in and cleaned up all the rest of them, but every year from 1899 slash 19 slash 21 and right on into the 19 thirties in Montana, they were bouncing 30,000 coyotes in 18, 99 and 1910.

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       30,000 coyotes and 1918, 33,000 coyotes. I mean the number of coyotes never dropped while wolf populations just plummeted. Data is so fascinating. What a crazy little animal that is. It is. It's a. it's so wonderfully counterintuitive in the whole kind of environmental story of America because what you always expect is that anytime we put our mind to taking on some creature and, and taking it out, I mean we can do it. I mean, you know, the only time this never really happened was in Moby Dick where captain Ahab is driven mad by his inability to control the great white whale and the control of nature and that in a lot of places that seems to be where we, we land when people realized that you can't do anything about coyotes, it Kinda drives people out of their minds because this is just not the American way.

Speaker 3:          00:20:15       We can always deal with an animal. Yeah, it is a, it's got to be very frustrating to people and a lot of ways, but it's, it's kind of amazing. I mean, it's really kind of magical and a lot of ways that, that they're so, they're so adaptable and that all came, you're saying because of their relationship with the gray wolf. Now how do we know that the gray wolf left? Well, we know that they're still wolves in America. Uh, there's no question about that. And so, I mean, that is a tricky question. I mean, there is a, you know, so I would hasten to say, first of all, I'm not a geneticist. I'm not even a biologist. I'm basically an environmental writer and somebody who uses history a lot, um, and there is unresolved science out there and buy what I mean. What I mean by that is that there are a couple of different camps that have advanced positions about the relationship between all these different wolves that we have in North America and coyotes. So there is a guy at Ucla, I'm here in Los Angeles. Uh, his name was Robert Wayne, uh, and he has done a genetic work on chain [inaudible]. I'm, one of his papers is called, uh, uh, the title includes the phrase and Magmatic Wolf, like Canids, and he's done the genetic analysis on coyotes, red wolves, gray wolves, and eastern wolves. And his argument is that

Speaker 3:          00:22:02       gray wolves, red wolves, and eastern wolves are all actually some version of gray wolves. So that's a different argument than the one that I made for you just a few minutes ago. I've been following, and I've followed in my book because I found it a more compelling argument, one advanced by a group of geneticists from Canada, led by a guy named Paul Wilson. And that's the, that's the position that the US fish and wildlife service and it's endangered species division takes. And their argument is that the gray wolf is a separate animal from the Red Wolf, the eastern wolf, and the coyote, they, they argue that coyotes, red wolves, and eastern wolves all come out of a clade, the biological term, c, c, l a, d, e, a clade of animals that are purely North American in origin. And that had a, probably a similar ancestor as recently as maybe 300,000 years to 500,000 years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:23:11       So we've got two different arguments about the relationship of coyotes to two worlds and I don't know who's going to win it, but one of the reasons I tend to sort of favor the, the Paul Wilson Line of argument and the one that the US fish and wildlife service is using is because they use some, they use evidence beyond just genetics. They also use morphology and they use fossils. Uh, and uh, Robert Wayne and the group, a geneticists who work with him all seemed just rely specifically on genetics. And they don't ever try to verify there findings by looking at the fossil record, for example. Um, so I don't know how it's going to play out between these two groups, but I find the argument, the Canadian geneticists that has informed the US fish and wildlife services strategy a little bit more compelling right now. But I mean, it's something to pay attention to.

Speaker 3:          00:24:13       We'll see how it goes. Well, it seems like you, you need some sort of a really comprehensive way of looking at it because you're dealing with so many different factors, right? If you're trying to acquire evidence based on 25,000 years ago, it seems like there's got to be a lot of different ways. It just, it's very odd to me that we know as much as we do. No, I mean in to try to figure it all out as got to be incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with so little evidence and you're looking at the fossil record. I mean a lot of the animals that die 25,000 years ago, there's zero evidence of them, right? Yeah, that's right. I mean, a 25,000 years ago, for example, and the light pleistocene, uh, the evidence from labrea tar pit indicates that coyotes were a slightly different animal than they are now.

Speaker 3:          00:25:01       They were, uh, at the time we think gray wolves were coming back into North America, returning to their evolutionary homeland. Coyotes were much bigger, more strapping, had larger dentition, stronger jaws. And what looks like happened is when gray wolves arrived in the west and began competing with these larger, more strapping coyotes, coyotes sort of sought a different path. They, they sort of stepped back away from outright competition with an even bigger Canaan and evolved into a smaller, more grass. I'll animal that was not so much just a pure Predator and scavenger, but more omnivorous and so became our modern canus, lutron's species. But yeah, it's a. and I was, we'll say, you know, as you mentioned a minute ago, I mean, it's hard to know all of this. Much of this information is fairly recent. I mean, we just got a kind of a reappraisal of the taxonomy of the North American wolves essentially in the last seven or eight or 10 years.

Speaker 3:          00:26:13       Our other wolves omnivorous, or is it just coyotes? Well, wolves can be omnivorous, but they're, they're pretty much really a carnivorous pack. Predators. I find coyote crap in my yard all the time and it's got berries in it. Oh yeah. Yeah. Like they eat a lot of these little red berries that grow out here. Yeah. They, they eat juniper's. I mean, the same thing is happening at all. My place in New Mexico starting essentially about in August or September, all the coyote droppings that I've found on the place. I mean, and I've got a lot of coyotes on my place in New Mexico, uh, has just been filled with juniper berries. That's what they've been eating. I mean they, they still are, you know, running down rabbits and eating rats and mice and things. But I mean, when they move into cities, they tend to eat and they have access to fruit trees.

Speaker 3:          00:27:04       They tend to eat a lot of fruit. So they'll, I mean, you know, that people have posted photos on the internet or youtube videos that show them plucking apples and peaches and things off trees in their backyards and they really go for that sort of stuff. So bizarre. It was just such a strange animal. And so do we know if wolves do anything like that or is it just a coyote characteristic? It's pretty much a coyote characteristic. I mean, you know, as, as we've been saying, the coyote in an evolutionary sense is a, a small wolf. Um, but it is different, especially from gray wolves. And one of the ways it's different, uh, that the biologist and the behavioralists who have watched coyotes interact with one another and watch gray wolves interact with one another, is an indication of how much more pack oriented Hanse sort of predatory carnivorous wolves are wolves because they exist mostly as despite our, in our cultural motif of the lone wolf.

Speaker 3:          00:28:17       Actually, wolves are such pack animals that they have a much wider range of expressions that they convey to one another in their interactions with one another. And they, uh, they basically will sort of engage with one another and a repertoire of grimaces and grands and showing their teeth are curling their lip. Of course, all sorts of body language were they curl their tails under a and they'll drop their heads and drop her ears. Coyotes have a similar repertoire, but it's a much more limited one. And the argument that the behavioralists make is that that's an indication of an animal that's not so packed oriented. It's not living exclusively in a social group. It can go off on its own or as a pair and therefore doesn't really need all those facial expressions to convey emotion. So how do we know that that all these animals, all these canids evolved in North America and then spread out and went to Asia and Africa and all these different places?

Speaker 3:          00:29:29       Well, that's out of the fossil record. Um, and I mean there's a, there's a good science in the fossil record of candidate evolution. As I said a bit ago. It seems to go back to about five point 3 million years ago. And all the cane is all around the world seem to have come out of this, this singular origin much the way all the primates of the world came out of an origin in Africa. And so, you know, and the horses, for instance, same thing, horses came out of an evolutionary origin in North America and then spread across the land bridges to become zebras in Africa for instance. And so that's how it happened. And uh, some of these, these animals like jackals for example, the golden jackals seemed to have separated from the small chain Id, the coyote, the line that led to coyote is about a million years ago and it crossed the land bridge into Africa, Southern Europe, parts of Asia, and became an animal that never returned in North America. And because of its separation from coyotes by a million years, it became a, a different creature. So crazy. They all did that on foot. Yeah, they did it somehow know that

Speaker 2:          00:30:51       the animal came from North America and made it all the way to Africa. And I want to bring something up that you talked about just now. The horses evolved in North America and became zebras. Yeah, I mean all that started here, but then they weren't here anymore and then they were reintroduced to the native Americans by the Europeans. And what happened to the horses that were here?

Speaker 3:          00:31:15       Well, that's one of the great mysteries of a North American evolution, actually, I, a frank answer is we don't really know what happened to them. And so this is, um, you know, maybe somebody out there listening, Joe in the next 10 or 15 years, we'll solve it. It will solve this problem because here we have a group of animals whose evolutionary. I'm in case of the horse. They're evolutionary origins. Go back 56 million years in North America, so 10 times a greater depth and time than, than the canids do. And so they're here in all sorts of forms. Everyone has heard, you know, the three toed horse, I'm a Eo. Hipaa says what it's called now that gradually becomes bigger and, uh, it's hooves fused together and they become hardened because it's running over rocky ground. And so it has to have hard hooves. And because it begins to, it starts as a browsing animal in the forest and ultimately becomes a grassland animal and it's eating grasses that are often coated with windblown sand.

Speaker 3:          00:32:31       So it has to evolve very strong and hard and namel and on its teeth in order resists having its being eroded down by San. It becomes ultimately by 15, 20,000 years ago, an animal that we would not be able to tell a would be any different from a modern horse. It would look exactly like a modern horse, same size. I mean I've seen skeletons of some of the horses that were in North America down to about 11,000 years ago. And even the paleontologists would have a hard time telling, which was the skeleton of a North American Horse Inn, which was the skeleton of a modern domestic horse. But these animals had had traveled across the land, bridges the bering land bridge when it was open and had ended up in Asia and Africa and Europe where they survived. But for some bizarre reason, sometime between about 10,000 years ago and 8,000 years ago and North America, they disappeared.

Speaker 3:          00:33:33       They completely went extinct in North America and so when we Europeans returned them to North America 500 years ago, one of the reasons they become such a success and just spread across the western part of the continent and multiply into the millions is because they're already pre adapted to the landscape. This is where they had evolved. And so they've already got the hooves. They've got the teeth, they've got the running ability that he got the bill to buck off predators and they get back here in North America and within the space of about a, after they get loose from the Pueblo revolt in 1680, within the space of about 50 to 60 or 70 years. They're all the way up into Canada. Uh, and there are within 100 years, probably as many as 2 million of them spreading across the West reinhabiting their own ecological niche. They just fit like a glove, fit like a glove man.

Speaker 3:          00:34:34       And um, you know, and they became an. It's a fascinating thing to kind of imagine because the West 10, 15, 25,000 years ago had been a place where horses had made up and some parts of the West as much of as a third of the biomass of all the grazing animals and in the 17 hundreds and 18 hundreds, they were doing the same thing again. They were multiplying into the hundreds of thousands. The millions gradually spreading New Mexico is where the domestic European horse got loose and began to spread and they had reached all the way up into Montana, Wyoming into into the edges of Canada by 18, 50, 18, 60 or so, and had probably were at least two to 3 million of them at that point. So they were just reinhabiting there. Oh, landscape and fitting into an ecology now that had been dominated by bison for a long time and now horses are back in the mix.

Speaker 3:          00:35:44       And horses today are very controversial animal. Wild horses are in, you know, people trying to think of him as an invasive species, but essentially they're just a reintroduce species. And because of that, there's a lot of controversy on how they should be dealt with. Like some people want to deal with them, like almost like they deal with wild pigs. Yeah, right. Uh, yeah. And so, you know, there are plenty of people out there who, who argue that the domestic horse, the feral horse in the west, which is the root stock of most of our population of wild horses in the West, um, you know, is a, essentially it's a European animal that has become an invader. Um, I mean, I always, and I've had arguments on stage with people who, who, uh, expressed this position. I always say, well, what you have to say about the horse, first of all is that a, it's a, it's an American animal with an asterisk.

Speaker 3:          00:36:46       It's gone for about eight or 9,000 years. That's actually not a huge amount of time in evolutionary terms. And even though we did domesticate them and began to produce some breeds, horses left to their own devices pretty quickly breed back to the wild look and the wild state. I mean, they'll acquire those dorsal stripes down their backs. And Zebra striping on their legs. And so zebra striping. Oh yeah. No, absolutely. Well, is that. There's a lot of controversy as to what the Zebra striping is for. Right? Is it to distract predators of the idea behind it? It may have been that, you know, I'm, I'm not quite sure I can say whether the Zebra striping evolved for a specific, a specific reason. Although most changes and animals do, but yeah, they, they will fairly readily go back to this early wild horse look, which is probably what horses looked like in North America 10,000 years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:37:52       See if you can find some pictures of like wild horses with Zebra stripes. I don't think I've ever seen it. Look, look, that's fascinating. Yeah. Look in the Pryor Mountains, wild horse range in Montana and you'll see a whole population of animals that come out of that, that background. They have a very interesting history because it was a group of animals that Lewis and Clark acquired from the Indians and they were going to take back and trade in the Mandan villages, uh, and a guy named, uh, prior who was responsible for the herd, was driving them through the today's pryor mountains and the crow Indians raided his camp and chased off a bunch of those horses and they're now in those mountains and they, this early, sort of a dorsal back striped zebra leg look that probably came right from the Spanish horses of New Mexico. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:38:48       Uh, up into the northern West. So the, whatever, the mass extinction event that took place somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 years ago that claimed the wooly mammoth, saber tooth tiger, all these different animals. The horse was amongst that as well, is that the horse was one of the ones that disappeared. Yeah. And, uh, you know, so I mean, we've got some pretty good explanations for what happened to the mammoths. You know, the mammas probably a were taken out by human hunters because this, this was a version of the American west that, that basically had emerged in the absence of people, you know, and we're just like every other mammal that you mentioned a minute ago. You were amazed at the fact that the wolves were able to spread around the world and the horses were able to spread around the world. Well, we did the same thing.

Speaker 3:          00:39:37       We started in Africa and we spread around the world getting the Europe about 45,000 years ago and didn't get to North America, which was one of the last places except for the islands out in the Pacific that humans got to until about 15,000 years ago. And so when we arrive, we confronted a landscape that was full of animals, like mammoths that had no experience with human hunters at all. And what we think is that these early arrivals from Siberia, uh, we're probably really accomplished big game hunters. And I mean, like all elephants, mammas had really long gestation periods. It took them once they were impregnated, took them two years to have a calf. Wow. And so they have a really to pregnant for two years. Yeah, they're pregnant for two years and so they have a really low population recovery ability, a biologist call this a case species that have a kind of a low reproductive rate.

Speaker 3:          00:40:39       And so whenever humans arrive and you know, and we take a look at the situation, and I mean cow mammoths evidently were a lot easier to deal with in a hunt then the big bulls were. And so these hunter seemed to have concentrated on cows. I mean that's of course obviously going to be detrimental to the demographics of the population. And so probably in the case of mammoths, it was human hunting of an animal that had no prior experience with human hunters then. And not very many defenses against us that took them out. The other animals that have a lot of them, I mean some of the predators we think they went because of their prey species disappeared. But I mean, the amazing thing with the horses is just hard to fathom because we haven't found very many sites. There was one recently near Boulder, Colorado of what appeared to be on early Indian kill of horses.

Speaker 3:          00:41:40       But you know, if you tried to argue that the same thing happened with horses that happen with the Mammas, she'd think you'd be finding kill sites all over the place. It's not really found them. Have you ever looked into as this one of the animals? So it's got the front paws got a little bit of zero strikes her front legs rather. But you, you're saying it's the back legs? Well, it's both, so I'll look at that. Wow, that's fascinating. Yeah. They had the zebra stripes on the legs and. Oh Wow. That is wild. And they have this black stripe down the back. The dorsal stripe is king. So yeah. Well, I've read something about zebras that they're, um, that it makes it very hard for predators to differentiate between individual zebras and that they had put an ear collar or clip on one of the zebras and immediately that Zebra was taken out and they had singled that zebra out.

Speaker 3:          00:42:33       It was very obvious to the predators that, that was an individual and they went right after it. Yeah. Well, it could be something like that. And I mean it's pretty clear from the North American horses that the Zebra striping trait originated here and then ended up being taken by the animals that migrated into Africa and perhaps elaborated on over time where they're dealing with, with lions and Cheetahs and leopards and things like that. And they handled lion in North America. Yeah. We had lauren time that was even bigger than the African lions, right. Panthera, the step line was a line that was one and a half times the size of, of the African Lion. And we had a, you know, a short face bear that was probably even more ferocious than modern day grizzlies for one thing. It seems to have been a this really gracile animal. It looked far more nimble and fast and its ability to run and so forth.

Speaker 3:          00:43:38       Then Grizzlies do. Yeah. We've talked about that thing many times since I heard you talk about and we pulled up pictures of it and the size of the things and the length of the legs. Yeah, and I looked at. It's a huge animal that's a huge animal, was bigger than a polar bear, so I. there's A. There's a Canadian biologist named hilarious guys who has argued for a long time that he thinks until short faced bears became extinct. Humans were not able to actually colonized North America, that those things were so fearsome that they basically kept Siberian hunters at bay on the other side of the bering land bridge and finally when they began to disappear, then people begin trekking across and getting it in North America. Wow. Well, they look like a monster. I mean, it doesn't even look like a real animal. It looks like something in a movie and then you see the short face and what is that next

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       day it. How do you say that? Don Dale. Don, that's what do they call that? The hell pig? Yeah, that's a, an animal even bigger than the short face bear. So all these animals that existed in North America, when did the short face bear go extinct? The size of that thing. That's terrifying. Yeah. I think probably about, uh, about 14,000, 15,000 years ago and as I said, at least one biologist argues that it's no coincidence that that's about the time that humans began showing up is that once this bear is, has gone, then it makes it possible for people to come into North America because they're a hypothesis as to why that went extinct because of human intervention as well. Now, you know, I think what's happening, uh, in, uh, there's a bunch of pretty wild swings in climate, uh, as a result of the, the steady progression of ice ages and then water called, uh, the Inter pluvial in between the ice ages and the reason we think we have sort of a steady record of ice ages and then a warming period in between and then a return to ice ages.

Speaker 4:          00:45:44       And warming, and that goes back on the record for a very long time, is that the earth actually doesn't spin a and a true, perfect spin on its axis. It has a wobble in it and sometimes when it wobbles, this is called a procession of the equinoxes. Well, it's called the, uh, the milankovitch cycles of a European. Uh, I can't remember if he was a geographer, probably a geographer was the first to speculate that this is why we have this climate history of a procession between ice ages and pluvial is in between, is because the earth wobbles and as it wobbles, it will at certain times position the northern hemisphere farther away from the sun for a period of 30, 40,000 years. And during that wobble and that position, you get a, an ice age. And then the wobble, we'll take it back so that the northern hemisphere begins to point more directly at the sun.

Speaker 4:          00:46:48       And in between you get what are called [inaudible]. Uh, sometimes quite warm episodes. I mean, we had one about 5,000 years ago. That was probably six or seven or eight degrees warmer than today. I would love to get you together with a guy named Randall Carlson, who's an expert in astro asteroidal impacts and he's got some pretty compelling evidence and some fascinating theories about the end of the ice age and at the end of the ice age corresponds to a lot of nuclear glass sites in Asia and Europe that the nuclear glasses as essentially the same stuff they find doing. They do nuclear test sites. That also happens when they have media impacts and it's all throughout and Europe

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       and he believes there was a significant impact in North America. Not once but twice and it directly corresponds to our, a planet passing through a essentially a comet storm. Really fascinating stuff, but he's got this. Actually, I would love to get you together with him because he's got some compelling evidence that he believes that the wooly mammoths and the, what was it, 60 something percent of the large mammals that died off during that very distinct time period. He says that directly corresponds to physical evidence of this trite night stuff and all these, uh, diamonds that they find micro diamonds that come from these impacts. Very fascinating. It is a possibility that you have considered

Speaker 3:          00:48:11       no. Well, I mean I've read about it and I think, you know, as in so many questions out there, you know, we haven't figured out the answers to things and a lot of instances. And so yeah, this is a possibility. I mean, what I was sort of leading to by tracking that milankovitch cycle, a procession through time is that that sort of changed tends to produce among animal species and plants to really a lot of speciation. In other words, it generates a lot of new because you're often isolating populations and when populations get isolated from their parent populations, they'll evolve some new traits and maybe even become a new species. And so you get a lot. It's kind of a cycle where you end up with a lot of different new animals. But when change comes, you often lose a good many of them. And so, uh, these extinctions scenarios that are associated with the ice ages and the [inaudible] in between the interglacials, uh, do tend to produce quite a number of extinctions.

Speaker 3:          00:49:24       And the short face bear, I mean I wish I was more of an expert so I could directly address exactly what happened to it. But all I can tell you from my limited knowledge of it is that it seems to have disappeared in North America around 15,000 years ago. And that's at a time when the Wisconsin ice age is beginning to wind down. Um, and so, you know, we still haven't. I mean, there are a lot of scholars out there, a lot of people out there who are arguing climate as the primary explanation for the Pleistocene extinctions. Most people sort of concede that, okay, in the case of the mammoths are evidence tends to point more towards human hunting, but we don't know about all these other animals. You know why? I mean the predators, as I said, they seem to disappear because of the prey disappears. But I mean one of the camels disappeared. One of the, the, you know, these giant ground sloths disappear when the things that they ate. The Globe mallows that are still in the West are still out there. But the animal that fed on them isn't there anymore, so it's something, you know, that people have been sort of a hammering around over beers and in laboratories for actually more than a century now. And we still haven't answered all the questions. It is

Speaker 2:          00:50:49       fascinating, but it's so amazing that you could even formulate that much information based on something that was 25, 15,000 years ago. It is, I mean, this whole country that we, we live in today was for, as far as Europeans are concerned, we've only been here a few hundred years, which is really kind of amazing. I've only been here for a few hundred years, you know, and uh,

Speaker 3:          00:51:10       I mean, as you know from, from the, uh, the other recent book of mine, American Serengeti, uh, one of the animals that you can observe today that gives us maybe our best sense of what the Pleistocene is light is the pronghorn antelope, which is still out on the plains. And of course across a lot of the west, I mean natural where they nearly disappeared at the turn of the 20th century. We've managed to bring them back and a lot of western states, but that's an animal that is essentially a holdover from the pleistocene and is kind of still fighting pleistocene ghosts. I mean, it's an animal is everybody knows that can run 65 miles an hour and yet for the last 10,000 years, the fastest animal that can chase it. The Gray Wolf only runs 45 miles an hour. And so that leads to the obvious question why the overkill in terms of speed, what you would think is all you need to do is run 47 miles an hour and you got it covered.

Speaker 3:          00:52:18       But here are these animals still among us that runs 65 miles an hour, that can't jump over fences that still congregate and what, uh, what people call the selfish herd where they'll group up as a herd of adults and the dominant animals will end up in the middle so that if there are any predators, they get the ones on the edges and the dominant ones survive. And yet they don't have any predators except as fons. And so what we think is happening is that in the pronghorn we've got an animal that has survived in our own time that preserves how evolution shaped it to deal with the predators of the Pleistocene, when there actually was a cheetah and a running hyena that could run almost 65 miles an hour and there were predators that went after their herds when they were adults, and all those animals have disappeared.

Speaker 3:          00:53:27       They're all ghosts and have been for 10,000 years and yet pronghorn still preserve the ability to run away from a Cheetah and two group up as a selfish herd and preserve the dominant animals in the middle against the hyena attack. I had no idea they could run that fast. They can run 65 miles an hour. I only think some of the females which are a little bit lighter than the males are. Some of them may be able to run 70 magic going on the highway. You're. You're violating the speed limit. And a pronghorn process is. Yes, that's right. That's incredible. I did not know that there was hyenas that lived in North America as well that could run that fast. Yeah. We had a fast, a running hyena that, uh, was a major Predator of creatures like this, you know, I mean, if you think about it, what you know, and this is why I use the term American Serengeti for the title of this book, what we had in North America where these versions.

Speaker 3:          00:54:30       Yeah. On the. Yeah. Look, we've got a video of them right now and just someone's driving in the car and they are just flying by. Yeah. Merriweather Lewis famously said they're, they're running motion more resembles the flight of birds than it does any mammal. Yeah, I've seen them. I saw them in Montana and boy did they book. It's Kinda crazy to watch in real life. We'll see him take off when they get spooked and you're like, whoa. There are version of, you know, impalas and gazelles and in Africa. And so what other aunt there was this Cheetah now? Is it, does it resemble the African Cheetah? Was it? Did it looked like an African Cheetah? It, it did. Resemble it, uh, as a result of kind of convergent evolution. I mean, it, it was an animal that pursued these pronghorns that could run 70 miles an hour. So it had to be able to run that fast.

Speaker 3:          00:55:23       Did it develop independently of the African Cheetah? It did end date. And in fact it developed from the Cougar, the mountain lion line. So it doesn't come out of, you know, I mean the, the Cheetah is a cat that famously many people say it. It's a dog gleick cat, uh, and it's, its own independent entity in Africa. And so our version of it came out of the same line that produced mountain lions except Mountain Lions 15,000, 20,000 years ago. Produced this very fast running version that was in effect an American Cheetah. Wow. And did it have the same sort of front paws as a cheetah? Cause Cheetah's, they're more, almost dogleg this, this, this North American animal didn't have dog like pads, like the African Cheetah does a, at least I'm not, you know, there may be some cheetah are our North American cheese expert out there who would, who would contest that. But I don't think so. I've not seen any evidence anywhere in anything I've read that it did. So it essentially just develop

Speaker 2:          00:56:34       disability to run very fast, to catch pronghorn

Speaker 3:          00:56:36       to catch pronghorns and catch, you know. And there were, there were other animals that could run, I mean, horses run pretty fast, so, uh, and cats, I mean the reason horses buck of course, which we translated in our own time into Rodeo sports, but the reason they buck is because that's their strategy for dislodging a cat attack. They were always a pray of cats. And so, you know, and so, I mean, when we were talking about horses a minute ago, I mean, one of the points I was going to make, and I can make this point too, is that one of the reasons horses reasons, horses are an issue now. And a problem in the West is a, they're not on the great plains anymore, which was the primary horse range during the 17 hundreds and 18 hundreds there in the deserts of places like Nevada.

Speaker 3:          00:57:34       Uh, so they're in a much more arid country, not in a lushly grass plains setting, but in a, in a desert setting, and we don't have their predators around anymore. I mean, we've taken out gray wolves, which certainly did pray on colts. We've almost wiped out mountain lions. They're meant lines are coming back and that's was always one of the major predators of cults, but horses don't have the sort of predators anymore that they had during the pleistocene or even in the 17 hundreds and 18 hundreds. And so without their predators on the landscape and also being out in a desert setting rather than out in the much lusher great plains. They, you know, they've become an issue in terms of uh, how they compete with cattle, how they compete with sheep, how they compete with mule deer and wildlife. And that's why we were sort of endlessly rattling the cage around wild horses now. But in the 19th century, in the 18 hundreds, I mean, were they were out on the great plains. They were in eastern Montana and eastern Colorado and eastern New Mexico in this much more lushly grasp setting. And they're, of course still were wolves and mountain lions to take out the colts and sort of keep their population suppressed them,

Speaker 2:          00:59:00       it seems, you know, I mean, I'm incredulous that human beings that didn't even have bows and arrows could kill off the woolly mammoth. But then you stop and think about what people are able to do in the few hundred years that we've been here when we arrived in North America, when Europeans arrived in North America and just essentially swept through the country and almost extra painted everything. Found like white

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       tail deer, antelope, Buffalo. We almost wiped the whole thing of elk when we got it down to just, I mean, at the turn of the 19th century or the 20th century, rather we. It was a, it was a sad state and it was a sad state and it was a, you know, it's one of those instances in history where a. I mean, I think I say this in the introduction of that American Serengeti Book, that that was the largest destruction of wildlife that I've been able to discover in world history when Europeans came to North America and proceeded, as you've just described from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific and essentially wiped out just dozens of animal species in most instances. Not completely a exterminating them, but dropping them to numbers that were so low that you know, you worried that this animal was gonna survive and I mean some animals.

Speaker 3:          01:00:26       We did go extinct. The Carolina parakeet, for example, a, was this beautiful Gadi Green and yellow, large cro sized parrot that was in North America all the way up to the great lakes and they became extinct by the 19 thirties people hunted them. They were regarded as a agricultural pest and so farmers basically killed them and enlisted government agents as had happened with wolves and coyotes to their wiped them out. It's fascinating and I guess it makes sense, but it's just fascinating that just a few hundred years ago they lacked the foresight to understand that any sort of intrusion into the ecosystem, any sort of, you know, eliminating one Predator or taking out one thing causes a cascade of events that can be disastrous. Now. People didn't know anything about ecology. I mean, you know, we don't have a emerge as a science until the 18 sixties. It may make sense, but it's amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:01:27       It really is amazing and it knew so little. We knew, we knew very little and we tended to, you know, I'm in with a complete lack of knowledge. I mean we did the same thing with the coyote attempt at exterminating them. We, we pass a law in Congress in 1931 to provide for the extermination of coyotes into appropriate the money to do it. I mean we spent probably $100,000,000 over the next 40 or 50 years attempting to do it and pass that law at a time when we'd never sent the first scientists out to do any study of coyote national history. We had no idea what they ate, had no clue about them, but before we even have any science to go on at all, we just go ahead and take step up. Okay. We're going to. This is an ammo. We're to completely weed out of the North American setting.

Speaker 3:          01:02:26       We're going to eliminate it. I don't know a damn thing about it, but we're gonna. Make sure that this thing does not survive through the 20th century. It's fascinating in your book, the accounts of the early explorers who are trying to figure out what the hell a coyote was. They thought maybe it was a jackal. They didn't know what it was, and then they finally decided it was some sort of a small wolf and in the initial description of it, where they call it a prairie wolfe prairie wolf. That's right. Yeah, fine in a lot of people don't know this for most of the 19th century. I mean I've. I've seen references to this name as late as 1915 Americans call coyotes. Pray Wolf's. That was the name Lewis and Clark gave them. And so that's what everybody called them. And it wasn't until we started getting out into the southwest, uh, in the 18, 40 [inaudible] and 18 fifties, especially around Santa fe where there were Indian people who had come up with the Spanish colonization of the southwest who spoke the language of the Aztecs.

Speaker 3:          01:03:31       That language is called know what and the word coyote comes from the Aztec language. So when Americans were first getting into New Mexico in the 1840 [inaudible], really they began encountering people who are using a different name for the animal. And over the next 30 or 40 years, that name sort of overtook the term prairie wolf and finally completely replaced it. So the original name was an Aztec name. Yeah. It was an asset name. Yeah. And it's pronounced and in the know Hwat language, it's spelled and their language c o y o t t l, but the l on the end is silent. And so the way they pronounced it was quote. And um, I mean the Aztec language because they, you know, they were an empire and they, they defeated a lot of peoples and they imposed their language and their customs on a lot of people.

Speaker 3:          01:04:36       There were all sorts of Indians who weren't necessarily as check who spoke that language, uh, and there were evidently a enough of them in places like Santa Fe in Tucson that when a Anglo Americans got out there, they, they were encountering not only native people who were using that word, but the Spanish not being privy to the American use of the term prairie wolf. The Spanish had just adopted the Indian name for the animal. And they had hispanicized it. And they began, they gave it an extra syllable. So they call the animal a coil pot. And that's what these early Americans were hearing. They were largely hearing the Spanish pronunciation, the three syllable version, Cota Ota and Mark Twain comes along and the 18 seventies and writes a very famous book about the West roughing it. Of course, he's America's most famous writer at the time, his book as best seller a and Mark Twain, not only kind of, because we, as you mentioned, mentioned a minute ago, we don't really know what to make of these animals.

Speaker 3:          01:05:43       Americans have never had an experience with an animal like this, so we don't know what to think about them. Mark Twain is the one who provides us with kind of a take on them as these cowardly, despicable a little creatures that have this, you know, uh, overgrown wolf skin and this is despairing look. And he says, you know, they're, they're such scoundrels in such scavengers that a flea would desert one for a philosophy, you know, and he's. Mark Twain is humorous. So he gets on this riff and he goes on for like three pages in this vein, so that by the time you end up reading it, your basic conviction is, okay, this is a despicable creature that's just breathing up good air. So we should just get rid of it. But he does. In the course of that book, tell Americans how, what the animal is called and how you pronounce it.

Speaker 3:          01:06:38       And he says, uh, in the west, this animal is called a coyote and he spelled it out phonetically given us our modern pronunciation of coyote. Saw our modern pronunciation comes from Mark Twain. Yeah, he's, well, he's the one who at least popularizes that. And everybody who read his book basically kind of, I think a absorbed that pronunciation of it. Why did these native Americans have such a great respect for the coyote? Like what was it about that animal that we created so many legends? Oh, that's a great story. And as I argue in this book, I mean, I. What I try to do with Coyote America is to tell the, the biography of the animal from its evolutionary origins through its history, up until the present time when of course it's in everybody's backyard all over the country. And so we're all all dealing with it and having to figure out what it is and, and how you coexist with it. But it's a real rollercoaster ride because I mean, it goes, you know, for a million years of its evolution, uh, confronting at certain times the return of gray wolves to North America, which clearly don't like coyotes and beat the crap out of them and even probably influenced their evolutionary direction into a smaller, more jackal like animal. But then it also, it has this story that's associated with us when humans arrive in North America. I mean, coyotes get this wonderful peer. It lasts like

Speaker 4:          01:08:17       14,000, 500 years or something where native people look at them and say, that's the most intriguing animal on the continent. It's for one thing, mammoths, camels, horses. All these big charismatic animals are dying out around us in the pleistocene extinctions. Somehow these little guys don't seem to be perturbed by it. They're surviving while all of these big creatures, these big impressive creatures are going away. And I think they also, at least this is what I argue in the book, they had this sense that a coyote is live by their widths. And I think that provided them with a model that they thought was valuable. Because I think living successfully, because you're smart, you know, is that's a trait that humans in any age, including ours right now, uh, could very well a follow and find to be a, a, uh, an effective way to go about facing your future.

Speaker 4:          01:09:34       So they see this animal is being particularly smart, particularly adaptable, a survivor, and because it was a social animal, it has pups the pups don't know how to fend for themselves in the world. And coyotes have to teach the pups just as humans do with their children. How to become full grown coyotes and how to survive that. It seemed to have a lot of traits that people found familiar. And so at some point in time, and who knows when it was, I mean, it could have been 10,000 years ago, they converted into Indian people in the West everywhere. Coyotes range, convert this animal into one of their principle, God's their principal deities and make it this sacred creature. I mean, they have no reason to kill them or harass them or anything. And so instead they look at it as this Avatar, this stand in for humans. In the world, study it really closely and they proceed to create this body of, of literature. It's our oldest literature from North America, uh, in the form of oral stories that have coyote as the central character, but it's not, it's not the little coyote that's trotting through your camp. It's a coyote man. He's a character who stands on his hind legs. He has pointed nose and he has direct ears and he has a tail, but he's standing up and he personifies all the traits, both good and bad of human beings. It's, it's

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       so weird. That was the way we look at coyotes today is this new sense and this past, and that's directly attributed to agriculture, right? Directly attributed to us having livestock anywhere near them, deciding we want them out. But if you look at the Museum of natural history in Los Angeles, when I was there, I took a photo of it because it was so weird. I put on my instagram there, the photo, the, the stuffed coyote that they have there. They have all these different animals. They have African animals, they have gorillas, chimpanzees, all these different stuffed animals. I just sort of give you a sense of what they would look like with this mock natural environment that coyote is natural environment. They show a porch and the coyote has a cat in it's mouth. I mean, this is this, this is this image right here. That is my photo that I took from the Museum of natural history.

Speaker 2:          01:11:59       It's like what? Like that's the natural environment is a porch with a cat in his mouth. It's, it's so bizarre. But that's how human beings, especially in and around La, view them. I know when I had my situation with the chicken before I started reading your book, I thought about killing that coyote. It was like, I want to kill that fucker. He killed my chicken. I'm going to kill him. Then I found out, I believe I'm pretty sure that it was a female because, uh, he, this female kind of honey Dick my dog into jumping the fence and efforting, converting with her and that's how they got the chickens because my dog's huge. I have a massive. And he knocked over this. When chickens, when they, uh, they, they brewed. Do you know about chickens brooding? Do you know that? My Dad had chickens in Louisiana.

Speaker 2:          01:12:49       So yeah, I kind of, uh, you know, hanging out with him when I would go back and visit. Uh, I came to know a little bit about chickens. Well, people don't know what happens is chickens think that their eggs, the only way the chickens have eggs every day pretty much or sort of every day, every few days. And when they have an egg, a, those eggs are non-viable. That's one of the reasons why vegetarians can eat chicken eggs and get protein from them. You're not hurting anybody. They have the eggs, whether or not there's a chicken there are any or not. They always have the egg and it has to be fertilized by the rooster in order for it to become a chicken. I didn't figure that out, so it was almost 40, but my stupid head, I was like, oh, the egg means there's a chicken and there you just gotTa Cook it before it becomes a chicken.

Speaker 2:          01:13:33       No stupid. Anyway. Um, the chicken sometimes are convinced that these non viable eggs will become chicks. And so they sit on them and they start plucking their feathers out and it takes the entire cycle that an egg would be viable and become a chick for them to get out of it. The only way to stop them is to put them on a perch and put them in a smaller cage. So we put them in a perch and the smaller cage, we separate them from the chicken coop and the coyote had figured this out, that this chicken was by itself and convinced the massive to knock the cage over because it was too small to knock this coop over. But the master is 140 pounds. He's like, I'll fucking

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       take care of. He knocks the coop down that coyote says thanks. Grabs the chicken and then jumps and hops the fence. And I was talking to my neighbor about, he's like, Oh man, I fucking hate coyotes. I go, do you like rats? Because if you don't like rats, you should thank the coyotes. The reason why we're not infested with rats, I mean we're in the hills. When you're in the hills, out here in California, there's rats and rodents everywhere, but they're not, and the reason why is because these coyotes, we make that mistake so often where we think that we're smart and we're going to eliminate one thing in this, this system, and it's gonna be fine. Now. All we have to do is take out this coyote and everything will be great, but no, you're going to have a rat infestation and that's one of the things that you talked about in your book about farmers who had chased off the coyotes and they had rapid infestations and they were praying for coyotes.

Speaker 4:          01:15:05       I mean this happens in a just over and over and over again. And so I think one of the reasons that we tend to make endlessly make the same mistake with animals like this is because we don't try to spend any effort to understand the ecological world around us and to understand their role in it in particular. And you know what I mean? I've been going around the country a lot over the last eight months talking about this book because obviously everybody is dealing with them and some people are brand new in dealing with them and they were alarmed first of all that there's this small wolf trotting down the street or through their yard. And then of course they immediately here. Well, it's going to get your cat scan to get your small dog. It's got a level to grab your three year old.

Speaker 4:          01:15:53       I mean, you just saw the horror stories, uh, through kind of urban legend make the rounds, you know, at a, at an accelerated rate and sort of basic good information about the animal doesn't make the round very effectively at all. It's not fun. No, it's not fun. But what you have to grapple with first of all is you've got to start with a position, which I'll admit this is not the American position to take. It's the position that in this instance, we have confronted a part of the natural world that we are not able to control. We can't control coyotes.

Speaker 4:          01:16:35       We met resistance basically as futile. They're going to be among us no matter what we do. I mean, you can certainly take out. I, you know, coyotes are individuals and so if there's a bad actor in the neighborhood and very few of them, by the way in the studies of coyotes in urban settings are bad actors, but occasionally there's one that starts catching cats are a starts chasing dogs or something. I mean you can take that one out and perhaps improve the situation, but just blanket going after any coyote you're afraid of something like your cat might disappear is going to boomerang in every instance because attempts to persecute them as I try to point out over and over and Coyote America result in every case and more coyotes and and it skews the populations so that what you end up with are often youngsters, teenagers, that like human teenagers get in more trouble than adults do.

Speaker 4:          01:17:38       So the thing that I keep trying to do, and of course there's a group in California and San Francisco called project coyote that's been at this a trying to help people understand how to coexist but coexist with coyotes for the last seven or eight years. What you have to do is first of all, accept the fact that, okay, resistance is futile. These animals are here. They know how to live in an urban setting. They know how to live in the hills around me. Now I've got to figure out how I live with coyotes in my life. And I mean, the obvious thing is you don't let your cats out in the morning to go hunt songbirds. You don't let your cats out at night. I mean the coyotes are, in most instances, not attacking cats are small dogs because they want to eat them. They regard them as competitor predators in their territory and so they're attacking them because that's how they.

Speaker 4:          01:18:39       They see them, but they do eat them, right? Well, they, they will eat them in some instances when they're trying to provision a litter of pups. So the times when cats will be snatched by coyotes and will disappear and you don't see the cat again is often the period from basically about now from April through about July, that's when they have their litters and I mean it's sometimes hard to come up with enough protein to raise five or six little coyote pups. And so occasionally a cat or a small dog will be taken away. But usually what happens with cats and small dogs is that Kylie's attack them and they just leave them there. And I've told people for, uh, for most of this year, I mean this is from my own experience because I've lived in the urban wildlands interface for almost all my adult life out in the countryside away from town. Whenever you find your cat, that's probably a coyote and its attack the cat because it thinks it's a competitor and it attacks, it kills. It leaves it. If the animal disappears, if your cat disappears and you never see it again, either that's happened in the time when they're provisioning pups or if it happens in the fall or the winter or the early spring. And your cat totally disappears. It probably was a great horned owl that got your cat. I mean als pluck

Speaker 2:          01:20:07       cats and take them to their roost and devour them. And so your cat disappears. Then you never see it again. But what almost everybody does now that we know, we've got coyotes as hear coyotes howling and the hills, the neighbor had a cat disappeared. Of course it was a coyote. Coyote got it. Yeah. But it might not be a, I would say in a pretty sizeable percentage of cases. It was actually a great horned owl that got the cat and not a coyote. There's a great video that I found online that I put on my instagram of an owl snatching some other raptor right out of its nest. Have you ever seen it? I haven't seen it. But uh, it's someone that had like a trail cam, a video up a black and white trail cam. And you see the owl flying in the distance or is it you see the eyes and then you see it snap and the other bird in the nest doesn't even know what happened. It had watched this. Yeah, it happened so fast. So what first of all, do you know what kind of animal that is? That. What would that bird is? Can you tell by looking at it? It looks like a hawk. Have some fledgling. Boom. That's it. I look at the other ones like what happened? What's going on? Yeah, that's a hawk of some kind. Maybe a red tail and the fledgling. Just the eyes and the distance are amazing. Look through these eyes. Sneaking up. Look at this. Here it comes.

Speaker 2:          01:21:26       It's so funny that we think of that thing is. Oh the wise old owl. Give a hoot. Don't pollute. Meanwhile, those motherfuckers are as evil as it gets. Well they are definitely major predators and they hear the stories about them in New Mexico. I mean there. I've got friends who were sitting at a, at an outdoor bar a couple of years ago with a railing on it. It was a late afternoon and a cat was walking along the railing, whether sitting there with their drinks, shooting the shit, and all of a sudden an al comes in and in a flash plucks that cat off the railing and the next thing they say is the owl flying off to the cottonwood trees over the creek with this cat dangling from its. Yeah, while they're all sitting there with their drinks, poison in the air. I was driving home one day and I saw this hour, we'll fly right above my head and I must have apparently while I was driving, it must have got this rabbit somewhere close to it and I startled it so it's flying off and decided to drop the rabbit.

Speaker 2:          01:22:24       So we're like right in front of me in the highway or the road. Was this eviscerated rabbit? No. Big Rabbit too. And I was in that. That was one of the first years that I lived here. And I remember thinking, Oh, I gotta read. I gotta recalibrate my idea when an owl is getting. Because it was just torn apart and it was a big rabbit and I saw this. I mean it was a big owl too, so the whole thing was like, Whoa, this is a predator, this isn't just a bird icon. They and that's the way they killed two. That's what they do with cats. They eviscerate them, they put a talent. I'm basically into their ass and just rip it all the way up, all the way up to their sternum, spilled their guts out. Whew. There's a wildlife near here and we visited a couple of times and they have owls there and you get to see them and check them out up close like animals that had been injured and things like that.

Speaker 2:          01:23:14       And you just see the talents on those suckers and just woof. There's serious. Yeah. It's fascinating how we anthropomorphize some of these animals and turn them into these cutie pies. You know, like polar bears are selling Coca Cola and Klondike bars and owls are selling tootsie roll pops. We evolved it just they're out there, Jack and cats. You know, there's a video in Los Angeles and one of the reasons why I wanted to ask you about this is because I'd heard you say before, I think on Renell's podcast, what you just said about cats and dogs, that essentially they're there, the coyotes, think of them as competitive predators. Yeah. But there's a video in Los Angeles, uh, in Hollywood have a coyote eating a cat on a lawn and a, these people are in the car watching and they're filming it and they're freaking out. Like, oh my God.

Speaker 2:          01:24:05       Oh my God, it's Kylie was just sitting there eating that cat. So you think that the reason why it's eating that music just hungry maybe, or is it, is it an occasional meal that they think of them as prey or is it primarily because they're a bunch of different factors or is it primarily because they're competitive predators? Well, I think it's primarily because of that, but I mean there are. So, you know, there's coyotes are so individualistic. Okay. That's soccer hanging out right now. Like, hi, how are you? Wild animal walking by the car, right in Los Angeles. I mean, just so bizarre that they're so comfortable around people treat like a little city streets. It's thinking about walking across the street, don't know how to navigate the streets like that too. So strange. How does it figure out how to make it across the street?

Speaker 2:          01:24:55       You know, there's a, there's a biologist in Chicago who argues that in rush hour traffic on the interstate in Chicago, 9 million people there that he's seen coyotes cross four lanes of the interstate and stop in the median and sit there and wait until the traffic lightens up for the other four lanes and then cross that way. So this is, uh, the coyote goes and gets this cat that apparently it had already killed before he starts eating it. So it's got it right there. Yeah. That thing at his feet. His cat. Yeah. Well, what I was going to say about that is that yeah, it's all stiff. Yeah. Well he's. So what a strange animal. You know. So. So two things I would observe about this particular video is, first of all, you know, everybody is making the assumption that coyote killed the cat. That cat may have been hit by a car and the coyote founded in is scavenging it. How about another stupid cat behind them? That's my friend right behind the low. Why are you eating my friend?

Speaker 3:          01:26:05       The other thing I would say is that they're so individualistic that sometimes cats, they develop. A coyote is develop a yen for cats. I could taste. Yes, they develop a taste for them and so I mean, there are examples. There was a coyote pack in Seattle and also one in Tucson that basically did this very thing. They. They decided that cats, we're going to be their target now. Most coyotes, you know, that's not how they react to cats, but cats do kill an unbelievable amount of rodents and birds. Yeah, and people don't want to hear this of course, but the truth is that in all cities were coyotes have spread, which is literally everywhere now. We have from the ornithologists a decided record of numbers of nesting songbirds going up dramatically as a result of the appearance of coyotes. Yeah. There was a statistic that we quoted on the podcast and it's something insane, like 3 billion birds a year in North America alone are killed by cats, by house cats b with a b.

Speaker 3:          01:27:18       yeah. When you tell that to people, they're like, there's no way, but look, these are biologists. These are people that are actually studying this, and it blew them away. I don't know how they studied it. I don't. Maybe you could enlighten me. Well, I don't either. I mean, one point 7 billion years annually, seven birds in the continental us. That is so crazy. That's us. That's not Canada. It's not Mexico. Continental us and I read a similar study in natural history magazine a few years ago about Great Britain. Same, same kind of thing. Yeah. Uh, I don't remember the figures anymore, but yeah, I mean cats, you know, they devastate bird populations and so letting your cat Rome out through the neighborhood. And it seems like this very compassionate thing to do. You know, fluffy wants to be out, fluffy needs some space to roam, but you're releasing an extremely effective Predator into the world.

Speaker 3:          01:28:13       And that's the results of it and when coyotes have shown up in town, it's suddenly getting a lot harder to make a living as a bird killing cats. And so we're, we're getting a sharp uptick now in songbirds. Yeah, it's interesting how it all just cycles and I'll just make sense and I'll figure it out at all. Seeks its own level. I'm. One of the things that I've found hilarious was we were talking on is a podcast about a group that approached you and they were doing a documentary on saving the coyote. Yes. And it was a, a couple of women, uh, who, uh, were pretty fresh in into the southwest and Santa Fe. They hadn't been in town for very long and they were interested in doing a documentary to save

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       the Coyote and uh, you know, so I mean there's a way to approach doing something like that. Uh, I mean you could say, okay, so I want wildlife services to stop killing 80,000 of them a year on behalf of agriculture. Uh, but what these women didn't seem to quite have a handle on was that coyotes don't need our help in saving themselves. They're perfectly capable of doing it. And so, uh, this is not an animal you have to worry about, for example, going on the endangered species list. Uh, and that's not gonna happen as one of the people who blurbed my book. In fact, it was bill mckibben, the nature writer. Now that I think about it, one of the things he said was that, uh, in his blurb was that a biologist wants told him that when the last human dies on earth, a coyote will be sitting on that humans grave howling at the moon. I've always loved that thought because of course it's a, it's an indication of how, what great survivors they are. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:30:19       you are starting to see a resurgence of wolves in Europe. And, uh, there was actually an article recently published in Paris about it were, uh, I guess the mayor of Paris was telling people not to be alarmed because they only look for four legged pray and people shouldn't be worried about these wolves. But the idea of these animals like intermingling with our, with our civilization, you know, we, we have decided, we put some hardscape down, put up some houses, and we'll go, this is our stuff. You got to stay out and they don't recognize these boundaries and now you're slowly starting to see these animals creep back in, in Paris, France, in Paris. That's right. Yeah. Well, uh, you know, I think when we moved into cities 5,000 years ago, one of the things we thought we were getting away from, by living in cities was predators. Yeah. And the most part we have. Yeah. Most

Speaker 4:          01:31:09       part we have. I mean, we don't have, you know, at least not so far. We don't have lepers in patrolling the alleys and, and, uh, Denver. But I, you know, I'm intrigued by one of the stories I uncovered in the book, which is an argument that I make is based on the work of a graduate student I knew at the University of Montana, his name is John Hall and he was doing a dissertation in history on a, what he was calling the great dog war in the 19th century and what it was all about. And the more I dug into it, I realized this is one of the explanations for why you don't see accounts of coyotes in cities much. Uh, even in, in La. I mean the first accounts I've seen of Katie's in La for instance, during the 19 twenties, but it's because in the 19th century, until about the 18 seventies, we let dogs our own pets and packs of feral dogs roam through American cities at will.

Speaker 4:          01:32:15       And so every city in the United States had a large population of feral and sort of loosely owned dogs roaming around our city scapes. Pharaoh, meaning they were totally wild, or people would feed them and people would feed them. I mean, they were just basically stray dogs that would roam the city. They would find things to scavenge behind restaurants and behind the houses and they would knock over people's garbage and. But in the. This happened in, I think in the late 18, 40 [inaudible] Boston had an epidemic one year of rabies attacks from these kinds of wild dogs in the city and so Boston began to institute what became our modern system of dog catchers, dog pound's leash laws, doc control, and it was at the Moma when the Boston model began to spread to Philadelphia, to New York, eventually to New Orleans, eventually to the cities in California, and we sort of instituted this new model of, okay, a dog is properly meant to be in an enclosed yard on a leash when it's with its owner is supposed to be running through the streets with packs of other dogs scavenging a garbage and stuff. When we did that, what that in effect did was to open up the niche in American cities for wild canids and the wild Canaan that was able to take advantage of it was the coyote that provided them the opening that hadn't been there before because a coyote wandering into a city and the 18 sixties or 18 thirties would end up being, of course assaulted by dogs. Suddenly all the dogs were put up and that opened up the cities to the arrival of coyotes in our midst. Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:34:22       Just the interface between human beings and the wild and our interaction with the wild and then to start our ability or inability to manipulate it. It's just so fascinating to me. And one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about is what they're trying to do right now, uh, in I guess it's Wyoming and parts of Montana, this, uh, American Serengeti Project. Now we please explain that. Well, uh, so this, this other book that we've, we've talked about some of mine that has been out now just about a year. It came out, uh, last, uh, last March of 2016. Um, that's a book, American Serengeti is a book that's about the story of the Great Plains and the fact that we had up until about a hundred and 25 or 130 years ago in North America, one of the what was widely regarded around the globe as one of the great wildlife spectacles of, of the world.

Speaker 4:          01:35:26       And these enormous herds of bison have a reemerging wildhorse bands of pronghorns, maybe 15, $18 million pronghorns, uh, not quite as many as bison, but almost as many a half million gray wolves that were their predators. Of course, coyotes playing the role of Jackals, a grizzly bears that roamed, I mean, the original range of the grizzly bear was actually out on the plains. They were all the way out into Kansas and into Nebraska. And I mean everybody saw the movie revenant of course. Uh, which the filmmaker said in the rocky mountains. But that was based on an actual event that happened in history. A guy named Hugh glass getting mauled by a grizzly that happened in South Dakota though, not up in the mountains because the grizzlies were out on the plains in this version of the Serengeti that prevailed a 150 years ago. But we ended up basically a wiping all those animals out.

Speaker 4:          01:36:35       I mean, we, we wiped out probably as many as 30 million bison through the 19th century. Almost all. We got the prom horns down from 15 million to about 13,000. Uh, we drove the elk off the great plains. That was their primary range was the planes. We drove them off and up into the mountains. Did the same thing with the grizzlies. So we basically reduced this, this American Serengeti, which Africa didn't do with its Serengeti or it's [inaudible] or it's veiled. It preserved all. It's great animals, but we destroyed hours and ended up not ever successfully creating any kind of wildlife preserve to sort of save at least a part of it. I mean, we got yellowstone, but of course yellowstone is said in the rocky mountains. And so what this American prairie reserve is about now, it's based in Bozeman, Montana. It's only about a dozen years old, but it's been pretty wildly successful in trying to do this. It's had the imagination. This group of people has had the imagination to try to recreate this American Serengeti that we are. Our government in our state craft never did preserve

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       forests and so what they've got in mind in central Montana is taking a couple of large pieces of of existing public lands. One is the Missouri River Breaks National Monument that Bill Clinton created a all along the Missouri River and then just downstream of it still along the Missouri River is the Charles m russell national wildlife refuge. And together those two public lands that are along the Missouri River and mostly on the South Bank of the Missouri River in central Montana, make up about one point six, one point 7 million acres. And what American prairie reserve is trying to do is to, as they come up for sale, to acquire the private ranches on the north side of the river, with the idea of ultimately creating a, a preserved that's going to be maybe as big as twice the size of yellowstone yellowstone's, a little more than 2 million acres and American prairie reserve is shooting for a preserve that would be something like 4 million acres with the idea of recreating this American Serengeti, of repopulating it with Bison pronghorns with elk, with big horn sheep, with mule deer.

Speaker 3:          01:39:19       All the animals that were there. And then because they're a private entity and they, it's not the fish and wildlife service, so they can't on their own merits, reintroduce wolves or grizzly bears. Just sort of sitting back and hoping and letting wolves come out of the nearby rockies and grizzlies, which every spring now are coming out of the, uh, the rocky mountain front and Montana and getting out sometimes as much as 100 miles out into the plains. What the American prairie reserve wants to happen is for these animals to get all the way out to this preserve, find this, recreated American Serengeti with all the animals that were there and give us in our own time and the 21st century this chance to not just read about this in history are maybe see some version of it on a late night old western movie, but actually to experience it ourselves now, how are they going to reintroduce these animals and where they going to get them from? Well, I mean, getting the Bison is not too difficult because their surplus bison, I'm pretty much around, uh, most of the West. I mean we've got a larger bison population in North America right now than we've had since the 18 nineties. More than 300,000 of them. So it's fairly easy to come up with bison. Pronghorns are already there. Uh, and so all you have to do is just sort of make conditions, uh, beneficial for their herds to grow.

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       Same thing with mule deer, with elk, with big horns, they're going that they'll have to reintroduce big horns. But that was an original range. There were big horns out on the, in the badlands of the great plains. And then, as I said, they can't deliberately on their own reintroduce gray wolves or grizzly bears, but they're a idea is that if wolves and grizzlies get there, then they're welcome. And, and the idea is they probably wants this preserve exists with all these grazing animals that the wolves and the bears will, will find it. Wow. That's so fascinating. And now do they have a timeline? They're trying to accomplish this in, you know, it's a, as I said, they've been around for about 10 or 12 years now. I mean they've raised more than $130 million dollars and they've got major donors on both the coasts along with lots of, you know, just people like you and me who give them 10 and $15 or $25.

Speaker 4:          01:41:54       I've got lots of friends who, once I sort of alerted them to this, who have joined American prairie reserve and our, and our donors, small donors. Um, the timeline is basically whenever they can make it happen. I mean, the, there's some, a considerable resistance from the ranching community, uh, not only in Montana but kind of across the West because ranchers don't want to see Bison and especially by sudden predators replace cattle herds, so there's kind of an ideological opposition on the part of, of ranching people, but, and that's two fold, right? It's one because of the food that the bison would eat because the battle for resources, but also because of brucellosis. Well, brucellosis of courses, especially in Montana and they explained to people that's disease disease, it's a disease that, uh, that bison and elk have and that if cattle get it, their beef cannot be sold, uh, in North American markets, all beef that's sold in our supermarkets has to be brucellosis free.

Speaker 4:          01:43:06       And how do they determine that? Do they have to test each individual animal when they swatted them? Yeah. Well, I mean they would, if there was a real threat about it. The truth is there has never been an instance in the wild of either a bison or an elk transferring brucellosis to cattle. How would they transfer it to the FDA at the same food? Now they basically, it comes through a largely from afterbirth whenever they, uh, whenever a bison a cow for example, that has brucellosis gives birth. If cattle come through the area a say within a few days and graze the same grass where after birth, uh, has been dropped from a brucellosis infected bison, then the theory is that a cow could get the disease. It's been made to happen that way. And laboratories, we have no record of it ever having happened in the wild.

Speaker 4:          01:44:02       When now when they made it happen in laboratories, did they force feed the cows? I don't think so. I mean, but I have to say that I've, I've not read the study so I'm not quite sure how they, how they pulled it off, but they did. They did make the transfer happen in a laboratory setting. Uh, what's been bizarre about the whole brucellosis thing is that elk are infected with brucellosis far more than by center, but the ranching community doesn't seem to be concerned about elk bison that they don't want. And why is that? Well, I mean, part of it, it seems to me almost dates back to the 19th century when we destroyed the, uh, original American Serengeti and killed all these bison and converted the great plains into largely a ranching country with cattle. I mean in the idea has been from the ranching community ever since that bison are a direct threat to the existing ranching community that if you get too many people and namor herd of Bison, uh, you know, and I'm not sure I can track the logic of their arguments, but it somehow seems to lead in that direction.

Speaker 4:          01:45:14       They don't like people introducing bison into the middle of a ranching setting, particularly what they don't seem to like is someone with an old Montana ranch of 40 or 50,000 acres selling that ranch. So somebody like American prairie reserve, which clearly is going to introduce wildlife on it and remove it from as an active sort of livestock ranching. A economic enterprise is interesting because it's a superior meet to bisons better meat and that's a better meat, better meat for you, much less fat in it. It's, yeah, it's. So this is a, I think the most exciting conservation project that's out in the West in our time. Uh, this is something that we didn't get and a lot of people don't know that. That's kind of why I wrote this American Serengeti Book because I wanted people to understand that only 120 530 years ago we had the equivalent of the Masai Mara in places like Nebraska and South Dakota and eastern Montana and wow.

Speaker 4:          01:46:30       And we destroyed it. And just like that and just the space of a few decades, we completely wiped it out. And as I said a minute ago, what seems to me to be the largest destruction wholesale destruction of wildlife discoverable in modern history. And so right now the American prairie reserve is just, they're just taking that land and buying it up and they haven't started this project at now. They have started the project. Yeah, it certainly exists and I've got a map of it in the, in the book and American Serengeti and they've reintroduced animals already. They have reintroduced animals. They're trying to come up with 12,000. So they have an instagram page. Look at that. Yeah. American prairie reserve as an instagram page. Absolutely. Only 1700 followers. How dare they. So click on that picture of the bison down there. Below that, below that Jamie lower right hand corner.

Speaker 4:          01:47:21       There you go. Lower right hand corner. Yeah, yeah. Look at that. Oh Wow. Interesting. So, um, there's a lot of bias in there roaming around and this is land that they occupied. And so these bison have a essentially very few predators and they're just wandering around and they're going to repopulate. We've got to repopulate. And uh, so one of the things that, uh, American prairie reserve does when they acquire these ranches is that they remove the fencing from. I mean they've been fenced of course to create pastures for bison, but they removed or for cattle, but they removed the fencing in order to let bison roam freely. And of course, the idea is you ultimately have to have the predators back. You're not going to have a complete ecosystem unless you have the predators there as well. That is really tricky, right? Because they're not allowed to reintroduce grizzly bears.

Speaker 4:          01:48:14       They are not allowed to as a private organization, oh, the fish and wildlife service would have to do this and fish and wildlife service doesn't actually, even the public lands that are there are not managed by the US fish and wildlife service. And good luck getting cooperation from people in Montana. There's still stinging from the wolves being introduced into yellowstone and the decimation of the elk population and all the other livestock issues that they've had there. Yeah. So, so they argue, at least when I was at the last few years I was in Montana, and this was about 10 years after the wolves had been recovered. We had about 1700 gray wolves in Montana or in the northern rockies actually, uh, by about 2012 or so. And uh, so the hunters in Montana were up in arms sort of the way these white tail hunters in South Carolina now are up in arms over coyotes.

Speaker 4:          01:49:09       The hunters of Montana were up in arms because it wasn't so easy to get an elk anymore and they blamed it all on wolves. And someone from the University of Montana did a study of a particular herd that had been singled out as one that was just being harassed by wolves and you know, and it was impossible to kill bull there anymore and concluded that actually most of the production that was taking place on that elk herd was from mountain lions and not the wolves that had been reintroduced, but it's become the for the hunting community, the sport hunting community, which has had, of course a century now of getting to hunt elk and white tails and deer and everything else

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       without competition from predators. This has become kind of the new excuse of why I didn't get my elk this year. Right. That makes sense. And then also, uh, I think it's super important that the hunting community step back and understand that these animals are supposed to be preyed upon by wolves and that without them you're going to get to these enormous overpopulation, which had happened in that hundred year period when we were reintroducing elk with no predators. They develop diseases and Montana has no shortage of ALC. I was there this summer and we drove by this house and we had to pull over and luckily I had binoculars in my car and I gave him my kids and the first time they saw elk, there was a hundred elk on this lawn, hundred there were all over the place and uh, one of the women who lives there was explained to us that they had wolves come through just a couple of nights before and it was really exciting and everybody's looking out the window and I think if you live there, if you're a person who was an elk hunter, especially if you're a lazy one, I get where you could see that that would be something you would complain about, but think the ELC adapt, you know, they figured it out.

Speaker 2:          01:50:53       They don't call as much and people are complaining about that. You don't hear the bugling as much, but that bugling was probably a little unnatural. They get a little too cocky that they could just scream and yell whenever they were breeding. You know, what they got preyed upon. Right. Well, you know, what we have to remember is that we are newcomers to North America. This is a very old place and wolves and coyotes and mountain lions have been part of the ecological equation here with all of these animals that we like to hunt with pronghorns, with elk, with mule deer. I mean this is, they've been evolving with one another for hundreds of thousands of years. I mean pronghorns, I talk about this and the American Serengeti book, pronghorn females always have two fonts. They basically have little litters of two and the reason they have to is because coyotes prey on pronghorn funds.

Speaker 2:          01:51:55       And so you basically have an heir and a spare and the spares, the one that you assumed the coyotes are going to get. Wow. So, and they evolve disability, you know, hundreds of thousands of years ago. So I think part of it is just coming to terms with the fact that we're, we're brand new here and it's gonna take awhile for us to actually truly become Americans in an ecological sense. In one way to do it is to think in terms of these long patterns that extinct stand back through time. I want to talk to you about your paper on Bison is called Bison diplomacy and bison ecology or is it the opposite? Bison ecology. Diplomacy. Yeah. Yeah. And what you were saying was, and this I found incredibly fascinating was that when we came along, when the mark, I say we obviously my grandparents were immigrants, wasn't me, but when Europeans, when you know, people that we consider Americans now came along a few hundred years ago, and then when they started doing the market hunting and killing off all the bison, well, we had done was something that the native Americans were already on their way to doing.

Speaker 4:          01:53:08       Well, I mean, so let me, let me sort of offer a revision of that. Okay. Um, native people and Bison, uh, had coexisted in that had been going on for eight or 9,000 years with, with the, the modern bison. I mean, if you track it back to, you know, the large Pleistocene Bison, bison, antiquity and bison latter fronds, the big Longhorn Bison Longhorn. Bison, what is that? Oh, amy. Yeah. It was by some Latin frons. It's called Lana frons. Frons. Yeah. And so it's a long horn bison. And then there was a slightly smaller one that existed farther into into our own time or the bison that we experience any of these pure. Well, some herds are. Wow. Look at that thing. That's amazing. Yeah. So that's, that's bias. A lot of fraud. I'm sure you're aware of the scrub bowls like particularly in Australia with these animals get free and they become feral domestic cows change their characteristics, look at the size of that thing.

Speaker 4:          01:54:17       So what the Lord. Yeah. So what that graphic shows is the contemporary are bison over on the right side of the graphic and you can see how much smaller it is than the animals that were here during the pleistocene by some latter fronds as the animal over on the far left. And Bison antiquity is one of these in the middle. It's probably the very middle one right there. These animals were hunted by early human hunters here too when the plot, because they arrived before the pleistocene produced that extinction scenario. So they hunted these, these large forms of Bison, but about 8,000 years ago, Bison, the large ones having become extinct. Bison sort of evolved into this smaller. I mean some people actually refer to the Modern Boston as a dwarf complex compared to these older ones. And so what I argue, and I've got a chapter on this and American Serengeti to Sorta my most recent take on this bison ecology bison diplomacy piece, which came out in a very fancy, a journal Academic Journal, but 25 years ago now.

Speaker 4:          01:55:33       But what I argue is that that hunt had been going on for 8,000 years and probably the reason that bison never that Indians never hunted them to extinction is because bison were actually better adapted to the grasslands than people were. So they were more successful as a grassland species than humans were. Until we get the introduction from the European arrival of a couple of things that change the equation. One is the reintroduction of the horse to North America, which native people in the west quickly take up and gives him a bill. An ability to hunt bison far more efficiently and to become just as well adapted to life on the grasslands as the as the bison was. But the other thing that changes the equation is the market and the introduction of the market economy. And so what that article actually argued and what my chapter in American Serengeti argues to I haven't changed my mind over the last 25 years about this, is that the market became a force for native people just as it did for people all around the world in Africa and India and everywhere else that they found difficult to resist.

Speaker 4:          01:57:04       And one of the primary reasons they found it difficult to resist was because if you were hunting with flint arrowheads, your best arrowhead maker could maybe produce 15 of them through hard labor in a day. But you could go out and kill a bison and have your wife Tan. It's pelt and make a robe. A softly tan robe out of it. And you could trade that to a white trader from the Hudson's Bay company or the American fur company and they would give you a hundred and 50 steel arrowheads that were far better than the flint ones that took your best arrow maker a day to produce and you could get 150 of them for the work of 30 minutes going out and shooting a bison. And of course your wife had to spend a week working on the pill. But basically the European market had so many labor saving technologies, steel arrowheads, steel knives, steel hatchets, a firearms that it became almost impossible for Indian people to resist trading for those things.

Speaker 4:          01:58:36       I mean, and if you didn't trade for them and the tribe down the river did, then they suddenly had guns and you didn't. And so you were going to be out competed by your neighbors. And so in effect, what happened was at the lure of the goods of the industrial world in the market economy, drew Indian people into the market hunt so that by the 18, 20, 18 thirties, 18 forties, they were still killing buffalo. In order to provide meat for the family and to provide, you know, a hides to make a teepee and all that, but they were killing and additional percentage of animals to trade to the European market. And so they became actors in the market economy that was basically wiping all these animals out. So he also was the reintroduction of the horse as well, right? Because I was in before that they were hunting these animals on foot and they were far less effective.

Speaker 4:          01:59:35       Yeah. Yeah. And they, they're, they're beasts of burden was the dog. And so you couldn't travel nearly as far, obviously by using dog propelled locomotion as you could horses, uh, and you couldn't carry the kind of burdens, that kind of goods that you could carry on dogs that you could with horses. And so the transformation from being a dog propelled people to being a horse. Propel people was a, it was a revolution in their lives. I mean, in one of the things that happened as a result of it, what was it? There were people all around the borders of the plains, many of whom were agriculturalists, who are farmers who ended up especially their young men, ended up abandoning farming because they realized that the potential for rising and status and for creating a better life was much higher if you match it up on a horse and rode out into the plains and hunted buffalo.

Speaker 4:          02:00:40       And so, I mean, there were entire groups like the crows had been relatives of demand. Dan's in the adult says, and had been agriculturalists and that entire group of people, uh, ended up abandoning farming, mattered up on horses, rode down to the planes, become buffalo hunters. I mean, during the period from basically about 17, 20, when a lot of the people in the west began to acquire horses. And the, the, what? Spread horses, as I mentioned earlier in our conversation, was basically in 16, 80, the Pueblo Indians down in New Mexico rose up against the Spanish colonists and drove them out of New Mexico. And in the process, they captured all their herds of livestock. They captured their goats, their sheep and their horse hurts and some animals. Some of the horses got loose and it's sort of the origin, at least one of the origins of the wild horses that spread across the West.

Speaker 4:          02:01:42       But the Pueblo Indians trade the sheep and the goats to the people who become the Navajos. They become herders of goats and sheep and they start trading the horses, which they have now in great surplus that they've liberated from the Spaniards up the mountains from one tribe to another, to the youth, to the shoney's, to the Nez perce, to the black feet, uh, to the essential ones. And then on out on the plains. And so from a 16, 80 through about 17, 20 or 70 slash 30, just about everybody in the west ends up getting horses. And you have to have the culture with it too. I mean, you can't just hand the animal over to somebody. And there's a famous story where the first horse that the blackfeet say they offer it buffalo meat to eight. And somebody has to say as a Kalispell, Indiana, who's riding the horses?

Speaker 4:          02:02:31       No, no, not buffalo meat. It eats grass. It grazes on. You have to feed it grass. And they have to be shown how to take care of horses and how to Gal stallions and how to ride them and how to break them and the whole bit. So there's a culture that goes with it, but once they acquire them, and this period that only lasts for about 200 years of the famous horse mounted buffalo hunting plains Indian emerges, that lifestyle becomes, which is kind of a backward step really in anthropological terms. You assume that, you know, you go from hunting to be in farmer and you go from farmer to being a city dweller. This is a step going back the other way, but it proved to be so compelling to so many people, as I said earlier, especially young men who often in these farming communities didn't have much opportunity for upward mobility, but you can mount up on that horse and ride out and become buffalo hunter and men, you know, the world was your oyster.

Speaker 4:          02:03:33       Wow. So was essentially the influence of the Europeans coming here and offering up the market and creating this environment where they were. It was really profitable now and so. And it became kind of something that native people almost couldn't escape. You couldn't get away from it because I mean, there were some groups that said, okay, we're not going to participate in this, you know, but that immediately disadvantaged them compared to the group right down the river. And so people who didn't participate, we're pretty quickly overrun by the people who became fully engaged in the horse hunt and the market hunt. And I mean there are instances where, I mean like the, the Su and people, you know, in the movies, the Lakotas, I mean they basically march across the northern West, like pac man, once they acquire horses, they come out of Minnesota and out of the woodlands and March across the West, gobbling up one tribe after another and taking away their buffalo hunting territory.

Speaker 4:          02:04:34       I mean, they're still doing it down to the time, the battle of the little big horn. That's why the crow's feet on the side of the United States at the battle of little big horn is because the lakotas are seizing their countryside. The Go Lakota is what they call themselves and other native Americans call them the Su, which means enemy and the word that we've used in history as the Sioux, but I mean I'm on the southern plains. The Comanche's did basically the same thing. They created this empire that was really on a par and able to compete with the Spanish empire, with the Republic of Texas and even for awhile against the United States and they created it around this. This horse propelled bison hunt that provided goods for the market economy. Now you were talking about steel arrowheads. Did they, or when did they start using firearms? While I started using firearms?

Speaker 4:          02:05:36       I mean, I was, uh, an early trade item and it was usually in the very beginning of, of contact between Europeans and native people. A firearm was, you know, maybe a couple of them were given to the headman to the leaders of particular tribe as a status item. One time I was an editor on a forum anthropological journal called Ethno history. And my task as a, an editor, I was a cyst, an editor, associate editor or something. But my task was to read the the incoming manuscripts that were submitted for publication, and one of the ones I read, I've never forgotten. This was an account by a trader in South America who was turning his trading post over to a newly arriving trader. I think they were Portuguese. And so this trader who had experience in the area was queried by the new guy, said, so how do I get the Indians to trade with me? And the guy who had been on the scene for a while said nothing to it, ride out 15 or 20 miles into the wilderness and take a steel ax

Speaker 1:          02:06:56       and

Speaker 4:          02:06:57       suspended from a rope from the branch of a tree

Speaker 1:          02:07:01       and then leave. And then

Speaker 4:          02:07:04       two weeks, three weeks later go back. And this guy, this new trader, did exactly that. And he went back two weeks later to the spot that's clearing in the forest and the Amazonian forest where he had tied this double bladed steel ax. And there were hundreds of native people gathered around the spot wanting more of these objects were or have these access. Because steel. I mean there's a famous. When Captain Cook first puts off the coast, off the Waimea coast of Hawaii and the Hawaiian people paddle there, outriggers out and climb on board his ships and immediately start pulling all the nails out of the planking on the ship and diving off into the water with the nails because they want metal. They realized this is such an advantage over the technology that they have. And so I mean, they're willing to trade what? What do you want for an x?

Speaker 4:          02:08:11       Wow, what do you want for a box of nails? So they just let the people know that the acs was a thing hanging from a tree, leaving for awhile, let him play with it and go back. Yeah. Wow. That's, that's a mindblower. So that's how how native people kind of all over the world who hadn't progressed to the iron revolution, to the Iron Age were seduced into the market economy, is that they were offered items that were so compelling. And as I have said a couple of times now, if you. If you didn't participate in it, you kind of within a decade you were disadvantaged because everybody around you was going to end up doing it and so you got caught up in it and so that's how. That's how what I was arguing in Bison ecology and vice and diplomacy m and and I, I the argument is slightly revised and American Serengeti, but it's the same argument and it's become the prevailing argument about what happened to bison and the 19th century is we used to think that okay, they were still 100 million of them by the end of the civil war and then guys go out with rifles in the space of 20 years.

Speaker 4:          02:09:27       They shoot them all down and that's the end of it for their tongues and further hides, but what the story actually is is a much more believable and real story that it has to do with the introduction of horses which drink water and graze grass and so that reduces the carrying capacity for Bison wants. There are two or 3 million horses out on the plains. There can't be as many bison anymore. It happens because there is a climate downturn in the 1840 [inaudible] for about 15 years. There's a drought and that reduces the carrying capacity for Bison. So climate plays a role. Um, we know that diseases like anthrax and ultimately brucellosis get among the buffalo herds and those diseases probably got among the buffalo herds because oxygen and other animals on the overland trails took these European exotic diseases out among the bison herds and infected them with disease.

Speaker 4:          02:10:27       And then there is no question that the way the market worked it was mean. And there's, of course no regulation of it. This is before we ever regulate, you know, we have any environmental regulations. It's just a free for all capitalist world also. No refrigeration, the refrigeration. So you had to kill it and eat it within a certain time period. So the, you can find a mate and that and that dry climate you can dry it and preserve some of it. But yeah, there's no refrigeration. So, you know, and I mean there's no refrigeration thing really plays a role in the [inaudible], the famous buffalo jumps that happen in the West because you know, you couldn't control how many animals were going to go off those jumps. And so if you wanted to run 10 off in order to provide you with buffalo for the next month and a half, your tribe of 125 with Buffalo Buffalo jumps.

Speaker 4:          02:11:22       Been running them off cliffs running off cliffs. Yeah. And you wanted to run off 10 and instead you got into a herd of, you know, 1300, 1300 and they all went off and it even became this thing. I mean we know about these buffalo jumps that people regard. Indian people regarded this as a stratagem that you don't want to let surviving buffalo go out onto the plains and inform other buffalo that there's this thing called a jump that you want to avoid. And so that they end up wanting to make sure that they get every single animal that you're driving so that you don't have buffalo go off and tell other buffalo how this works. But it's going to sound crazy, but it makes you wonder if it was ignorance on their part that the, these animals could communicate like that or if they had some sort of an intuition about how instincts and how, how certain fears that animals had were developed.

Speaker 4:          02:12:27       Well, I think, you know, and I, I spent some time talking about this and the Buffalo Chapter in American Serengeti, uh, it has to do with what we would call native science, what you mentioned at the last there that they do understand and they've probably seen examples of, you know, an animal learning very quickly how to avoid a trap. But it also has to do with the cause effect explanation that they have for how the world works and the, they don't have this kind of, you know, Western explanation for this is a cause and this is an effect they have on a cause effect relationship to be sure. But it explains the world in a different way. And Indian people pretty, pretty generally believed that bison were a people that they were a family of animals and they had families that were very similar to the families at any and people had and they had a controlling master animal, sort of a buffalo master who you had to appeal to to get the animals to give themselves up to humans for the good of humanity.

Speaker 4:          02:13:50       And so the idea was that you had this kind of, um, you know, a theory or tie to these animals. It was a tie that we would explain. Now looking back on it, we would say, okay, it's a religious thing. This was some sort of spiritual kind of understanding of how people and animals interacted with one another. But it was informed a little bit by kind of native scientific observation too. And I think in particular this one where the argument was, and it's from what I've read, it's been, it was pretty widespread that if you did a buffalo jump, you needed to kill all the animals that went off the jump. You couldn't let any of them get away. I think that probably was more in the line of kind of native science because they maybe had observed. They're being instances where an animal that had gone off a jump and had survived.

Speaker 4:          02:14:48       The next time you encountered that animal. It might be particularly marked with a white patch on a hip or something and a few months later you saw that particular animal and another group of Bison and when you try to do a jump, it led that hurt off in a different direction. And so I think there was kind of native science in that. But the. You know, where we got to and talking about this was no refrigeration. So if you ran 1300 of them off and it's August, then all you're going to get to do and you've got a group of 125 people. All you're going to get to do is to basically take the best pieces off about 25 or 30 animals and you're going to lose the rest of it. Because you can't preserve the meat of all those animals. So they find these sites where they'd just be masked carcasses or mass bones.

Speaker 4:          02:15:37       Oh yeah, yeah. There's a site in Texas, it's called a bonfire shelter site, and the reason it's called that anthropologists gave it. There are archeologists gave it. This name is because there was a bison jump that was so big there. We think about 10,000 years ago during the folsom period that and so many animals went off that jump and only a few of them could be harvested by the people who did the jump that that big mass of animals sat there and basically over two or three weeks of time burst into spontaneous combustion and scorched the cliff that they had gone off of. And so when whites first saw it, they thought somebody has built a giant bonfire at the of that cliff. Look at that. It's strict a hundred feet up the side of the cliff. Now, what archeologists realized about it when they begin investigating it was that it had been a huge mass of bison, driven off a cliff that had burst in hot weather and the spontaneous combustion and probably burned for four or five days. How does that happen? How did they, how do they burst into flames? Well, I mean in hot weather with that much decay and fermentation of all the juices that are in intestines and stomach, you basically create a condition where you've got flammable chemistry. That

Speaker 4:          02:17:09       lights put what causes the ignition? You know, who knows? I mean, I think it's the explanation I've read is spontaneous, but you know, somebody may have walked over with a torch and tossed it onto the pile of animals and burn them. Wow. Thousands of animals. Yeah. Thousands of them.

Speaker 2:          02:17:29       You know, it's interesting where you're talking about with. I'm explaining this idea that if one of them survived that they would inform the other ones. There was a study that was done recently on mice, and this is a direct genetic study, so it might not be totally related, but it might be in some ways they took these mice and they spray to citrus smell in their cage, and then when they smelled the citrus smell, they shocked them. They shock their feet. They had the bottom floor of the cage was electrically charged, and every time they sprayed that citrus smell, they would give them a zap. Then their ancestors who had never experienced this before, they did the same thing to them, just sprayed the citrus smell. And they had a physical reaction, a heightened sense of danger, fear, you know, they, they realized that a shock was coming just by the smell that citrus, they were terrified of it. Yeah. It makes sense that instincts are passed on.

Speaker 4:          02:18:29       Well, it does. I mean, we, we've sort of concluded from studies that have been done primarily in Italy, uh, over, uh, studying families through the generations and Italy that

Speaker 4:          02:18:47       descendants of a particular group of people will preserve evidence in their jeans sometimes four, five, six generations down. A timeline of an ancestor who went through a famine or a starving time, and so that famine would produce a physiological effect on the body and that would be passed down so that geneticists could discover effects of it several generations down the timeline. So it's sort of similar to what you're describing with, with mice and think that's probably, you know, we just said we haven't studied, at least I'm not aware that there had been a lot of studies of this kind of thing, but, uh, what it really kind of means is that we're the products, um, you know, in our modern world of things that happened to our ancestors maybe two or 300 years ago and maybe even the fears like they think that Arachnophobia and video phobia and a lot of the fears of snakes and bugs and things that people have might be directly attributed to ancestors being bitten or poisoned by those things.

Speaker 4:          02:19:59       Or a seeing someone getting bitten or poisoned by them. I mean, speaking of that sort of thing. And, uh, there's a section I do and when I'm talking about the development of poisons to try to eradicate coyotes, uh, and the, uh, cody America book where the reason during World War II we decided are the government what is now called wildlife services, um, this agency that was trying to solve the Predator problem by exterminating caio. He's, the reason they used our new chemical insights during World War Two to come up with new poisons a against coyotes, was that they began to realize that strychnine, which had been the poison of preference for the previous 70 or so years, was a poison that kill coyotes too quickly. And coyotes are really smart about cause and effect. And so a coyote that was in the presence of an animal that ate a bait cube and then suddenly went into convulsions.

Speaker 4:          02:21:06       And strychnine produced these really sort of bizarre and grotesque deaths that those animals would not take a strict nine bait after they saw that happen to one of their pack members. And so in the 19 forties, we came up with three new poisons. Uh, one of them was call a sodium. Uh, let's see, sodium, a floor Acetate, which is the one we now call 10 80, and it was called 10 80 and it was used for the next 19 that was in fact, it's still used in limited application today, but it was a poison that was developed after 1080 tries by this laboratory that assists 19 20th specialized in developing poisons to kill a wolves and coyotes. It's called the eradication methods laboratory. So 10 80, uh, another one, sodium foul medium was a poison that kill coyotes so slowly that they would often survive for a week after they ate the poison.

Speaker 4:          02:22:24       And in that week their pads would fall off, their hair would fall off, the village would come off their bodies. Uh, there's one story where a farmer in Colorado found during the winter of about 18 or 19, 47 or 48, he found seven or eight coyotes in his barn with no pads on their feet, no hair on their bodies, all huddled together trying to stay warm. She's, and he killed them with a pitch fork. Oh my God. But the reason we introduced these poisons, and there was a third one too, which was a cyanide, uh, basically the one that we call him 44 now that are little cartridges that fire assign I'd missed into their mouths is because these poisons killed them slowly enough that other coyote is witnessing the victim taking the bite of the poison bait. Didn't put two and two together. Wow. Yeah. I mean, so we ha. We even had these kinds of insights about how animals will observe something and preserve a memory of what they've seen and then try to actually come up with, with a poison that plays against that. Absolutely fascinating.

Speaker 2:          02:23:50       The whole, the whole subject. Absolutely fascinating. Listen man, I'm so glad we got together. I want to get you together with Randall Carlson though. Would you be interested in coming back and doing another shot? I'd love to do that. I would great to have you get together with him and compare notes because he has some really interesting observations about these asteroidal impacts and I think the two of you together would have a fascinating conversation. So let's do that down the line. But until then, your book, Coyote America is fantastic. I loved it. Thank you very much for that. And I'm going to. I haven't started reading yet, but American Serengeti is your other book. I'm sure it's equally awesome and I really enjoyed this. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Thanks for having me, man. It's been great. All right folks. See you next week. Bye.
