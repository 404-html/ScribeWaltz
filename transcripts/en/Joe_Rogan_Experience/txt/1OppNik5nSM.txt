Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Done Christine. We're live. We talked a lot before this podcast. We even said we weren't gonna talk. We're like, I don't want to talk to you too much. A lot of stuff to talk about, but Dan, we got into everything. Christie Brinkley, fibonacci sequence, Tony Robbins, Tony Robbins. We covered a lot of ground crime. Boyfriends as dogs, as protective dogs. Yes. Protect it. How did you get to become a life coach?

Speaker 2:          00:00:32       Oh Gosh, this wasn't the worst. No, no, no, no. It's just, it's not. I never planned on it and I don't really even like that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:39       That what's a good name? I haven't come up with a better name for it and let's come up with

Speaker 2:          00:00:43       maybe by the end of the show will come up with something better so that that's. That's your job. Joe Got my new title by the end of the show, so I started out in Hollywood. Actually. I moved out after college to La because mainly because growing up I was teased a lot. I was massively insecure and if you've got something to prove, Hollywood's a great place to come out here to like, oh, fucking show you. They'll show you. Yeah. I since I didn't fit in, I didn't have a lot of friends and boys didn't really ever like me unless they wanted to cheat off my paper. I became addicted to achieving and that's like, what can I be? I want to be somebody like if only I was somebody. How old was I? Oh Gosh, when it started, 10, eight, something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       That's when you started like wanting to prove yourself. Not

Speaker 2:          00:01:29       Teasing started happening and that's when I started to feel like I didn't really fit in and I needed to find a way to feel worth something. So overachieving kind of became my way to do that. And then at 10 I was diagnosed with depression and put on Prozac at 10. I know that's what we'll bookmark that combined. And so from a very early age, I really thought something was wrong with me. I didn't fit in and so I had to come up with these compensatory strategies to feel worthy, to feel validated. I feel like I mattered and so I just became like straight a student addicted to achieving, went out to college. I grew up in Texas, went to northwestern, graduated early and was just committed to moving to Hollywood and working my way up as an actor. I mean, as a kid, I was an actor.

Speaker 2:          00:02:16       I tried that for a little bit and then I was like, Whoa, this is way too much rejection. I can't deal with this. I want to go on the other side of the camera and pursue this career in Hollywood and I didn't know what exactly I was going to do. I thought I was going to be a producer or something like that, but I came out. I was 20 years old and I applied to the William Morris Agency to be an assistant. They're like, you have to go through the training program, which is like pushing mail carts around and I did not want to do that. So somehow I got a desk like really early and started working for the head of TV packaging and quickly learned I did not want to be an agent, just didn't like it. It was crazy long hours. I was treated poorly.

Speaker 2:          00:02:53       It was just a hellish job and it was a lot of selling and I didn't really like that either. So I left and actually went and worked on the show. You did? I did. I thought maybe I'll like production. So first season as the man show I was there, which was kind of a blast and also just crazy crazy show to work on. I mean Jimmy and Adam were always like super awesome to me, but I was a young girl, pa running around the jug dancers were everywhere. Like I just, I was like, what am I doing here? So I quickly got out of production and then started in comedy development at paramount and started scouting comedians and going to comedy clubs and finding people that I could represent and bring in, maybe get deals for them. And that quickly transitioned to moving to another company where I was doing comedy development and then I quickly fell back into being an agent.

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       So that was like my first career was like going to comedy clubs late at night. I'm at f two, I think, you know, with the first client. That was your first client. That's fine. I know Eddie very well was my very first client. We still keep in touch. He says hi. And that was like my life. So here I am now 24, 25, working at a big agency representing clients. I was the youngest female agent like in the department, maybe even in the city at that time, I don't know, it was really young, got promoted really, really super young and I was dating the head of a movie studio and I was living this amazing Hollywood life, like making a lot of money going to the Oscars and Golden Globes, private jets. Hanging out with celebrities, like I totally had it all, but I still wasn't happy. It was like I had achieved one thing and then there had to be the next thing.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       And then I did achieve this and then it had to be next thing you knew I'd get the guy, I still wouldn't be happy. I get the promotion still. I was on that constant chase and nothing ever was like doing it. So about two years I did this job, I'm still on antidepressants. I'm also taking antianxiety pills at the time and just like trying to like manage my life. And I was one of those people that I could really look good from the outside. I could seem like I had it all together and the inside was a totally different story. It's Kinda like a duck on water, you know, looks smooth. But underneath it's like, that's, that was what I was like. And you know, a lot of people ask me about how to achieve all this and still like suffer from depression. And I was a very functional depressed person.

Speaker 2:          00:05:17       Like a lot of people think if you're depressed you just lay in bed all day and watch soap operas or something. But that's not the, that doesn't, you know, summarize all depression. Like there's different ways it shows up. And so I was able to live my life, but I always felt like something was missing. I always felt like I wasn't enough and I just had this heavy, heavy energy and, and, and nothing I could achieve whatever, filling that gap. So let me keep going. So, uh, one day I was riding up in the elevator to work and I had basically a mini panic attack. I just couldn't breathe. I got off the elevator and I just couldn't catch my breath and was looking at. There was a lot weird foot painting and art in our office and I was looking at the weird photos and the one outside of my desk was this woman in a negligee who is nine months pregnant in this huge yard sale with a Ufo light shining down on her about to take her up.

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       And I'm looking at this painting. I feel like that's me. How did I get here?

Speaker 2:          00:06:18       Here? And I just, I walked, I went back down the elevator, walked around Beverly Hills and then came back upstairs and I just wanted to quit. All I wanted to do was quit. I thought that was the answer was just like, I quit my job and reinvent myself and start over, but I needed someone to give me permission and so I called my dad because my dad is has always been there for me and I'm like, Dad, I really want to quit this job. Can I? And He did a really good dad thing. Really pissed me off at the time, but it was a good dad move. You want to guess what he did,

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       so you get your shit together,

Speaker 2:          00:06:53       said I love you, but I can't make this decision for you. That is a good dad thing. Get that thing. And he hung up and I quit the next day and that was the first really big risk I ever took.

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       Why did you feel like you were the pregnant woman with a Ufo about to take you off in a flying saucer?

Speaker 2:          00:07:12       Felt confused and lost and like, I didn't fit in and like chaos and it's all wrong and how did I get here and what has happened?

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       Isn't it crazy that Hollywood has so many stories? I mean, not obviously, not exactly like yours, but so many stories of people who were rejected and who have decided they're going to come here to prove something or to get the love that they need and what do they run into. They're in the business of rejection for every. Most people don't really think about it because most people don't act, but if you try to act, you have to audition. If you audition, you're going to audition with hundreds of other people. They're all trying to get the same job and they treat you like hundreds of other people were trying to get the same job. It's the weirdest thing and people leave and they're just devastated. They're so confused. They get nervous before the thing and then they leave the thing and they feel so helpless. Yep. It's the. It's a strange, strange business

Speaker 2:          00:08:06       really is, and it's. It's so often not based on talent. No, it's so often not based on who's the best person for the job and that's what frustrated me as an agent and also one of the reasons I left. I had a deal that I put together Eddie. He was actually involved in it and my boss made me attach a show runner who like nobody wanted and but he needed the police of that client and it killed the shout and it killed these guys that opportunity

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       all the time, all the time, but happened to us. When I took over the man show, there was a show runner that there's this, this weird incestuous sort of fucking business in Hollywood of connecting people. It's almost more about being social than it is about anything else. It's about making these relationships almost like politics. You become beholden to these people and you get them jobs and they get you jobs and you all just feed off of each and y'all suck. It really happens a lot. It happens a lot with comedy writers. Yup. There's a lot of comedy writers that are just, you know, there are. They might have even been on Seinfeld or something like a great show and there's a few brilliant writers and there's a few that are like, what in the fuck is this guy doing here? Well, his agent is this guy's agent and that guy, agent force this guy in. If you get that guy, you get this guy too. And they make these deals.

Speaker 2:          00:09:20       Exactly. And that's what was so frustrating for me. If I'd have these really talented people and I couldn't, I couldn't get them jobs.

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       Why did they put you on Prozac at 10? Do you, were you an only child? No, no, no. I was the oldest, the oldest. How many kids? Just to.

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       And I think, you know, my, my parents loved me a lot and they just were doing the best they could and they were listening to doctors, you know, it was a time when, if a doctor tells you something, you listen,

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       what was bombing you out? Like, like what did, what was it the point where they were willing to put you on medication?

Speaker 2:          00:09:49       Well, I think I went from when I was little, I was really outgoing and talkative and happy. And then when the teasing and bullying started to happen, I completely just shut down. Like I shut off particular group of people that did it to one girl. Well, she's the one I wanted to mention when I won my Oscar that was, wanted to get up there and say get up there and then eventually, eventually I got over that, but I just, I, I really just shut down and withdrew and

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       so it's just like. Did you move to a different school or was it just one particular kid?

Speaker 2:          00:10:25       They wanted me. My parents were like, go to a different school, honey. Like, and I just wouldn't. I was, I was stubborn and I wanted to stay and I think I was just scared, you know, that's the thing. Like oftentimes what we know that's, that's bad is safer, feel safer than what we don't know that might be better at my had a comfort zone and where I was like, even though I wasn't really happy, like I knew that school, I knew, I was afraid that if I went to new school I would just have to deal with the same thing. So I was just like, I'll just stay where I am.

Speaker 1:          00:10:53       Isn't it crazy that you could run into the wrong person when you're 10 years old? And it could fuck you up for a decade or two.

Speaker 2:          00:11:00       Yeah. Yeah. But I think we, I mean, I don't know any human who hasn't had something in childhood or adulthood or whatever that is. We can call bad jamie. We're them. Perfect. Nothing's ever went wrong. Nothing's ever gone wrong with you. Just wait. It's coming from

Speaker 1:          00:11:15       smooth and calm. Young James collected. Yeah. No, everybody's had difficulties. It's unavoidable. But w, the bullying thing is very. It's very strange how prevalent it is and how it seems to be a part of human nature that people have some strange desire to find someone who's weak or who's insecure or who is. And then literally go after them and put yourself in front of them and fuck with them and ruin their life. Their shit. Let's go get her. Like that kind of shit is. It's a weird natural pattern that human beings follow. And I've always wondered like, we need to talk to God sad about this. Like what is the evolutionary basis for that? Like what is it about people that makes them want to do that? Especially young people.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       Bull, I don't, you know, and I think it's different with the white girls do it in the way boys do girls do it. It's, it's a little more sneaky and I think a lot of times it's based more on jealousy and that might have like, I don't know, that might have some girl unattractive. No, I think that um, I was, I was smart. School came easy for me. The teachers really liked me, parents liked me and so I think that that might have had something to do with it and again I don't know, you know, is 10, like I have no idea why they did what they did, but it was more sneaky like passing around notes saying I joined the I hate Christine club and like having everyone sign it and just kind of quietly doing it behind my back and pulling all my friends way where I think boys are just more aggressive. Like they'll, they'll beat you up, they'll put you in lockers, they'll do that, that kind of thing. But I think it's just a, a power thing and you know, within every bully as a scared little boy or little girl. So it's just, I think how we were always, not always, but so much of the time we're trying to compensate for something, you know, or refill less than where we feel insecure. We think if we can just have power over something or somebody else that's going to make us feel better.

Speaker 1:          00:13:08       There's also a thing that happens when like the I hate Christine Club thing where the other girls would probably like, I don't want to be on the end of that, so I'm going to join in. You get scared that they're going to go after you next and you want to be on the main team. I think that's what's going on with Donald trump. I really do. I think that's a lot of the reason why people are with him and for him he's, he's so vindictive and mean and the way it goes after people, I think you see a lot of people support him and sort of like, like cower to him. Like even that Megan Kelly chick who's a super brassy Badass ice princess, she did that interview with him after they had their little thing when she sat down with them and she was. She was so like submissive. It was weird. It was. I mean maybe we should try to keep her job. Maybe Fox News where the riot act, I don't know, but it was really bizarre to watch her tone down. You ever see?

Speaker 2:          00:14:02       See the followup interviews? Does. She didn't. She didn't call him out on anything.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       Thanks. She just. No, she was really submissive. It was, it was not what I expected it was. It was very orchestrated. I mean, I think it was kind of obvious at that point. I don't know if he had, he was the nominee or he was on his way. It looked like all the other nominees were falling apart and she did this interview with her and him sat in some office room, like sat across from a table and it was like people are scared. People are scared of, of the the strong man or strong woman, you know, the, the, the person who's going to go after you

Speaker 2:          00:14:37       or the unpredictable, like I think Donald is so unpredictable. You never know what he's going to throw at you and he, he will go to whatever lengths he needs to go to, to humiliate, to make you feel less than two to throw you off your game, you know? So she probably was just like, I better just,

Speaker 1:          00:14:54       well he just, he sues so many people and so many people sue him, his, that's his world, you know, and that's, that's like a normal thing for him. If he doesn't have a bunch of lawsuits floating around the world probably feels like nothing is even happening today. Going to gotta get something going. I got sue somebody crazy. But I think that that, that is one of the reasons why people like are attracted to him because they don't want to be on his bad side. I think people were terrified of them. You know, super billionaire, very famous, big, powerful guy. I think there's a bunch of people that, like with this, I hate Christine Club. If there was this one mean bitch that just wanted to go after you, there's probably a bunch of people that would want to side with her just because they're scared that she's going to turn on them and start going after them next. I think that's probably right. Yeah, for sure. It's, it's totally, it's, it's a tribal thing. It becomes this weird, like that's, that's our leader now. You gotTa, you know, a lot of leaders are the most vicious, mean, nasty, terrifying people, you know, look at the dictators in Russia or Putin or Kim Jong Una and what are they known for? The dictators and a lot of these Middle Eastern countries, they're fucking ruthless, ruthless people and everyone's scared of them. So the whole goal behind them, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:16:06       Yep. Better to be behind them, go up against them to feel the RAF. Yep. Yeah. I think fear is a big motivator unfortunately. And, and it I think impacts our ability to really think clearly about something because we're just so scared and so threatened that we, we stopped questioning, wait a second. Like what is he really saying? When is he really leading me to? Yeah. Because that's the thing with Donald and I talk to people who support him. I'm like, but do you do, do you understand? Like he would have more money if you were to just like taken the money. His father left him and invested it versus all the bankrupting he's done in the keys. There's just so much that doesn't make sense about him yet. I'm just like, okay, well

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       it's never been a man alive that needs mushrooms more than Donald Trump is. There is. I haven't heard of them. I mean, I'm sure. I'm sure there probably has been. But he needs him back. He needs to go straight to the Amazon. Yeah, you might need to go right there, but he needs something. It's just, he's, he's almost like this super impulsive huberous character. Yeah. You know, everything is like when Hillary Clinton says, you know, he doesn't pay taxes because. Because I'm smart, like he can't help, like you're on the deer at a fucking debate on TV. You said you're smart because you don't pay taxes. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:17:22       Really reflects. I mean it's not just him like it really reflects like where we are as a society that enough people support him to get him to the place that he is. I think we're so polarized right now and like, look, I don't really love either candidate to be honest. I just don't. But I think that. I hope that maybe this is just wishful thinking that will have four years of whoever it is. I think it will be hillary and then in the next election we'll have people run that we're actually excited about supporting and voting for

Speaker 1:          00:17:52       maybe, but I don't see those people anywhere. The job one wants the job. That's the problem. It's a crazy job and it's a job where they try to destroy you if you run for it, you know, and you're seeing that with, with trump and you're seeing that with hillary and they're pulling out all the stops and by the time it's over, the opinion of the commander in chief, it's going to be terrible no matter who wins. Right? I mean there. I mean that Crooked Hillary thing is going to stick forever. Hashtag Crooked Hillary. That's gonna stick forever and People's opinion of him is horrible. You know, it's no matter who wins and she's going to win, most likely, but it's not good. It's not good for any of us. Nope. It doesn't represent what we think of the United States as we think of the United States as being this unbelievable place of creativity and innovation and the greatest superpower the world's ever known and this, you know, this really progressive force for good in the world. And you know,

Speaker 2:          00:18:51       I don't know, maybe we need to go through this time though to shake it up a little bit. Maybe things need to get bad to get better. I mean, I see that in human psychology so much, you know, you need to hit rock bottom, you need to go through these hard times so you have something better emerge that maybe that's just wishful thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       No, I think you're probably right. I think we also needed to understand because of the wikileaks revelations, like how exactly politics is run. Even with the people we think that are the good folks, like it's all fucking gross and dirty and all the stuff with the Clinton Foundation and all the stuff they did to Bernie sanders and they conspired to keep that guy out and there's. I mean he's a Democrat too. There are a whole. The whole thing was supposed to be about who is the person that best represents the people with the people choose, but now the Democratic National Committee was fucking working to make sure that Bernie Sanders wasn't the guy and they were all conspiring with Hillary and they're all pulling favors. This just like we were talking about before with producers and networks. It's the same shit. It's just using your power and your influence and all the friends that you've made and all the years and all the favors and and pulling it together, but now we're being exposed to it in a way that we haven't really, since Watergate, Watergate gave us like a little window, a tiny little window, but the access to information was so minuscule back then, like we clung to those 15 minutes of whatever, Watergate tapes, whatever it was, and we look at this.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       I'm not a crook. He was doing what they were all doing. He just got caught and we got to. We got a sense of it now, but now when you read these emails, but how they really feel about each other and all the fucking gross list that goes on.

Speaker 2:          00:20:35       Well, I try to not engage too much in the gross ness because it's just like, what's the point?

Speaker 1:          00:20:41       I guess the point is to understand what the world really is about. What the structure, the government that looms over us is really all about. Why are certain things legal? Why certain things illegal? Why are certain loopholes in place? How did they get in place? Who benefits from them? What is a charity and if it is a charity, how come you get paid so much? Like how come you get paid $250,000 to speak and then all this money goes to your charity, but that $250,000 goes to you. Like you just talked for an hour. Like this is a scam,

Speaker 2:          00:21:14       but that's the thing like you're asking, you're being curious, being curious. You're asking questions and I think that's helpful. I think what so many people are doing or just getting mad and just trash talking in America and the candidates and and that doesn't do any good for anybody. If you want to like ask questions and get involved and start to get curious and quest, that's, that's awesome. That's how we change things, but I think too much of this has just been so emotionally driven that people are just getting upset and not really going home. What can I do? What can I learn? How can I shift this in some way?

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       Yeah. It's also people are like super psyched to get behind their candidate. Third team. I got to tell you like there's a lot of gross on both sides for sure. There's a lot of grossness on the trump side. There's a lot of mean assholes that have finally found another mean asshole that's running for president and they're pumped like he's one of them, but then there's a lot of men who are using Hashtag. I'm with her and they're the grossest little fucking white knights. Oh my God. I've run across a few of them on twitter, like a white knight. You don't know what a white knight is. How dare you. You really don't know like a knight in shining armor. A man who comes along comes along and positions himself as the superior morally superior to call Michael Shermer calls a virtue signaling as someone who would would say Hashtag, I'm with her Hashtag male feminist, you know, Hashtag.

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       That's real. There's a lot of those out there. Yeah, they. They're trying hard. They couldn't get laid in any other way, and this is, this is the strategy. There was the strategies to position themselves as the super progressive. Yeah. It's like people who don't want you to think that they're racist, so they go out of their way to discriminate against white people, other white people when they're white. I read this thing with this woman was saying, if you are a white person and you were up for a job and you are up against a person of color, do period not period. Take that job. You don't deserve it. Examine white privilege. I was like, oh my God, what Liberal Arts College do you belong to? What fucking crazy shit is in your head? Like what? I don't get it at all. Period. Not Period. Take that job. Yeah, well you don't have to get it. We went on a tangent. We went off. We were trying to find out how you become a life coach and all of a sudden you're talking politics,

Speaker 2:          00:23:40       White, White Knights. I love it. I love it. Yeah, and now I now I know a whole new understanding of white nights. Well, I always understood it as, you know, the man who's going to come in and rescue

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       that would, they're positioning themselves as that, but that, you know, I think we're a couple decades away from all this going away because I think technology is going government going away, all bullshit, all bullshit and lies. I really believe this. I think technology is going to enable just like no one anticipated. As you can go back to the first days of cameras, if you went back to the 18 hundreds, they first had a camera. No one would have ever thought that in the lifespan of just. I mean, what was the first camera? Jamie? Like 18 slash 60, something like that. Like civil war era was like the first cameras. No one would've ever thought that in two lifespans, which is essentially what it is from then to now, you'd be able to send video to Australia instantaneously from something that slips into your pocket, find blind when he like, stop

Speaker 2:          00:24:44       to think about how much we've seen in our lifetime.

Speaker 1:          00:24:47       Yeah. I think we're just so used to it. We're so used to google and the Internet and when Hillary Clinton was telling like Donald Trump said something and she's like, Google it, Google what? He said, it's not true, and it was like how hilarious is that Hillary Clinton is telling people to Google Donald trump. Like that's, that's how beautiful access to information is today. I think we are a couple decades, maybe a little bit more away from a completely new paradigm, a completely new way of accessing information. I think we're going to submit to something, whether it's a neural implant or some sort of augmented reality and we're going to be able to read intention and thoughts. It's going to be there's not gonna be any lying 100 years. I really believe that.

Speaker 2:          00:25:33       Totally think you're right. And I think that's why we're seeing so many of these systems break down like the presidential election, which used to be this coveted amazing thing. Now we're kind of looking at it like it's, it's a reality TV show. That's what it seems like now

Speaker 1:          00:25:46       is all pussy grabbing, craziness, craziness. That's the believe that

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       first, like 20 minutes of the second debate. Well, I had been out of the country for a month, which was so refreshing and to come back and I watched it and the first 20 minutes was just character slams. It was nothing about nothing, about the issues or anything and I was just like, what, what's, what's happening?

Speaker 1:          00:26:09       That doesn't make me happy. Like it doesn't make me feel like if he shits on her, she shits on him and she, she tears him down. It doesn't make me feel like she's better. I liked her and one of the debates because I didn't tune into it until the last hour and he was saying a bunch of crazy shit and she would start laughing. I was like, that's how she should handle him. She should handle him like he's a child. Like if she did that, but she's fucking crazy too. So depending president of another tangent, lots of fantasy life coaching. How, how do you go from.

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       All right, so we're running mad at both of us, by the way. I'm sorry. Suitable politics. Yeah. How about you just shut the up. I will totally own that. I, that's not my area of expertise. That's what nobody knows shit about politics, even the people doing it. That's why Donald Trump's running for fucking president, nobody saw that common, you know, and nobody understands this stupid system. Yeah. But You understand life coaching. I see. Yes. We're going to come up with a better name, but her name and that's our live coaching. Yes. But, so the way it happened is

Speaker 4:          00:27:13       um, all right, so I quit my job, which threw me into an even worse depression because that was my whole identity, like it was my success in being an agent. And so then in a period of, I don't know, like six to eight months, a bunch of things happened, I went into lots of debt because I tried to keep up with this lifestyle. I, um, was a strange from my family for a bit because I made a choice that they didn't really like. And I got diagnosed with another autoimmune disorder on top of everything else. And then I was engaged and thought, oh, I'm going to be a wife. Like that's my next role. I'll be fine. And then six months before my wedding, he dumped me cultivating. So I in that, you know, I know people listening to I've been through worse, but in that like span at 26 years old, losing my career and money and family and health and love, it was Kinda like this sucks like this.

Speaker 4:          00:28:02       I really didn't know what to do. And I had honestly a moment on my bathroom floor, which I don't know why I was on my bathroom floor was disgusting, but she was laying there. It's a good spot to cry the tiles and nice and cold, you know, it feels very dramatic and I had this like kind of insight I guess you could say, of how much I was relating to everything as a total victim as like everything was happening to me. And then it dawned on me I'm the common denominator in like all of these situations. So either I have just really bad luck or I have some influence over this. And again, like it was just a teeny bit of an insight. But it was enough of a new perspective on my life that kind of got me off the bathroom floor and started to give me some kind of hope and started to make me realize I needed help and like I, the way I was doing my life wasn't going to work anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:29:00       And so I found, I thought I was having a quarter life crisis and I found a book by that name and I read it and it was fine, but it wasn't going deep enough for me. So I decided to write a book about like my experience and everything I was learning and how I like was getting myself off my bathroom floor I guess. And I was interviewing people for the book and they kept saying things to me like, can I set up a session with you? And I'd say why I got all the information. And they said, well, aren't you a coach or a counselor or something? And I'd say no. And they said you should be, you should be, you should be, you should be. And I kept hearing this over and over and over again. So I went to my coach and kind of my first teacher who I met when I was 22 and I was still seeing, she has had a major impact in my life and I said, Mona, you know, everybody's telling me I should do this and I've been looking for my career for years, maybe this is what I'm supposed to do.

Speaker 4:          00:29:50       She's like, Yep, Yep, that's what you're supposed to do. And I got out, I've been coming for five years, like, why didn't you tell me this? And she said, you know, you had to figure it out, you had to find it. And so that's how it just started. Like people kept reflecting back to me, hey, you're good at this, you should do this. And I didn't really know how or what. And so then I just became, I started studying it. I apprenticed with her, I got training, I got a master's degree, I wrote more books and it just sort of happened out of my own life and out of just creating things that I thought would help people and people going, actually, this is really helping me and can I talk to you more? And that was, you know, a good 10, 11 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       Have you pushed the mic forward a little bit more and make the sound consistent? It's, it sounds good in your ear. Just the recording. You'll be weird. It is an interesting thing that it's oftentimes small choices that people make that dictate what happens to them in their life. But if you just decide that things are happening to you, you don't take any responsibility for any of the choices.

Speaker 4:          00:30:49       That's, to me the biggest difference are people who are able to change their life and people who don't is ownership, is realizing that yes, things happen but we're not victims and anything can happen, but at the same exact thing happened to you and I and we can make different choices about what we make it mean and how we respond to it and we're going to create different results based on that. So it's not what happens to people. It's not just luck. It's truly what are you going to choose to believe about it. And that's to me the key differentiator between staying where you are and kind of regressing as you get older and just repeating you're familiar patterns and prints and repeat life and more stubborn and all those things and you know, just looking for those short term bursts of happiness and like a trip or a bottle of wine or whatever versus like really getting clear about how you can change your life, what your purpose is, what brings you joy and like who you really are.

Speaker 1:          00:31:45       There's a thing about life coaching to or any, but I mean, just to forget that word, but the idea that your dispensing advice or giving out inspiration or you know, writing things down that have affected and helped an enhanced you, people want to dismiss that stuff like, oh, I don't need that. Oh, that's nothing, but I feel like one of the best things about being a part of a community or being a part of a culture is that you get to look at all of the things that people have done that have benefited them and all of the, the positive choices that someone is made and you can learn and experience those without having to go through all their bullshit. Yeah. You know, and there's a lot of things that I've learned from people whether I've read things that they've said or listen to speeches that they've given about mistakes that they've made.

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       Where I've come across a similar moment in my life when my ob, I've, I know what this is, I know what that is. It's, I think it's one of the best tools that we have. When, when, when it comes to improving and enhancing your own life, your own individual experience is looking at all the different shit that other people have done and it's a. it's a weird one because people dismiss it so easily. They don't, first of all, they dismiss it at A. There's a certain amount of Hubris and a certain amount of ego attached to it where they don't want to admit they have an issue or they don't want to admit they need help or they don't wanna admit that they need to be inspired or they need some sort of motivation.

Speaker 4:          00:33:13       I think it's. Yeah, I think it's fear. Yeah. That whole, this life that I know is comfortable. I may not like it, but I'm so scared of uncertainty that I don't want to make the changes. You know, people are terrified of the unknown.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       There's also a lot of fuckery of foot when it comes to life coaches and motivational speakers and there's a lot of hosers like we were talking about before, the podcast, about a couple of hoses. We know there's hosers out there and those people, but it's like everything else. Like, you know, there's bad car mechanics, you know, they'll put a used part and your car and fuck you over this. There's bad doctors, there's bad everything. Everything in this world as someone who's half passing it. And the problem with that whole, the idea of being a life coach or being a motivational speaker is that there's not really, like, you don't have to get a phd to do it. You don't have to, you know, you don't have to like prove yourself. Like Mike has opened up 15 different businesses, so he's going to show you how to do a business. Like this guy's a successful businessman. That makes sense. But there's a lot of people out there that are doing life coaching that are fucking failures. Yeah. And maybe maybe that's not the worst thing in the world to be a failure because you've learned from those failures and maybe your achievement or your contribution is expressing those failures and your revelations from those failures and that can help somebody else not make those same mistakes.

Speaker 4:          00:34:36       Yeah, I mean, I think I've had a lot of so called failures and mistakes. Um, did you ever have one of those like bathroom floor moments? So it's like life pivot. Oh Man. First of all, check on the floor.

Speaker 1:          00:34:50       Yeah. I mean I'm not all bullshit aside. Yeah. Yeah, there's always um, for, for a comic, the big one is bombing. Bombing on stage is devastating and you start thinking like, I can't, I can't do this. Like you can only take so many of those bombings in your life. It's like getting beaten up. You can only get beaten up so many times before, like your brain stops working. Right? And there's that relationship breakups for sure. Um, devastations I think are always the best for a rebirth. And at the time they don't feel like it. No. And devastations anything devastating that happens to you in your life while it's happening. You feel like, I don't know if I can take this, but then you get through it and you have this sort of enhanced perspective. And then you also, we live in an amazing time where you can see, you know, not that you should revel in other people's failures, but you could like, look what most of your failure is. Nothing in comparison to what's going on in a million like Syria or million different parts of the world that are just filled with fucking chaos. Most people can't see that because you see your life and your life is all, you know when your life is falling apart.

Speaker 4:          00:36:05       Right. Well, and I think too, you know, we get so kind of narcissistic and our problems that we forget the bigger perspective and we don't. A lot of people talk about being happy all the time. You should be. And I just don't think that that's real. I think that you, I've grown and I through contrast through, you know, I, I think I really understand happiness, enjoy because have really understood depression and sadness. Like that polarity I think is such a big part of what we're here for.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       Yeah. I mean you look at your read a book about different parts of the world and what's going on. You if you're still happy to read that book, something wrong with you, you know, like, probably shouldn't be happy all the time. There was actually, I think it was scientific America or something like that that had an article recently saying you're not going to be happy all the time and you shouldn't be. And there's an a, there's a reason for it. There's peaks and valleys in everything in life.

Speaker 4:          00:36:59       Yep. And that I, you know, for people listening that might be in one of those valleys, it's like, don't try to just get through it, really ask, you know, why, what can I learn from this? That was my biggest thing is I stopped asking why is this happening to me? And started asking, what can I learn?

Speaker 1:          00:37:19       Yeah. So instead of painting yourself as a victim, you paint yourself as someone who's present in the moment and just, okay, I don't want to do this anymore. Let's figure out what's going on.

Speaker 4:          00:37:27       Exactly. And we don't. A lot of times we don't have the tools and that's where things like life coaching and personal development come in handy is cause we can go and get those tools instead of using our old coping mechanisms by like being strong or overseen overworking, overdrinking over, do you know, jumping into a relationship like whatever it may be. We, we don't really learn how to deal with disappointment, failure, anger or shame, any of those things. And so we're kind of left to these quick fix devices that in. I think that's a big reason addiction is such a problem is because we don't really learn how to manage emotion and how to manage this appointment. And so we go for that thing that makes us feel better in the moment. But the problem is we have to keep upping the ante. You know, at first that one glass of wine does the trick, but then you need to then you need three, then you add vodka, they whatever it may be.

Speaker 4:          00:38:17       And so I, I mean, why I'm so passionate about what I do is, first of all, I never, I never thought I could be happy. Like I really didn't. I thought that this, you know, I was going to be depressed and I just was gonna constantly be looking for something to fix me. I never really truly thought this life that I'm living now was possible. Again, externally things look fine. But internally I'm talking about a totally different kind of experience and it's only because of those like really awful moments. I call them expectation hangovers that I was kind of desperate enough to let go of my normal coping mechanisms and my trying to control everything. It was like the ultimate and surrender truly of going okay. Like I don't, I don't know, I need to find a different way to deal with this. And that's really what has led me down the path that, that I am today. So, you know, I, I think that life coaching and the personal transformation industry and all that. Like you said, there's a lot of, what'd you call them? Hoke cookies.

Speaker 3:          00:39:24       Posers, posers, Bob and Doug. Mckenzie, I don't even know who that is. Fucking 19 eighties. Siren live character for college to the posers there from a Canada. Oh my God. It hoser mean those guys. I don't know why. Why hosers learning all these words. This is great. Why hoser? I don't know why that. I hardly ever use that. I don't know why it popped up. I love it. I want to go back to the. The PROZAC? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because I'm super. Your parents put you on that stuff when you're 10 years old. I think it was more the doctors. Doctors. I'm sorry, your doctors put you on that stuff when you were 10 years old. Tests and blood tests. What do you see a demon? What do you see? Death. What do you see? A skull? I probably said things like a butterfly of pitch. I hate from school with fucking ax in her head. So the doctor puts you on PROZAC. And what kind of an effect does that have on you? I mean, it actually helped.

Speaker 4:          00:40:18       It really helped. I think it helped me. Um, gosh, it's so hard to remember too. I mean, I was 10, but when I talked to my parents about it, they're like, you know, it did help because I really do think that because of everything that happened, you know, my brain chemistry did shift, you know, I do think that we can shift our brain chemistry with repetitive thoughts and you know, I had enough thoughts about, you know, I'm not likable. I had just intense inner critic in my head and I do think that shifted my brain chemistry and I do think that the medicine helped me at least get to a point where, you know, I was like kind of awake again. How long does it take? I don't remember, but I know that, you know, especially in my twenties, like I'm still on it. Oh Gosh, I was on it until 30. Yeah, I was on every from every. I was on Prozac, Wellbutrin

Speaker 3:          00:41:12       for many years. 20 from the time you were 10. So all through high school you run that stuff?

Speaker 4:          00:41:18       Yep. Wow. Yep. I, I believed that I needed it just like a diabetic would take insulin. So how long ago did you get off of it? A seven and a half years ago. Wow. And, and like totally, I, I never have any regression or dips but I did. I was super intentional about getting off of it. I didn't just stop like, especially after 20 years. It took me a while. It took a lot of the emotional work that I was doing with my coach Mona because so much of depression is suppression so you know, and all that stuff was happening. I think I was pretty angry about it but I had no outlet for that, especially as a girl like boys again can go out and get stuff out. But a lot of times, and this is why I think so many women get irritable and bitchy and all those kinds of things is because women, we don't have like that outlet for anger.

Speaker 4:          00:42:07       And so we internalize a lot of that. Like we can do sadness but anger a lot of times gets suppressed. And so a lot of like me getting off my medicine and not feeling depressed was not being suppressed. Exercise the exercise is okay, but until you like go back and actually process the emotion. I mean, exercise is good in terms of moving the energy, but a lot of times you have to attach like the feeling with the movement, right? So like a lot of my retreats that I do where I just bring women, I facilitate like an anger barn for them, anger, burn, what is that? It's like a safe place for women to get their anger out. Like, and it's not just catharsis, like there's a whole kind of process I put them through so they like, you know, kind of reconnect maybe earlier life experiences where they didn't feel protected or they felt unsafe or they felt you know, abused or whatever that is.

Speaker 4:          00:43:01       Because again, like this is just, this all comes from my own life experience in working with, Gosh, thousands of people at this point. Like I, I see over and over again. People that are depressed, shut down, have a lot of anxiety, not happy with their life, have some like, unprocessed thing from their past that just needs to move. And when I create this space for people to start to move that energy, it's like underneath there is creativity and passion and peace and freedom from anxiety and all that kind of stuff. So when you're looking at me like he's looking at me like, who is this girl? So when people have that space to unleash that and to let the energy move through them because I think there's a difference between emotion and feelings. So feelings to me, our physiological responses to thoughts. Okay. So if I sit here and think about the future of that I'm scared about, I'm going to feel anxiety.

Speaker 4:          00:44:08       If I have like, oh my gosh, what if someone breaks into my house tonight, I'm going to feel fear. You know, if I, I can, I can feel regret because of a thought or guilt. But, but emotion like energy in motion, if someone hurts one of your kids, you're going to experience anger. You know, like it's a natural response. Someone close to us dies or we have a heartbreak. It's natural to feel the emotion of sadness. And I think that there's a lot of kind of misleading information about like, oh, we create all our feelings with our thoughts and we can just affirm our way out of things and think our way out of things. And to some degree that's true. Changing our thinking does a lot. But with, with some core emotions like anger, shame, sadness, I think we got to feel them and I think that that's what people are really scared of is actually kind of opening that box, opening that can of worms and going back and actually feeling those feelings. But the thing is they're in there. And so if you don't get them up and out in a healthy way, then I think that's what creates a lot of suppression, a lot of depression, perhaps, maybe even disease, things like that because they just get stored in our body somewhere. It makes sense. So what do you do to these gals?

Speaker 4:          00:45:20       What do I do to these gals? Um, I, it's just creating the space. They just scream, well, you know, it's not a pill. No, it's not that I give them. I definitely give them something to hit with, like in those foam noodles, you know, that I do and oh gosh, the comments to this are going to be crazy. I can't believe this, but here we go. So I um, and I put on some pretty intense music and again, I don't even know. Not slayer, not slayer. Slayer. It's more like, it's more like metallica. Metallica is on my playlist. I'll, I can pull up my place. I really want to see it. Um, you have a beat the shit out of a foam roller. Oh, for sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's cool. Anger, burned platelets. Anger, burned playlist. Yeah. Well I'm telling you a little bit about actually.

Speaker 4:          00:46:16       So one time I was doing this, I rented a house actually out in the near here, a Gaura and people were doing this process and again, like I prep them, like the, you know, I, they, they bring to mind things that they've maybe, like I said, like we're angry about things from their childhood, you know, it's not just like a throw them in a room with loud music and say go after it. Like they're very, there's a lot of processes I put them through to get them to this point. But anyway, so we're doing this one time in this house and there's like 20 women, loud music yelling and um, the cops show up and the guy's like, what do you like, what's going on here? And I step out, I stepped out and I explained, I said, you know, a lot of times I, this is a women's workshop and a lot of times, you know, we, we hold back our emotions and you know, we ended up getting irritable and it's just as healthy way for people to, to heal and work on their emotions.

Speaker 4:          00:47:13       And the cop looks at me and he's like, can I have your card? I want to send my wife. No kidding. That's what the cop said to me. So is. And I've gotten lots of calls from husbands and boyfriends and even kids and like thank you because there's something about, it's like pulling off our armor honestly. And there's something about doing like the deeper work and kind of going to those scary places that takes a layer off of us. I think, I mean it's similar to plant medicine, a lot of ways of going to those places where that are Kinda like, hmm, where you come out the other side and you have a deeper understanding of, of yourself. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:47:58       so by doing something completely ridiculous and crazy and just letting loose and all the madness involved with it, it's almost like a reset

Speaker 4:          00:48:06       for you. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not, again, like it's facilitated. It's not this, this crazy, you know, people going into screaming, it's not fight club. It's not because there's a difference between catharsis and like actual processing stuff, but it's just. And again, I think we, we don't really understand emotion to a certain level and we think that big emotion is crazy and it's not necessarily. I think what is crazy, what makes people crazy is suppressing it their whole life and trying to manage it through their mind or through doing things or through whatever else versus actually like being willing to look at those parts of ourselves because we're, you know, we're humans. We have a mind, we have emotions, we have actions, we have, you know, our spiritual self, whatever you want to call that, like something that's connected to something bigger than us and I think we need a holistic approach to really change.

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       No. From the time that you decided to get off of the antidepressants, did you follow a protocol? Did you go to a doctor to discuss it with them? Did you read anything about how to do that and what advice would you give to anybody out there that might be listening that also is going through that same sort of situation?

Speaker 4:          00:49:21       Um, doctors told me I couldn't do it, so yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:49:24       definitely good doctors ever stay on and I'm getting paid exactly.

Speaker 4:          00:49:28       Um, so I had, you know, my coach at the time, he was really helpful who more than, again, like coaches such like a, I don't even know what to call her. She was, how did you find her? I was dating a guy who was an addict and complaining about him to girlfriend at lunch for like the 80th time. And she said pill. No drugs like coke, alcohol, maybe pills and pills to fun times. Good Times. Hollywood. Super Great. Yeah. I was popping xanax while he was doing all that. So anyway, I, I'm, I've totally lost my train of thought. Oh, how'd you find your coach? Oh yeah, yeah. I had to find a coach. So we're sitting at lunch. I'm talking about this for the 80th time and she goes, I can't, I can't listen to this anymore. I went and saw this kind of cookie woman go see her.

Speaker 4:          00:50:22       So and I had been to shrinks my whole life and I'd never been to like a coach. I had always been to therapists and psychiatrists and so nothing against therapists and psychiatrists. They do good work, but I had kind of like reached my limit with it and so I go to this woman's house and she's like totally stuck in 1985, like her decor, her fashion, everything. And I sit down and I sit across from her and she didn't even see me in a normal office. I think she knew she needed to like totally get me out of my comfort zone. So she put me in her son's bedroom with like these race car bunk beds and I'm sitting there on this race car, bunk bed, the going, where am I, how did I get here? And she walks in and she sits in front of me and it was the first time in my life and I felt loved by my parents.

Speaker 4:          00:51:05       This was the first time in my life I felt really seen, like it was almost uncomfortable. Like this woman could almost see through me. She could see me, she could really see me and I felt zero judgment from her, like zero and although is scary and a little bit because it was like kind of, I felt very vulnerable if there was something so reassuring about it because she was the first like practitioner I had seen that didn't see me as broken. She really just saw me and she was the one that in so many ways helped me over the years, get off the medication by teaching me how to release my emotions. Um, by helping me understand that, you know, bad feelings aren't necessarily bad. I also got very clear about my diet, like I got off gluten because a lot of times gluten can impact brain chemistry.

Speaker 4:          00:51:55       Um, I stopped drinking. I wasn't never a big drinker, but I stopped drinking for about two years because alcohol's a depressant. I'd always been into exercise and fitness and eating healthy and everything like that. Um, and then I also started meditating and like finding some kind of connection to a higher power. I didn't really have a name for it at the time, but something where I didn't feel like I was so alone because that was kind of one of the scary things about depression, you feel you feel alone a lot of the time. And so it was a combination of all of those things that over time and the belief that I could, I really had to change my belief that I could get off of them. Um, so for people that are considering it, um, don't just stop, like, it's dangerous just to stop because that can really mess with your brain chemistry. Find somebody who knows something about this and can put you on a plan, can help you, you know, I'm not a doctor, I'm not here to get met, get given medical advice so, you know, consulted doctor. Um, but for me it was number one, the belief that I could and number two, finding the people that could really support me and number three, making the lifestyle changes that I needed to make to support it and being willing to go to that dark, scary place that I was afraid to go to.

Speaker 1:          00:53:16       What do you mean by when you say that she was the first person who didn't see you as broken? Do what do you mean by they all? They all saw you as broken

Speaker 4:          00:53:27       when, you know, for me, when I would go to one of these doctors or therapists, I mean they'd see that I was on medication since I was 10. And um, they kind of relate to me in that way.

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       Like as a person? No, just more like, like I had a label, you're depressed. And so that's why they weren't willing to consider you getting off of the medication. He felt like the medication is a part of who you are. You've got to accept it. It's a daily thing. It's like brushing your teeth. You're not going to stop.

Speaker 4:          00:53:57       Yeah, maybe. I mean, I don't even know what they were thinking and I just know how it felt and I just did it and it maybe it was because like at the time I didn't believe it yet either. Maybe I need to someone who believed in him.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       I do think that also the people that deal with people everyday, whether you're a psychologist or a psychiatrist or whatever, that you're so inundated with people in their fucking problems that after a while you just become overwhelmed and it's very difficult to see people like and have a fresh reset. Every time you see something like this is a new person. Her name is Christine. Hey Christine, what's going on with you?

Speaker 4:          00:54:28       Yeah, I think you're right. I think it's therapists, psychiatrists. They have hard jobs. Like imagine your whole day is person after person talking about what's wrong with their life. You know that that can be very draining. Even when I first started as a life coach and I saw person after person after person, I really had to learn not to take that on and not to let it drain me. Um, so again, like I have a lot of respect for my mom's a therapist, so I have a lot of respect for therapists and psychiatrists are very helpful to me. I just think for me in my life journey and what I wanted, I, I just, I didn't want to spend the rest of my life medicated. I just really didn't.

Speaker 1:          00:55:11       So what is the difference between life on medication and life off medication and how long has the process of weaning herself?

Speaker 4:          00:55:17       I mean, I think it took me, it took me a good two years to feel like it was finally kind of out of my system.

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       Two years. How long was it before you were actually stopping taking it?

Speaker 4:          00:55:32       Um, well I, I, Gosh, I can't remember exactly, but I think I, I probably weaned for a good six months and then it was like a year and a half until I felt like it was like cleared out of my system.

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       Wow. So for six months you slowly wean yourself off of it and then at the end of six months you're not taking the medication anymore, but you still feel foggy. Like what do you feel?

Speaker 4:          00:55:52       Yeah, I wish it was, it was like my system was recalibrating, you know, all my brain chemistry was recalibrating and you know, because that stuff affects your brain chemistry. It affected my hormones, like it, it just affected a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:56:04       So did you take like one pill and then cut it down to three quarters of a pill?

Speaker 4:          00:56:10       I did consult to a psychiatrist and um, they gave me like a winning plan. So yeah, whatever, different people, like it's not a standard thing, like different psychiatrists will tell you different things. So it depends on what you're on, how long you've been on it, which medication you're on, what the side effects for for it are those kinds of things. What does it feel like when you're first day? No pills. Do you remember that day? I remember the first day I woke up and I felt clear like I felt like scientology clear. I don't want to keep getting kicked out of here.

Speaker 4:          00:56:46       No, I'm like, like, like it was like out of me and I was like, oh my gosh, I just felt like a fog and a heaviness had lifted. It just fell. And I also felt like I had deeper access to my creativity, my intuition and all those things were present, but it was just, there was just sort of like some white noise there. And I also like for me, depression manifested as being incredibly self critical, like super self critical, like this very, very, very loud inner critic. And so that started to lift too. But again, I was doing all kinds of other work at the same time. You know, I was studying with my life coach, I was getting a master's degree in spiritual psychology. I was, what is spiritual psychology? Yes. Good question. So um, this place called the University of Santa Monica and I didn't know anything about this place but I had been a life coach and I thought okay, if I'm helping people with their life, I've got to know how to help them deal with their past.

Speaker 4:          00:57:47       Like I can't just work on present and future without like having some skills for dealing with your past. And so I was researching schools. I thought if I could get a master's degree in psychology that would help me and that would be good for my career and all those things to have some credentials. So I researched and I find this school and I didn't really know anything about it. I'm like, this is great. And the spiritual part didn't have anything to do with any religion or anything like that. It was more of the premise of, you know, that traditional psychology is, is kind of a little bit more about labels and, and spiritual psychology is more people have the inner resources they need to to heal. And I didn't again, didn't know much about it, show up at this school with my laptop thinking I'm going to like take notes and there's going to be lectures, but it, there are no desks.

Speaker 4:          00:58:32       It was a highly experiential school. It's like I said, a two year program and in that I really learned how to um, change my belief systems, heal stuff from my past, connect to a part of me because we all have like our basic self, like our conscious part. But I, I believe we also have something deeper like art, we can call it her intuition and we can call it our gut feeling. We can call it our authentic self, but there's some kind of inner wisdom that I think all of us have access to. And this program really helped me get more access to that, that part of me. So that I could start listening to that more than my old conditioning. My old belief system is my old fears because, you know, when we're born we're kind of this blank slate and then stuff happens and we formed these stories about our lives and who we are and how we get love and how we get validation and how we get acceptance and how life works and who we are and our identity and it's kind of just a story and we have, we can change that story, but it takes work.

Speaker 4:          00:59:36       Going back and deconstructing that story and letting go of some old beliefs that maybe we've hung onto to create a different one. So that's, that's what so much of my journey has been about is kind of looking at what's the story I've created about my life and how can I change it? Because the story that I had was I'm depressed. I'm, you know, have to be achieving all the time. Being hard on myself with how I motivate myself. So on and so forth. I'm constantly rejected Blahblahblahblahblah. And by believing that story, it was creating results in my life that align, that, aligned with that. And so to create different results, I had to have a different story to tell.

Speaker 1:          01:00:13       And so there's this shift that that has to take place and it's like turning a battleship, right? It's not, it's not a quick thing. It takes a long time.

Speaker 4:          01:00:23       No, it's, it's not. And I think that's another, um, kind of let downs people have when they go to a seminar or read one book, they expected change overnight and it's a, it's a process.

Speaker 1:          01:00:35       Do you remember the secret? I do. There was a girl, I've told this story before, but she was so nice. She's friends with my friend Kelly, Kelly, Kirsten, you know Kelly, Christian comedian, funny girl. Anyway, uh, she was at the comedy store one night and uh, she was, she was talking to Kelly and uh, I was talking to her and she started going on about her future, all the things that she was going to do, she was going to be married within a year. She was going to have the career that she wants. She was going to this and that and that and this, and uh, I was so confused and she was like, I found the secret I'm doing, you know, do you know about the secret? I go, oh, uh, the power of positive thinking, I that kind of thing. She's like, it's not just that, it's not just positive thinking.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       It's like you do create your own future. You create your own identity, you create, you create reality. I was like, okay, like you sure? And she's like, yeah, I'm sure you know, I'm, I'm positive. Okay, good luck. I'm like, boy, the problem with all that stuff, of course, if you've never heard of it, is what do they, what, what is the term for it? They're trying to achieve law of attraction. Yeah. What, what they're trying to achieve is they're trying to, like, you take the photo of your dream house, you pin it on your wall, you take a photo of a Ferrari, you pin that on the wall. You're going to get those things. The problem is when you watch those videos, when they say, you know, I had this photo of my home on the wall, I had the Ferrari that I wanted, I had my dream life.

Speaker 1:          01:02:10       Now I have those things. I, I made those things happen with intention and with thought. Do you know many fucking people have a photo of a beautiful house on the wall and a Ferrari. And they got no fucking house and they got no Ferrari and they never will like you. It's, you're taking it from a biased pool of successful people who will tell you that this happened to them. But there are literally millions of people who think positive and nothing ever happens to them. So this girl who, um, was a very nice person, she came to one of my shows like a year later and we're hanging out outside and I go, how's everything when you're doing? She's like, well, it's really a drag, you know, because I was convinced that by this time I would have all these things, but you know, my dad, he's still, you know, fuck up and this and that and I've got this problem, that problem and I just don't understand it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:06       I don't understand it. I believe that I was so sure. And we had this like, really, it was really interesting because she was like two different people. I got met her twice, right. So I meet her this one time and she's just a glow with this delusion that now she's got it and she's getting. She was, she was, she thought also that talking about it all the time was part of how you affirm it. So she was saying, you know, I'm going to be married in a year, I'm going to do this. I'm following the secrets. She kept saying it and it was. And then a year later she was just, I don't get it. It didn't work. And so we had this sort of heart to heart about it. Haven't talked to her again and I don't know what the hell happened to her, but I'll never forget it because the two different people, the, the, the girl who was like, it was kind, kinda crazy. Like, oh, why I didn't believe in. And then a year later, year and a half I think just wasn't happening and life was still kind of shitty. And she was, she couldn't understand why the career didn't happen and alive didn't happen. And it's, is all, it's a slow shift.

Speaker 4:          01:04:10       It's a slow shift. And I think the law of attraction can be misleading because it's more, you know, change takes more than I put a picture up and I do some positive affirmations if like down deep you don't feel like you're worthy or you're, you're not going to be able to attract those things. You've got to like Kinda go back and deal with core issues and core belief systems in order to shift things in your life. I mean, if it was as easy as putting pictures up on our wall, everybody would have, you know, lamborghinis and hot and wives and husbands. So, but it, it takes, it takes more than that, it takes being willing to like do some work and take some responsibility rather than just thinking the universe is Santa Claus and just going to pop something into your life

Speaker 1:          01:04:57       to people that are morbidly obese that want a six pack, like it can be done, can be done. But God damn you got a long road. You know, if you want to climb Mount Everest and you're starting in Santa Monica, you gotTa fucking get to Mount Everest. Absolutely.

Speaker 4:          01:05:13       Absolutely. And then that's when people ask me, how'd you get off antidepressants? I'm not like, oh well I just did this and then I did this and then I this, it was a, it was years of like, you know, deciding I was going to and having the right people around. It wasn't, it wasn't an easy thing. It's probably the hardest thing I've done. No.

Speaker 1:          01:05:30       Now what is the difference between antidepressants and Xanax? Like when you're taking. You said you were taking both. Yeah. Why do you need the Xanax if you're already pilled up on the antidepressants?

Speaker 4:          01:05:40       I mean, again, not an MD, so not my territory, but for me like I, the antidepressants just kind of kept me steady but then with my boyfriend at the time and my crazy Hollywood life, like I just had so much anxiety and you know, you go to a doctor and you're like, I have so much anxiety though. Do you want to or how do you define anxiety? Worried. Worried, worried a lot. Like kind of high, strong. I'm not able to calm down. Um, yeah, just that. Just normal, like anxiety, but I didn't have tools. Then my tools then we're medicine now had better tools.

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       So now do, do you take anything? Nope.

Speaker 4:          01:06:25       And supplements, supplements, vitamins and stuff? Yeah. I'm super like I love human hacking and human optimization. I'm, I love exercising. I love meditation. Meditation. I take Alpha brain, like all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:06:41       And you, do you ever miss it? Like is there ever a time we like God dammit. Popping Xanax and fucking glasses?

Speaker 4:          01:06:47       No, no. I will say this though, when I had my eyes, lasix lace Vino, the Lasik and they gave me, um, value. And how's this? I see why people get addicted to this. This is incredible. I'm glad they did because I was super freaked out about them cutting my eyeball open and value them. Just relax as you rise. I would've felt great and then the only time I ever did it. But no, I don't miss that because what I have now is um, like I, I feel clear and alive and you don't feel happy all the time. I definitely have my days, but I don't relate to it as I'm depressed. It's just like, oh, I'm having a normal. Like, you know, human experience not having the best.

Speaker 1:          01:07:31       I think stories like there's a very inspiring to people. I think it's very important. We don't want. It's, it's like it's hard for people to look at people who aren't doing well and talk to them and just go, oh, I don't know what to tell you a good luck. Let me get the fuck away from this bitch. You know, like that's how people think. Like I don't want to deal with her. Problems are. His problems are I, I wanna, I wanna I want to separate my and concentrate on myself. So I think when someone like you can sort of express how you were in this really bad state and yours is a very bizarre situation because you're talking about being on these pills from the time you're 10. Right. That's, that's really unique. But then having almost a decade off of them, seven years off of them is.

Speaker 4:          01:08:13       Yeah. Yeah. I'm state. Yeah. And it's, I, I honestly think it helps me help people. Like it really does. I've had lots of training as a life coach, but my own life experiences have been the thing that's really given me the most creative.

Speaker 3:          01:08:31       Sure. I guess you could say, what are your credentials are that you're actually happy.

Speaker 4:          01:08:35       Yeah. I'm actually happy I, you know, I, I've been able to create a life and a career and friendships and connection that, you know, I thought I no longer live that story of the I hate Christine Club. I have great friends, great women friends, like all of that, you know, and, and that's, I know, like different or more special than anybody. It's just again, choices and I made choices that led me to this point and everybody has that. Everybody has that freedom. What's the book? Man's search for meaning. Have you ever read that book by Viktor Frankl? He was, yeah, he was in concentration camps and he was actually a psychiatrist, I think, but he talked about, you know, he kept himself saying and he kept himself free through his mind and he says in between stimulus and response, basically what happens and how we respond is a choice. And in that choice lies our ultimate freedom. And I think that that's true. That's, that's what we all have. That freedom, no matter what your circumstances.

Speaker 3:          01:09:35       No. When someone comes to you and they're like, Christina, I'm all fucked up. I need to get my shit together. Like, how do you, uh, how do you start with somebody? It's different, you know, everybody's different. But is there anything that people are universally could benefit from Missouri?

Speaker 4:          01:09:53       Yeah. Yeah. The number one thing that where I start with people is having them really look at their relationship with themselves because when they come they're like, oh, I'm fucked up, or I need help. They're relating to themselves as if something's, something's wrong with them and they're being really hard on themselves and they've kind of lost hope and lost belief in themselves. So the first thing is just like acceptance, accepting where you are because you know, I had, I haven't liked everything that's happened to me, but one of the main raise I've been able to move through it is because I stopped fighting it. Isn't that like in martial arts, if a punch comes at you, you're not supposed to resist it. You're supposed to kind of move with it.

Speaker 3:          01:10:33       Yeah. Move away from it or roll with it, roll with it. Right. So that's like your teeth, your teeth and taking on a job. Exactly.

Speaker 4:          01:10:40       And in life we kind of do that where like, oh, I don't want this break up, I don't want this layoff. We resist it, we fight it. And so it's like, can we just get to acceptance of playing? Where are you are who you are and what's happening right now? Perspective and perspective. Yeah. And when you can get to that neutral place, that's when you can start doing the work and that's when you can start doing different things. And then the second thing is I ask people like, do you believe you can shift? Do you believe that you have the power to make different choices and change and you don't have to know how that's, that's my job. I'll help you with the how. But you've got to believe you can because if we don't believe it's possible for us. And it's really hard to make any kind of change in our life.

Speaker 1:          01:11:23       Yeah, that is, that is giant. But how does someone believe, like how do you get someone to believe that they can make change? Like do they have to see evidence in themselves? Do you, is there like do you recommend like attempting things or tasks or hobbies or.

Speaker 4:          01:11:42       Well, a lot of times it's going back to a time in your life where you did take a chance or you did do something that was a stretch in some way, like everybody has times in their life where they've done something they weren't completely sure they could do even if it's just a little thing and everybody has that reference point they can go back to, but a lot of this joe, like honestly a lot of it is taking a leap of faith and I, I've taken a lot of those and I've wanted to know the answer and I've wanted to know like 100 percent that this would be guaranteed. Like if I take this leap of faith, everything will work out and they haven't always been 100 percent guarantees, but it was in taking that leap and taking that chance and having little faith that things started showing up and things started shifting and that's what started to create the evidence. And it's a tricky thing because I think people want evidence before they make change. But you have to start making these little changes to start having the evidence show up. I don't know if I answered your question.

Speaker 1:          01:12:44       No, that does make sense. Um, I, I've often said that very difficult tasks, like a, anything that's difficult that you do, it gives you the confidence that you can overcome adversity. You can, you can, whether it's I'm a martial art thing or something along those lines or marathon running or anything. When you do something like that, these incremental changes happen where you push yourself through things and you, especially if you can achieve a goal, if you could set out to do something, you achieve that goal. Like, I'm going to run a marathon by the end of this year. I don't know why I keep saying marathon, but you know what I'm saying? Doing things along those lines. They can be motivating factors that they can help push you. They can be the engine that starts to push things in a positive direction.

Speaker 4:          01:13:27       Can you start to believe in yourself and you start to believe, oh wow. Like, I can do this. I can take this step. You know, I often tell people that show up or come to workshop where I'm like, just that fact that you're here is proof that you believe you can change because like you wouldn't have shown up if some part of you was in, you know, kind of certain that you could

Speaker 1:          01:13:48       have you ever had someone come to you, you're like, I can't even help this dude. The girl. Not yet. No. Do you get mostly dudes or girls?

Speaker 4:          01:13:55       Well, I only coach a few people now. Um, my retreats are mostly women. My private clients both. And then like courses and stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:14:04       How can we have retreats that are all women?

Speaker 4:          01:14:07       Well, I know, I know I'm going to get, I'm going to do one that will be both men and women soon and it's like a recipe for danger. Too much depressed people hump it in the woods or wherever we go. The first one that everybody's depressed. Some people come just to grow and not out in the woods or out in the woods. That's amazing. No, I like to do it in places like Bali and Costa Rica jungle. Oh my gosh. I finally, for people at this, this might be able to some people, so I, whenever I go to anywhere tropical, I get eaten alive, like eaten alive no matter what other people have three bites, I'll have 400. I finally figured out B one, vitamin B, one, two. It's totally stopped. It really have to find it. Like you can't take a b complex. It's vitamin B One, Huh? And it's for some reason stops in mosquitoes and bug bites. Um, why why B One? I have no idea. I just know it works for me. Does something to change your smell? I don't know. It just worked. It was my salvation. I was so happy. They don't bite you at all I little bit, but again it went from being eaten alive to just getting a few. Did you ever try thermacell? No. What's that?

Speaker 1:          01:15:27       Thermo cell is a device that a lot of people take when they go camping. Things along those lines. You, um, it's like a, it looks like almost like a radio and it has these little pads and these slide these pads into this heating element. And this very fine mist comes out of this heating element. You can put it on the ground near you and the bugs won't come with an 18 foot circle. Yeah, yeah. They use it when you're hunting and you're in the woods because if you're, if you're in the woods, like, especially in Alaska or Alberta, I don't know if you've ever been Alaska in the summer. The mosquitoes are insane because they own their only alive for a month.

Speaker 4:          01:16:07       Oh, so that is good at town, like rabid Barbara,

Speaker 1:          01:16:10       Berrien mosquitoes like me and my friend Ari went fishing in Alaska and it was so crazy that you would get out of the car. We pulled up to this, uh, this stream. You get out of the car, you open the door and then won't, you're hit with a cloud of mosquitoes. We jumped back in the car and shut the door and we were in the car with like 50 mosquitoes were like, what in the fuck is going on? So then we're spraying ourselves all the spray, all these toxic chemicals. Hell Dad found out about thermo sells. Thermo cells just cleans it out. Totally easy to travel with their. Yeah, they don't even. They're really light. It doesn't even smell. I mean barely smells, but bugs don't want to have anything to do with it. Mosquitoes don't want to have anything to do with it without thermo cells like hanging out in the woods, like sitting in a spot. It's almost unbearable unless you have mosquito netting and you don't want to wear like all that. The mosquito bug spray stuff where your skin is in Oregon, you know all that stuff that you're putting on your skin. It is just not good.

Speaker 4:          01:17:07       It's not. I was deet my first couple

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       of days on my last trip and I started getting sick and I'm like, I can't. This is like, what am I doing? You're processing and with your liver, from your skin, it gets in your bloodstream. Terrible. Yeah. I mean I'm sure there's probably some nontoxic alternatives, but they probably don't work there now, so it worked for me. Hey, b one, you hear it. I've heard that before. A friend of mine was telling me that about Africa. They went to Africa and they took a bunch of b vitamins. The B one in particular did it for me find anything on that journey. I found something that said that studies are inconclusive, but it may make mosquitoes. Thank you. Stink. Good. Perfect. Good. It's fine for me. I wonder if it's like a vitamin that makes people think you smell good. People are mosquitoes people. Yeah. Because if bananas don't Eat Bananas for Ms Dot Susan, don't eat bananas. That makes sense to it. But I would think that like,

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       like this probably like weird smells that you're not even sure you detect you now. Some people just give off a weird odor to people. Yes. I mean not even like a, maybe not older, older, but like they just feel weird, you know, they said that. Um, Chris Ryan, my friend who's um, um, he, he's an author, he wrote a sex at dawn. He's great, super smart, super smart guy. He was telling me that there's certain odors that human beings have and those odors enable people to understand whether or not they're genetically compatible with each other and you know, like they used to be when we were kids. I used to always hear about couples taking blood tests to make sure that they could have babies together. Yeah. That was a thing. That was a thing. They would, they would make sure that they were compatible and I don't even know if there was.

Speaker 1:          01:18:55       It was real science behind it, but they would take blood tests to find out they were compatible. That was like, I remember it being like really common to discuss. I mean it was this is a the eighties or the nineties or whatever the fuck. It was the dark ages of science, but for me it was that easy. Right. But not compatible. Obviously personality wise and all the other things that come into play. But they were. He. Chris Ryan was saying that women can smell a man's clothes, like you could smell, literally smell their clothes and they would know whether or not they would be attracted to that person based on the smell that per person is getting. Not Not like, oh my God, this guy stinks, but like literally like you, your body knows what's repulsive and what's not repulsive in terms of genetics, based on someone's odor that they give off on their clothes, but what it didn't work is when they put women on the pill, so when they put women on the pill, they were no longer able to differentiate whether or not someone was genetically compatible by smelling them that it gave you.

Speaker 1:          01:20:01       It fogged up your, your natural senses because I think when you're on pill you don't actually ovulate. Right? So you're not in the natural rhythm of biology. Yeah, I think there's a natural feeling that women have when they're around a guy that they would breed with or a guy they wouldn't breed with like, okay, gotTa go, you know, like that. And that is probably a good thing. And the people that are on the pill might be making like really shitty genetic choices, like literally genetic choices. Ah, you can blame your last bad ex boyfriend on being on the pill. You could smell them accurately. I really think you can. I mean, it totally makes sense. I probably. Chris has probably listening right now go and you fucked it up. I probably did, but I think there's probably something to instinctual reactions to people. I mean, have you ever met someone who, for whatever reason, I just don't want to be around this person and then you find out years later that that person is fucking crazy or this or that.

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       There's, I think people give off in detectable in terms of like what we classify as smells, but maybe these pheromones have some sort of a weird reaction to your birth control pills affects women's taste in men. Bam. Wow. How synthetic hormones changed desires and women and their choice of a mate intimate. Yeah, totally. Makes Sense. Interesting. Yeah. Well it just makes sense. I mean, it just can't be. Nor your body must be so confused. Like this pitch is pregnant all the time. I know. That's what it thinks. Your body thinks you're pregnant all the time now. That's the pill scares me too. Just synthetic hormones pumping through your system. Yeah. Camp can't be all that good to never get off, but a lot of women never get off it right there on it forever. Yep. Yeah. I don't like it. It makes my hair oily when I'm off at. Yup. Here's stuff like that. There's other ways to balance your hormones. You know, I'm not a hormone specialist, but why does hormones make a girl's hair oily? I don't know. I have no idea. How do we get on the subject? Smells. Retreats. You don't take dudes. Dudes on retreats. Yeah. I would think they're like getting a bunch of people that are trying to get their life together and then having them all together. Male and female. Do you run into these weird issues? Were

Speaker 2:          01:22:18       anything that really just trying to hook up? Yeah, exactly. You can get really distracted and you can get, like if there's some kind of attraction, you can forget what you're there for and get obsessed with someone and, and it can kind of throw off the thing and there's something too about,

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       you know, women coming together with women and men coming together with men that I think is important. And I think kind of back to that tribal conversation we need, I got a lot of women including myself, have beef with other women, you know, and they don't like being around just a bunch of other women. Like there's competition that comes up and Oh, well I used to because I was scared of other women because I had all that stuff happen. I didn't really trust it. Um, and so when you get a group of women together, a lot of times there is that like comparison and judgment and I can't trust into that. And so it's important for women, I think to gather together and kind of do work separately from when there's men there because there's something that is very healing just in that. And then, you know, it just, there's a level of vulnerability that's possible when there aren't men.

Speaker 2:          01:23:20       They're not to say that you can't be vulnerable with men there, but it's just a different dynamic. And I think the same goes for men, like I know men who do men's groups and men's work and there's great value in that and that's important. And I think one of the problems I see a lot in intimate relationships is that in a heterosexual relationship is that you expect this one person to be your everything and you're not. You don't have a tribe and you don't have a community, you don't have friends of the opposite sex in the same sex that are fulfilling kind of these needs that we all have. We just project like this. My one person has to be my everything, my soul mate. And so, you know, having your community, whatever it may be, and having different friends I think is super, super important to having a healthy relationship.

Speaker 1:          01:24:03       Yeah, having friends period is super important. There is something that I tweeted today that I was reading about, um, they were talking about the role that genetics and family have in creating a personality and how much of an impact your peers have and they think that your peers and the friends you choose have a bigger impact than anything in your life. And it was really fascinating. I, I tweeted this morning on it, but it's, it's one of those articles where you read it and you go, oh, that completely makes sense. Researcher argues that peers are much more important than parents, that psychologists underestimate the power of genetics and that we have a lot to learn from Asian classrooms. Interesting. Yeah. What about it? What about Asian classrooms to go down and scroll? Forgot what that was about. I don't know, probably too long of an article to really get into it, but um, would have to read it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:58       But peers in general, I think I'm choosing likeminded folks and choosing people that are on a good path. They, it, it helps support you and it supports them and you feed off of each other. And when the tribe does well, you do well. Exactly. This is very, very critical and people, everybody wants to be the person that's accomplishing things. Everybody wants to be the one that's out there. Go get knit and fuck the world's all about me. But if you do that, you like, you're gonna, you're gonna mess up the whole happiness thing. Like the happiness thing comes with all the people that you're around having a good time.

Speaker 2:          01:25:34       Absolutely. Yeah. And then it's just like, it's endless. You have to keep upping the ante. And I think what we want more than anything is connection. Connection. We want love, we want to feel like we belong to. So I think belonging is a huge, huge, huge thing. And I think as adults we think we belong by, you know, achieving things. But really it's finding those people that you can just be yourself

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       with and to have that tribe and also let go of the people that are bringing you down. Like I've outgrown some people in my life and some friends. Not that I'm better than, but I'm just on like a different, different path and a different route and it's important I think to kind of know like who's the sort of dead weight and your life and what are some friendships that might have reached their expiration date that you know, like, I love you, that's been great, but you know,

Speaker 1:          01:26:28       and a lot of those friendships, like you're not helping them either. No. Matter of fact, sometimes when someone cuts you loose, you go, wow, what the fuck is wrong with me? They don't need to look at myself. Right. I mean sometimes when you enable a friend, you're not only, you're not doing yourself any good, you're not doing them any good either.

Speaker 4:          01:26:45       Exactly. That was a big Aha for me when my fiance broke up with me because I very much wanted to be the victim in that, but I had to look at, Gosh, what did I like? What did I do? Because everybody's like, oh, he's such a jerk, but I really had to look at how was I showing up in that relationship that was impacting his decision because he wasn't a bad guy. Like he wasn't just a jerk who decided, you know, I'm going to break up with this girl. Like there were ways I was showing up that were like made him make the decision that he makes. So I think in any of those situations, friendship or relationship, you know, you don't, you don't want to go too far. The other extreme and be like, oh my gosh, I'm a loser and think it's all your fault. But it's important to look at, Geez, what's my part in this? You know, what's my responsibility? Because I played a role in this whole thing.

Speaker 1:          01:27:36       Yeah, I mean there's no one way street when it comes to relationship and if you're in a relationship with a bad person, like why? Why did you get in that in the first place? You know, if they did trick you, you know, what did you do when you realized it was a trick? Did you stick around and try to fix it? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:27:53       I think that's a really good question because I mean how many people do you know that are in bad relationships? Continue talking about it but don't, aren't doing anything about it. Like they're brutal. They're not leaving it and if people are brutal are because there's just like lie, but a lot of times it's because it's familiar and it's date. What there's somebody said, you know, you get the love you think you deserve and it may be easy for us looking outside going, oh my gosh, it's so easy. You should just like leave this relationship. But a lot of times the person like doesn't think they can do better. Or maybe this is like playing out some dynamic they had with their parent or you know, you sort of need to understand why you're in it before you can actually make the choice to get out of it.

Speaker 1:          01:28:37       By the way, there's a lot of delusional people out there that are like, I deserve a lot more than I'm getting. That's true. That's not really there. That's true. What do you do when someone comes to you with unrealistic expectations or they don't want to see themselves like you know, you'd, you'd tell them what they need to do or what they should consider and they argue with you about it.

Speaker 4:          01:28:56       Well, I just really ask like, is what you're doing working like is your way working? You can show me your ways working then. Great.

Speaker 1:          01:29:05       My weight is fine. This is fucking other people. Everybody else. Everybody else is all messed up. I'm good. God Damn it. Yeah. I need you to coach everyone else. I know.

Speaker 4:          01:29:17       Yeah. If we could just change other people. It's everybody else's fault. Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:29:21       Do you ever have to tell people you're not going to work with them?

Speaker 4:          01:29:25       I've had one person I had to tell that to. Yup. Just one and it was, you know, I think it was, it was just not a good fit and she just wasn't ready. Willing. The super committed to her story and sort of wanted me just to cuddle it, which I wasn't willing to do.

Speaker 1:          01:29:43       Yeah. Sometimes people just want someone to that. That's what I've always wondered about therapy. Like I have friends that have been to therapy, I'm like, okay, well what do you do when you go there? You talk about your problems and one happens while they give you advice and then what happens? You don't do shit. You know, like there's a lot of people that just want to go somewhere and once a month to listen to them talk. Right? Right. They'll go three, four times a week and they're still fucked up. I'm like, well, that isn't working. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:30:07       it doesn't. And I think my intention always is to really give people the tools, not just advice and really help them heal really get. I've had amazing teachers have been really, really lucky and they've really taught. They haven't just given me advice, they haven't just given me motivation. They've really given me tools to heal and change and that's, that's what I try to do in my work with people is show them that it that a as possible and they can do it and give them the tools to do it because that's what that's going to last longer than any kind of like

Speaker 1:          01:30:41       pep talk. It was funny. We were talking before the podcast started about going to a seminar and someone asking how many men here feel vulnerable? And like no one's putting their hand up. How many women here feel vulnerable? All the hands went up, all the hands went up and I mean, part of it I think is a little delusional because I think a lot of men are way more vulnerable than they really think they are. But also there's just a different thing going through live. I mean there's that expression, the fairer sex or. But being a female, being a woman means you are physically different. Yup. Your roundup, a bunch of people that most of them could beat you up. Yep. You know, that's, it's a different way to walk through the world. That vulnerability though is that creates another level of anxiety, right? Like walking down a dark street, you see someone and it's a man and he's walking down a dark street to like, Oh, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:31:40       yeah. Um, it's, it's scary and it's something that, you know, I, as a woman, like I'm always aware of it. Not always, but a lot of the time, you know, cause I, I know that like, like you said, I could get beaten up like it's between me and a man. He's probably gonna win. I mean I'm pretty strong but

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       not that strong and I live. I think what's also beautiful about women and just the feminine general is that vulnerability. But because like at sometimes as it feels safe, I think that's why a lot of women like kind of have a protective armor and are guarded and sometimes more and they're like masculine energy in the world is because on some level we feel like we have to, we have to like protect ourselves and whereas that, that vulnerability really is the thing that makes us women in so many ways not. And I think we confuse vulnerability with weakness because vulnerability to me is being open, being available, being um, soft but not weak. Weakness to me is more about kind of going into the victimy and going into that poor pitiful me and the feeling sorry for and on all of those kinds of things. I think there's beautiful power and vulnerability, but when we're talking about just physical strength, yeah, I mean for the most part, men have the advantage on that one.

Speaker 1:          01:33:00       It's just we need all the pieces, right? You need the whole spectrum of human beings and it. I mean, especially in terms of, you know, the traditional way of looking at things. You know, masculine men are attracted to feminine women and Feminine. Women are attracted to masculine men and we both need each other, but a lot of times, especially when you're dealing with damaged folks, you're dealing with a man who has a vulnerable woman in the man's all fucked up, so he takes it out on the vulnerable woman and the vulnerable woman is like under the, you know, the, the pressure of the relationship or the suppression of being connected to this man, and so you kind of dealing with the same dynamic that you were dealing with when you were in school or someone's bullying you and you get it in this relationship. Then instead of someone appreciating you for the difference in the softness versus the of the Yin and the Yang, now you have someone who is exploiting that and you see it with women too and they see it with like aggressive women and weak men. That is, to me, one of the saddest things I ever see is when you find the aggressive women and the weak man cut. Probably because I'm terrified of it ever been me. You know, I don't think it will be, but I mean if it was, you know, nobody wants that. Nobody wants a woman who's yelling at you and andy goes, woohoo.

Speaker 2:          01:34:28       That happens a lot, a lot, a lot. It's kind of crazy to me because, you know, I see women emasculate men quite often, you know, not maybe on like a huge scale to the degree you're talking about, but just like the little comments, like I'll be out with a couple and the woman will say something and it's, it's kind of emasculating. If the roles were reversed and the guy said something like that to the woman, I don't know if it would go over, you know, guys just kinda take it

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       on sometimes and then when I see that I'm like, a lot of men feel emasculated by society in general, just by the roles that they play in the office and the, just the, the, the physical act of going through life, this civilized world and also constantly needing people's affirmation, needing people's acceptance and, and you, you sort of become what people want you to be, even if that's not what you want. You get in these relationships and you see it all the time where a guy sort of accept a little bit and then they accept more and then they don't want to mess up. And then I have a bunch of friends that have like really domineering, overbearing wives or girlfriends. And it's weird. It's weird to be around them. Like, dude, you know, you can leave. Like, he just like, this is just a person.

Speaker 1:          01:35:48       Why do you think they don't? Because they're scared. They're scared and it becomes the thing. You know, that's, that's the thing, this is the thing, or go out of the fucking wife, we're going to go home to the wife, you know, and it's, it's, it's very strange. It's very strange when you have someone in your life that's essentially like a parole officer, so many life that gets to tell you what to do and you're not allowed to do certain things. You're not allowed to watch certain things or certain things and they control you and they own. You mean this, this, and I think a lot of these people that are doing that, much like the girl who bullied you or any, anybody who does that to someone, they, they do it out of, out of fear. They do that to insecurity and they also do it out of this bizarre instinct because they can.

Speaker 1:          01:36:32       I state this girl, she wasn't a bad person but she used to like to fight and I don't. I do not. I do not like to. I don't like that kind of conflict. I don't like, like interrelationship conflict. I don't do. I don't like it. I won't fight and argue. I just rather leave. I'm like all into I'm into discussing things, but when people start yelling and get crazy, I'm like, fuck this. I grew up. I grew up around domestic violence too. I grew up with a, so I saw it when I was a kid. I just, I'm not interested and so we broke up, but we stayed friends and then years later we went out to coffee and like, how's everything? What's going on? I'm living with this guy. It's not going good. I'm like, why? She's like, she's telling me how she yells at this guy and she can't help it.

Speaker 1:          01:37:16       She's like, I can't help it. I just fucking yell at him and he doesn't do anything. He just takes it and she's like, he takes it. I just want to fucking smash him. She's like, I just can't. She goes, I don't want to yell at them, but I can't help doing it. And then when he's gone, I'm like, why the fuck did I do that? And she had this weird, almost like a natural impulse to dominate this guy. Like if you ever seen two dogs, one dog has the upper hand on the on the dog and he'll go near the dog and the other dog and that's just, that's just their world. That's just their world. The other dog never gets a chance and sometimes it's not even a size based thing or they might be the exact same size dog, just one dog just decides the bitch and the other one's the dominator and that's just how it goes. While she was in this position with this guy where she just had this compelling desire to fucking yell at them. And I go, well, what are you yelling at him for? She's like, anything, everything. She goes, I just, I just fucking. I want him to tell me to shut the fuck up.

Speaker 4:          01:38:16       Yeah. She wanted him to out manner.

Speaker 1:          01:38:19       Yeah. But isn't that crazy? Like what a bizarre instinct to like to, to push. Like she was frustrated at herself. She was frustrated at him, but it's almost like she was compelled, like she's being drawn to the great magnet, you know? It's like, oh, I'm going to scream at them. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:38:38       Well it's interesting like how we project onto other people, you know, like whatever. Some of that was going on inside of her that was like creating that dynamic in him and then she could have left at any time. It was like she was so trying to get a reaction out of him honestly to probably see if he cared. Like she probably equated. Alright well him taking it means he doesn't care. So how much can I push? How much can I push, how can I match, can I push so that I can see that he, he'll react enough because that means.

Speaker 1:          01:39:04       Do you think that's what it is that she didn't think he cares or do you think she just thinks he's weak and it's just frustrating to her that he's weak?

Speaker 4:          01:39:09       Well, if it was just that, I think she would have left a lot earlier. There was something she wanted, like we don't keep doing it over and over and over again unless there's something more attached to getting. Like, you know, when we're just went and we're like, Oh man, this is stupid. We, we get out of there. But when we find ourselves in situations where it's like it's happening over and over and over again and tend to get frustrated but we're not leaving. There's something we're attached to trying to get from our behavior. So there was something she wanted in that, there was something in it for her, although I should have been out there a lot sooner.

Speaker 1:          01:39:41       I wonder. It was also she was trying to do the acting thing and she was constantly frustrated. She was constantly just taking it out and everything. Well that it was, it would be really interesting. Like I'd watch these like almost sort of manic things. Like there would be these moments where she would be preparing for an audition and she'd be hopeful yet nervous. There was a lot of anxiety and there was all this, here's the thing and it's going to go and hopefully if this happens, this guy's connected to this and that's going to happen with that. And then boom, it didn't happen. And so there's this massive let down, there's a cigarette smoking and depression and you know, all this angst and I got the fuck out of there. But this dude got in there like, and he caught me, he caught, you know, the second wave of angst when I met her.

Speaker 1:          01:40:31       She was just moving here and so she wasn't completely bewildered by the experience in the machine yet. Yeah. And it's also, I think for some people choosing things that you do for a living that are healthy for you, I think there's a lot of people that get involved in careers that require too much of their time. You don't really want to do it, but you get caught up in it. Whether it's being a lawyer, being a doctor, or being something that has a prestigious title when you feel like there's something great tech, but really in the back of your mind, there's something else that you probably be way happier doing. I mean, that was me. I was going after it for the wrong reasons. What do you want to do though? If you weren't doing a life coach, I know you enjoy doing what you're doing, but you have like if somehow or another you were independently wealthy and you didn't have to coach all these crazy people.

Speaker 4:          01:41:21       Not that they're crazy, but some of them will probably do it. I mean like I, you know, this, I, I love people and I love personal development. Even if I had all the money in the world, I still speak. I'd still do my podcasts. I'd still do retreats. I, I love it. Like I love the human experience. I love being there for that moment where someone has a major insight where they connect dots and it's like Whoa, a massive perspective shift and like all of a sudden they start to kind of move a different direction. It's, I can't imagine doing anything else. I mean if I could sing, if I had any kind of music ability, I think it'd be awesome to be a rock star. Like just to have that rush, but literally I have no musical ability whatsoever other than listening to it. I'm just do not have it.

Speaker 1:          01:42:09       Well that's great. So you found your thing now how often is it when you talk to be, but when you're trying to coach them and help them and you realize like, man, you got to do something else. Like is that A. is that a factor? Because I would think that see the thing about careers is not only is it eight hours of your time, but it also kind of defines you, so every day you're defined by whatever you do and oftentimes, like we were talking about like men in these workplace environments, there's sort of like, they're boxed into this predetermined pattern or behavior that's expected from them. You know, they have shoes with tassels on them and ties and they have to talk business talk and it's like you fall into these weird patterns and you lose a lot of your individuality inside those patterns because office life and you know, human resources demand certain things of you. Like there's a certain your personality, like when you're in an office environment, anytime you're in the corporate world, your personality is stuffed into this form. Whatever that form is, whatever that mold is, the mold of being a business person. You know, you know you're a woman. You're a businesswoman. You want to be respected and want to use the right word to say the right things and you know, and, and talk the right lingo. But the like a lot of times people are left wondering who the fuck am I? Right, right,

Speaker 4:          01:43:31       right. They just get totally lost in a role. Yeah. And I do like, I go do a lot of corporate speaking and I have a lot of people come up to me afterwards and they're just like, oh my gosh, like I'm. Because I talk about, you know, how we lose ourselves in these roles and how like a lot of times our adult life becomes sort of just this like checklist follow

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       Truman show. Like one thing after the other just like follow this structure that was set out for us. We never checked in and said, do I want this? Like, do I even want this? You know. And so to answer your question, yes, a lot of times when people come or I'm working with people, it is like looking at like, is this, is this career right for you? Is this relationship right for you? Like what have you created in your life that just doesn't fit where you are, but you're in it because you're scared to make the change. And, and also, you know, some people really can be happy in corporate America, like some people

Speaker 1:          01:44:24       she works for them. I, um, I really believe that the vast majority of people that are living the American dream, living that life during that nine to five, the vast majority of them are fucking horrific. Horrifically miserable. Yeah. I really do believe that. I think it's, it's so defining and it's so. It's so contrary to the human spirit. Right? Right. But I think most people don't want to believe that. They don't want to believe that it's possible that everybody's doing something wrong. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:44:54       And they don't believe they can change it then. Yeah. There's no other option. I don't know what else to do, especially if they have a mortgage and a spouse and kids, student loans, all that stuff. Yeah. It's really intimidating to go, oh gosh, how do I, how do I change this? I think you have to start small. I think you have to start with, okay, I don't have to quit my job tomorrow, but what are some things in my life I can start doing that made me feel alive again? Like, is it a hobby, is it like training for a marathon? Is it what is going to start making me feel like, you know, I'm creative and I matter and I'm more than just this role as husband, wife, mother, father, corporate executive, whatever it is. So I think that's a good place to start is something small you can do to make you feel alive again because anybody has access to that, right?

Speaker 2:          01:45:40       You don't have to leave your job to start creating some things in your life that can start to shift things and then like we were talking about then it's like the gradual change, you know, because I don't think it's possible for most people just to quit their job tomorrow. They don't think it's possible. Right. Almost knowing exactly what and, and not everybody's meant to be an entrepreneur either and do their own thing, but there are always things we can do in our life to mix it up a little bit and even just show up differently in our job.

Speaker 1:          01:46:07       Yeah. I just think that for a huge amount of people, the amount of time that's required of them. Yeah. Because of their job is so overwhelming because most people, let's be honest or not really just working nine to five, particularly most men, there's a tremendous amount of overtime involvement. Yes. I was looking at some thing that was talking about. It was an article on the wage gap difference in what would it really is about. And one of the things that was about was the amount of the difference in the amount of hours that men work and in their ambition to try to climb up the corporate ladder. And you look at the numbers that people work and it's terrifying. There's no lie. If you're working 60 hours a week, you don't have a life. There's nothing left. If I worked here, um, I'll do a podcast or three hours and I'll do a bunch of other stuff and you know, I'm trying to fit in things in my day and I have a pretty loose schedule.

Speaker 1:          01:46:59       I mean, I do a lot of things, but it's pretty loose. You know, like today I did UFC stuff for a couple hours this morning and then I come here for a few hours. Then I got to work out. Then it will tell some jokes, but there's a lot of movement in there. There's a lot of times where I can get shit done. Yeah. Some people don't have any of that. It have nothing. So what do you think was like that made you different, like back in the day where you could have done that path of the corporate route? Why did you make different choices? It's a good question. I don't know. Probably. I don't know. I don't know. I mean I never felt like I could. I never felt like I could have a regular job like I. from the time I got out of high school, I never had a full time job.

Speaker 1:          01:47:42       I had a bunch of part time jobs. I did some full time jobs, were construction companies and stuff, but it didn't last. I would do them for like a month or a couple of weeks and I was like, fuck this, like whatever it is about. And it was all. It was the main source of all my problems in high school. All my problems in high school is I was not willing to do things I didn't want to do, so I would barely get by through high school. I go take tests. They would register intelligence or measure intelligence. That'd be great. Everything's fine, but I would take actual test based on what I was supposed to be studying and I fucking barely paid attention. I mean I squoze through high school with like a c average in most things. I barely got by and even when I was going to college I was only going to college.

Speaker 1:          01:48:32       I went to Boston University and our umass rather in Boston and the only reason why I went is because I didn't want anybody to think I was a loser. So I was taking classes at Umass and was. It was and I was teaching taekwondo at Boston University, which is a really good school and I was looking at all these people that were preparing for life and to me it was like, you're going to go get eaten by alligators or something. And I was like, what are you going to do? You're going to go get a job. You're going to be working nine to five for whatever, whatever fucked up thing that was wrong in my head. I would way rather get up in the morning and deliver newspapers for three hours a day or drive limos at night. I. I had a really unstable childhood, so in my mind, anything that you were locked down to was death.

Speaker 1:          01:49:17       It was prison and I, whatever malfunction of my brain, I figured out a way to make it work for me. Survival skill. Yeah, in some way, but also a lack of like I'm not very disciplined. It looks like I'm disciplined on the outside. I'm not disciplined at all. I'm obsessed. I get obsessed with things whether I'm disciplined with in certain aspects like with exercise and I do it when I don't want to do it. I forced myself to practice and I forced myself to write. I forced myself to do things, but more of it's more of an obsession thing. Like I get obsessed with either goals or tasks or things or puzzles or games. I got a real problem, like there's something wrong with me.

Speaker 2:          01:50:01       Well why do you say that? As a field draining

Speaker 1:          01:50:03       no, because like I'll play pool for 12 hours in a row, like I'll, I'll get obsessed with playing pool and then I think I'm going to be the world champion. I'm going to practice 12 hours a day for the rest of my life. I mean I, I, I'm a sick person. Like whatever happened to me when I was young, like whatever weirdness in involved in it. I figured out a way to manage it, but it can get away from me. It's gotten away from me before I played video games, like eight, 10 hours a day. It can get away. I got have to manage whatever craziness that makes me like focus on things. Yeah. I see it in my kids. Especially my middle daughter, she's, she gets obsessed with things and I'm like, wow, this is crazy. It's like a genetic thing. It's like watching a little female, me and a lot of ways, you know, like she read all eight Harry Potter books in a matter of a couple of months.

Speaker 1:          01:50:52       She just, she just gets into stuff and then you've got to go, Hey, shut the light out. You got to go to bed one more chapter like, come on, you got to stop. It's been um, it's not like she's seen it in me and she's mirroring it because it's her own little weirdness, you know, but I think it's obviously she's got a healthier environment than I grew up in, so it's not like a, a matter of plug not ever not ever wanting to be connected to anything permanent because nothing is permanent. I mean that was part of, I think with the lessons from my childhood. Like no one's here to help you. Not As, don't get locked in any fucking job, don't get locked in and you get ready to move in anytime, you know. And embracing moving. Like to this day I'll be, I'll be like, I gotta get the fuck out of La.

Speaker 1:          01:51:34       Like everything's here. I have to do everything here. The comedy is here, my family's here. My kids go to school here. All my friends live here, but I'm like, fuck this. I'm going to the mountains. I gotta get Outta here. Like I have this like no mad shit in me that I'm like constantly trying to, um, to manage. So as much as people like to take credit for a certain amount of success, like I can tell you all the different things that I did that led to me being successful at things. But almost it's like the function of a mental issue, like a big, a lot of it is a function of learning how to manage a brain that doesn't work like everybody else's brain.

Speaker 2:          01:52:16       That's so I think common for a lot of successful people especially. And the differences. You're aware of how it works and you've learned how to manage it, but that you know, that obsessive thing in so many ways it has made you, it has gotten you a certain degree of success and all of those things, survival skills, compensatory strategies, whatever they are, they have their positives, they have ways that they really help us. But then they have the ways that kind of torture us and a lot of ways. And I think

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       growth is really about understanding what are the ways that this isn't doing me any good and how can I be mindful of it. And also like, you know, how, how do I know now that like that now is not then like how do I stop being activated by old experiences in my past and just have peace for where I am now and take those gifts from the obsession that's made you successful but not have the parts that kind of torture you at the same.

Speaker 1:          01:53:14       Well, I don't feel tortured. Um, so I think in some ways have achieved some sort of a victory over my whatever mental issues that I have. But I can't do nothing. Right. That's the reason why I have three jobs. I can't do that if I do. And I have three jobs and a fucking ton of obsessions outside of those jobs. Martial arts, archery or reading and writing and all sorts of other stuff on top of podcasting, doing the commentary for the UFC, doing standup comedy. Like that's the only way I'm, I feel even. Yeah. And I can't have one thing that I count on either. If I had, if I only had standup comedy or only had the UFC. If there's only one thing or only had podcasting, I'd be like, this is my. I got it. I would want to quit. I was like, I don't want to do this anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:54:04       This is my fucking thing. I'm just going to be trapped doing this thing. Talking into a fucking microphone out into space for the rest of my life. I got to go to fucking. I don't even want to hear myself anymore. I've got to quit. No. So whatever weird malfunction my brains had. I've figured out a way over all the years of my life to, to manage it, but a lot of his physical to managing my brain, a lot of it requires intense exercise. Like when I, when I intensely exercise, then I can like, oh alright, it's gonna be all right, it's going to be cool. But if I don't, it's like it's all built up. And then there's, it's hard to enjoy things. It's hard to just chill. Like I can't chill unless I earn it. It gets a, it's probably a malfunction, but it's the illusion is that it's not the illusion is that it's a discipline and then it's all, it's all choices, but that's really not the case.

Speaker 4:          01:55:00       Maybe it's just you and how you operate your operating system. Are You coaching me now? So what's going on here? Does that feel like I am?

Speaker 1:          01:55:12       Yeah, maybe it is me. I mean, I think people,

Speaker 4:          01:55:15       and that's not a bad thing. I think that they're back to the acceptance thing. There's a lot of ways I think we're supposed to be and we look at other people and how they do their life or whatever and we think that because we're acting this way, something must be wrong with us, but a lot of times there is not. This is just the way you operate.

Speaker 1:          01:55:34       You don't want to. And that's the thing is interesting is um, when I was a kid I was a not very confident and also didn't like to, to people get anxiety again, anxiety. If I had a talk and I get anxiety, if I had to like talk to a bank teller, like if I had to wait in line to go to the bank teller, I'd start freaking out like on my way to the bank teller and like if you talked to like people who knew me from high school and they'll go, uh, did you ever think that Joe is going to be a comedian? They be like, no, like no fucking way. That guy was at funny, like they didn't. I figured out a way to be more relaxed socially and it wasn't an easy process at all. It took forever to the point where now I'm extremely relaxed socially.

Speaker 1:          01:56:18       Like now I can talk to anybody. Like I don't. I love one of the things I love about doing podcasts. I like just having conversations with people. Yeah, I will. I will. I want to know, like you're another organism. You're another person. I want to know what's going on in your head. I don't understand your life. I wanna I wanna own a. try to see what connections you've made, what, what definitions you've fallen on, you know, what you know, how you've defined this world, how you've, how you've categorized things and how you're managing it. How are you, how are you maneuvering through it? I'm fascinated by that. I'm fascinated by the thoughts that people carry around inside their heads. Yeah, me too. Yeah, I love it. And whether or not they're empowering or whether or not you're a woe is me type person, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:57:04       and one of the puzzle pieces that have led to where you are and I love that you're sharing this because I think a lot of people can see you and see your success in everything that you have and thank you were always like this and then it's just been easy because it's this, you know, you're always like this, but to know you had that background and you had the social anxiety and this is like such a stretch. I think it's really inspiring because it gives people. It's like, oh you, you can't. You can no longer argue that, you know, you're just born a certain way. And like, that's just the way you are, like your proof that you actually can change and you can't get over things and you can create things that you know, you probably didn't think were possible when you were 10 or however old you were when you were going through all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:57:46       Yeah, I think people have different starting points and now it's like I was saying that if you want to climb Mount Everest, good luck. If you're starting from Santa Monica, you got to fucking walk all the way to Tibet. It's going to take a long ass time. Ocean is going to be hard to get across. But if you're at the base of Tibet, if that's what you live, it's or the base of the Himalayas, it's way easier to climb that thing. You know, it's still not easy, but it's easier. And I think there's a lot of people that start, you know, in the a metaphoric Santa Monica would their life, they're really far away from their goal. It doesn't mean it's not possible, but it means there's a bunch of steps, whether they're conscious or unconscious that you're going to have to make in order to get to a position.

Speaker 1:          01:58:30       And I still remember fucking freaking out going to a bank teller or used to having all the time. I just didn't want to talk to people. I was just in my own head and I was super insecure and I just could barely get through shit, you know, what changed it, just doing it over and over again. Martial arts was a big thing. The martial arts is the first thing that I ever did where I was good at it or I didn't feel like a loser. It was like I'd done. I was pretty good at art and uh, yes. Yeah. And I wanted to be a comic book illustrator and that was like a big focus in my life when I was younger. But um, I mean, and I and I definitely took some sort of identity in the fact that I was good at that.

Speaker 1:          01:59:12       I liked the fact that people would say I was good at it and made me feel good, but it was different than martial arts because with martial arts, um, it was the first thing that I did where I felt like I could really be exceptional. Like it could be really good, like in an hour, realized that first of all I was gifted physically and then also this crazy brain of mine, if I could point it to something, like I would work out at 3:00 in the morning because I knew nobody else would. I knew they weren't there, so I had keys to the gym. So, uh, because I was teaching, so I would go there, I'd wake up and I would drive down to the gym and I opened it up in the middle of the night and put in a workout because I knew that no one else was doing that.

Speaker 1:          01:59:59       I knew they weren't there and I knew, I felt like it gave me an this. Well, yeah, an edge. But it also, I felt like there was, I was getting ahead of them, you know, like, like it was, it was some sort of a crazy race. So for between the age of 15 and 21, I was just completely obsessed with fighting and that's all I did. I just, I didn't, I didn't know. I probably barely knew who was president. I didn't know a goddamn thing about the world. I wasn't reading shit unless it was like some Samurai book on philosophy and combat. Like that was all I was obsessed with and that's when I was also a gun and they were Ah, anthony robins somewhere around that too. But I was interested in like things that would give me an edge, personal development stuff that would give me an edge and then through doing martial arts and then also through teaching, I think that was a big one was teaching classes.

Speaker 1:          02:00:52       And then teaching at bu was big too because when I was teaching at Boston University, I was teaching an actual class. Are you teaching taekwondo window? That was at that time I was a. I'd won the US Open. I'd won a bunch of different tournaments and I was, I was doing really well as a, as a fighter, as a martial arts competitor. So, um, they had uh, a taekwondo program at Bu and I was teaching it and I would have to address a whole class, but I would address all classes, something that was really good at, like I knew I could demonstrate them to them, some movements and stuff like that. It shows some things. I'd asked someone to hold something and I'd kick it or something like that and they'd be like, Holy Shit. And then they would listen. Like I could get, I could, I was confident in what I was saying there.

Speaker 1:          02:01:37       And it was like the only time in my life that I can remember being confident in telling people something. It was like I would describe how you do it, this is how you do it and I'll show you how to do it here, but this is how it needs to be done. And this is why. And this is what happens when you do it. And this is what's involved in the mechanisms of your body. And, and so that, that gave me the first, that was the first feeling that I got were there, was I, I knew that there was like a light at the end of the tunnel or at least I knew, well at least this now I don't feel like a loser anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:02:08       Yeah, yeah. It gave you something to like, like you said, be exceptional at. And I think that's what gives us confidence is feeling like we've somewhat mastered something like somewhat really could understand something well enough to teach it. Yes. And without that we're just chasing it I think for and trying to get it through little things we do. And I think that's why a lot of people like go from career to career, job to job or whatever. Trying to find that little bit of instead of sticking with something and like really focusing in on really studying it. And that's where I think the obsession actually served in a lot of ways.

Speaker 1:          02:02:44       I think for sure. This is also an expression that I love to use that martial arts are a vehicle for developing your human potential because. Because it's so difficult and it's so terrifying, and then the idea of competing and in the physical consequences are so devastating. If you get hit that you are, you can't, you can't have asset, you can't slack off, you have to. You have to really pursue this thing with an insanity, like an incredible intensity and then through that you realize like, oh, I could do that. And then from doing that you kind of realized, well, what if I apply that to writing a book or doing that or learning how to do something else, or for me it was standup comedy.

Speaker 4:          02:03:24       Wow. That seat, standup comedy seems just terrifying to me. Karen

Speaker 1:          02:03:30       terrifying is working in a fucking office wearing tassels, shiny shoes.

Speaker 4:          02:03:35       That's very true. Stupid thing. Socks are too. Yeah. That was terrifying for me to. Oh God. I remember like Sunday nights I would just get knots in my stomach just like, oh, do I have to go and be in awful staff meetings on Monday mornings? And just like draining all sucking the oxygen out of their own life out of. That's where a lot of people start taking medication. Yep. Yep.

Speaker 1:          02:04:03       That unhappiness of, of just what you call quote unquote real life, there's been a structure that's put in place that we've all sort of shuffled into that doesn't serve us and it doesn't serve most people. You have Wim Hoff on last night, you know, he is a telling me about him. He's amazing, but one of the things he and I were talking about, he was. He gave me his number about what did he say? Like seven percent of people or something like that. Do things that are creative with her life. What? Seven percent, 70 percent world. I don't know. Let's, let's get crazy and say it's 15 percent. That's really small. It is. Well, here's the thing. One hundred percent of kids are creative. It's true. Like my kids, they're both. They're both always do. My young kids, they're both always painting or drawing or doing something in my older kid does music, so there's so much creativity that they, they feel drawn to it and all that stuff is something that every kid does. Yep. Every kid draws shit. Every kid plays with clay. Every kid make stuff with legos. You all like put things together, you mind, but somewhere along the line we're stuffed into this structure that doesn't serve us. Then if we feel like we have to do it because we've been shuffled through school and into college and then we're in debt and then we have to take opportunities and these opportunities is a good opportunity, you know? It's a good, good career. Yep.

Speaker 2:          02:05:30       It's horrific. It is an end like, to go back to what you were saying earlier, like these, these systems that we've built are so antiquated and so outdated from politics to the school system and it all needs change and we're seeing it start to, you know, ever seen it start to. I think that the way we educate kids, the way we relate to add and all these things, I think so much of add is like the current system and the way kids are like confined in this classroom and have to follow these rules and sit still all day like it. There's no nurturing of creativity. Right? Um, so I think over time a lot of this is going to start to change. I hope so because we just can't squat. I see this with kids all. I have three nephews and I see the same thing.

Speaker 2:          02:06:15       They're so creative and they're confident. They don't care what other people think of them, you know, they don't have a lot of fear. They and, and when they do do something creative, they don't judge it and go, oh, is it good? Like they just enjoy the process and that starts to phase out as we get older and we get obsessed with other people thinking isn't good enough and is this safe and will this please my parents and like, will I be able to make money this way? And we just get so disconnected from that childlike creativity and wonder and curiosity and, and kind of no fear and faith in ourselves that we just get stuck in this kind of checklist. Tassel wearing life.

Speaker 1:          02:06:52       I think it's another tassels, tassels, our enemy. I think there's another thing that we need to consider and this is really important to people that are like, well, this is bullshit, dreamer talk. Listen to this because this is real. That corporate worlds only been around for less than 100 years. This is a new thing in modern life and modern life is new in terms of the length of time human beings have been alive. This is a new thing and it doesn't serve us and maybe with technological innovation and robots and automation and all the different shit that's coming down the line, maybe there'll be less and less opportunities for you to work a slave job and you'll have to do something creative. It will be more and more compelling, but this world that we've structured that doesn't serve us is incredibly recent and it's not. It's not rigid. Like you don't have to do it. Right, right. But it seems like you do.

Speaker 2:          02:07:48       It seems like you do. What's actually really cool about millennials, you know this, the generation that's now like 20 to 35, 36 ish. That's one of the things I talk about is generational diversity and millennials and they're demanding a different kind of workplace. They're more likely to take a job where they have more creativity. The culture is like less cubical base. They have more freedom than a job with the salary and the benefits and they're not relating to work in the same way. They're really questioning the old paradigms there. I don't understand like why do I have to be there from nine to five if I can like get this done at home, you know, a certain amount of time and a lot more of them are starting their own businesses and doing the more traditional path. So I think we're already starting to see it change because we have a generation that's huge. I mean the millennial generation is ginormous and there they are demanding different things from work and making different choices already. So it's already shifting. Already shifting.

Speaker 1:          02:08:46       Yeah. I also think another thing that's bullshit is the amount of time that's required to make a living just to survive. I mean how many people are barely being able to feed themselves and housed themselves and they're giving up their entire day and their entire week and you get. If you're lucky, you get that Saturday, Sunday off, but most of the time on Saturday and Sunday if you have an office job, you have some shit that you brought home with you that you have to sort through.

Speaker 2:          02:09:13       Yeah, that it's the whole payment systems crazy and you see like these instead of celebrities making all this money just by posting pictures and you've got somebody going to a job like nine to five day after day after day, barely scraping by. It's just, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:09:31       Well what freaks me out as people that just move money around and they make billions. Like think about like hedge fund people and people that like, what are you doing? You're moving numbers around and you're making numbers and how much, how much are you extracting while you're moving stuff around. It's the like. I had this conversation with this woman who was a staunch Republican who was telling me that the minimum wage, I was so ridiculous. She was so adamant that you can't raise the minimum wage. I'm like, why not? She's like, was $15 an hour? It would crush businesses. It would do this or do that. I'm like, well, other people disagree like you don't know whether or not that is. I go, do you want to work for less than 15 bucks an hour? She's like, well, these are entry level jobs and this and that.

Speaker 1:          02:10:13       I'm good. You're still requiring an hour of someone's time. If your job, if you ever, if you have a business and your business can't pay someone $15 for an hour of their time, your business is bullshit. It's bullshit. Or you have too many employees or you're, you know, you're not, it's not set up right, but you're the person who's at the lowest rung of the food chain to take the hit. Not The business. Like if you have a business, you came and pay someone $15 for a whole hour of working. How much money are you generating and why do you need all this business and why don't you know as employees do it yourself. It's not, it's not an efficient business and I wonder what's going to happen with automation and with, you know, they're, they're talking about like a tremendous amount of jobs that are being done right now by people that are going to be done by robots and it's just a matter of time.

Speaker 4:          02:11:05       Yeah. So it's even more important to nurture your creativity and know what you can do besides rely on the man or the corporation or whatever it is. Because I think a lot of people think that safety and economic security is in that is in working for someone else and working for a quarter,

Speaker 1:          02:11:22       getting a good job of climbing the ladder. Shoot your brains out, jumping off a building. Yeah. It's just, we don't have that much time. This is, this is not, this is not a long run. It's really not. It goes by really some 49 and I feel like it was 20 yesterday. It just, it just happens. And next thing you know, I'll be 59 and next thing you know, I'll be 69. You know, and I'll be able to close my eyes and hear the yawning grave. It's coming. It's coming for all of us. Yep. You gotTa have fun. GotTa have fun while you're here. If in any way possible.

Speaker 4:          02:11:59       I agree. I always say that I think regret is far worse than risk far like I, I'd rather take risks in my life than regret playing it safe or staying in situations that I knew weren't, you know, for me, I mean it. It's scary. Yeah. And there's no guarantee, but at least you do it.

Speaker 1:          02:12:23       That's where she comes from. The. Yeah, exactly. Like the scary stuff. Like, Ugh, that's what forces you to move. And that's what gets things done. Exactly. Every two years I throw away my act and I write a new one. Yeah. I do a special, like my netflix special. I abandoned all those jokes and I have to write a whole new one. Fucking terrifying. It's the worst, but I keep doing it and every time I do it, it gets better. If I keep doing it, I keep focusing on it. I'm all that terror and fear of taking that chance. It makes, makes me get better at it and that's a pretty minor thing because it's not like that much financial concern and I'll be okay, but for someone to take a chance financially and take a chance their future and they don't really know what, what the future holds. It's not like they have all these things to fall back on. That's when you fucking dig. In fact, that's when you make things happen and if you don't, you just. You just. You just stay soft and lazy.

Speaker 4:          02:13:20       Yeah. Then you never really discover your true potential. If you just stay comfortable.

Speaker 1:          02:13:26       Christina's people out there right now that are listening, that are getting fired up there. Listen this right now, they're jogging in place and you're like, God damn it. I don't want to listen to Christine.

Speaker 4:          02:13:35       Take a chance. It's good, right? Yeah, it's really good. It's really good, but don't just like you just broke the letter. Can you really end it? But don't feel motivated, like actually like commit to one thing. What's one thing you can do to start shifting your life? Is it, like I said, finding that hobby? Is it like having a conversation with your boss? Is it going after that creative endeavor, like just start. That's the other thing. Like people think they have to know all the steps. It's like I want to get to the second floor, I'm at the bottom of the staircase and like I think I just have to jump to get there. No, like you go step by step by step, just like you'd walk up the staircase so you don't have to know it all at once. It's just taking that first step and then that leads to another and that leads to another and like you said, like it's so scary moments where you find your grit and you find your potential and you find out how you respond to adversity and you find your true gifts and you can only do that in uncertainty and when you're uncomfortable, maybe she'd be a clarity advisor.

Speaker 4:          02:14:35       The clarity advisor, like of psychic. No, no, no. Clarity. Clarity. Yeah. What a psychic wouldn't be a cleric. This is my new. Oh, Gotcha. Gotcha. I clarity advisor. That's good. I like that. It's a little wordy. It's not perfect. It's we're getting closer to step step.

Speaker 1:          02:14:54       There's something there like you're. You don't. One thing that I tell people that I think is really important, it's helped me a lot, is write the things down that you need to do. Make a checklist as far as your day like the best way to get shit done is to stare that Goddamn list and say, all right, today, did I work out? Did I write? Did I do this? Did I do that? Then take care of that stuff, right? All that stuff that you need to do, do it at the beginning of the day or do it when you go to bed at night, sometimes even better before you go to bed at night. Set your intention for the next day. Say, I'm going to get all this shit done right out. Give Yourself Fifteen, 20 minutes. You have it. Everybody's got 15 minutes and then write it down, put it, put it on a piece of paper and the next day check that shit off. Yeah. Do those things and if you could just get in the habit of doing that. It's so easy to avoid because people love to just be lazy. They love the distraction of doing nothing

Speaker 4:          02:15:48       insane. They don't have time.

Speaker 1:          02:15:49       Yes, and saying they don't have time, but. But that is one that has been incredibly beneficial to me is writing things down and making a list and forcing myself to check all the shit off. It's on that list.

Speaker 4:          02:16:00       Yeah, and doing the things you don't always feel like doing and and also being accountable that people like having somebody that's like calling you and being like, did you do it? Like did you do it? Did you show up for yourself because it takes momentum. You are they making these kinds of changes? You have to build momentum and if you have that checklist and you're doing that, that one thing every day and maybe the first thing you're going to do is commit to making a list everyday. That's a great step. Once you start showing up for yourself every day and doing that and checking things off the list, you start build self trust. You start to have more integrity with yourself. You start to build momentum and then it's easy to take the next step and do the next thing, but without that momentum and without that commitment, I think people just expect their life to change like this and like we've talked about this a lot, like it just doesn't, but those little steps, they start to make you feel better too because you start to feel like, oh my gosh, I'm not doing the same thing over and over because that really is insanity.

Speaker 4:          02:16:57       But went on Einstein, who said insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result. I think it was like that. That to me is crazy. Making

Speaker 1:          02:17:06       it is and also there's a thing that people have to be aware of in that is the trap of falling back into old patterns because they offer you comfort. That happens to a lot of people that want to lose weight. Losing weight is a big one. They start, they start off good, they start losing weight, they start looking great, and then somewhere along the line, that old pattern calls to them, this is how I'm fucking

Speaker 4:          02:17:29       donut, man. You've won or you've earned a donut krispy kremes get a couple of them and some big deal tomorrow you get back on a track and you just never do. You never get back on track and it's, it's, it's really common for people, whether it's cigarette smoking or you know, fill in the blank, whatever it is. Old Patterns are really hard. They're really hard to avoid because they offer some sort of bizarre comfort. Yeah. They're like coping strategies and so many ways. I mean so many people eat or smoke or whatever for comfort or to self soothe themselves and so they can either make a new year's resolution and lose the weight and then if they haven't found another way to cope with life when things get hard or someone upsets them or whatever, they were going to turn to that old coping device because they haven't dealt with the issue underneath what made them overeat or drink or smoke in the first place.

Speaker 1:          02:18:24       Yeah, and it's also when you're filled with angst and she's. All these things are fucked up in your life. There's something about those old patterns like give you a big hug.

Speaker 4:          02:18:34       Yeah, they do that like a warm fuzzy blanket, but it's really disgusting. Covered with bacteria. Good way to look at it.

Speaker 1:          02:18:44       If people want to get ahold of you, how do they do that? How do they go about that?

Speaker 4:          02:18:48       Oh, well, expectation hangover is my last book. Christine Hassler, instagram. Facebook.
