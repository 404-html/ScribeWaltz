Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       I'm gonna. Do what you're doing. What are you doing over there, man? What is this? Well, actually I was thinking about making sure that I'm in a position mentally and spiritually to talk openly and clearly connect, but you're doing it with fists on interest. You're going to talk openly, but you're going to be strong about it. It's not like this. There's this thing that the meditation thing where you're just gently touching your fingers together. Yeah, right. I suppose then I'm looking to be embodied as well. Tense. You're like a hybrid. Yeah, that's right. That's what we've got become these days. A little bit of both. A little bit of spiritual, a little bit of warrior, the whole thing. We've got to survive in this world, so you can't be all the theories. Can't be. It can't all be in the consciousness. Yeah. Otherwise you'll never get anything done.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       Right. You'll just be constantly dealing with other people's wants and wishes and no. Unless you going to make the decision to be one of those cave people unless you. Because last time I was thinking about that, like this, put on robes, meditate. I that I only live in the consciousness, but given my extreme levels of attachment that I've experienced over the years to physical things, I don't think that's my path. You know, I'm here, I'm in the world, I'm sending books, I'm having a baby or caring about what people think about me. I'm wondering if I'm going to be in a film. I'm dealing with the world, being a man in the world, being the type of man I am. It's not like, oh, you know, I'll just real life myself off in a cave. Well, there's a certain amount of attraction that I think we all have this idea like, hey man, I'm just going to get away from it all.

Speaker 2:          00:01:47       But the problem is you, it's going on whether you like it or not, it's happening. Even if you're not there. So you should probably be there just to go, what is this? Yeah, what is this? Even in Christianity, Christ says in the world, but not of it. So trying not to be defined and determined by other people's opinions of you, the systems and structures that are set up around you, particularly if you question those systems and structures and think, well, I don't trust that system. I agree with that, you know, just having how you don't want to be defined by that. But the fact is we are here and I think there are certain people you know, but do have a monastic tendency that should be meditating, that aren't equipped for the material world. And one of the great things that make me sad about at times is if you don't have economic and productive value, then you are nobody. You know? And there were some people that don't know how to resource themselves. You've found a way of turning yourself into an economy of creating a kingdom. I found my own way. If I can make my mental illness work for me, people me money, it'd be this crazy, you know, but not everyone gets those kinds of breaks or has that kind of skillset. Yeah, I mean obviously there's some people that really do thrive on that monastic lifestyle does. Have you ever seen

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       this, a vice documentary on this guy? His name is [inaudible]. He lives in the believers that eastern part of the, uh, of Alaska. He's in this, uh, this Arctic region. It's a, there's a, a vice piece called Heimos Arctic adventure. That's it. Arctic refuge. Hi Mo. H e I, m o heimos high malkuth is his name and this guy is a very. HE lIves in the elastic arctic national wildlife refuge, 100 miles from tHe nearest human and he lives there with his wife and he lives in this little log house that he's sort of built himself and he thrives up there. It's very strange because we're, we're attracted to these people like to just go, okay, wHat do you do all day, man, like, what's, what's your life like and what do you do? Do you miss people? And he has like a vcr and he plays old movies and it's a fascinating thing because I think when you watch soMeone like that, you always run it through your head. Like, could I live like that? Like, is this, is this, got happier? And he says he is. I mean, he says that the, the hunter gatherer lifestyle that he lives is a uniquely attractive to people and, and uniquely satisfying and it's something that we don't get in our everyday world, so we're never like completely even. Whereas he is just running around fishing and hunting caribou and stuff,

Speaker 4:          00:04:27       we're fitting in with someone's else's idea of what life should be. The system within which most of us operate is not this. What I would do if, if I had to free star, you know, I don't mean just personally me, russell, I mean anthropologically yeah. We're designed to be nabad nomadic tribes people. When my podcast, as I said gestion by you, I had on as a guest, yuval noah harari, he wrote that book sapiens and he does a lot of anthropology stuff and says about like that, you know, look, we're designed to live in tribes of about 75 to 100 people, or at least that's what chimpanzees do when they get bigger. THere's normally a conflict and a separation and a split in that nomadic tribes would follow the food sources that were available to them. so in a way, if you can replicate that or get close to that in some way of your own, in your own life, it would make sense that it would make you happy.

Speaker 4:          00:05:22       And we're like, when you were saying that about the guy is a hundred miles away from the nearest person I fought people, there's people that live in suburbia that mentally or 100 miles away from the nearest person that you're just really. Your life is. You sit in front of a screen, you don't connect with. People hAve not spoke to people for days. You know, I think about this when people make these desperate attempts to connect through dog in his finger in my country where people meet up in labels and just having anonymous sex masturbating in public dogging. It's a uniquely british for nominal dogging. That's where I heard of this. Well welcome, welcome to britain docking is people go la bise quite buyers and it still could be sort of suburban is a bit like swinging, you know, but it's like you pull up in a car with this isn't.

Speaker 4:          00:06:02       This is. I've never done this. I'm just clarifying. You put up in a car with a partner, it could be, you know, I think it's kind of heterosexual thing or home that you can do it wherever you know, wherever your persuasion is. This particular place of particular people and you know the lights go on and people jerk off and you know you can have sex and so thinking these are desperate attempt to find some connection to nature to sort of drop anchor and hit your prime or self to get into who you are because you wake up and you've got to do your job and you've got a screen in front of you and you're a consumer and you're not living in the world anymore. You want some visceral experience. One of the things I get from these New York guys, he's like, oh, your person.

Speaker 4:          00:06:36       That's questing after with the whether it's the artery or the dmt, looking for what is it that we're meant to be as humans and I'm doing that in my own way. Having unfortunately written off substances because my stupid stupid mistakes in my twenties. I can't go into the dmt iowaska world's much as I would like to and like I want to find how is it that I be me in this world and yeah, I don't think it is through isolation isn't. I don't think it's like, right, I'm going to try and get an island and I'm not going to participate. I think it's like write what you know. We are nature. We created this. This is a form of nature. Our civilizations are manifestations, but is it the best we can do? Can we change it? Can we pull back from what seems more than ever like some kind of apocalypse with your current president?

Speaker 4:          00:07:20       No disrespect them with our country breakfast of sort of like a weird time of fracture and the manifestation of ugliness stuff bubbling up. Affiliate like dark unconscious matter. Bubbling up, man. I was in the airport traveling to here and I was in New York and like just the people that are working the lines. When you put your cases through that people felt seem heavy and low and like, because if you're british Donald Trump, just something that you know, you kind of make jokes about, you hope that there isn't going to be a nuclear war, but he seems like a sort of a comic figure, but here I sort of sent, oh, there's pain now. I know there's a lot of people that obviously liked him enough to have made him president of United States, but I think even in those cases he speaks to a particular rage. Something that wasn't being addressed.

Speaker 4:          00:08:00       The failure of neoliberalism that lies of the last 30 years of a kind of politics that was just about management and not about giving people truth. I don't know joe. I like, you know, like our individual journeys. How can our individual journeys, informal social and tribal journeys now national journeys and he's ever even hope anymore for such a thing as United States of America or great britain. Or should we start looking at smaller projects? Because you know, if the United States of America and great britain leads the colonialism, mass capitalism, consumerism, ecological meltdown. If that's what you believe in, then maybe we need to look at breaking down some of these great institutions.

Speaker 3:          00:08:34       I wonder if what's going on is that our biology and what we've been sort of programmed to for the thousands of years of living these tribal existences where in these travel existence where you had the small groups of 50 to 60 or 100 people plus that this is the new thing and that part of our chaos is are trying to adapt to the new thing. It's almost inevitable. We've created this incredible way where we can get food to people so more people had babies, more people stayed in these areas where they're not growing food and then you have. You're dealing with these massive numbers of people you know, in la 20 plus million and we're trying to figure out like how do we get along? Like how do all these different ideologies coincide? How do, how do we, how do we cooperate? How do we, how do we figure out what to do with all our waste? I don't figure out what to do with what we're doing to the environment. You know, how do we figure out who's right, you know, is it is a the doom and gloom people correct or that we're going to be okay people correct. You know, and what's, what's the right attitude to take about this?

Speaker 4:          00:09:41       Many of those significant movements that you're talking about, agriculture and industrialization and urbanization, agriculture obviously meaning food available on mass industrialization, products available on mass urbanization, people living together en masse. None of these things are good for the people on mass. They're good for a select straw of people that primarily benefit. You know, like the app, they say that the average diet of human being got worse after agriculture before that varied diet. People with loads of stuff after I coach her urine, potatoes, now peasant, you're on rice now, peasants, I think each of these movements are to benefit a particular aspect of the system of particular class, a particular structure, a particular economic class, and you know me and you ain't doing bad. We have relatively near the top, but we're not the engineers. It. There are corporations and elites to use that very popular word these days that benefit from things being like this. I don't. When you're saying is there a way that we can all coalesce and get along in urban conurbations are 20 million people? No, because the power is to centralized. Don't break down.

Speaker 3:          00:10:52       Mostly we are getting along maybe mostly. Mostly. Mostly we are getting along in these weird groups and even with our whatever static that we have with each other. Even with the weird weirdness of it all the diffusion of responsibility that comes with these gigantic groups and you see things happening, you just get away from them. We still for the most part of getting along in this weird new world,

Speaker 4:          00:11:12       I think you'll write it in a sense, joe, like I'm not. I'm not a demon, clean guy. I think human beings really, really beautiful and brilliant and like I don't feel like, oh god, this is such a mess. what I think is is that we're trying to inhabit systems that are not designed for us to live within and I think that yeah, people are getting on, but I also think that there's a lot of tension in cities that everyone's one right turn or one traffic light away from getting out of their car and smashing someone in the face. You could like feel it bubbling under in that, in that the feeling I had in the airport is that the people that were working there were under undue stress. Now, this is just one anecdote, but I feel that we're being forced to live on a particular aspect of our consciousness, a particular bandwidth of where we kind of a bit fry in the foot a little bit.

Speaker 4:          00:11:56       Too much desire and I'm talking about most people. We're again, I'm not poor no more so I'm able to create money. Creates distance. Isn't it? Money's like you can fuck off problems. I'm getting in a nice car and I'm out of here, but like I remember the feeling and a lot of people are living like that where the tensions up in their face and so yes, I agree that people do muddle along and that's I think shows you that we're not as in a darwinistic model or or or some of the ideas derived from darwinism rather like the selfish gene and the richard dawkins idea that people just want to survive and we just want to kill him. Fucking with. This is what propels us forward. I think. No, we're coke. We're cooperative, collaborative, artistic, imaginative, beautiful people, but we've created systems around the worst aspects of our nature.

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       Greed, selfishness. This is what capitalism and consumerism on and this is so all encompassing. Our cultures are domed by them and we can't see beyond them. We exist within them and I feel like if we were to break down those kinds of systems, live in smaller assemblies, smaller groups where power is as close to the people that affects as possible, where people would vote on, well, this is how we want to use our resources. This is where we want to run our street, our hospital, our prisons, our schools, our systems. This is how we want them to run. Then things which really, really slow down, but man, what's the rush into things would slow down and get a lot slower, but I think that people would be empowered and you wouldn't have resources and power filtered to a small group of people. No, I think you're definitely right and I think you should probably start a cult idea about how to run it and how to keep

Speaker 3:          00:13:28       so the resources in the community, but I think that also this discontent that we have is a sign that people being upset with how this is and the momentum of the way things have sort of established themselves today. That we is what we need. This is the momentum and the motivation that we need to try to improve upon things. I think we're uniquely qualified to do that today because we're. We're talking about it so you can be the doom and gloom guy today. I'll be rose colored glasses, so I think that this tension that we have in this, even like a guy like Donald Trump or brexit, I think the good thing about those things is that people are looking at what they don't like about the way we were running the world, what they don't like about our culture and they're getting upset about it and hopefully we'll sort it out that way and that being completely content with everything and everybody just sitting on the couch and smiling all day. It doesn't lead to necessarily lead to progress. I think we're more informed now than we've ever been before, so I would hope that with our ability to communicate and being more informed now that we have the potential to move towards a better society.

Speaker 4:          00:14:32       I agree with that, but I also think that that was important in the world is who has power, power being the ability to affect change. I, I'm not one of those people that are like, I'm not like baffled by what happened with trump. I feel, oh, there's an indication that a good many people feel extremely angry and disenfranchised the same as brexit and our country and I recognize and understand it similarly. I don't think, oh, wouldn't everything be zippity doo dah. If hillary clinton was president of the United States, that was where the way stuff was going. That's what the previous 30 years has been like in your country. My country, managerial politicians with no vision. We've seen the failure of recent sort of that they've kind of promises that were offered by an administrations recently. I think that what trump is, what brexit is, is a big fuck you to the system like we want something different, but for me, in a way these things are good because I believe that people that fill those things are right and I would like to see more power delivered to ordinary people.

Speaker 4:          00:15:28       Genuine change happening now, but I think it won't happen unless you sort of look at, well, what, where is the power? Really the power really is with people that this system works for a sort of a particular corporate elite, a particular straw. I Don't know. Politicians and bureaucrats and I hope that what the sort of cataclysms of recent recent news lead to is devolution of power new systems because even in the time that I've been in the country on this trip, joe, you know, there'd been that mad sort of massacre that it sort of for me is it, and this tells me that this is a sick society, not, not. Oh, and britain's wonderful of course, you know, we went round plundering the world crazy, crazy. We've got enough problems with our own, but like for me, what is causing this? Why is this hAppening? You know, for me, I don't see it in isolation. I don't believe in lone wolf. I think the system is coughing up these events and there are patterns and there's things that we can read and there are things that we can change to improve it.

Speaker 3:          00:16:26       Certainly a part of the guy that was that shooter was certainly a part of our society. Right? So if we have a set culture, you know, I mean there's, there's eVidenCe of it. I mean, is it not, it's not a completely set cultuRe. I mean, we don't. We're not all dying, right? We're not all, we don't have all have this disease, but some of us most certainly do. So this thing that you're saying like that people looked at Donald Trump as a big fuck you to system the tipping over the apple cart. I think that's absolutely what people were hoping for. And then there's a bunch of people that just love saying, fuck you. There's a bunch of people that went, fuck you is flying around. Yeah, fuck you. They just get in it. Fuck you. And then you're seeing a lot of that with Donald Trump supporters as well.

Speaker 3:          00:17:04       You're seeing people that they're looking for some excitement, they're looking for some fun. You're looking, you're seeing people that enjoy chaos. You know, maybe they're trapped in cubicles and they're just completely frustrated by this fucking grind day to day grind. Like literally being their soul, being ground down a cheese grater every day, being forced to stay under these fluorescent lights and it was fucking small little box dealing with human resources in the corporate environment and they're going fucking crazy and anything that happens that, that tips that over. It's all fight club, right? They're just going to get punched in the face. They're looking to go crazy. Then there's a lot of that as well, you know, but I think this chaos, the worst parts about it, there's no good too, right? There's no good to mass

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       shootings, but what comes out of all these things is the discussions and the intense realization that we have real problems with real problems with the way we're communicating with each other and I don't necessarily know if the solution. I mean it would certainly be a solution for those Involved. If you get 100 amazing people and everybody just starts a co op and Maine somewhere. I mean, yeah, it'd be great for those involved. But for, for all of us, I mean even while that, I mean it's almost like the monastic lifestyle we're talking about. If everybody just isolates, it's all going on around you. If you put your phone in a drawer and never use it again and you stay off the grid and you get your water from a spring, all those people out there still drinking water with antidepressants in it and there's a bunch of fucking small and the people have to deal with.

Speaker 2:          00:18:31       There's a bunch of problems with hurricanes now because the water's warmer. It's inevitable. it's inevitable that this is all you can decide, hey man, I only have 100 years in this planet fund this. I'm just going to ride this out. But if you do make a kid and you have, and I've got a bunch of them. I mean you would see what's gonna happen to them. You know what? We have to think about what happens with them as well were we're all this global community. Really? Yes, we are, and that's why I don't go for the head dominique lifestyle of our fucking. I've got a century. let's line up some blowjobs. I tried that route and that fellow john, let's get a century worth of pillow tops. Line up some blow jobs, ice cream here, brother Joe Cook because I like you believe in the possibility of change and I've been like, again, I mentioned it again.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       I started a podcast because you said, you know, cost and he's. He's good fun. Now. What I do on mine is I get like a because I'm doing a university degree, religion and global politics. In fact this thing happened. What happened to me really is I hit full on a full right now I know a bunch of things on it. Gonna work, the ice cream, the blow jobs, the attention, the privilege, heroin, crack, all these things. I control. Cough is not working. I can't control them. I've got to find a way through this. Oddly peculiarly it's a sort of a personal version of spirituality. Yeah, that's what I've found. William blake, the great english poet says each artist must find his own religion. We have to find our own way. What works for you is not going to be the same as what works for me.

Speaker 2:          00:20:01       You know, there are ways that we're coLlective, but there are ways where we are individually. So fulbright are going to have to educate myself, I'm going to have to do things that mean something to me. A big part of that was like write me and doing, you know, in my own small, fragile, brittle way brazilian jujitsu go, I've never done stuff like that before. So go and live in your body being there and go genesis, jimmy marlow and giving them a drop because all these guys are such big fans of your show, you know, and I go there and I do sessions with chris, that titanium skeleton of a man that twists me up and can cause paIn in ways. That's what, how was he even doing that? And like when I try to do this stuff back, it doesn't work or it puts me in my body in a different way.

Speaker 2:          00:20:37       Learning the history of the ideas that we're in in religion. The way that the, the, the distinction between politics and religion is an sort of an imaginary distinction. When people talk about religious violence versus secular violence, they're saying their violence is a rational and our violence is okay. I've learned some amazing stuff in the last few years. I'm the and as a result of that, the kind of guests I get on my podcast like this guy, can ross mate, you'd love him on yours. Actually, he was a diplomat in the foreign service around the time of the weapons of mass destruction and nine slash 11. He believed in the system. He's like, all he wanted was to work in the foreign service. He knew they were lying while it was going on, so he's like, oh no. This thing I believed in is not true. Like he's being asked to participate in it.

Speaker 2:          00:21:18       He come out of a foreign office and believes that no centralized power can ever work. We have to have devolved power assemblies. Anarchism is the word, and a key doesn't mean chaos. Anarchy means devolve power to the smallest possible groups that there's no power between you and I and jamie, that we're equal in here and we should run the space according to what all of us think is a group that hospitals, schools, or institutions, community should be run on a democratic basis. You don't need to minimize the amount of centralized or eight. We need roads to be running, needs to be some security and all those kinds of things based will be minimized where possible. That's what this guy came away with and he explained it real well to me and what I liked the increasingly. What I think is that when you talk about that make the cheese grater on the soul, that's the.

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       That's the phenomenon of the west, you know, that's what people in our countries are going through is alienation is talked about like in one of the things that navigates taught me about marxism, that marxist theory of the way that he criticized and broke down capitalism, how operates it weren't just talking about the economics, so mark's was a great economist. He goes, capitalism will lead to individuals feeling worthless and meaningless because they'll just be cogs in the machine. It will break people's spirits and that is what's happened because people sell. Not the only thing that's happened go on. It's also created incredible technology and medical innovation, all sorts of different ways that we can make the world easier. Do you think we could keep those things without the cheese grater soulmate? Because I think we couLd think we could call the stuff now. We could progress with it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:49       We could have different fare or ways of doing that and people were like, I think people sort of kill that conversation too early because there's, you know, because it's working for the enough people. Yeah. The throwing out the baby with the bathwater. I think so, yeah. That's what the whole thing of marxism is the abandonment of capitalism and so let's go this way, but you know, you look at what happened when people adopted marxism and left the lead to the death of millions and millions of people as, as capitalism and a lot of places we've been all f's but it's not reported in the same way, but I'm not saying that we will want to live in communist Russia or the soviet union or China. Terrible, terrible things happened there, but that's what we always. We always revert to say, well, is there not? Is it not possible thAt we could for start?

Speaker 2:          00:23:26       They didn't do it properly. They ignored it. That's what everybody says, but no one's ever done it properly. I mean, we have more freedom today. Human beings have more freedom, more freedom to behave, more freedom to communicate, more freedom to excel with this capitalist society that we're criticizing today than any human beings that have ever lived, ever. There's a lot of negatIve about it. One hundred percent, but it's also. There's a lot of benefits and positive about it. There were a lot of soulless people that are just counting numbers and throwing them on a hard drive somewhere and buying yachts. That's true too, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't continue to evolve and inspiring. I don't think evolution is finished. I know there's loads of good things about capitalism buffing. Let's carry on. Let's see. What we can do is could we be doing this better or I believe that we could.

Speaker 2:          00:24:04       I believe that this has taken us about as far as it could go because of certain ecological imperatives in this spiritual thing that you definitely mentioned that it's destroying the souls of a lot of people and it's not necessary. When is that? You know, the war we were promised in the fifties and the technological revolution will mean you'll work. I have an hour a day. You know, like they know when delivered on that and people just went, no, actually you carry on fucking work in and we'll siphon the profit up hill and we could have leisure by societies buy. I think that as long as there is a form of centralized power, people at the center of that power will not share it. I think you have to go, all right, this community is going to be run by those people. This community is going to be run by those people and that also solves a lot of the other problems that are defining our times of people seem to want different things.

Speaker 2:          00:24:49       Some people want to say absolutely no homosexuality. Some people say, we want total sexual freedom. Some people want, we want to live in what would be called a religious extreme way. Some people say atheist, well that can't exist under one banner. I don't think any more problem with people saying no. Homosexuality is that they're deciding about freedom. The other people's freedoms to exist for other people's freedoms to behave and to express themselves the way they want to, and the real problem with that is a lot of the people that want to control other people's freedom, they really. The reason why they're doing is they're trying to suppress their own urges and me. Right. One of the things I'm most interested in is how much of our activity is unconscious activity so much with doing things. We don't know why we're doing it. The book here that I'm promoting recovery, I written this book is my version of the 12 steps, but some of it last night we were in it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:38       Yeah. The 12 steps is a is a journey from unconsciousness to consciousness. That's what essentially is unconsciously pursue pleasure. You unconsciously pursue patterns because you don't know you're doing it if you're a smack it or a crack head like me. Eventually it gets you into such trouble. You have to address it, but most people hover along on the cheese grater level lives of quiet desperation, never realizing, wait a minute. It is possible to be happy. It is possible to be contented, move towards nature, you while yourself doing it, you can run. This is what I'm good at, this is why I'm doing a note. The way you run your life, I know they will know and telling you what to do. You don't want to compromise. You want to learn all of this fascinating staff and fulfill yourself. You don't want to be like, so you've created a road for yourself to do that, but not everybody can and more people could and I think there'll always be resistance. They'll always be corrupting because it's in me like I don't, I shouldn't spend another second condemning Donald Trump because I've got an arsenal in me. I'm a greedy person that wants attention and wants people to love me and buy my book and take care of my interests. You're introspective thinking has led you to stop that path. I mean that's, that's essentially

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       you. You saw the flaws and hedonistic behavior and you hit the pause button you thinking about and that's very attractive to people because we all see that in ourselves. You know? And when you talk about like what what I do and what I've done, the most important thing that I've ever done is surround myself with people that I love. Like I've a really good group of friends and interesting people and that that leads to more like they find more interesting people. It branches out and spreads out and then people listening to this, they become like minded. They pursue their happiness, they pursue their, their actual desires, what, what interests them, like what, what, what, what they would like to do for their, for their career, for their life, for their, their craft. Like what do you enjoy? Like find that thing. Surround yourself with likeminded people. And I think we all get fuel from the people that were around and it's one of the most underrated aspects of being a person in a community is if you're around a bunch of ambitious people who are creative, who are open minded and honest, you are inspired by that and you seek to have like likeminded thought.

Speaker 4:          00:27:50       Yeah, you're right about that. I think that's another one in the column, the against column for disappearing into the cave. And being an hmi or a monkey or whatever, because I heard someone say, we exist in dialectic, which means we exist in relationship and conversation with one another. Who are you without other people? You'll nobody in it in an aluminium capsule floating through space. What does your personality match? You know, so you're right about that, you know, that we exist in these relationships with one another. And I suppose what I have sought out is to connect with people on the level of the damage, on the level of the wound, on the level of the vulnerability. Knowing a pessimistic that's, you know, ring ourselves out into the gut away. No, that's recognized that we're flawed, but that together we can create supportive, compassionate, loving communities. And for me, the, the stein point for that is a life that is predicated on spirituality as opposed to materialism predicated on what my consciousness does. When I stopped thinking what my consciousness does when I meditate, now I don't have the advantage of the dmt experiences in the ios got fascinated by it, listened to it. She tried kundalini because you do that

Speaker 3:          00:29:00       well. Have you ever had any sort of psychedelic experience through doing kundalini because the people that I know that are really into it, they say that they can achieve people that I know that I've done dmt. I'll say they can achieve the same sort of states. Wow. With kundalini.

Speaker 4:          00:29:14       Well, they're doing it well. Kundalini is one of the things I believe in this particular toe at my finger by mark mahoney of shamrock tattoos, los angeles. He's the kundalini serpent as drawn by called young one of the great early figures of psychoanalysis, but the fire in the belly, the animal energy of survival, the energy of creativity, the serpent energy, the reptile energy that's deep in our dna. When we were listened to, when we were creatures that crawled on our belly and lives in a still can be the serpent,

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       the snake within can become crowned. It can become royal. Your animal desires can become royal, and I think that the kundalini as I understand it, is about harnessing those energies, bringing it up. I'd do like a yoga and I have. I do have pretty tripped how experiences where I feel like, oh my god, I'm awake, but I am not me. I am not my thoughts. I feel this sense of transcendence 90 fold them retrospectively. You know, in the moment there's no me to register it. It's only afterwards went, wow, I lost myself there. Do you feel weird when you finger people with that finger? Because it does. I know. Don't send that snake in, but to be honest, fingerings are less significant. My life finger is a very weird. It seems so rude in the expression fingering. It's a dirty business. It's not functional. No, there's no need for it in the adult world, but like it, it's not for a lot of people love it.

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       People ask for it. I say, do not give them the snake combat reptile. Right over open. The shark was, is this the right moment to tell you? I dreamt about you last night knowing it's a risk always to tell someone that you dreamt about them because once it's out there, it's out there. So and particularly, you know, check it out. So we were in this dream. We're in some sort of semi organic forest type world, but they had an industrial component, somewhat labyrinthian makers that component like that as if you know, like the, he walks how they've made the most of the woods, you know, to build little huts and stuff and maybe they'll have a little. I don't know if the walks have another couple of thousand years, maybe a little. He was trained. I don't know what they would have done. Who knows? They were lovely, cuddly little guys.

Speaker 2:          00:31:16       So anyway, there was a solvent. It is small industrial component to it. We were somewhere within that world and we were doing brazilian jujitsu. That's used the word rolling. Now there was a sort of, this is how we know is a dream cause there was a moment where I had you inside control. Now from that moment I moved towards choke and you did something where you arched and flipped over. Very acrobatic and very elegantly don't even know if it's an actual move or not. It was very, very beautiful and a for ah, right there. This spa, we're going quite well this rolling, but it seems that joe rogan is better at brazilian jujitsu than me, but that even in the dream world that seemed like something kaiden understanding of, well, there's

Speaker 3:          00:31:53       so what's brilliant about it and what's interesting about it is that the more time you put into it, the more you understand the moves, the more moves you require, the more moves you drill, the better you get at it, the more it's literally like a language and that as your vocabulary increases and your ability to like. Even if your vocabulary is very broad, if you don't talk a lot, he'd probably have stumbling conversations. Right? But if you get used to talking all the time and you're having a conversation with someone and the words kind of flow, but if you're talking to someone and they're weird and they bark out things and they talk over you, it's, it's awkward. And herky jerky, much like jujitsu. Jujitsu is almost like a Connecticut language, but there is a puzzle that's solved, right? And there's a problem, right? And this person's.

Speaker 3:          00:32:42       the problem is this person is trying to apply all these different techniques, whether they're chokes or joint locks on you and you are trying to both defend that and then put it on. You put yours on them. It's beautiful. I've heard you say before, high pressure problem solving or mma. I always describe as high level problem solving with dire physical consequences. Physical clickers, mma is the most, the most high level of all the problem solving because there's the consequences are so grave getting kicked in the head, getting elbowed and kneed like those things are so. Jujitsu I think is better for you for sure physically because the consequences are not nearly as grave. You get choked out, you're fine. You get your arm, you know, you tap out. If your lungs, you're, you're, you have. As long as you're willing to tap out, you have to be willing to tap. Now you'll, you'll get through it. Okay, and if you get injured, you just get it fixed and take six months off, she'll be back. I like that connect language thing you said. That really makes sense to me because I feel like when I'm doing it, I'm not going. Hello? Yeah. Show me the way to the train door door.

Speaker 3:          00:33:53       People that are like punch me in the right direction. You go thousand ways. Why exactly do you watch jujitsu? It all online? No, I don't watch those, but sometimes I look at videos of named grace. He's or something and they're effortless capacities and charisma. You should watch just because you're enjoying it. Watch like current top of the food chain, jujitsu guys like hoffa mendez, you know, watch some. Marcello garcia watched some, you know, some of the young guys coming up. Gary tone and it's fascinating to watch them apply these new strategies to this old language, you know, because that's really essentially what it is. I mean what you're seeing is these new approaches. Jujitsu is this never ending thing. I mean it really just doesn't. It doesn't. The the like boxing, although it's very complex and it doesn't seem as complex to someone on the outside, but When you watch like a guy like floyd mayweather or sugar ray leonard or someone who's just a master at their craft, which you use see how complex it truly is.

Speaker 3:          00:34:50       You see all the different, the all the different nuances to it, but it's still punching, right? There's just still too punching. Whereas jujitsu is this fucking tangle of bodies and possibilities and potential. There's so many different ways to approach it. There's people that are chokers. There's people that are armed lock guys. There's people that are. They like to get you with their legs, their triangle people, and they all have their own little way of approaching this conversation, so you've learned a few sort of grammatical pathways, fruit that kinetic language and think, right, I'm going to mf that. That particular area, so watching videos online, it's like watching a video of Alan Watts talking. You go, oh, okay. TerenCe mckenna or timothy leary or whoever it is that you think is fascinating when you hear them talk and it develops new pathways and possibilities for your own thinking.

Speaker 3:          00:35:36       and it was one of the things I was gonna say earlier though, we, we, when, what I was thinking while we were having this conversation about the future and about possibilities and about civilization that you, with all due respect what you and I are doing, both of us were. This is a very rudimentary way of trying to figure this out. I think were, were, were clubbing at it, you know, and I think people are listening to this that will do a far better job than us in the future. Yeah. And I think that that's important and I think that we're doing our best, you know, we're taking our tests, but when Henry Ford created the model t, he didn't intend it to race against the la ferrari. You know, he didn't know what the fuck a la ferrari was, but if he didn't make that model t the la ferrari and wouldn't have been possible.

Speaker 3:          00:36:15       But you can't go back and go, Henry Ford fucking suck, dude, ride this piece of shit with its leaf springs at stupid tires, you know, and then get into 2017 corvette zr one. You go, whoa, okay, this is where it's at now. It's like all these things have to be in place for the next evolution of it to advance, and I think we're, we're looking at today with our society is we're hoping that there's a solution out there were the, there is a solution, but it's god damn slow. Just like all evolution. It's god damn slow. It's faster than single celled organisms to a giraffe, but it's still fucking slow and we're a part of it. All of us, not just you and I, but the people that are listening to this and the people that are having their own podcasts, their own conversations and doing ted talks and writing books. We're all apart of thinking this out and these little pieces all fit together slowly but surely and create this mosaic of ideas and potential. And what we're experiencing now is just what we can experience in this realm. Like in this world with this life that we're currently stuck in and then someone 50 years from now we'll be looking back at our stumbling conversation, trying to figure out a way to engineer society correctly and they'll have a much better way of doing it.

Speaker 4:          00:37:29       I Think that's a very beautiful progressive argument. I agree with much of what you've said except some adequate joe. Even things I've heard on this podcast say when you have graham hancock or a particularly intuitive when you got them more sanctioned academic guy on there and they felt like, you know, you know, you bastard. You're the people that I love that

Speaker 3:          00:37:51       such a rebel, you know, it's, it's fascinating to see these people know, attacking him for his ideas and his research, but now having less and less ground stand on. Graham's ideas had been more proven in the last 10, 20 years than ever before the case. Finding these new civilizations and finding these new evidence that human beings have existed on this continent far longer and that they're traveling all over the world for far longer and the civilization, it's probably quite a bit. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:38:16       Than we thought that's right, and so we don't therefore know that this idea of continual progression, linear progression is the only one. It is possible that when it comes to the realm of consciousness, ancient people knew something that we are struggling to understand that and I, I

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       recognize that your model t to ferrari metaphor is a good one and actually speaking to young people now, I do feel that they're kind of more switched on. Geez, look at a baby With an ipad. It seems lIke they know already and, and, but what I feel is, and this might just be my personal narcissism, but I like to think of myself as the pinnacle of consciousness. That there isn't some other realm. Even though god, I want that dmt so bad. Like, why are you afraid of that? Because it's not. It's not a like, it's not an intoxicant because I'm a 12 step guy and I'm a sobriety shit. Stop other 12 step that you're not going to fuckIng book about that fucking promote. You're not going to fall slip addiction. It's not this idea that you're going to fall apart and become a junkie again.

Speaker 2:          00:39:23       It's not going to happen. That part of her is that you can say that joe, but also a in an integral part of my recovery is the idea of surrender and I think that's an integral part of a lot of spiritual beliefs and internal part of dmt. Yeah, I feel you, man, but like to bypass the idea of my egoic offer ship my egoic or flurry of I'm russell and this is what I believe and this is what I'm going to do. I've surrendered to a way of life. I've surrendered. If I can find some people with 25, thIrty years in recovery, clean time that go. You're allowed to take the empty. I'm like fucking hammered a pipe. You don't need there. There isn't a face or they're sanctioning. Well, in a way I learned by the way, you don't even need dmt. No. You don't need it, but you seem like you want it.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       Yeah, because I love the transcendent. I love it because I've know and I've always known that this experience of being in a body, in the conscious, individualistic mind, and remember I've taken loads of acid when I was a kid as well. I know that this is not all of it. This is just we're just reading one bandwidth of data with our century instruments that there is limitless consciousness and limitless reality. Do you miss that asked experience? Yes, I do. I. I love it. I love it. Is the concern that if you fell into it like whether it was mushrooms or whatever it is, that if you fell into that experience again, that it would lead you in a downward spiral of addiction in a sense. It's that in a sense, it's that and the fact is as well, I've turned my life around or my life has been turned around by this program, by this system and like, you know, the, the 12 seven, it does have something in it.

Speaker 2:          00:40:56       That's quite what I want to say. Like I said, little bit. Ascetic is a little thing like it's about the nile, Right? Because, but the reason that I've written this book was an interpretation to 12 steps, excuse me, it's because I think it's a masterpiece I think is a masterpiece at a time when people are struggling with ideologies, a tIme when people are struggling with religion because the bad things about religion is so obvious, the bigotry and the violence, those things are so clear to us even though there are many, many beautiful things about islam and many beautiful things about christianity are focused, tends to turn on the bigotry and the hatred that is present it or used out of those ideologies. The 12 steps is accessible to anybody and can be used

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       as a code to unravel your connection to your own individual experience, your own self centerdness, your own self obsession. Now this might not be a problem that you have that this might be the line that separates us. Me, I'm self obsessed and I have the first league like this is hoW it works. One, you admit there's something that you want to change and like that could be I'm a smack head, pretty obvious then, or you're a sex addict and that's a harder thing to admit because it can be rewarding if you're into adult human females in a culture like I was, but if he ultimately leaves you lonely and unable to have a family and you feel like you're having a negative emotional effect on others and yourself, then you need to admit it's a problem. The secoNd thing is could your life be better and the of course it could, and the third thing is being willing to accept help from others and whether that's a community or from your understanding of a higher power.

Speaker 4:          00:42:22       Now I happen to have, I believe in god in the sense that I believe that there's limitless consciousness that my individual consciousness is connected to something that I can't understand, that no one can ever understand. And again, as I've heard on one of my own podcast, as a matter of fact, yanis varoufakis who lived this political movement in Greece. He said, we will never know whether consciousness proceeded matter or matter, proceeded consciousness and in a way it's irrelevant now because spirit, this quality is here. It's here and it's a big pile of what human beings are and it isn't dealt with by consumerism and it isn't dealt with by contemporary politics. People don't talk about love, kindness, togetherness there, but these are the dominant things in our lives. That's What's most important to me. The people that I love, like you said, the connections with the people.

Speaker 4:          00:43:04       You have to become your reality, but a political system that reduces you to a component of an economic machine is never going to fulfill you. So what I now believe is that by what I think this book and do is give people a guide to reach in their own spiritual truth because it's completely non prescriptive. It's like your version of god is going to be different from mine. Your personal inventory that you draw up, we will reveal the truths of the way you see the world and the problems you've made. The communIties that you belong to will support you and you can change your patterns, you can make amends for your past, you can continue to stay present, and a vital part of this program is prayer and meditation, continued connection to the moments you don't lose yourself in your past or the projections of your future.

Speaker 4:          00:43:45       Now, whether or not that prohibits me from experimenting with psychedelics in the long term. you know, for me the jury's out because I do want to. And bill wilson, the guy who founded these fellowships was fascinated by asset and subsequent like even when he was so bad, it took a lot of acid and I think that guy was a prophet. He was on a mission. He was trying to discover what is truth, what is reality? We discussed much in the 12 step program though is because I think it's like most things, it becomes orthodox. You know, like most religions, most systems in the end they become orthodox and it does such a good job at helping with its primary purpose of stopping people, being alcoholic, stopping people, being drug addicts. That's such an amazing job and it's doing that job and it should continue to do that job well.

Speaker 4:          00:44:26       I feel like I wanted to do is extract the thing that I think is amazing about it and say, oh my god, anyone could use this. Do you hear this again and again from people that have got long time pro clean in these programs, everyone should work this program. EveryoNe should know what is the impact cause your mom treated you tHat way or your dad, they saw associate at intuit score. You were abused. You are still carrying it in your consciousness. We've touched on it a moment ago, joe, if you're like I say this, you don't choose between having a program and not having a program. You choose between having a conscious program and an unconscious program. If you're not working in a conscious program, you are being worked by your unconscious program. This is what I do. If a man makes me feel intimidated, this is what I do. If a woman makes me feel like I'm important, this is what I do. If I have a bad day program, program, program, the program of your class, the program of your school, your family, your culture, your time, and this 12 step system can be buggy from it and it's not anybody else telling you what to do because it's your own version of a higher power. It's your own version of a truth, except it's guided by the idea, become free, connect to who you really are, and become benevolent and loving to others.

Speaker 3:          00:45:28       You know what I'm thing? Is it really important that you said earlier about there's no political system or no, no politicians that are talking about love and values and caring and a sense of community. I think that's the solution to what we're fearing about brexit and Donald Trump and the rise of, you know, the just this attorney of the apple card, this, this thing that people are seeing right now that they don't like and this, this, this, the hateful rhetoric that people are most disturbed about, particularly with brexit. Right? That's like the big thing that people are really disturbed about is that it was fueled by this fear of the other. Yes. That's right, but isn't it possible that the when if people decided that that didn't work out, whether it's brexit or trump, that the response to that would be the rise of this ideology, the rise of someone who's going to talk about love and community and someone who's going to be genuine.

Speaker 3:          00:46:23       I mean we don't have that person now, but it doesn't mean that that person can exist and we've only had 45 different presidents we had. We haven't had any, every single version of what's possible for a human being to be interfacing with the entire civilization of the United States of America. I think it's pretty clear that what that system delivers. I think that those power systems are evolving in this direction. I think that this is, if not the pinnacle, I think it's possible that there are better versions of a president, but I think that systems that at that centralized will always deliver inequality. I think it's impossible for them not to and I think that they should be evolved, altered, devolved in a in a sense,

Speaker 4:          00:46:58       but I do agree. One of the things that in the I think is positive about cataclysm in politics, if something like brexit, when brexit happened, when trump happened, I felt this sort of. I'm a bit, I'm eric know I'm a dharma mccormick. I live in mischief, I live in the madness. That's just behind reality and I've been away. This is good. Not for the people's lives will be negatively effective when we've seen the rise of divisive politics and like kinda softened quite old fashioned ideas about sort of ethno nationalism and that kind of stuff. But the good thing is it precisely as you say, joe, that it does open the conversation up for someone to say, oh, hold on a minute. I think we've just left out love kindness, unity, togetherness, like these things perhaps people will be open to. Whereas I think if, you know, if we'd stayed in the european union, if we'd had hillary clinton as president, things is a bit more business as usual. We're not forced with. We're not staring into the face of madness. We're not forced to address. Things are going wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:47:51       You know, I talked to my friends sturgeon, a dental sturgill simpson, the musician. He a brilliant musician and he sent me this text message of a conversation that he had with dr rick strassman. Dr rick strassman as the guy out of the university of New Mexico ran those clinical tests on dmt, wrote the book, dmt, the spirit molecule, but he was quoting when he was talking about the times that we live in and how fucked up everything is. He was quoting this, I forget, I think it was a monk who said this, that we are constantly in a fight between 49 point nine percent and 50 point one percent good and evil and that they fluctuate back and forth and that we feel like we are just like a speck of dust because we are both a speck of dust and the most important thing in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:48:48       Because the. The actions of one individual literally can influence the course of the human race. The course of our civilization and that this period of flux is what creates growth and change and that the tipping of the apple cart and the. The, the positive thing about having someone like Donald Trump, and I don't like Donald Trump more than I like hillary clinton, I didn't like either one of them, hillary clinton represented to me was this lifelong politician who didn't support gay marriage until 2013, which she was to me. What she represented to me was an obvious magician, someone who I could see them pulling the cards out on their sleeve and I'm supposed to not pay attention. It's bullshit and what he represents is the ego unfettered in figuring out with crazy hair and a family in the middle sands and the whole deal. It's just this chaos ego putting his name on buildings and then we're realizing that both of these are terrible options.

Speaker 3:          00:49:45       System is a terrible system. This way. When we have what's essentially a popularity contest to see who controls nuclear weapons, it's insane. It's literally insane and that the only way this is going to change is by having this incredibly upsetting moment for everybody where they're looking around going, what the fuck is going on? And then new ideas get introduced and I don't know what those new ideas are going to be or who's going to introduce them or how someone is gonna come along within the next three years and challenge this current system in a way that's appealing, not just to the right and to the left, but maybe in some way to just human beings. Maybe in some way human beings, They realize like what's what's we're not going to get by in this world by enforcing right wing politics and ideas and and, and this sort of ideology or left wing ideas and politics ideology, but freedom and love and community and to be free to practice your own level of conservatism on your own. But the idea that I don't want any gays and want to have a little tribe were no gays are allowed. That seems to me to be counterproductive and that seems to be the counter revolutionary. All of that idea. Any suppressing of people's individual right to express themselves.

Speaker 4:          00:51:01       Sure. I agree with almost everything you said there and I've got a sense of been involved in academia. Do you know one of the main changes or make notes? Oh, well, yeah. Notes now. I never would have dreamt to that when I was a younger man. Excellent. Native beginning. You talked about this idea of the fitbit, the percent aisle, you know, good and evil that couldn't even now there's a great quote by the rational for sultanates and the line between good and evil runs not between creeds, religions and empires, but through every human heart. So nice quote for that quote now, and he's a personal theory that the reason that I dollar tree is bad, like they becomes like an in most religions say don't worship individuals is precisely because they understand that don't make one individual have too much power. Even now, historically we know that gandy had skeletons in the closet.

Speaker 4:          00:51:46       Great. Great gandy, wonderful. Great hero of bringing down the british empire, bringing it about freedom and love. Interestingly, gandy said there's no point ass kicking the british out of India and then replicate in their systems. This is a country of 70,000 villages. These 70,000 visitors villages are or should be autonomous run on their own craft or craft economies, trade with one another only in access, so like he was trying to get like important ideas out there, but like, like your great civil rights leaders, malcolm x, martin luther king, these are men that had flow. Malcolm x did prison time for unusual shit, but Dr. King, you know, extra marrow of stuff. People are not perfect. They're great hero. Pioneer people are people. So we have to change this. What I think is is that we can't have a popularity contest to decide who's in charge of nuclear weapons.

Speaker 4:          00:52:35       These kinds of systems need to be devolved because it's mental. We know that. Exactly. I agree with your analysis of hillary clinton and Donald Trump entirely. I think that the reason that you have a mad option like Donald Trump being successful, it's when people had had enough of those cheap tricks and cards up sleeves and financial corruption. So yeah, the apple carts going over chaos too. I agree, is an important part of evolution. We rest on chaos. These patterns that we observe, just temporary or show their sort of a cult leader and sort of poetic figure leader said, we talk about civilization as if it's this great thing. What is civilization a clearing in the forest? You know, for a moment we create our cities in the forest closes in and has it again. We're all theSe ancient civilization. Graham hancock talked about, so lucidly, where are they now? It up by the amazon

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       and I think great quote in a herman melville's moby dick that says, you know, noah's flood is still happening. We are. The majority of the earth is still flooded in war. These, we are connected to these events. We are out there in that chaos. So I suppose, gosh, what I'm trying to say here, joe, is that when we recognize that we're all flawed, that we're all fallible, we have to sort of thing. We have to think, how can we build systems that tend towards the better aspects of our nature, not the worst aspects of our nature. Can we recognize that any politician in a position of power for too long we will make mistakes, will be floored. That power has to be spread out as much as possible and as close to the people that it affects as as is feasible. Yeah. There's always going to be an issue with someone being able to acquire $100,000,000,000 like the amazon, Jeff Bezos guy like that, that is going to corrupt people. It was like, why would you? First of all, why would you keep working? Why would you want that amount of money and what's your plan? What's your end game? You're trying to make the world a better place. You're going to try to acquire more brown boxes with your logo on them. I mean, what do you. What are you doing?

Speaker 3:          00:54:34       Where's, where's it going? And it seems to me that there's a game, right? Everybody plays this game. Some people play it for $10 an hour. Some people play it for $10,000,000,000 a year and that once you make $10,000,000,000 a year, you want infinite growth. You want 11 next year? I would like to tell my stockholders that we have caused to celebrate and we have 20 percent increase in our, uh, bottom line this year and everybody's looking good. Let's go to tahiti. Right? And then like where, what are you doing? You can't, this is not going to last. You're not going to live forever. Like what? What is the end game? Well, there's no end game. You're caught up in the current game, in the current game. They are literally, capitalists are literally living in the moment because you have to just stockpiling shit that they're not thinking about the overall objective, you know, a sky down looking from the, you know, looking from the heavens

Speaker 2:          00:55:23       down on earth like what the fuck are we doing? They're not thinking about that. Nor are they accepting that limitless growth is literally impossible. That we have finite resources on a finite planet,

Speaker 3:          00:55:34       not for me. It's also you get caught up in the momentum of whatever you're doing, you know, whatever you're doing, you just get caught up in it and you know, you. If you're doing something and you're trying to get better at it, whether it's make a better paintings or acquire more wealth like you these requests and you try to get better at these quests, you know, and that's, that's, that's a real issue with human beings and I think it has evolutionary roots. I think it has roots in our, our, our need and desire to make better structures and shelters to make better weapons, to make a better civilization so that we can stay alive longer so that we can ensure that our children will be alive longer. I think there's roots in that that are sort of just sort of bastardized and twisted in this world of ideas where, where you're talking about like money and and and, and stocks and bonds and mutual funds and hedge funds and it's like jesus, like it's, it's almost like we have these ancient instincts for, for constant improvement that just, they, these human reward systems get. They just get corrupt.

Speaker 4:          00:56:43       Did. My theory on this idea is that we have biochemical drives, as you've just described, that compel us to move forward and to survive. But we also have a culture that's continually stimulate in fear and desire in order to cost us in a particular economic role that have consumer. And the reason that I believe that this program and indeed this book are important, is because it is a code to awakening a code to becoming conscious and once you are conscious you aren't beholden to the same systems. So much of our behAvior is a result of what we don't know about ourselves. We are motivated. we're trying to fulfill ourselves because there is that biochemical imperative to get more to survive. Which as an addict I experienced and have experienced an extreme sex, sex, sex, sex, sex till. There's no more getting out of my head till it's inconceivable that I could do that anymore without killing myself a one in status and power and prestige.

Speaker 4:          00:57:43       And see. The reason that I think this system works outside of addiction in it's as it's currently recognized is I've had to work in all sorts of ways. Once I got rid of drugs, I got obsessed with sex. Once I get, once I get a handle on sex, I've stopped being obsessed with what other people think of me. Power, fame and money, and what I'm continually recognizing is none of these things can be fulfilling. If you're not connected to who you really are, that can give you a moment. Then you're free to pursue your art or your creation of structures in a conscious way. You're not doing it because you feel unconsciously a bit worthless or a bit crap or like it might fulfill you. It becomes pragmatic. Eric,

Speaker 3:          00:58:17       do you also feel that like less concentrating on yourself and less being self obsessed is allowed you to have more open communication with other people and more healthy like back and forth, fulfilling communication with other people, which literally makes you happier. Whereas you thought that being obsessed with yourself and being obsessed with success and adulation and or sex or whatever those other things were that you were obsessed with was going to fulfill those needs and they weren't, but that community and bonding and that's a big part of jujitsu as well, man. So I think part of it, yeah, big, big, big, big part of jujitsu. It's like we're a family when you're in there choking each other, as weird as that sounds like there's a. There's a bond between those people that are in those classes all over the world that are. They're going to. They they, they recognize this community in that as well as it being an extreme pursuit and as well as it being something that is developing your human potential, you're also. You're also creating this really intense community of likeminded people. Comedians feel that. I definitely feel that with you. I feel that with most comedians that come in here and I know what you. We are the same thing in a lot of ways.

Speaker 4:          00:59:25       Yes. Yes. I think that's very important and in a way it's a return to what you were saying at the beginning of our conversation that there are certain anthropology core requirements that you need to feel lIke you're part of a tribe. You need to feel connected to one another and in my very limited pop in there once a week experiences of bjj when I've done classes with other people instead of just the one on one with the instructor because he looks after me, you know, I mean he's delicate because he's brilliant, but when it's with like other people that are similar beginner level, there's moments of real intensity within it, but afterwards, a sense of fraternity and love and closeness and like some stuff that I'm not familiar with have not used to being close to men in that kind of way and it's amazing and beautiful and probably very, very natural and impute important side of my life that I didn't explore because I did download the myth of our time that you are an individual and you carve your own way in this world and what's important is your power, your ability to affect change on others.

Speaker 4:          01:00:27       Your ability to sleep with women, the adulation of others. And as I've got older and having experience a degree of it, I recognize, oh, it's not real. It doesn't work. And symbol things. Connection and community have become more and more valuable to me, but it's an ongoing thing because if you set, the percentage is so close, you know, we're not getting involved. Recently in a campaign that it was. I got involved in a campaign to save a house in the state a couple of years back about these women asked me to tell them our state's going to get turned into commercial flats were all getting evicted. We live here with our families. I back their campaign, I've got them on the tv, this corporate power back down and it was amazing because like ordinary people, ordinary family be, you know, it was like the rebels be in the empire. It's like an amazing achievement of those people. But my ego, like there I am, the power, I am the power fed back into it. You know, so like I, I see it as an ongoing thing, but that my life now is how can I convey ideas that I think will help people in a way that is accessible? How can I be useful? And knowing that my, my role in this is to make sure that I don't slip into the yoga egomania again because I would love to be a cult leader on some days.

Speaker 3:          01:01:39       Thinking, thinking about it though and being aware of it is one of the most important steps because we're all, we're all a work in progress. I mean, there's no perfect person out there. They don't exist. And we've already discussed this kind of ad nauseum, right? I mean, I'm a work in progress. You're a work in progress. I don't, I've never met anybody who wasn't. And I never met anybody who doesn't vacillate at least a little bit, larry. There were some days you're better than other days and those days where you're not as good, you feel uncomfortable about it. And those are the lid would lead to better days. When you find yourself slipping, those slipping moments are actually critical because they give you some self awareness. You realize why I fucked up, you know, I yelled, fuck you at my car window when I shouldn't have or whatever it was, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:02:17       Well, again, this system is what provides

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       you a way out at like the, you know, the recovery system, this 12 step system is that you like, you would not rely on one person to be perfect. You recognize everyone is fallible, but together as a community we can start to have better objectives and in an instance like I fuck up all the time, but this step nine, step 10 or about making amends when you make a mistake. So I would like now I literally do this. If there's a moment where I shout fuck you, but somebody or it isn't. I go shuffling back a day later listening to this thing where I said fuck you. That was wrong with me. That must have affected your feelings to find someone in traffic there you to fuck you. Yeah. I'll try and do it real quick. You've got, you've got fast and a lot of my fuck you's. Maybe it's on a phone call or maybe it's in a shop or whatever. The air like, I mean in a way is about, I suppose becoming a benevolent force in this world. If I tend towards that better, 50 point one percent as opposed to the 49, then I'm becoming an a progressive agent or a bird benevolent agent as opposed to another person intoxicated.

Speaker 3:          01:03:22       I think it's a microcosm of what we were talking about earlier about society itself is that one day in the future, look what the way we behave today is light years past the way they behaved in during the inquisition. I mean in, in, in the future. I imagine especially today because people have so much access to the way other people have behaved. We have so much data on just written words, listening to people talk and podcasts and speeches and watching videos. There's so much more data than there ever was available. One hundred, 200 a thousand years ago, that in the future we're going to have a much better way of communicating based on the learning and growth if we survive. Right, and I think that's the same thing with You and I and everybody listening to this as a human being. If you continue to grow and you don't fall into all these traps as time goes on, you will be a better version.

Speaker 3:          01:04:16       It's slow and it's fucking brutal and it's painful sometimes because it's just, You feel like, god, why don't I have my shit together? You know? I mean there's, I was saying this about Donald Trump, like someone was writing off Donald Trump, like he's never going to learn. You know, he's who he is. I'm like, did you just stop learning when you're 70, like, 70? That's it. It's over. There's no more data's getting in there. Well, I don't know. I don't. I mean, maybe Donald Trump could have a revelation one day, you know, maybe Donald Trump could realize the error of his ways and the way he communicates is his, you know, he's causing more problems and he's fixing, you know, maybe he'll be not even to point him out because it's just, he's just one of us, right? To all of us that I think we're, we're all slowly, brutally piecing this thing together and hopefully we're better at it than we were a week ago and hopefully we're better at it than we were six months ago and that it's going to continue.

Speaker 2:          01:05:09       Well, that feels like the general tendency in my own life to put out the general tendency in your life. Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          01:05:15       And you know, one of the things that's helped tremendously as this podcast, being able to have these long three hour conversations with people, you sit down and talk to them with no distractions. It doesn't exist anywhere else. It doesn't exist in nature. Someone. Someone said this to me, they said, you know, you always say on your Podcast that you just try to have a conversation. He goes, but who the fuck has these kinds of conversations? We just sit down and stare at each other and talk for hours at a time. I'm like, get your right. I mean, it is just a conversation still, but you're right. Is that, it's sort of an accelerated form of it. It's like a. If you, you know, you could kind of apply it to everything else. If you spent enough time doing it, you know, you're just, you're, you're going to get better at it and you're going to.

Speaker 3:          01:05:53       A lot of the podcasts is thinking right and it's an examining your own behavior and examining the way you interface with other people and I do more of that than I ever have before. What do you want to change about yourself? Just keep going the same way. I'm going to get better at being nice, get better at being honest, get better at being in loving. I mean, it sounds hokey, hippie bullshit. He says, yeah, I want to. I want to be nicer. To me. I want to have better relationships with my friends, better relationships with my family, better relationships with people that I don't even know that. I mean I just want to interface with the world in a more positive way. I think one of the most important things to realize is all the interactions that we have with each other, a dependent upon to individuals or more.

Speaker 3:          01:06:34       Right, but it's You and whoever you encounter and the way you encountered them is going to change the way they behave to you and everybody always wants to put it off on the person who behaved a certain way to them and in some ways you're right, but in other ways your reaction is completely dependent on your own way of approaching it and your reaction may change the way they react and you'll complete the right like any. Like if the, you know, throwIng a pool against that brick wall, it will bounce back a certain way, but if that became a softer surface or indeed a furry wall to quote one of my own films, that it will bounce back in a different way so that they did another thing that's in the program than necessity for forgiveness. If you. If you instead of blaming your past and blaming other people, you come to a point of forgiveness.

Speaker 3:          01:07:23       This creates the silver, the nexus for change. As long as you're like, ah, that person felt me out when I was a kid or my bad wasn't a loving figure in my life. As long as I hold onto that belief, I'm trapped by it. I mean, I say I relinquished that now. It's not happening anymore. I'm willing to move forward. That's another human being. They were doing the best they could. Suddenly you're liberate it in your path changes. Now, joe, when you were saying just then mate, about like wanting to help people, do you have any particular projects are specifically about that? Obviously this podcast is a tool for education, but do you have anything that specifically about right, I'm going to do this thing like, I don't know, take in martial arts in the community type stuff? No, no. You think it'd be really good at that if I had more time. I just don't. I don't have enough time to do what I'm already doing, you know what I mean? In terms of just sheer numbers of hours in the day and I think

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       I can't just work because if I just worked, my work won't be any good. I mean you have to live. It's one of the most important things about standup comedy is you can't just do comedy. You have to do other things and this is something that took me a long time to figure out like you can't, like you ever see a lot of comics, they just started talking about airline travel and hotel rooms and your life is your life and they can relate to it, so that's what they talk about. What? That to me is a failure of gathering research. I mean it's all. It's life, right? But your life has to. I think in order to have a continual body of work again, he can't just constantly talk about airline travel. You have input. My thing in the beginning of this was about airline travel and the low level, low frequency anxiety I experienced in airline workers.

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       It certainly wasn't a comedic bit, but it was cultural analysis and did to a degree revealed that I'm in the middle of a press junket and that's my life at the moment. I could just as easily have told you about bees. I'm a bee keeper. I've bees. All right. Do you swim in the river? you have experiences, you have said for we sort of one be, I'm not keeping one b, one b, one one doesn't work. You're like, be. I'm afraid. I said responsibility to have now. Sixty thousand pounds. I'm not taking them on the or anything like that, but he doesn't. Yeah, you're right. It's given me and said, what's your standard, your standup comedy then what is it currently? What are you covering? What your sections, your bolts. See what I'm doing right now is working towards the new netflix special that I'm going to do in either march or april.

Speaker 2:          01:09:47       I have to figure it out. Uh, want to do it in boston and I don't want to do when it's too cold because that 1000 seat place in boston. I think wilbur. Yeah, they will. Yeah. It's awesome little theater because it's really 900 seats and it's really three, 300 seat comedy clubs. Yeah. It's three stacked on top of each other. It's a great venue. Well, you'll say, so you're going to do an hour of free nights. Boy, you'll see. What if you got to a free 20 minute average? Do you know what your pit. So yeah. Anyways, if you don't mind me, it's difficult to talk about it on the podcast because without going into actual. But can you tell about the area or I'll tell you about my arrows to show you this. So I think I talked about like when I got heavily involved in politics and I found myself on tv shows and doing rants on telly and getting into arguments.

Speaker 2:          01:10:32       Those are great, but otherwise thank you. I love doing those. Love the one you did. Was it fox news that you did one with it? Breaking down like what are we doing here? I love doing that. I liked that love, ridicule available. Once you get into the analysis, you're, you're a fucking runaway train and once you start a sentence and you start going very fast and powerful and they'll be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. And there's not a lot of ums or uhs to interject and they're sitting there. They're all, you know, first of all, the little starry eyed in the first place. Second of all though, the runaway trains happened like, uh, uh, under the ride's over five minutes later, like tin cans or rolling down the aisle and they're like, okay, it's a good technique because see that what we were saying about bjj, that, that language don't know the language, the language comedy, it's a language I've worked on.

Speaker 2:          01:11:17       So one of my techniques is never create space. Give them no space, no space, no space smush. See if you take the actual jujitsu out of it. I'm brilliant. Or jujitsu, it's just the actual physical contact. Hold locks and chokes judges who shows itself in all forms. Yeah, that is true. Transcendence to find one universal language, one universal myth, one mind one consciousness, one, yes, no, the way broadly. And you'll see it in all things. So Ryan Hamilton, masashi, that was pretty good for five rings. Just drop that in there. Chinese philosophy or something like that to my arm. What is he? Some sort of master? He was a samurai that was a, he was a ronan. He was, uh, during the time where samurais roamed the earth and got into these one-on-one sword fights. And he killed 62 men in one-on-one sword fights. I said, life in a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          01:12:10       He wrote an amazing book on strategy in life. And one of the things that he emphasized in that book is that a real warrior must be balanced. You must be good at art and calligraphy and poetry. Good. Can't have any holes in your game that you have a balanced person in order to survive in these intense moments of sorts, flying at your face. I had never teach a man to fight who doesn't know how to dance. It's quite good in it. I don't know how to dance set paycheck they like. But what I sort of like, what I've done is I've found things like the approach from a different angle of like pointing out the things that I did wrong in my political campaigning where I floored and fed into my ego. I do a good long bit about the birth of my daughter, like purely from the perspective of a watching a birth, like, like, uh, uh, commentary, uh, sports commentary on the baby coming out.

Speaker 2:          01:12:59       I don't use the beat, uh, the rhythms of sports commentary, but just actually describing what happened and what it did to my mind to be present at the birth of my daughter to experience something that's so defined, but so animal tearing, flesh roaring and all that stuff. But It's like god is in their house, you know? So it did it beyond that. But in every time I building up into a point of divinity, I undercut it with like, you know, how sort of mad it looks and the obvious stuff I guess you'd call it. So like I do that so. And the whole show rebif, which I'm doing from a netflix, I believe at some point soon it's like a is about, it's called rebirth. And the point of it is how having the babies, men, I've been reborn to myself, but a lot of it's about recognizing the limits because I think I got very narcissistically involved in politics the same way and possibly getting narcissistically involved in spirituality right now because I still have this yearning, this thing that wants to change other people's lives, changed the world in inverted commas. You know, but like the comedy comes from recognizing my own flaws within you. Do you do any sort of like really difficult to exercise outside of a jujitsu? Do you ever do ever get involved in, you know, any like yoga, like intense yoga, like long periods of time, like 90 minute hot yoga classes

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       or running or anything where you really have to push yourself physically, really push a run and then listen to your podcasts and sam harris' podcast sometimes or wherever and I'm like, and I do. I do do yoga, but not like. It's interesting that you specifically say push yourself to the limit. Why do you think that's an important part? I think there's a freeing aspect and pushing boundaries and physical boundaries because it's exhausting and not just exhausting physically, but mentally too because there's a strain on your. Your body's desire to quit, like your, your, your mind's desire to seek comfort and that in pushing past that you find this freedom and you also find a vulnerability and who you are as a person. It's very difficult to think greatly of yourself and to Be egos autistic when you know that you're so fucking tired, you have to put your hands on your knees and your, you're heaving and you know, and then you have to keep going and then don't, don't be opposed to you.

Speaker 3:          01:15:03       Come on, keep going. And so you, you don't, you realize who you are. You feel yourself for who you really are as opposed to like adulation and looking at yourself as this, uh, this thing that's above it all. Like you realize the flaws in your mental process, the flaws in your, your physical abilities. And I think it's very humbling you. Yeah, right. I can see that doing that in a bodily way, it will be useful. But like I tell you the truth, the trouble for me, and I think a lot of addicts, he's not the like of course they self obsession, but self obsession isn't usually about fucking great. IT's normally I'm worthless. That's why he comes mostly from that position, but it's also you're thInking about yourself all the time, right? That is the problem that needs to be decoded. And I think you're right, that physical exercise is really, really important.

Speaker 3:          01:15:48       The level to the level to which I think I always feel better. It's not my, like I have to work even to bloody do that. I'd rather spend a ton of time thinking or doing something thinking I'm fucking coming is thinking that's what's, what's confusing about it to people. It's thinking, but it's thinking in a very different Way. Like there's, there's thinking when your body's at rest and you're just using your mind whether there's also thinking when your mind is trying to manage your body under extreme stress. And that is also a mental exercise and that's where people get it wrong. When people look at people that exercise and especially people that work out really hard and they think of them as meatheads or as like someone who's based or primal and unevolved. But I feel like there's a high level of mental evolution involved and being able to push yourself like, like I, I really admire people that, you know, like you'll see like a lot of old people that are, uh, I see him in yoga class all the time that just never fucking stop in there. And they don't have extreme physical abilities at all. They're not, there's nothing athletic aBout them. They're not strong, but they're in there grinding. and in doing so you have to, I mean, it can't possibly be comfortable for them. Right? I look at their saggy arms and their old legs. This is not like some graceful person is able to do this easily. This is a person who's really struggling and in real struggle, like that is a mental

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       energy that's involved in forcing your body to go through these uncomfortable emotions. That I think is very freeing. Yeah. I think you're right. What you said as well about balance and possibly what you're saying is that I'm a person who will benefit from more of that. I see a guy in the gym once and he said, don't stop exercising. He was old, he was like in his seventies. He goes, don't stop exercising, don't let your body find out these dying. I just keep going. Don't let your body find out. It's dying. That's great. Yeah, that's pretty cool. Isn't it? So, yeah. So, but like I think that in any form of, uh, I think that some variety of it. I know you do the yoga, you do the brazilian jujitsu, you do the running. I think it's very important of different forms of exercise, different forms of mental activity, different forms of stimulation to live like good because this is what this machine is designed to do.

Speaker 2:          01:17:57       And again, I returned to the problem of capitalism is that it reduces you to your role within an economic system as opposed to why not gap. Go for a run through a bit of fishing. Could wander around, shoot some arrows, do whatever it is you're into. I spend some time, meditate in, spend some time exercising, spent a time in loving physical combat. Well, the reason you can't, there's no fucking time because he's. Your job is to stand on the line or in that cheese grater. Great. It just get your soul ground down. Yeah, that's necessary anymore. It's not necessarily. It's certainly isn't necessarily enough to justify spending eight hours plus a day, five days a week inside some sort of a box. I know a while ago you said we are both a speck of dust and limitless consciousness and this I agree with to limitless expansion, limitless contraction, possible within consciousness and what you said, if that one idea can change the world very quickly and that's why they'd be systems regulate the kind of information that's available and the way that it's transmitted and also the fact that it exists within the same economic model.

Speaker 2:          01:18:59       You can, as long as you're making money, as long as the money's getting directed in the right way. People will let us talk about real radical stuff. They're quite comfortable for us to say, hey, you should break down the system. You should devolve at twilight, this conversation. Whereas with geico, p attachable, he's an australian gay rights activist who lives in the uk and he said, it's like when you're talking like this with no disrespect, disrespect for the great civil rights heroes in the people that have had civil rights struggles, but he said, and he's experienced as a gay rights activist. He goes, in the end they will yield when it's to do with those things, your race, sexuality. People sort of know you guys, but when you, you know, the system will use, they will you. All right? Gay marriage, of course. All right. Yeah. We, you know, we can't fucking have slavery in the end. And of course these monumental human struggles. I'm not diminishing them because. But if you go near people's financial interest, you are fucked either they'll get you there when you start saying, hey, why don't we not pay our mortgages? Hey everyone, let's not pay tax to stop using oil. Right? You fucking your out. Uh, I see it so straight away. So it's sort of like, this is what's interesting to me, like was like these are the, these are the access points, these are the points where

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       there is vulnerability. I'm not suggesting that we will organize ourself into a radical crew of tax avoiders or mortgage renegades or wherever, but even though

Speaker 3:          01:20:17       are both doing well, we're in, like you said before, we're not in that weird, you know, upper stratosphere where you're living on the hamptons and some fucking hundred acre ridiculous seaside mansion you where your helicopter and private jet everywhere and you're worth $100,000,000. And that's a weird world. That's a weird world that very few people exist in. Once they get there, they don't want to leave. Once you start flying private everywhere, you don't want to leave. Once you have a match and you don't want a department, once you have a bentley, you don't want to, you go, you know, it's like nobody wants to go down. You want to keep moving up.

Speaker 4:          01:20:57       Yeah. And it's weird because those things happened. They tend to happen in. So if they haven't been in, if you've got that money for entertainment, maybe you're still sort of, you've got some connection to your roots and your entertainment and not maybe you'll still connected to the source. But when it's in tech and finance, yeah, you've got a vested interest. My friend jason segel, the brilliant actor goes, um, you know, you guys, you think all that stuff's about you, the jets and the billboards and stuff. But it's just the symptoms of other people making money out of you. It's not that you have a tool in your parlor machine, you'll be processed to be kicked out. It's not a carousel, it's a train. It will run out of energy and as soon as you're not providing your route. and I was doing some promo for this book. I'm still trying to. Sally occasionally promote in this free willing conversation at facebook and I family, man, this place didn't exist 15 years ago. We've looking at now it is a monolift like these other kingdom lives. Now google started all these little ideas that will make phones. Fuck

Speaker 3:          01:21:56       the newest google pixel. Two phones. I mean, they make, they make these incredible devices that you can interface into the google world and they're optimized for their whole system.

Speaker 4:          01:22:04       Amazing, amazing. You know, david fosTer wallace, your great american author in his book, infinite jest, postulated a world where all stadiums were named after brands were countries and regions were named after brands, and it's sort of happening. It's happening. The flags of our nations are merely a veil over the true corporate interests. The british empire was always about east India trade and all that kind of crap and this country. Now it's just a veil over true power.

Speaker 3:          01:22:31       I'm going to the t mobile arena in las vegas this weekend for the ufc.

Speaker 4:          01:22:36       Oh yeah. The team over in the mobile arena, that's what it's called. Now you know, you're sort of at fIrst when they start to name football stadiums in our country, you still remembered the name of what it used to be before sponsorship, but we start to forget that it was ever anything else. You start to forget. We were once warriors. We were once connected to the earth. We are gods were ones, eagles and stags. Now our gods are the timo, pilar, rena, take back your freedom. Not the coliseum. It's the sony center, right? The christians are been flown to the lines at the same 3:00 PM.

Speaker 3:          01:23:09       Wow. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, they want people to use t mobile. I get it.

Speaker 4:          01:23:16       Would you mind to use it? We'll just ask me. Give me a deal. Oh, use it. I my liquid. You're saying keep talking unlimited data. It's nice. Yeah. One. Hey. So like, I learned an important lesson of you and this was it when I was a light came on last time you were doing sort of a very big a ufc event in I think vegas and my mates, like from the gym that I go to, genesis theme, I've already mentioned that they were coming over for a stack though they didn't ask me, but I sort of thought, oh listen, I could further inveigle myself into this little crew of martial artist by hooking them up with joe rogan tickets. And I thought, Yeah, I'll do that. Like every, the politician, so forth. So I text you a joe who hook up my mates with this thing and he went, oh, okay, who are these people is important to you?

Speaker 4:          01:24:04       And I took a moment, a form. They are important and like them, but was my motivations here. They're like, this is a good thing. I took a moment to reflect on it for shayla do this will come up with tickets, you know, maybe I'm doing this for the wrong reasons. I took a moment of rest are reflected. I didn't do it well it was a little less than. It was a little less than because you gave me pause for rest by. I think you were doing a standup show actually. And I was to and they were already had tickets for your standup. That's what it was. And I was like, how could you give them backstage passes? And your answer wasn't an immediate ben dover. Yes, of course I'll do what you want mr. Brand. It was a bit more questioning like, well who are these guys?

Speaker 3:          01:24:38       The reason why I ask, I always ask is because sometimes people say, look, you don't have to do this, but they've been bothering me about it. It's a guy I work with, or people have said, hey, would you do this? It's my best friend. I love this guy. And then I go, okay, yeah, ah, so you give people little junction because sometimes those people are paying now because somebody might be a pain in the ass to you and you might just be getting in line and I didn't know you as well, you know, so I'm like, well, and I really admired the way you handled it. Like I said, do you want to give my number? And that was the thing, and you went, no, I don't think I'll give him your number.

Speaker 4:          01:25:15       It seemed like I might be overcome me and made me look at my own motivations and I suppose that's it. Anything that is called the great Carl Young, the mystic, and one of the pioneers of psychoanalysis said anything that crosses your path that you didn't intend for, that is god in inverted commerce and opportunity to learn. So this is how I try to approach my life now. I was like, hmm, I didn't plan for that to happen. What's the lesson here? What can I learn from this situation? So like, you know, anyway, I'm sure damn guys would have been fantastic. I though they did later show me videos of what went on. I think it was just stack them and they were carrying on like idiots called up and down corridors drunk at their mind. So perhaps it was for the best, but generally I'm sure that nothing would have gone wrong.

Speaker 4:          01:25:52       But when I look at my own motivation, ah, what are you doing here? Why do you want to do this? You're doing it a little bit because you want to look cool. Don't bother doing that. Then you know, that's a little small in the way that I walked the path for a small amendment down a line. Maybe I will ask again. Yeah, actually joe, could you sort these guys out with tickets for this or that? But I'll do it with the right motivation, the right connection. Now, this again, as I keep saying this journey from unconsciousness to consciousness is what has been the myth of my own life. I think we have to. Whether or not we're in just limitless chaos in an ever expanding universe without meaning, without point, without love, you know, it may be. That is the way you know that a lot of people see the world that way.

Speaker 4:          01:26:32       It's not how I see the world. I see there as being meaning in everything, poetry and everything, beauty in everything, and certainly in my own life. I like to find the story. What am I meant to learn here? What am I meant to do here? What did I learn from being ahead in the story that I learned from being promiscuous, from being a drug addict and it all seemed to make a kind of sense. It all seems to be guiding me towards something and that thing does seem to be love, service, kindness, awareness. Not trying to manipulate people and not trying to get shit off people. Time is a good journey and I feel like it's sad if people don't get to do their own version of that journey because they're on the cheese grater or because they're pursuing some myths, some code from their childhood that they're not good enough or that they don't deserve to be happy or they can't achieve anything where whatever rung their call on, whether it's the wrong of booze or drugs or the wrong of staring at social media the whole time with the rung of hatred of others or the wrong of being caught in bad relationships and a crap job.

Speaker 4:          01:27:30       For me, I think that we can accelerate that evolution. I think that there are codes that can slip through and the same way that an amazon can spring up in 15 years and be this great economic monolift, new ideas, new faith's new ideologies can slip into the net. Particularly now we have this access to technology. You've slipped past the gatekeepers. you have your own media empire out of nothing. You know, and you've limited it because it's too you built around you as an individual in your perspective, et cetera. But these are, there are ways now of getting information out there that excites me. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:28:03       And They should, you know, and what we were talking about too, about being a hedonist and doing things wrong and fucking up. and what can you learn from them? I think every time you fuck something up and every time you do something badly you, there's a lesson that you get out of the weird feelings of failure, of discontent. And those lessons are extremely valuable. You know, a person who doesn't make mistakes and a person who doesn't do anything wrong, they never learned shit. You don't learn anything from doing everything perfectly. every time it doesn't happen. No one knew no one and the more bold and brash you are and the more you take chances and the more you put yourself into these weird positions. Even in these like, you know, I'm sure when you're, you were a sex addict and you're in this hedonistic whirlwind experience, you're still, you're taking in all this data and you're taking all this in, in the hollow feeling that you had that you didn't like. It is what propelled you to your new stage of once you

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       emerge from it. Yeah, that's right. Every so often because it's like pleasure laden an orgy. I mean that's the point of view. I mean this flesh everywhere. It's this bits of it. They're brilliant. I was no in, hold on a minute. This isn't working and this is a thing that I thought would really, really work, you know, like sometimes the, the great gift of promiscuity is you get to experience the intimacy with all of these strangers and it seemed exciting and the type of sexuality that I've always had is more about worship than any kind of domination I adore. I adore, you know, so it's not about like, I want to control you, so by like all these wonderful experiences and encounters, but within it, this kind of ongoing seem of loneliness and ignorable and also this is the thing, when you get the things your culture tells you you should be doing and you experience them now you know, now you know you can stop chasing the carrot because you've had a bite out of it.

Speaker 4:          01:29:53       And he's like, oh, mini bullshit, like you know, not an, it's a hard one to learn because anything that's got an orgasm at the end of it, you know, there's a degree of pleasure to be had, but it takes, it takes a while to recognize what this, the emotional cost or made a spiritual cost on other people. The fact that it's prevented me from becoming a father, from becoming a husband, from berlin, from becoming rooted from becoming actually whole, from becoming a man, from becoming connected. It takes a while to spot that. I think a lot of people don't get the opportunity to break out that pattern. I would never have spotted it. Had a not first being a heroin addict and got, hold on a minute. You're doing that thing again. Same with fame and celebrity. Well toxic, well toxic, exciting and brilliant and loads of lovely people in there.

Speaker 4:          01:30:33       And I still like, you know, I might make another film, I don't know what happened, but like it's because I'd had the template and the experiences of awe, this is addiction. You're expecting this thing to make you feel better. Now what's happened is I am as a baseline disabused of the idea that the material world will give me anything that it will ever fulfill me, that I am responsible for my own connection and that my role here is to serve other people and help them in if my objective in life is or what can I do to augment myself to make myself better. And I, you know, even self improvement. I agree with all of that. I agree with entirely. It's brilliant, brilliant thing and it's necessary I think, but like in order that I may be of service to others rather than. Because then I'll just look great in this arm chair ranking.

Speaker 4:          01:31:18       Self improvement is about being better at what fulfills you the most, which is almost always establishing community. So don't you think then joe, that we could do something that's a bit more explicitly that from the. You already have this huge community there around the joe rogan experience. Is there something in it bother you? Like couldn't there be something that wouldn't cost you that much? That might be sort of wonderful. Didn't do these things, not float into your world, and people go, you know, you're an influential figure. You're unusual. You have this strong male energy. Be very open to learning and very open to it and you're like, you know, I agree with you. A left wing categories right when categories, that shit's all got to go, but I think that there's a real opportunity for you to have a huge impact on communities. They're very neglected. Young males, for example, not knowing how to use their bodies, young males are that violence is becoming a problem for. there's not that many people that are in as powerful position as you to sort of the wrecks to them in a different way. Is that something that you know about? Is that something that's come into your orbit? Well,

Speaker 3:          01:32:23       you're doing it right now. I mean, you're doing it right now about communicating in a way that you're going to get to way more people than you're going to do it in a physical sense. You know, by spreading these ideas and communicating online in a podcast and allowing people to download it for free. Getting into your phone and your head and you know you're jogging and you're driving your car, you're getting ideas and the way more people's heads and you ever would by physically being there physically being there. It's very retro. It really is. I mean, you can only be there for so many people and what are you going to do? I mean, I could. I do comedy shows for a lot of people, but I mean physically being there and doing something and organizing some sort of thing. That's what you venture into some weird cult thing that's for the culture. Shit gets slippery. Everybody's covered in baby oil and you just fucking trying to grip nothing.

Speaker 4:          01:33:14       Right? We're in a jungle now. Massively side may be a right job. I think it's an interesting thing to observe. I do think that's right and it made a lot of people in england like the go. Yeah. Yeah. I heard you on joe rogan. I listen to joe rogan. People talk about it and it's interesting because it's different, like it's accessing information that people would not have always been. People come for the fight stuff or come for the entertainers, but then they're getting hit with graham hancock or some neurologist or wherever the behavioralist or wherever is a good thing. Well, I think

Speaker 3:          01:33:47       the wide variety of guests is very important too, for me personally because otherwise I'd get bored if I only talk to comedians are only talked to mma fighters or whatever, or even only cocked to scientist. I'd get bored. You know, I like, I like talking to a bunch of different people. You know what I mean? I didn't plan any of this. So the way that sort of an an folded is, is been pretty organic to use an overused.

Speaker 4:          01:34:13       tell me please just briefly, is there something about the phenomena of conor mcgregor that is unique? what is it that is happening? What has happened with him? What does he mean? What does he mean into ufc? What happens to him now that I'll post mayweather fight? What is he an example of sort of an outlier, a pioneer? How will he be regarded? What does he represent? Is he an entertainment product? Easy. A great athlete is a combination of all those things. What does he mean for the sport of ufc and what do you think will happen in mixed martial arts and boxing? Do you think we'll see more of those kinds of events? Well, you never going to see another one like him, right? Because he's a unique

Speaker 3:          01:34:53       person. He's. He's literally being himself. You're going see a bunch of people try to mimic that and in a sense he sort of mimicked the people that came before him, like the chill sonance and the muhammad ali's and the people that were really good at talking shit. The difference is that what connor's been able to do, he's the first guy in the ufc that's been able to do that, that's had spectacular results and also showed his real character in losing and then coming back and winning very quickly afterwards at the same guy like the nate diaz fight. I think that was a very important character exposing fight because he lost a fight. He got humbled and then he jumped right back on the horse and then wound up winning and then he comes back and blows eddie alvarez out of the water to become the first two division concurrent champion in the sport.

Speaker 3:          01:35:43       I think he's a unique guy in a very. It's almost like we don't have a word strong enough. Unique is not really a strong enough word. So he is founded on a belief in a very basic way. He's got brilliant, brilliant ability, massive. He's incredibly smart and a very. He's very innovative in his techniques and his approaches. And um, I think he has phenomenal coaching as well. And animal movements. The fuck is that walk well, he's just getting that thing that he does. He throws his name doesn't mean anything loose. He's doing. He cocking okay. When I come out and stay sometimes it says just an amazing thing to do with the body heat cooking. You say cocky. I was like, oh my god, these guys fucking out and look what he's doing. He's letting the other guy know that he so loose. You can kind of struck with his arms like rubber bands flying around, but I mean he's a combination of a lot of things.

Speaker 3:          01:36:41       He has a brilliant team. John kavanagh is coach is a brilliant coach. She's got, you know, amazing jujitsu, coaching and striking coaching in his mind. He just, he understands how to apply these things and his ability to perform under pressure. This is fantastic. You saw that in the mayweather fight. I mean even though he lost that fight, he hit me with some pretty good shots and he won the first three rounds against the greatest boxer of all time. So then the extraordinary, extraordinary. I mean you can say easily that made whether it was taking those rounds off and I agree he was, and you could say that may, whether it was bringing them to deep water because he knew it would exhaust him because he didn't give him enough time to train for it because you really only gave them two months. It was very brilliant.

Speaker 3:          01:37:20       I made with his part. He knew that he wouldn't be efficient. He would tire. Although as a kinetic, big explosive movements at conor likes to do their very taxing and he knew that he was not going to have the efficiency to go 12 hard rounds with a master defensive fighter like mayweather and made whether it was right, but he didn't want to get hit with that upper cut that he got cracked within the first round. He didn't want to to to like connor's movement was very unusual. It took floyd a while to decipher. It has been way better for him if he just blew connor out of the water from one round on and just completely outclassed him. But he didn't. And one of the reasons why I didn't is because connor's an extraordinary person and he has greatness. Greatness. I mean he didn't really have the proper opportunity in only being able to prepare for two months and only having this one professional boxing match.

Speaker 3:          01:38:08       There was a lot of things stacked against him and yet I feel, although he clearly lost, he performed admirably. I don't think it hurts his stock in any way. I think it elevates them and I think his next fight in the ufc, a whoever it would will be will be probably the biggest fight in ufc history if they can do it correctly, depending upon who it is, especially if it's nate diaz. Nate diaz is a huge name and if nate diaz and him decided to do it one more time, I think that would be the biggest fight ever in the historY of the sport because I think connor has eclipsed the sport largely, you know, and, and maybe for now maybe someone else will come along in the next year or two that, that does it. I mean look has only been around for a few years. I tweeted to him in 2013 or 14, I forget what it was when he had won a big fight in the uk and I said, congratulations on an amazing performance.

Speaker 3:          01:38:59       I really hope to see in the ufc someday. That was like four years ago. Oh my god. The most. So in four years he's gone from being this unknown fighter that only like the really hardcore fanatics, like myself knew about to him being this worldwide phenomena. He's the biggest combat sport athlete, not just of today, ever. There's no one like him. No one like him, no one that has the kind of popularity that he has. I mean, this fucking guy has thousands and thousands of people fly from Ireland to vegas. Every time he fights the weigh ins. It seems like you're in dublin. I mean, it's fucking crazy, man. When you look out, when I, when I interview him at the weigh ins in the ufc in vegas, you look out, you see nothing but irish flags. You see people screaming and cheering and singing. Mandalay bay during the floyd mayweather fight, which is not even the venue where the fight was being held. Mandalay bay was packed. Bumper to bumper with irishman walking down the hallway, cheering and singing songs in sync. It was insane. Brilliant. There's no one like him.

Speaker 4:          01:40:06       Is that. First of all, you have to have the greatness. Like we've had the greatest. Who gives a fuck? He's just another person because like I said about van gough, you know, like, you know, it gives a fuck if you cut your ear off, if you paint paintings, have god be good, game is good, but then like the law, there are often great geniuses in sport, but to have that, like you say, this fall that he used like that romantic ideas of Ireland and he's an irish ness, that became an important part of his perception, but it's obviously resonating in a very, very powerful way to have that kind of devotion or Ireland. Ireland's

Speaker 3:          01:40:40       very important. Ireland's a very important part of the equation as well because their appreciation and love and support of him. It's unprecedented. I mean, I've seen brazilian fans that love josie aldo and I've seen brazilian fans that love anderson silva and you know, the worshiped by their countrymen, but it pales in comparison to the amount of love that conor mcgregor gatz.

Speaker 4:          01:41:05       I understand. Then then myth aligns with his myth, the myth of the irish people as being oppressed by british colonialism and having to fight for their freedom. It resonates with what this man represents and perhaps this is always what happens with figures of greatness, whether it's within the realm of sport or within the realm of politics, temporarily a person sort of captures a particular mood, a particular energy, and this is what I think again, is to do with unconsciousness. I don't think people are go like a con, like are aware of these kinds of feelings. I think it's stimulated on a level that's not about for. This is one of the things I'm very interested in what lies beyond the rational. You know, what lexia, we can equate, we can work out, we can just. But there seems to be some ingredient even in conor mcgregor that you can't quite pin down.

Speaker 4:          01:41:49       Yes, there's the greatness as a boxer. Yes. The irish people, you know, but there's also some flavor is being caught and I wonder if you can ever preempt or understand these things. I wOnder if you can ever drill down, but like the sort of the work of Joseph Campbell, the work of Carl Young, the worker bees people to say, oh, they are unconscious archetypes. There are unconscious themes, there were stories that are running below the surface, patterns, coordInates that can be connected to. Some people will not believe the profession of in know how to harness these energies. If you have enough people feeling not good enough, they will spend money trying to feel better, whether it's the purchase of a car or a coffee or whatever it is. One of the key ingredient is make people feel not good enough. If you can rehab and redirect people's sexual eNergy so that their sexual energy is directed at products and consumerism, then you will sell Your product.

Speaker 4:          01:42:40       But for me it seems like such a shame to waste this force, to waste this knowledge, to waste his energy just to turn people into consumers just to turn everything on this planet into a commodity when what we could be doing is using these energy to imagine new worlds, to imagine new systems, to use our greatness, to use our greatness to. I don't know, Joe Love one another to create new tribes. I mean, I don't know if he. You. Boy, you tied a lot of things together. There was. It was pretty, pretty good rent that coffee's really kicked in and actually that's no joke. That's serious. I think I could do another one. I think I won't fucking handling 250 milligrams. I'll mainland this shit. I'll pour mii you want another one? I do like it. You do have a terrible drug problem. It is a drug.

Speaker 3:          01:43:27       I mean, what were you saying about connor's? I think undeniable. He's a hero and he dares to be great. I mean he dares to be great in a way that very few people do and he stands in front of the opponent and looks at the entire crowd and goes and goes like that and puts his hands up like that. I mean literally is like some archetypical fixture figure from the past. I mean beautiful. I mean what he's also doing by doing that, he's like, he's letting the opponent realize like you're in there with greatness. You're in there with someone who's incredibly comfortable in the moment and someone who truly believes that he's great and the results that he's had, like you can't deny that they have a factor in, in his future success and in the way people love them, the way knocked out. Although with one punch to win the title, I mean this giant buildup over this long period of time and then he just fucking starches them with one shot, 13 seconds of the fight and the deafening roar. The irish in that arena, when that happened was it was fucking insane. He's like a hero, like a mythical creature.

Speaker 2:          01:44:26       I suppose the role of the hero is to embody and represent some inspire to inspire, inspire the crowd to put me right.

Speaker 3:          01:44:35       Those people, those 15,000 plus people that saw that fight, who knows how much energy that gave them to then go forth and pursue their own dreams because that's a big part of what heroes represent. What a what a big part of someone who's accomplishing anything spectacular. It's not just that people get to watch it and get this thrill of watching this experience, but also that you get energized to go and pursue your own ideas. Yes,

Speaker 2:          01:45:01       yes. This is true. I agree. But, uh, I think an integral component of the mythic figure of the hero is sacrificing fucking credit. I'm in the bloody world judge conor mcgregor and any stage from any angle because people that are brave enough to do that, it's fucking unbelievable. But like the, what I've felt it while it resonates, we've asked when somebody is willing to sacrifice themselves is because it temporarily makes us recognize when someone's willing to die for what they believe in. Whether that is, you know, these civil rights leaders and miserable for malcolm x knew he was going to die for doing that. And he did it anyway. Gandy had a good sense that he was going to die. He did it anyway because what he believed in was more important than what he was as an individual. And I think that when that happens, it reminds us, oh, there's something like you say, inspire.

Speaker 2:          01:45:49       It puts breath into us. It reminds us we have the capacity for greatness and we are not just contained by our body. We all these streams of energy in that moment, perhaps there is no disconnection between conor mcgregor in that crowd. There is a oneness of purpose in that single punch punching for all of them in that moment. The only thing that saddens me is that is ultimately not ultimately, but at least seemingly housed by an economic idea. That's the old thing that prisons are the sort of contains it. Do you know what I mean? You got to pay money to go there. Ultimately, it's a commodified thing. Conor mcgregor is a commodity that all that makes people aware of the stakes that are at hand, that makes people aware of the magnitude of the event. If you can get pack 22,000 people into an arena like that, it makes people aware of the magnitude of it all.

Speaker 2:          01:46:34       If it just happens on a soccer field, no one's watching. It's not the same. No, you're quite right. I'm not criticizing the crowd because they're or because the crowd is important and that's what it's doing. It's representing something bigger, but I feel like it's a shame and I feel I say when you take it like we've taken into the arts because there's more sensitivity, it's more cerebral and it's less embodied, so ca qubein. He's like someone like, you know, like someone in the matrix waking up in their pod. He woke up in the pot of fuck, you know, he knew he was a genius. He knew that he was connecting with people. He knew it was representing something and we also use mentally ill and a drug addict and he killed himself and it. But I think that there is a sort of a comparison there that he knew that he was becoming commodified.

Speaker 2:          01:47:17       He was being reduced to a commodity. He woke up in the pod and for our fuck, all of these things that are coming from my heart, this truth, I isolation, alienation, the kinds of things that he was singing about, that in itself became a product. The machine can handle it. The machine can take people talking about that connecting to people's deepest fears of India that inadequacy and worthlessness and it can turn that into a product and sell it to them. I think you're getting caught up in money as always being a negative anD I think connor is actually eMbrace The money as a part of the narrative and I think you know another person who's done that without bragging about that as manny pacquiao, manny pacquiao was made hundreds of millions of dollars in the same form, has actually used that to spread well throughout the Philippines and hands out money to people and he's famously.

Speaker 2:          01:48:05       I'm generous in that regard and I think with connor's done is it's part of his hero mythologies and he's sitting on a. He's sitting on a throne on a pile of gold. It's really a part of it all. He's a king. He is a hero. Now the heart of the story, I'm not criticizing him as an individual and saying, conor mcgregor the money. Yes, but I'm criticizing the seed. Money is a part of the story. It's not necessarily negative and I don't think it is negative at all, but joe money is literally a symbol. It is nothing but that represent something. I promised to pay the bearer. we believe this is one up in semantics because he could definitely go out and buy a house with that. Money is real as fuck. Like he can go out and buy mansions and cars. It's real as fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:48:48       The idea that it represents like, I promise to give you this. Yes, it's a promissory note, but it's fucking real. You know, he has all that. He has 100 million dollars. It is a part of the store. He is sitting on a throne on a pile of gold. He does have a crown, is a crown on his fucking neck. I mean it's real. I'm not like, like I don't see conor mcgregor is the terminus of this point. I see. I see. This is an opportunity to critique what the culture is telling us and what the culture is doing to us. They're, you know, I understand that, you know, with money you can acquire goods and services, but what I'm saying is, is that our system for evaluate in worth has become about commodities instead of perhaps about beauty or about love. Not like, you know, I'm not saying that conor mcgregor should give away all this money and start marchIng around a be the new jesus of Ireland. Then that will be fucking fascinating to watch unfold. I'm saying that isn't

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       it discussed question, is it not a little unfortunate, but greatness is ultimately given to us as a product that that is how it is received. That's how it's understood. Is it possible that there will be other ways of demonstrating greatness as he does? you know when he's fighting? Yes, kurt cobain did when he was playing, but ultimately the dominant thing, that dominant puppet here, the thing pulling the strings is the dollar. I don't tHink it is.

Speaker 3:          01:50:15       I think it's a part of the story. Much like you know, your clothes are a part of, you know, what you look like. I don't think it's the dominant thing. I think it's a big part of how you sell it, like this is going to be the biggest fight ever. He's going to make x million dollars and the way condamine, but connor uses that as a part of his narrative. He drives around in a drop top bentley and he's, you know, he's got beautiful watches and suits and say fuck you, and pin striping. I mean it's part of what he's done by. By creating this incredible mythology mean. I don't think it's necessarily in any way, shape or form negative. I think it's a part of the story.

Speaker 4:          01:50:53       Say with hip hop, right? This is possibly a similar way of looking at the same idea and this isn't saying I know the answer to. Do you know what I mean? Sure. I'm not. The kind of work is being out and I want to teach you there. I'm not going. I'm trying to fucking work out myself. Say with hip hop, hip hop first. When it comes out, it comes out as this angry raw.

Speaker 3:          01:51:10       No, not really pay. Originally it came out as like a happy ron, a hip hop hibbett to the hippity hip hop activity beat. Don't stop this bit with

Speaker 4:          01:51:18       for combat or at the beginning and then like it becomes a social whole. Yeah, sure. Heal and bambara and yesterday early hip hop pioneers and then we go through this sort of that phase of. Yeah, you're right. It goes through the early part of it. Jolly

Speaker 3:          01:51:31       alliance to rap, gangster rap, like anger of we are going to have a voice straight outta compton.

Speaker 4:          01:51:40       Amazing. And then that in itself becomes about like what is the subsequent mutations of hip hop as it becomes sort of claimed by a dominant system. It becomes about jewelry, bling, particular attitudes and lou, do you not see what I'm saying that there's sort of almost like a trend. Things get pulled into a certain strand, a certain way of being. It

Speaker 3:          01:52:02       does, but it doesn't have to look. It didn't with some guys like the really like here's a perfect example, one of the best rappers ever, nas, nas never fell into that. Nas remains one of the best lyricists of all time remains brilliant. All of his rap has meaning. It's creative, it's interesting. He doesn't fall into all the bullshit and the bling, although he has plenty of money and he has all the trappings. He's got this sort of style about him where I believe his father was a jazz musician and he grew up with, you know, with art in his family and he's an artist first and foremost, and although he's a brilliant rapper, he's my favorite rapper. I think that he's never really fallen into all the bullshit blang,

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       mansions, all that stuff. Like the display of it all. I mean he has these things but it's not the primary display when you're talking about nas, like as an artist, as a musician and because again, like I suppose what I'm interested in is how like sort of cultural movements start off. It seems by saying something that's important and powerful, whether it's punk or hip hop like becomes a voice to the disembodied or a way of conveying a embodied disenfranchised comes a voice for them. Or like in a similar thing with punk punk. Very observable because it was relatively short term movement. The bands like the pistols and the clash and all these stuff, these bands come out of england and it quickly became sort of commodified and sold back to people. What I'm saying is is like that, and this could be resolved, this. I'm now during the second candidate caveman coffee in his skin deep.

Speaker 2:          01:53:35       the pimps in my mind. This is too much for one man. I think it's 5:40 for the two kiDs as well. Do the dMT now. I'm almost there. So like um, what I'm saying is, is that things start with this original germ greatness, a glory heroism, but there's anger and there's an external system though joe, that can turn into a product and sell it to people. And I think that that does strip it of its, of its real value and you all saying, I suppose no, it doesn't matter. It doesn't have. That can just be the architecture of it or the, the aspects of it. And I'm just saying as long as we have a system that is ultimately about making money and turning everything into profit. And that's what I'm not saying this about any of the individualized. In fact that's the point I'm making.

Speaker 2:          01:54:20       He is great now as this great, great, great, great, great, great. But ultimately you great me great. We're like, please god like a pool. But everyone's pulled in the direction of prophets of like is a thing you've got to swIm for. Like now as we become free, is there something different that could be done here? Can something truly glorious? Be down here. Like when you describe that moment of vegas temporarily being overwhelmed noise. It has been in recent days by tragedy, death and blood, but it a glorious spirit of Ireland and a hero that isn't the unfortunate that that energy can't be literally used to create better worlds, better systems, better lives or that really happens is a load of people make bunch of money and probably. And I don't necessarily mean the fucking protagonists, you know what I mean? Like people talk a lot about our athletes and too much money I don't agree with.

Speaker 2:          01:55:12       That's one of the few ways that fucking ordinary working class people can make a lot of money. But there are people at the top of that chain is siphoning significant amount of money. I've all of those little industries, you know, so. But that's my question. Responsible for making it happen in the first place. I mean you can't leave It up to the athletes to put something like that together. You need a dana, why you need a floyd mayweather and money. The money team productions. You need people to promote it. You need people to put together a press junket and a world tour and then you need people to organize the paper view and then ben. Then the real ultimate result is the

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       inspiration that all the people that watch it get the inspiration, the entertainment, and it's completely up to the individual whether or not they pursue greatness or whether they just pursue money and it's a trap if there's trappings in both ways is the trappings of greatness with no money. There's the sadness of someone who dies great, but penniless and homeless. and then there's the guy who just threw it all away from money and that never ever realized its full potential. Which is equally sad. But I think the in that is that we are showing a particular aspect of our own conditioning there in believing in the myth of the individual, but the Individual will always try and if you have greatness, you know. But like now you did say like the great person that dies penniless know it's a kind of a shame that we don't create benevolent systems that are helpful to the vulnerable.

Speaker 3:          01:56:34       Wherever you're talking about sport, right? If you're talking about is completely. I mean, look, there has to be some sort of a support team behind the individual, but it's deplete completely dependent upon the individual. If you don't have john cavanagh, you don't have a straight blast gym, you don't have ido portal and then dylan dannis and all the different people that train connor. You don't have connor. But if you have all those things, it's entirely dependent upon the one individual that takes that knowledge and goes in there and performs. That's what's so scary about It and that's what's so rewarding to people that watch it because they know it's so dangerous. It's so crazy. It's so fraught with peril to be the one that's so much lies upon the the one that the weight on his shoulders is massive and that's one of the most substantial things and the most impressive things about connor is the way it handles the weight of the pressure that it goes in there and does this in in the giant big moment that he stands there in front of everybody and throws his arms out like he's the king and then everybody goes fucking crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:57:36       That he's glorious. Yes. It's nothing to do with money. It seems like it does, but money is a part of it all its greatness. Greatness is the thing. The money is a side effect of greatness. That shit when he does that, I don't mean come on man. Beautiful case that because I don't ever want conor mcgregor to listen to this and things like brian's criticized. We didn't make like fucking shoulders on that son of a bitch. Especially that left. No wonder why knocked people dead easy. It's hard to tell from the angle, but big fucks people up at that left hand. Boy, this is not a critique of any individual. This is my. I'm trying to understand how systems work and that's why I'm trying to understand and I'm suggesting that they're all favorite ways of doing things. Even they let me say this, this system doesn't mean jack shit.

Speaker 3:          01:58:28       If someone can't rise, this guy is dIfferent. Okay? It's the system exists all day long, 24 slash seven, three 65. The systems going on this weekend in vegas, there's going to be to world title fights. It's not nearly the amount of attention being paid to these two world title fights this weekend is conor mcgregor pulling his dick out and taking a piss in a punch bowl. He could do that on paper view and more people would watch it. Why? Because he's done so much In the past as an individual. The greatness that he is shown, it's. It's more than just money. It's more than just the system. The system exists. It's a matter of one person figuring out the frequency that this system operates on and showing this unbelievable performance inside that system and that's the individual and that individual is. When you talk about his past, when he, you know, he was, he was working as a construction worker or as a plumber or some shit and you know, he'd done some amateur boxing and some mma fights.

Speaker 3:          01:59:25       He was a regular guy. He grew up in a working class neighborhood. He wasn't rich. He wasn't. There's nothing substantial about him. He even his own parents say they never thought that he was going to be this guy. He figured out a way through it. He wasn't born the king. He wasn't some, some person who, you know what, for whatever reason was gifted with this existence, you know, he worked his way through it, figured it out, and once he got to the greatest stage in the world when the pressure was at its highest, he shown like the brightest star in the universe. And that's What's so exciting about him.

Speaker 2:          01:59:56       Yes, I think he's beautiful and fascinating, but my question is about commodification. Money freak. You're free. You're not free to amend that, hold them, but when you say you take a look at the empty right or take a lot, I've taken a few taking it 99 times. When you have them experiences, what does it, when you come back from it, what is it that you feel about the way that systems are organized? Do you know? Do you come back from it quite fatalistic? Like, oh yeah, that's just the way the world is. Do you Think? Hold on a minute. It's fucking mental. There's so much stuff going on. Things could be different, but I don't think about the way that you think about. I don't think about these systems. I think you spent a lot of time thinking about the elites in the one percent and the systems.

Speaker 2:          02:00:40       Um, I don't, I don't think about that stuff very much. nor do I think mostly about why I'm interested in is god and oneness. And I think that greatness is a representation of god. I think that is coming through conor mcgregor or kurt cobain or jimi hendrix or Dorothy Parker is some kind of the beauty that that person is the perfect vessel for iconography is the realization of greatness or the realization of god in inverted commerce. Given them this is the singing, the stO playing the star spangled banner at woodstock. unbelievable. Here is some, some moment that pulls us all together. Now what my curiosity is about the empty is that does dmt make you experience that oneness or that loss of self in a way that's kind of religious or spiritual? What does it do to your tense loss of self? I mean as intense as any thing, but it's. It's

Speaker 3:          02:01:33       not even. I shouldn't say as there's no comparison. I shouldn't say as intense as anything because there's not a word

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       that I could say that's going to come out of my mouth. It's going to do it justice. The words haven't been invented. They don't exist because it does all words that we have created. They represent things that we can reference in the material world. When you. When you have a dmt experience, you're literally having a conversation with god. You're experiencing something that's everything and something that's infinitely powerful infinitely wise. The way I've described it, as you're seeing this insane, infinite world of complex geometric patterns that are made out of love and understanding, right? Right. But there's things in there that might have these entities. He feels something in there that knows you and I don't know if it's you that knows you. It's like you that gets your bullshit separations. Dissolve is my, is my. My suspicion is that there is no separate. There is no subject object.

Speaker 2:          02:02:31       There is only oneness. Now you yourself just said, it's about starts to feel like it's about loving and one show. So that level of consciousness exists. So my belief is that our systems we have, our athletic systems are in attainment systems and certainly our economic, political and social systems should be as close to as possible to that feeling, but that feeling should be our guiding light. So I'm not criticizing conor mcgregor, the great genius who like I'm fascinated by and door all kumbaya know anyone. I'm just saying, isn't it odd that you have personally experienced in your way through dmt and I have free yoga and meditation and she, I'm, when I was a kid, they sense of oneness, this love that seems to transcend my personal form and everything I believe in and yet when it comes to our systems for organizing this plane that we live on, the material plane, the choices we make are not about that love and understanding there about the kind of a, about resources and elitism, you know, so he's interested in the one percent and all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:03:31       I'm a bit interested, but what more interested in is why are our systems not more representative of the divine puba truth that we can access through spirituality? Well, I think our systems are based on the monkey need for survival and this sort of. That's not good is it? We should get beyond that. Well, I think we will, but I think it takes a long fuCking time. Just like we were talking about before. I mean, unless you want to get the world to do dmt tomorrow. I mean, if we had a dmt day, boy, that would change a lot of shit. I'm very interested in that. I think that's the role of the role of the shame and the role of the artist I think is the role of the comic and even the role of the shaman. I mean that's important point that gets. That gets distorted.

Speaker 2:          02:04:10       There's a lot of people that go down to south America because they have this romantic vision of what a shaman is going to do to them and that they're going to go and experience and then they. They encounter some shyster who really just learned how to make iowasca to prey on gringos. I mean that's. That's a big, big part of the narrative that a lot of people experience when they go down and do that with the wrong people or. Yeah, I'm not happens mainly thing because of systems of commodification. Materialism and profiteering does, but it also.

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       It happens because people are just like looking at an opportunity there. They're opportunistic. They're. They're desperate. Maybe they had been mistreated, maybe they, they don't. They don't have a particularly healthy view of human beings.

Speaker 2:          02:04:51       Well, I recognize this. I'm standing for men in my mind just over the course of this conversation. It's like, like you said earlier, there's the potential for good and the potential for bad in all of us. Sure. But I see our culture as a magnet and the magnet is pulling out the worst stuff and what I think is it would be possible to have a magnet that was pulling out the best stuff, but it has some

Speaker 3:          02:05:12       the best of to like what happened in houston. Okay. They have this giant hurricane that comes down in houston and I have put my friend John Dudley went down down there and brought supplies and was feeding people and organized a bunch of other people to help and do the same thing and there was a ton of people that were doing the same ton of people that were donating their time and their money and they were using their boats to help get people out of their homes. And there's a video that I saw. There was an amazing video. These two guys talking after they didn't even know each other and they were, they were, they were being interviewed and they were saying that the love that they experienced helping all these people pull, pulling them out of the wreckage of this horrible natural disaster that was. It was like nothing they'd ever felt that this love was amazing, that all these people were being completely altruistic.

Speaker 3:          02:05:53       They being completely generous and just helping and just the I think in times of crisis. Are you familiar with sebastian younger? No. Sebastian younger is an amazing war journalist and he wrote a great book Called tribe and his. His book is essentially all about how human beings really only feel at their best and they're happiest when they are coming together to overcome something and so that in this, in this moment of overcoming this incredible natural disaster that you blame it on industrial capitalism and global warming, blame all that on the fucking the hurricane. At the end of the day, it's a force of nature that no one saw coming. No one can. There's no one that pulled that trigger. Right? There's a guy in vegas that pulled that trigger, but there's no one that pulled the trigger on that hurricane. It was collective. It was, it was. It was a thing of nature.

Speaker 2:          02:06:46       I don't do that together. That is beautiful. What a coffee. Agree that anything we're human beings come together like that is glorious. But both of those examples that you're using as you yourself alluded to, you know, you can look at what conditions create hurricane maybe, possibly. Yeah. No. Yeah. We don't know. They could have that hurricane. Has hurricanes have happened forever, but that's my point. That's only 50 percent. The other 50 percent of my point is that that guy pulling the trigger isn't just an individual. He is, like you said when I was touching you on the fucking shaming thing, they all, maybe that shaman had a bad day and that's why it's become a slippery shaman. Well, no, that's a great band. Slippery shaman like so, like, so this guy, the shoot, like of course we all have individual culpability, but similarly he is a product of our culture is a product of this again, system. So like, you know, there is one form of analysis

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       that says a meteorological disasters. They're detached from reality and of course meteorology is its own fucking thing and individual freewill near. There are some newer, I'm sure you know, say that doesn't even fucking exists for out in nature out in a meteorology. The biochemistry of our system is governing everything. But certainly there are connections between each of us that create the way that we behave. You know, if like if, if I haven't experienced in here where I walk out feeling intimidated, maybe I'll be less kind to the people I work with, a less extreme example of a brutal murders and the more obvious example aware of it,

Speaker 3:          02:08:14       we're aware of it, which is one of the reasons why altruistic behavior kind behavior, loving community, these, all these things are rewarded because we do understand that those do enforce a better way of people behaving. And that real determinism. Like people like if you, if you really truly don't have freewill, well we know that we would like people to behave kinder because whatever factors that play into people going out and behaving in a nicer, kinder way, there are part of that that we know that that's the fuel of that

Speaker 4:          02:08:46       so isn't then the role of us as individuals finding our own conor mcgregor, our own greatness, out own heroism to create as much as possible a spice for the altruism, a spice for that philanthropy, a space for that togetherness to create those moments, like you said, without hurricane web and we've all experienced there. I know when I do something nice for other people, I start to feel, oh, this is what I'm meant to be. This is what I'm meant to be doing. But I in my own personal life gets sidetracked by our fuck. I've got these economic imperatives on want to fucking feel great about myself because of other people's applause or you know, verification like it like because we are all flawed because we are continually going to battle between the monkey in us. The primary little creature in us. And the great angel within us, what if we have an agreement on a social level that what we're aiming towards is the most benevolent, the most beautiful, and on an individual level we try and do it, and communally we encourage each other towards it knowing that we're going to fuck up and fail all the time, but that we're heading in that direction together instead of what we have, which is a system that is about make as much money as you can and get out.

Speaker 4:          02:09:50       You only have 100 years line up the blow jobs. That is the system that we have that is capitalist consumers and that's what it's based on. This is a machine. The machine makes money. It's got to have infinite expanse and infinite growth. That is, that is the system. I'm not saying that it's very fatalistic way. It look fantastic. I think we can change the world

Speaker 3:          02:10:09       doing it. And you're not. You're not living that way. So the system that you're talking about, it's escapable you've escaped. Yes. And we. We're talking about it and it's just no, there's no like willy wonka golden ticket that's going to get you out of the system.

Speaker 4:          02:10:21       I don't trust him. Shady fucking on polymers. Where do you get them? I doN't think I should even be working there. Too much chocolate loss in that truck though. That poor boy drowning. And there was johnny depp behaving like a young girl.

Speaker 2:          02:10:36       I've been lucky. A fucking movie man. He's a weird way of talking. A lot of questions. I think it was about Michael Jackson, chocolate chocolates, the peter pan type deal that clean. I don't want to grow up you. I think you need to go back to it. There is. It's chocolate factory. Johnny. Look at my. And I think, uh, this fatalistic thing that it's just designed to. It's. I don't think it's designed to do anything. I just think it is, it just, it is an agree with that. I even agree with that. I think. I think that what we live in is the manifestation of our most primal desires. Greed or not even necessarily great survival. And I think that if you extrapolate on that system, you end up with what we've got, but I think an alternative way of being something that might be a corrective path for us is to look at those.

Speaker 2:          02:11:28       This feelings that you described of the altruism in that hurricane, the feeling of greatness in an individual and the way that an individual can pull communities together is sort of like a. It's not a binary choice. I know the world's more complicated than that joe. But like I suppose my quest and indeed fuck me, my book is about how I individually have got my head and I wrenched myself away from selfishness and greed and pride on a daily basis and pull myself towards our tourism and love and self betterment apart of it. Keep myself fit mentally, spiritually. So I can be a better part of this. Excuse me, system and perhaps through myself, improvement create better systems because there is all this energy. There's all this power. And I think it's a shame that it gets siphoned in a particular direction. Well that, that feeling you express and as you express it and express it, honestly, that resonates with people and I think this, what we're talking about is the 49 point nine percent and 50 point one percent that rick strassman was describing.

Speaker 2:          02:12:25       It was this constant battle and it is not an easy path. I don't think the system operates it. The 50, 49, therefore I think the system's way way towards the negative system like a cultural system and the economic system, human beings in this world is a capitalist country or where they say I don't know enough about what goes down in China. So I'll say like sort of global capitalism. Say and again I'm not a fucking economist. I'm just picking up shit from listening to your podcast and have a podcast, you know? I mean that's where I'm getting educated. I've luckily turned up at university of lately. I'm tripping on that fucking coffee, man. Man. Deep. Can I go to the toilet and maybe the poor hell have I been in here? Do you feel like I've done enough about my book? We've done two hours and 20 minutes. We could wrap this fucking got a clock there. You've got these advantages. There's buddhas in every direction and only one clock I didn't know at the time is a clock there. There's a clock there. There's. They're all facing you. Facing anybody who was a guest to think about time. This is a tune one. This system. Yeah. I'm just some johnny come lately. Kid from england with a dream weaver a I'll come

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       over here to the layer, a dream to sell books. I'm just a kid. He wants to fuck the system, but by my book out of that, obviously polk. Chrissy, how dAre you point out. That obviously puts it. Cannot do a wait. No. Yeah, yeah. You're bad. You're good. Typically we're open that door and the first one. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:13:52       Nah man. It's beautiful. Don't worry about it. No, no, no. You're good man. Don't worry. You're good. Told you that caveman coffee.

Speaker 5:          02:13:59       Who's going to get them? You were gonna. Pull something up about nas. I think I had something I didn't know if you knew he was a venture capitalist. Um, I mean like I know you opens up a restaurant up that sweet chick place potentially if there's companies sell soon, I don't know how that happens. Or if it comes public, he could be what they're saying is hip hop's first true billionaire. Yeah, no worries. Says it's only like if that slipper network, there's like $17 million. That doesn't include all the companies he owns and has been investing in for a long time. No, I didn't know about that. I knew

Speaker 3:          02:14:36       about his restaurant because I'm friends with everlast and everlast goes to that sweet chick. I think everlast was a piece of that too. I don't know, maybe he doesn't, but he took me to it in New York and took me to an la once we went there. But if they were playing music that was so loud, it was literally hurting my ears. Nas is like half man, half venture capitalists look at that beautiful suit. He's gone on. He's got a pocket square and like a little small chain. Have you ever seen the small chain?

Speaker 5:          02:15:02       I don't know now with the. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          02:15:05       Interesting. Yeah, there's a lot of those motherfuckers make a shit ton of money. Smart. Why not? You know, I mean it shows you that they could figure out a way through just their art to get to this weird position where I mean if not really does make a Billion dollars. Like fuck still makes amazing music though. That's my point. My point is that his music never went commercial smoothies. It's fucking fantastic.

Speaker 5:          02:15:31       Someone was saying I was reading some stuff that he supposedly tried. Remember he had a rap battle up beef had a couple of beats jz with like puff daddy the hate me now thing. Oh that he like, he also wrote, ghost wrote for wilson myth. I don't know what that really means. He's sold out, but that's not selling out. That's just writing for a friend. But the rap battles I think is more just an ego thing. Someone talk shit about him. He talks shit about them. Yeah, you know, you all right brother. You got a copy of your book. You're not fucking around. You brought a copy back. Now if you want to show everybody here, give it to me. I'll hold it up so you don't feel bad. Vanna white. I like joe rogan. I'm wanting to experience freedom from our addictions, russell brand. Ladies and gentlemen, let's wrap this thing up man. We've talked for two hours and 20 minutes. That's good. Beautiful. You kicked it, kicked it into the fucking orbit. I didn't change the bit that I wrote about you as a matter of fact because I didn't know you wrote about me in there. Yeah, yeah. Now you fucking interested. Oh man. I'm feeling

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       good. It was slightly because what it was I realized I asked them to put in the word seemingly because I thought that I'd been to reductive and you know me like I'm having this experience like is part of the book is about trying to explain how in the addict's mind you're trapped in this constant cycle, own self obsessive for an outside world seems so massIve distance and you can't connect to it. Right? So as well as explain Now to go through the steps. I talk through like this is what it's like to be in mY fucking head. So I'm like, this is me out with my dog, I'm a dog, causes all these problems all the time, and I run into these people and say, all I know, I've run into them and I start, I don't want to go and talk to them because I feel so self conscious because I've looked kind of like cool.

Speaker 2:          02:17:13       And I think, oh no, I've got these people. I'm going to feel inadequate. All I know is how I feel and that's all I'll ever know unless I learn. I can learn a new system for being bill. This guy comes over and says hello while I stand now on the goose. Shit, we're on this sort of riverbank. Vaguely embarrassed by bear. My dog bears looping enthusiasm. I heard you on joe rogan. He says, joe rogan, the former mixed martial artist commentate a comedian and host of the world's most downloaded podcast is himself an interesting example of new emerging models of masculinity, a fusion of right wing individualism, a new age tolerance, a fierce auto didact. he has become a champion of american libertarianism is to me, fascinating because he's clever and a good fighter. There you go. There's me mentioning you in passing now. I went over whenever he wrote here.

Speaker 2:          02:17:59       I said, you better put in seemingly because I think a footnote in reductive. They're saying miksang, right wing individualism and newark, but what do you think about that, joe? They are. I don't know how much right wing I have in me. I'm exactly libertarian libertarian right wing stuff is probably, if you talk to a real bright winger, they'd go, what the fuck you're talking about? Yeah, I think you're right. I mean, I think a lot of libertarianism would have sort of covered it better, but this was written a point where I didn't. I hadn't listened to as much stuff, so I've changed in this amount. You can come on here anytime you Want. I love talking to you. You're awesome. Do you think so? We have a great time. We did have a great time there. We. I'm looking forward to going back to your new studio. That sounds like your own version of a willy wonka podcast. Land be crazy. The thing is, you know, like this is why I don't take drugs is because I've drank caffeine there and I'm sort of slightly scared of going back to like my normal life in a parachute in, back into that fucking brand. Ladies and gentlemen, joe rogan ebook. Download your podcast. What is it? Go under the skin with russell brand under the skin with russell brand. Goodbye everybody.
