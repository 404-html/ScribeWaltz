Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Through me doing stand up. Gene Simmons came to see me do stand up at new years and a in La and then his son, uh, like listened to one of my cds and liked it. So you drag the whole family out. Oh Wow. I've never been starstruck before. A show where I was like, I felt weird about to go on stage. I'm going to go, I'm about to go on stage. I couldn't, it wasn't a normal show, it just couldn't be a normal show. It was just too weird to me when I was a little kid. Like I was little, like seven or eight years old or whatever the fuck it was. I guess I was probably like 11 when, when, when kiss was big. Um, I remember like thinking they were the greatest thing in the history of the world, you know, like this is the greatest band of all time. Like I was a huge, huge kiss fan. So to like to be standing there as a grown man and he's a grown man and, and we're at my show. I'm like, that's just too fucking weird. It's just too much for me. I had to address it. How to address, I has shifted my whole act around

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       address it cause I have something that whole music thing. No, I don't see Tim is chuck. Luckily I didn't write, uh, there are some people there like some young girls who, who uh, who would be more starstruck by Gene Simmons, his son. She saw the two of them walking down the street or some young in general.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       Well he's a reality star. Yeah. He's a handsome devil. Very tall. The whole family is very tall. When they were hugging me, I felt like their child,

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       uh, all of them is following them around for Valerie show.

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       No, it was legit. It was just regular shell.

Speaker 2:          00:01:31       Did you know there's an abandoned zoo and a la and the Griffith Park and London zoo? Yeah, it closed in the 1960s. It, when was the first zoo in Los Angeles? I, they closed it down because it was so fucking small. And so they raised money for the current zoo and so they, it was like a mile down the street. And so now I found out the other day that you can actually go to this zoo. It's still there and they've gone through it. Yeah, they filmed the movie anchorman. There's a scene in it from that movie. So anyways, you go through like this weird trail and he'd go through this parking lot and then you end up in this zoo and it looks like, you know, like this is where the Tigers, where this is where the elephants were. And then there's like all these cages where they used to be like gorillas and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          00:02:10       And what's so cool? It's fucking creepy. Like, like it's been grown over, like there's plants and stuff like that and it, half of the shits like still standing how they're half is like crumbling. Uh, but people hang out there and like we'll put bring blankets and there was like, like people playing the doors and one of the cells. So you're just walking down the here with Jim Morrison, just kind of echoing through lessons. A little fantastical. I mean, I live really close to there and it's not like, it's not that like, it's just, it's a field like right when you drive in it off Riverside there, right. It's just a pass, like the merry go round thing and there's a big field and then some old cages. You're freaking me out man. And then, and then we know about these doors. Did you make of the old house and talk to us? He told us to go when it turns out he's

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       been dead for five c we climbed, we're in the animals walk up and down or through the back, you know? And there was like people, graffiti artists like really awesome. Like oh you saw this? Yeah. Oh, okay. And behind that, behind the there was like, you know, like a big drawing of like a gorilla face screaming behind this badge of someone that just club you over the head. And the next thing you know, taking your ass. That was in the dream when I thought it was the creepiest though it was mostly women and girls like just hanging out there. I never, stuff like that. So it's a hangout people hang out at, it's like a park on that, but it was at night during the day. So it's a former zoo that you could walk through it and anybody can walk. Yeah. And it closed.

Speaker 3:          00:03:46       And then in the 60s and then you can really explore, there's a lot of trails you can find like old things that like you can't, it would be really cool to see the blueprint and like, oh all right, this is where this used to be. This word is cause there's a, it's like a ghost town. It's creepy as fuck. I was working on most of it. But it sounds, what you're saying is yeah, I was working for a private investigator once and um, I used to have to do a lot of drive and forum and we were out in the middle of fucking nowhere, like way, way far away. And it was driving back home and I was bored and I don't remember the town, but it was a town in the middle of fucking nowhere. And I saw a sign that said the zoo for whatever the fuck this town was.

Speaker 3:          00:04:23       I mean, I'm in the middle of nowhere. So I pull in and I go, okay, let's see what this fucking zoos all about. So I go there, there's a tiger that is in like a swimming pool. I mean, this fucking has nowhere to move and it keeps pacing back and forth and back and forth. And that's as far as I got. I got to that thing and I was just so freaked out by the obvious madness that I was seeing that they had taken some animal and put it in wood. It's really like a swimming pool and this fucking thing is just going back and forth and back and forth, and there's no room for him. A swimming pool on its side. When I say a swimming pool, it's like the size of a swimming pool and it's cement. I mean, it's just this weird fucking thing that this poor creature is stuck in.

Speaker 3:          00:05:07       He's pacing back and forth and I'm watching it. I'm like, this is madness. Like there's some like really tiny ass zoos and some places for little fucking animals are just, you know, even if you go to a nicest, who though does that not ever freak you out? I can't, I don't like that feeling of looking at these. I mean it's cool that we could see them all. I mean I was spoiled educational. I grew up one by one of the best zoos and probably some people consider it the whole country or whatever. Yeah, the Columbus Zoo where Jack hand is frowning and all that stuff. So ours do, it was a little bit cooler they had, cause it's Ohio, they had like farm land, you know, where it was just like this elephant was in like its own like woods. Like it was like it didn't look like a k. There was just, you know, big huge exhibits. Do you think it bothers them though? Okay. It's take it, if it gets big enough then it's okay. Is that the justification?

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       I think. I think like, do you know you, you know that you're on, you know where you're at right now. You know, if you grew up on an island like Hawaii or something like that, I mean that's a way bigger. But you know, elephants, they just want a big thing of grass. I don't think they care like to go hiking. Are you saying that elephants are in Hawaii? I'm so [inaudible] equation, I'm talking about like if animals have enough space so they have like, you know, football fields. I agree.

Speaker 3:          00:06:23       The San Diego. Yeah, San Diego Wild Animal Park is pretty dope. And like the one animals that definitely seem happy or the giraffes, they're just kind of like chilling and eating and wandering around. And there's like no one there to jack them, you know, which is, if you're like [inaudible] or an antelope or a fucking giraffe or anything, you're always thinking something's going to Jack you eventually. You know, you ever see the videos of, um, of them taking down giraffes of lions taken down giraffes cause a bunch of them on that line is, it's crazy. It's crazy. One of them, there's a lion and a n two lionesses and they take down this giraffe in the middle of a street. And these people are filming this from their fucking car. They're inside their car and they're filming it through the windshield. And this fucking lion takes down this giraffe right in front of them. It's why I'll dude, so fucking primal. Oh, you're right there and this thing, it's just, Ooh,

Speaker 2:          00:07:21       a shirt is so bad ass. Yeah. I got a bird crusher to shit on. I don't think so. That is beautiful.

Speaker 3:          00:07:27       It says I am the machine. If you don't know Bert Kreischer as a fucking hilarious story that he told them this podcast, which is amazing story of him and Russia. And it's so funny.

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       So somebody animated that one, right? Yeah. If I, if I remember correctly, it's like in the hundreds of thousands now.

Speaker 3:          00:07:43       Yeah. Fucking hilarious. I'll find it later and I'll tweet it tonight. But, uh, you know, Bert Kreischer, he's been on the podcast a bunch of times and he's one of the funniest guys.

Speaker 2:          00:07:51       Crazy story. I heard it. He did it at the Improv, but he's so funny. He's such a fun guy to be around, man. I didn't realize his like, history. I mean, I just, you know, he's just the guy that I met around doing comedy, but I didn't know that he was like, like the king of college partiers and while stem

Speaker 3:          00:08:09       wild, it was like such a nice guy. Yeah. It's so weird. It's like he's a, he's a partner. Yeah. But he like, he doesn't have a fucking mean bone. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:08:17       no, no. And he hangs out with his fans like, like that one guy that monkey Todd. Awesome. Nancy grace video, by the way. Did you see that Nancy Grace Video? It was beautiful.

Speaker 3:          00:08:25       Stewed called up Nancy Grace and ask Nancy grace, you know, what is it who you want to marry? Fuck or kill? Yeah. And she, he asked her,

Speaker 2:          00:08:34       well, would you rather like one marry, kill or fuck a red band, Sam Aaa or Jason Tebow? And he says on Tmz live really racist. Just sitting there like, like you could kind of look like she was going to smile, but then it'd become angry. And then monkey Todd goes and would you dry hump? Uh, Sam Aaa and then uh, Harvey, the TMZ hosts. This is what their first serious interview

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       I heard like they were like really like, like wow, this is the first time we have a serious interview Harvey. It's like, is this serious? Really like it, it's uncomfortable to watch that video, don't you think? No nonsense. She is not juggle babies, animals full. Laura, did you know she was with tapes or an office that big? Big. Yeah. Well you know, getting fretting about dead babies and Florida, it allows you a lot of freedom to eat Cheetos and stuff. Your face with brandings. You're all dead babies. It doesn't seem positive. Ring Ding. If thought Doni this rating thing cause this baby and Florida going to be alive now. I don't think so. She just eats it. She's, it's hard to stay slim. There's so many dead babies. It's hard to say this last baby she has like twin babies, which doesn't seem right. Like she doesn't seem like child bearing now.

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       It seems like that should be physically impossible. Her eggs should it be just fucking fighting to the death in there? I questioned it. I looked at her eggs should look like a gladiator seen fighting each other. Keep magic. She just had the pants. Pussy ever just choose way, just like a fist. Imagine just like jerking you off of her vagina muscles do have you seen that Russian bitch online that can carry like 30 pounds of their pussy? I don't know how it works and she doesn't really show the Gash, but she's got like videos on how to like control your pussy muscle so that you can like pick up weight. You know, like she would just fucking crush your dick just getting in there. Maybe it would be too tight. It would be uncomfortable. Like a wrestling match with your Dick. You know, he'll like dogs.

Speaker 3:          00:10:36       I like dogs when they fuck, they got a real problem because dogs have a bone and that bone gets locked in there like a fish hook and sometimes they get stuck. That's fucking pain. Cats do. And her jagged dicks. Catholic. It's jagged. What do you do in jerking off cat son? Well, you see a cat. That's why if you hear it, that's why. If you ever catch you seeking, they're screaming. Oh Wow. So it's, it's painful. It's painful for their female cat. That's nuts. You should Google Google cap penis right now. You'd be shocked. It looks like, uh, I've been tricked before, but not that easily, Brian. Not that easily. That penis, penis. Seriously. Look at it. I guess I need to know that everybody knows who his dog Dick looks like, but very few people know. No, you've never seen it. No, it didn't go take a look.

Speaker 3:          00:11:24       Okay. I see little Barbie looking things. Cat, penis, spines. They're called, my goodness. He's telling the truth. This is horrific. Nature is so ruthless. You know what it is. That's to ensure that the, the, the male stays in there and shoots his load. This is horrendous. Nature is so God damn vicious. What a vicious fucking animal in nature is, are all cats would just loosen up a little bit. They wouldn't take their Barbie Penis. You know, that's a wild world. We're living in a world of the cats. You know, big cats. Jaguars are little baby cats out there killing mice. It's just the same thing. It's all wild world of, of fucking moving and killing things smaller than you. You know, you can't, we can't even understand what it must be like to try and get some cat pussy. You know? You should imagine. Could you imagine this bitch is in agony. She wants to fuck so bad. She's in agony, but she knows that you're going to rip her insides up, but that needle he dick, she wants you to just keep talk being with no needles, the needles and they just circle each other.

Speaker 2:          00:12:29       That could be a good like let's write that script cat man like he, but he just has that Barbie peanut. That's why

Speaker 3:          00:12:36       cats, you know what they liked? They liked those fluffy cats that just give up, you know like what are those called? What was yours called? Persians. Persians. Persians. Just give up. They just a little slutty cats. They just relax and just take it. That's why I like a big Tom cat with like a Persian cat around the house so he could just fuck it. Random, you know, she's not going to fight back much. You know, she's going to barely fight back. She can't fuck with him being black street cat. It's like the Kardashians. They're Persian, aren't they? No. No. They're Armenian. Did you just make a joke about Armenian somewhere on Twitter recently,

Speaker 2:          00:13:11       so no, I don't think so. Have you ever worn a long exactly on par. Oh, Jen Kirkman tweeted something. Yeah. She tweeted something about, what? Is it, an Armenian holiday today or something? I Dunno, is it? She said something shit. I called it. She said she wasn't going to make any sarcastic tweets about the Kardashians in honor of some Armenian day, and I called her and ask us. That was the whole, I didn't say anything negative

Speaker 3:          00:13:34       about Armenians. I know you would never do that. Right? I would never say anything negative about a group of people that proud Armenians. They love being Armenian. You know, there's a lot of Armenians who were like, fuck, I wish it wasn't you. No. They love being Armenians. You know, they're proud people. Carl Breezy and duty used to fight the UFC. Fucking what a personality that guy has. He's hilarious. I got this thing that he, we were having lunch. I got to ask him if I could put this video out. It's a video of him joking around about he, his nickname was the heat and joking around about giving girls the heat and telling them, what are you doing? You're taking the heat. They take the heat. He's like yelling about it and he's like, he's so Armenian. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's so fucking hilarious. You know those, those really aggressive, funny Armenian type guys.

Speaker 2:          00:14:24       Yeah. I mean, I don't know a ton of them. I've only lived out here for like extreme Italians years. They're like extreme. Like I actually had Armenians hook me up at the tire center the other day, which was the most weirdest thing. There were six Armenians. They all came out circle around the car and was like, hey, how's it going? Oh you got two nails in your tires will change them and patch them. And he goes, you know what? It's on us. And I'm like, what? Really? That's awesome. Fuck is he though? Yo, you always hear bad things about people, Russian people

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       and Armenian people and you know, people from what we consider like hard places. You know, I've, I've made a lot of great, I mean, yeah, I mean are people like a lot of passion? You know, there's a, it's a, it says something about real ethnic groups, you know, a real group like the Armenian is, you know, like they stick to their culture. And when I was growing up, our startup culture is kind of bullshit. Like who gives a fuck? You know, like, you know, does it really matter if you behave exactly the way everybody else behaves? But when you see like a really tight knit ethnic community and you appreciate, not that they're racist or biased against anybody else, but that they have like this real distinct flavor to them, you know, the way they behave, you know, the, the, the things they like, you know, they have this real distinct, let's see, real uniqueness to it that makes it interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:15:38       It's one of the interesting things about life. You know, the, one of the things I was thinking about when I was in New Orleans this weekend, I was like, this is a completely different way to live your life. Like here there's these people that are living in, this is a totally different flavor, a very unique flavor of its own. You know, it alls was like a race. You know, like Norland people are almost like it's from another country. But I think that, you know, when, when people get assimilated it's the, you mean the perfect thing is to have everybody be cool with everybody. And there's, you know, and no, no people who are prejudice against any particular group because we're all some sort of weird shade of gray. Now we've all interbred to the point where there's no distinctiveness between you. No, no, no way of distinguishing us between anybody else.

Speaker 3:          00:16:20       We're all just one sort of individual type of thing. But along the way, man, we're going to lose a lot of fun. You know, there's a lot of fun and people being weird because a lot of fun and you know, Armenian dudes who are like suit wearing gold chains. And try to get some pussy. Those guys are awesome man. Yeah, those guys are fucking, the Kardashians are Armenians. I believe that they know. But our is that like if you make fun of the Kardashians, like as an Armenian Guy gonna Punch me and I don't think they claim, um, claim them cause it seems like she's trying to get a white girl. It's different, you know, think are Armenian women. I don't want to speak for Armenian women. They'll say, well less. They have to like forget about whatever the fuck you know. She's, you know, is she worthwhile and she worth anything.

Speaker 3:          00:17:08       What's the point? We're talking about her. So she's entertaining just as like Max and Ruby is a cartoon that my kids love. It's this little rabbit show. It's a fucking show. It's entertaining. Maybe not to you. I've never heard of kids to someone. This Kardashians show is fucking awesome. All right. Oh that's that person. They deserve it. It's ridiculous. As ridiculous as it is. So, uh, I dunno, I dunno if the Armenians claimer but they should, you see that she's a bad ass bitch when it comes to like being like good at that. You know, you've got to recognize Paris Hilton, who she took the Paris Hilton thing. So some completely new level to the point where every time I'm at the airport, I'm my fucking sneakers into a bin. I'm looking at her face just like ads where it's her and a couple of other famous people and I, every time I'm like, wow, this girl started off in a fucking porno movie.

Speaker 3:          00:17:59       Now I'm putting my change on her face. It's so strange, you know? But you got to, I love it. I love the madness of it. I love how ridiculous it is. I've gotten to the point where I love Rick Perry. I see him talk and I know, I know he's of stutter and fuck. I know he's just like Bush. I know he's going to do the exact same shit. Maybe even weirder. You know, maybe if he reminds me of dude. Yeah, Josh Brolin playing w in the movie. That's what it reminds me. And I look at it, but I like it. I like that he's there. I'm enjoying that he's there. I mean gang, but then you can, then it's just like, so I don't know what was given up on everything, you know? I mean that's kind of in the same boat where it's like, all right.

Speaker 3:          00:18:43       I mean I can either be walking around like furious out of my mind all the time or just like don't really pay attention to it and enjoy the absurdity of it all. It's like watching Mitt Romney and Rick Perry, like I just saw on the news. I don't know what they were like debating each other and it's like, who's crazier? Who believes in crazier Shit Dude? Like that's like from an eighties and look like they're like politicians. They are like the archetype like bad politician guy from like an eighties movie or something. It's just like this like robot dude. They're both exactly the same. I think when you take your choice, we're getting a real clear message, a real clear message with politics over the last decade or so. It's that what you are seeing on television, the people that are talking, that's the guy who got that spot. That's all that is, and that guy is, he's, he's instructed, he's pushed into a certain direction for all the people who got him to that position.

Speaker 3:          00:19:42       It's so clear. It's so obvious there's, there can be no denying it when you look at it now, to take it seriously, as in, you know, to take it, to think that there's really some sort of a big vote going on and we're going to change the way the whole thing works. Hey, I hear they're going to throw out, the Federal Reserve is going to go back to the only live in by the constitution. We're going to cut the number of laws back dramatically. We've got to let people have state's rights again. Yeah, we're, can I get rid of all, how long would that last? No, they would kill that guy. They would kill that guy. The heartbeat. Oh yeah. Of course. We all, we all agreed that the guy's saying like, uh, no, I don't think I can sign that bill called the clean air act.

Speaker 3:          00:20:20       That actually lets you pollute more when people tell you, well that's ridiculous. You're being cynical. This is a terrible message to send out. You haven't really researched this enough to be APP. Absolutely accurate. You get, you're saying this damaging thing that voting doesn't change anything and you're sending a terrible message to people, but at what point in time are you allowed to be objective? At what point in time do you look at a guy like Obama who acts like a Republican and does all this creepy shit that if GE Gw was doing it and liberals would be fucking calling into newspapers every day and protesting every day, he's doing shit. Does just like the stuff that Bush did and yet somehow or another. Yeah, absolutely. I really, somehow or another liberals aren't even saying anything about it. It's the whole, it's so bizarre. Lee. Creepy and so bizarrely weird.

Speaker 3:          00:21:04       Just like windows versus PC. It's like the same sort of retard battle going on. It's the same sort of weird control over some fucking boat that doesn't even have a steering wheel. It's like one day you break into the fucking main cabin. All right? We finally got to the head of the boat. There's no stairs, there's nothing. There's no instruments. It's smooth as glass. You can affect this fucking thing at all. You could spend your whole life chipping away at this insanely corrupt system. Good luck. Look at when we, when you see anybody like challenges, any, any of the mainstream ideas that we've come to accept. Like look at a guy like Ron Paul. They'd duct that fucking guy every chance they get. I've seen polls where they ignore the number one guy and focus on the two and three, the real battle between Rick Perry and Mitt Romney. And they were, they were literally ignoring that Ron Paul was winning things. Just ignoring them. Just not even talking to them. Yeah. Because he's just telling him they're, they're doing everything wrong. We're doing everything wrong. The people are going yes. And the TV.

Speaker 4:          00:22:06       Well, it's like when Howard got, when Howard Dean said, yeah, just fucking but has never fucking, he fucked up. I fucked up. You fucked up. I think they set him up to manipulate, like they took that footage and twisted it into something.

Speaker 3:          00:22:23       Well, I remember it was morning mattress material. There was a, there was a show that I was thinking of when I think of morning shows, Charles Laquidara the mattress in the morning and Boston. Oh, okay. They would play something along these lines. So you know that every fucking single wacky morning zoo radio station that crazy yelled at her, yelled out and it became a joke. It became a national joke in the matter of a day. You remember it, right? Howard Dean did a campaign speech and he's like, Hey, we're gonna Fairmont in New Hampshire. And all they did was take that. Yeah. They're like, no fucking way, dude. You can't ever, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:23:01       Resident. They took it from like his body, Mike, when he was yelling to like, you know, a couple thousand people.

Speaker 3:          00:23:08       But could you imagine if Obama ever, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:23:13       well, ever since. How are we managing that? You're not allowed to show any emotion anymore. I mean that's, they have playbooks now where they're like, no, don't show any emotion. Just put the, this is still in when you make your fist, isn't it? Isn't it amazing? And don't ever answer a fucking question no matter what you do. Never fucking give a direct, definitive.

Speaker 3:          00:23:33       Once people decide that Howard Dean has done, Howard Dean has done and he just pushed to the side like he was the front runner. He was the number one surgeon

Speaker 4:          00:23:41       from Vermont. Like, you know, you man, brilliant man. Wait, speaker. Got a little

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       emotion. Good morals. Yeah. Fuck Outta here. You know, I kind of like him even more now because he's so uncensored when he talks about things and for months a very interesting place too. He's from Vermont. It's amazing. It's like, it's really northern in rural, but it's really smart. Have you ever done a Gig there? Yeah, I've done that. A gig in Burlington when I was living in Boston, I did a weekend there once was fucking great man. I was like, wow, what a crazy. And they were like, winter's are tough though. What he said, I have a friend who lives in Brattleboro and uh, yeah, winter's are fucking, I wouldn't want to be there. No winner. There's a certain quality of your life that you sacrifice when you, you know, you, you live in someplace. It's brutally cold. Well it's the way it's so rural that you have, everybody's got like a 45 foot kind of dirt driveway thing and then when it snows and freezes, it's like you can't drive my truck down there fucking to know a tree.

Speaker 3:          00:24:37       Well up in big bear. A lot of people drive around with fucking chains on. Yeah, I think, well yeah, you can do hires. I think you were required areas and she used to be, you know, I know they make like studded snow tires and shit, so you can deal with that. Like a lot of people in Colorado, they had that, but no changes are required. Yeah. That a place like Vermont, it's fucking cold for a good five or six months. It's really cold. Fuck. Is it beautiful up there though? Man, it's one of the few places that's like hasn't been fucked with, you know, because there's just, you know, it's, it's a fairly small population and it's a, it's got an incredible amount of wildlife and incredible amount of like woods and just beautiful nature shit to look at. You know, when you drive and drive up to Burlington, you're like, look how beautiful it is.

Speaker 3:          00:25:25       Just clear air and not that many people. And it's almost all outdoor advertising and Vermont to no billboards, no outdoor, you can't advertise outdoors. Wow. Yeah, the real hippie. That's where Ben and Jerry comes from. Ben and Jerry's ice cream, they came from their real super happy up there. Are they up there so you can actually go to the factory and to the dude's live up there too or did they fucking fake it and they're in Miami getting made Dick suck prime. I don't know any magic there. You imagine that they were just became super rich and they just became ballers, but then they'd have to like put it on the fucking Birkenstocks. So their ad campaigns, they just want to be out there doing blow. And that's a funny idea. That'd be a funny like sketch mad big hippies like fake Ben and Jerry get those guys and when they get big or like p diddy and fucking just totally shift here.

Speaker 3:          00:26:14       Ben and Jerry's becomes like Mcdonald's where a different guy plays it in every store. Hey Jerry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have a fucking Ben and Jerry's show that goes on before the actual ice cream gets served. Yeah. I'm Ben and he's Jerry. How are you? Sure. I thought I was jewelry. Yeah. Yeah. How the fuck did that Mcdonald's thing happened? Remember when there's a real clowns, Justin up as Mcdonald's and you can go to Mcdonald's like certain days and Ronald McDonald would be there and you're like, shit, this has got a Ronald Mcdonald's going to be at this. When people get excited about it, how ruthless has Mcdonald. They still do that. I had a roommate who was a clown. He really do. Ronald McDonald Shit appearance. Amazing. Now, what a tricky way to rope kids in eight and your fucking food man to think that about. You know, when you think about the most delicious serial as all the worst shit for you, that's all the ones with the big attractive cartoon faces on.

Speaker 3:          00:27:07       It literally is designed to get little kids and go, Ooh, look like to them serial called cookie crisp. Yeah. That's not going to be a feeling of a kid. Well, you could have a cereal box that was all white that said captain crunch peanut butter, and you would look at it and go, fuck yeah, you could be completely white with like black letter. But to a kid that's going to be completely unattractive because they can't fucking read. They're getting them before they can even can read that and go, I want this. I want this. Like my three year old can't read, but she looks at captain crunch and it looks fun. You look at fruity pebbles and fun.

Speaker 2:          00:27:45       They still make Bogue, blueberries, blueberry. In Ohio, there was no such thing as booberry. They had only the strawberry and the chocolate, but then I would go on vacation in. And what was the Franken Franken Berry Berry. Did you feel left out? I would go to Florida on vacation again, five boxes of it it or you haul a mom very like, mom, please, I, this is my favorite series, so she'll spend like $30 and buy as much booberry $30 oil, a little scrappy. It was rude. There's no reason for that. Blueberries is the best one and you don't sell it in certain markets? I think I've ever had booberry oh that's great. That's great. Or the strawberry on going to cvs, they saw my folks wouldn't buy us the sugary stuff. I mean I've had it had

Speaker 3:          00:28:27       it as an adult. Good, good for them. My parents bought it very sparingly. They let us have it every now and then you'd like pick a favorite to just eat the stupid shit they would, they would indulge us. Lou would also let us eat TV dinners. We wanted a TV dinner, shots, stories and they're disgusting. But were for whatever reason, I saw the very steak. I want to eat a TV dinner, wanting eat the dumbest shit. So they would let me every now and then. But for the most part, they wanted me to eat healthy, so I didn't get to eat too many of those, but, but when I could, when I got a chance, man, oh fuck. Yeah. Well like what we were talking about earlier, once you tell people they can't do shit, then it's on. It's like, really? I want some of that. Yeah. You mentioned if you grew up a Vegan you would just like hunger for chicken livers and hearts and meet and legs of lamb. He's smell it. And restaurants in life, you can never have it. Milk. Yeah, no shit. You're just getting seeds here. Eat the seeds. They have a full spectrum of [inaudible] Polak acids. It's all vital nutrients. Eat the seeds. You can get everything and just the seeds. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:29:35       Yeah. I don't know. Could you ever go vegan? I, I'd give it a shot.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       I mean, I wouldn't have any, I mean just for kind of like to see how it makes me feel and like to kind of clean out like, you know, just eat and kind of raw. I would do like raw diet or I don't know much about it, but I'd try like I think, yeah I could go vegan nut fish. I like fish too much. I like eggs till I could drive vegetarian cheese take. There's some merit to vegetarian. I think it definitely, it probably changes your personality too. I think it's print been a least with anecdotal evidence proven that people we meet are more aggressive than people who are vegetarians kind of makes sense if you think about just the nature aspect of it. Even though we're not going out and getting the stuff, even though we're not killing it ourselves, that makes sense. We're still eating it, you know, we're still getting it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       You're eating flesh to the attitude that you must have, like the cultivating your body. If you were a flesh eater, a constant flesh eater, it's gotta be a more predatory attitude. It just makes sense. Yeah. I mean I don't know how the real probably just keeps something triggered in your body of like, you know, totally guessing here. Totally talking out of my ass. Cause obviously I don't know how the real reward system works with like eating meat and getting aggressive, but we all associate like steak with aggression. It's like a natural association, you know, fucking what's a man's meall, right. Make sense to me. Sold, you know I'm doing no further research. I'm going to repeat what you said. Is fact the other people now I think if we all ate shit that was like grass fed, if we all let just grass fed beef, there would be way less of it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       But it'd be way better for you and people would probably enjoy it more. But there's certainly at this point I think there's just too many goddamn people and not enough food, you know, to to live like that. That scares me man. I mean there are a lot of, you know, we would have to have monstrous, monstrous farms to compete with some of these crazy chicken farms will be fucking grow them all stuffed together. I mean everybody that, it freaks everybody out when you watch those chicken videos. But if they weren't like that, like how, how much farm acreage would it cost? How much more would it cost? Is Is it at a point where we need cheap foods so much that they have to do shit like this? Cause that's fucked up and I'm not insinuating that they are. I'm just raising the question that is fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       If that's the case, if it's like we need to do like the factory farming thing cause it's fucking way too many of us and then just sending chickens out the moment they shit, I'm out there fucking pop it up in the hormones cause they gotta get a big quick so we can ship them out to the 300 million motherfuckers. And out of those 300 million, how many are farmers? How many a 300 million people are farmers? Is it even a million? No, it's not one in 301 and 300 people isn't a farmer. Do you think there's a million farmers in this country? Probably say there's a different kinds of, I don't know man. Amelia, either way. Let's look at it. Obviously folks for you googling right now, he's fucking guys are so off with their numbers, Huh? How can I say? All I'm trying to say is, could you imagine if that was the case? If it was one in every 300 could you imagine if one person had to take care of 300 fucking people?

Speaker 5:          00:32:52       Yeah. That's ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          00:32:58       Yeah, I guess,

Speaker 5:          00:32:59       oh no.

Speaker 1:          00:33:00       I would just eat a lot of water and she'd be like, you, you imagine one person you had to feed 300 people. That's true. One person, one person feeds 300 people. What the fuck? That would be so hard. No, you'd have to do it by yourself. You couldn't employ anybody. We can employ a million people and honor for our, our numbers to work. You can't employ anyone because it's one of the 300 and we're being super generous. We're saying there's 1 million of farmers, so that's, that's where it gets fucking loony. Toons man. Obviously it doesn't work like that. They have a hundred people and they do. The work of 5,000 individuals are more, you know, I know obviously it doesn't work like that, but it almost seems like at this point the, the, the resources versus population. Isn't that a weird place where we need an incredible amount of food and we all sort of take for granted that it's out there, you know, like who's providing all of this,

Speaker 5:          00:33:51       you know,

Speaker 4:          00:33:53       it's a lot of fucking food and if the three of us went out right now and had like two hours to just buy as much food as possible, we could each by so much fucking food. Yeah. It's, to me it's like just fast food. Like if we had like an hour or two by is unlimited felt like we could buy probably,

Speaker 5:          00:34:12       I mean a van full. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:16       More, yeah. 250 cheeseburgers a piece. It's just to me staggering the way we have, uh, grown from being hunter gatherers to people who lived in like small villages to cities where we have to get the stuff sent in every day in trucks, just more meat for the wheel over and over again. Trucks and trucks of meat. I just pump it into the city all day long and it's really only been going on for a few hundred years. That's nuts, man. Yeah, that's, that's amazing. It's almost like there's a living machine called civilization and its blood is animals. I mean that's the pump you hundred prompt alive by blood, you know the blood and the trucks. It's almost like individual blood cells, you know. But it's not, it's a circle is much larger scale. It's like yeah, just meet delivery devices. Yeah. And that's what Keith does. These are the, the meat delivery devices to the city that keeps it moving at this insane pace where you can fit 7 million people on one square floating place and have them stacked on top of each other and he just keeps sending the meat. I saw that movie yesterday. Did it freak you out? All right.

Speaker 4:          00:35:31       It didn't really freak me out. It, I don't think it's stuck on a sock from, I heard a lot of people say I liked it. Um, but tell me if this is right. Does Tokyo have 36 million people? Something crazy like that. They're packing blew my fucking mind cause they were talking, you know, like as the thing, I mean everybody knows that. Not that it's about a disease, it spreads. And they would show like, you know, New York population, whatever, 8 million, whatever lives in New York or California or Los Angeles population is in and they will go to Tokyo and it said 36.4 million. And I was like, Eh, that's incredible. That's like five times the size of the goldfish rule. Like the bigger the bowl of the bigger the fish. And that's why Asians for the most part seem, you know, a little bit smaller built. And

Speaker 3:          00:36:13       that's interesting. You know, that's very interesting Brian. That's a uh, an interesting physiological theory of one that, you know, people would consider. It's funny if you judge any group like that, say a lot of Asians are small, all of a sudden you're, you, you're tipping on the verge of the swimming pool filled with racism. Like you look right there. What are you saying? We say Asians are small, but they, their actual statistics, you can look at like the appetite and weight of them, right? They are still, it's, it's a weird thing if you make an observation, there's always the danger of being called a racist. Even a little observation. It's not, it's not at all.

Speaker 4:          00:36:48       Did it? A girl from uh, Japan and she took me on a picnic at a dog park. That's racist.

Speaker 3:          00:36:55       Yes. Cause I'm only think Japanese people even eat dog. No, but they did. But jokes offensive in on many levels. Joke sucks. Logical level. Yeah. The Jug makes people go, people don't need dogs in Japan. That's what they do. They don't get a whole audience full of people going, you blow your dogs in Japan. Yeah. That would be the sound in the audience. People that have dogs in Japan, thanks. Talks about pan

Speaker 4:          00:37:24       that would be accepted. One Midwest, yet dogs and you're paying. I know they do.

Speaker 3:          00:37:29       It does make sense of what you said because in another animals, that is definitely the truth. Like these guys that I know told me that they could get me some baby crocodiles. I had a giant fish tank and I was looking for some exotic shit to put in my head. Paranas for a little while. Oh man, I got bored with them and I wanted to get some crocodiles. It seems like such a bad, so terrible idea. This is what I was saying. I was saying, okay, well how long, how big are these motherfuckers going to get? Why would I have crocodiles? Cause we can get you crocodiles. I go, you can get me crocodile. I was like, well how big are these crocodiles going to get? He goes, all, you don't have to worry about it. I go, what do you mean? He goes, as long as the tank is small, they won't get big.

Speaker 3:          00:38:02       I go, what? Really quiet? No, what? Yes, yes, yes. He said, how big is your tank? It was like, I don't remember how big it was, but it was about nine feet long. It was a really big fish tank. And he said, ah, maybe I'm exaggerating. Seven feet long. Oh, that's a really big fish. It was big. It was very big. He said, don't ever get more than a few inches. Yeah. My uh, my dad, did you get them? No. No. I think they're super illegal. And I didn't know the dude that well. And what if he was a fucking cop, right? Yes. Dot Rogan's in. I got you some crocodiles, brother. My Dad,

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       my dad built this huge pond in the backyard and he got like one of those like a hundred, uh, worth of, uh, a hundred, like a hundred goldfish at a pet store and I can almost feed or Goldfish, you know, like Shitty goldfish throws him in the pond. He took a couple out and put it in this other separate pond. The fish and the gold upon are still alive. A lot of them were like, I would probably say like 20 of them are still alive and now they're huge. Like your monster goldfish. The other two are normal goldfish. Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. They almost look like a boy.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       Well I think gold coin goldfish are pretty related. Yeah. Look Related Shit. Yeah. What is with coys and tattoos? What's that supposed to signify? The coy becomes a dragon or some shit. Everybody's got Koi fish. It's Japan thing. I think some dope ass Japan shit hands. She's the legend. They figured out tattooing. They figured out how to make like a sleeve. They're the ones who first figured that shit out really to make like big, big, bold pieces. You know, like the old days, you have a Koi fish? No, I don't have any Koi fish. I do have a drag and though tiger in a Samurai. How long ago? A lot of Japanese shit. This one's six years old and this one's two years old. Oh, you had that all done at the same time? Yeah. This dude Aaron Dellavedova from Guru Tattoo in San Diego. He's a fucking bad ass artist.

Speaker 1:          00:39:53       And um, I just, uh, I just always enjoyed tattoos. I always liked him. I think you're wearing some cool art on your skin, you know, and there's a lot of people attach a lot of weird shit to it. Like you don't have to do it. But to me, like I take care of my body and I'm a healthy and everything, but I'm want to decorate it the way I want to give a fuck. For some people it's a, it's a weird thing. So weirds mountain tattoos, weird amount tattoos, weird people out because they're permanent. You know when you have tattoos it's like he's willing to do something permanent

Speaker 4:          00:40:25       being that some dumb tattoos we got, I have Ozzie rules tattooed on my toes. Do you really? Are you serious? Before Ozzie came back like it was, that's weird. How old were you when you got that? 26 I was waiting to hear 33 26 27 and uh, but it was before the Osbornes and stuff. Like it was like, yeah. Yeah, it was me and my friend were talking about we watch

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       done it or were you disappointed once the Osbornes came out? Were you like fuck man, now it's mainstream?

Speaker 4:          00:40:56       Um, not really. I mean it's on my toes, but it definitely made the joke like not funny anymore cause you used to see like Ozzy written bathroom stall. I used to see Ozzy rules written everywhere. Right, right. And he just didn't see it anymore and I was like, Ozzy still fucking rules man. Like we saw this interview with him on like VH one behind the music, me and my friend. And they asked Ozzy what the key to happiness was. And Ozzy said the key to happiness is appy knees. And they were like, what? And he's like, API knees. The key to happiness is API knees. And I like what? What are you talking about? He stands up and pulls his down and he's got smiley faces tattooed on his knees and he goes, appy knees happy knees wide. I thought it was funny. I was like, Ozzy rules man. Funny. Not Funny enough to laugh. It's like funny loves to smile. I Dunno man. Ozzie was pretty, he's a pretty funny character. He did a lot of crazy shit.

Speaker 1:          00:41:58       It's amazing. He's still alive, isn't it? Yeah. I mean he's one of those dudes because they're like, wow, he made it through.

Speaker 4:          00:42:04       Uh, yeah. And now he's like this mainstream. Like, did you ever think you'd see Ozzy Osborne doing like a fucking, I don't know. He's didn't like, I'm sort of a thing with his wife and his kids on TV commercials too. You see them in pretty mainstream commercial. Really like fucking, yeah, for like direct TV and shit. It's weird. Or like cars. Probably, I don't know. I don't really pay attention as we get older, say things. You know, as we get older we're more willing to do

Speaker 1:          00:42:30       take shit from crazy people that we like than we ever were before. You know, like look this Chris Brown dude who, Oh yeah, you got that reality check. He sort of making a comeback, you know, and it's like all these award shows and Shit and apparently he's a super talented, a great singer and there's some people that are accepting it and some people not. And like look at this Micheal Veck thing. Michael Vick killed a bunch of dogs and his back plan it, you can't tell me this is the same world that I grew up in because this is a different world. This is a different world. People are stranger world. People are getting away with more

Speaker 4:          00:43:05       people are more forgiving because more people are fucking up and doing weird or creepy or shit because of the Internet and stuff. Man, the bar is going higher and higher doing more deviant shit. So they're like, well, let's not be so hard on that guy because I don't know, maybe I want to fucking try some of that weird shit or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       Don't you think that people have bounced back from Shit that they could've never bounced back from before?

Speaker 4:          00:43:30       You know, sports I, yeah. I think Michael Vick is definitely something that wouldn't have happened 25 years ago. I'm shocked. But I mean, when you're that like, yeah, I think the morals of the, our entire cultures have just been eroded a little bit. Like, yeah, I don't think that would have been acceptable in the, in the early eighties like it would, it's, it's, it's, it's also fun. You have a guide that talented to who can, you know? But yeah, I just, I don't, I don't think money overrode everything

Speaker 1:          00:44:01       25 years ago. Could you imagine if Clinton was in office today? Oh Man. Jim Magic Twitter messages that like interns would be throwing back and forth because he would get busted for sure if it was an office today. Yeah. Yeah. I think about the crazy shit that dude did

Speaker 4:          00:44:20       so many more avenues of him. Like a,

Speaker 1:          00:44:23       he was always my, my proof. You know, like when, when he got his dick sucked by that check, I was always like, God damn it. I fucking knew it. I knew it.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       I knew they have to be crazy to get in there. You can't really be that guy you're selling man. You can't, you're not going to have the kind of [inaudible] likes blowjobs though, man. Yeah, yeah. Everybody explode exposures. But Clinton would just whip his dick out on people. He would just get alone with girls. Just whip his dick out cause he got out of control. He was a maniac. He's a fucking savage who got blossom. Just one of those dudes just couldn't help it swaying. I can't help a swine. I saw the pitch. There comes, he just loved it. Yeah. I mean there were a lot of chicks doing that to him. Could you imagine if he existed during the, you know, the days of Wiener Gate? Fuck yeah. It could have been set up. I bet he liked Geraldo. I bet he likes to get drunk and Bang State troopers, hot police troopers.

Speaker 3:          00:45:20       How hot would not be in the back of a police car. That's a lot of girls. A lot of girls. I bet. I bet it's pussy output tripled after that Monica Lewinsky thing because there's a lot of girls that just want to let him know and then keep their mouth shut. Listen, I know you had that problem with Monica, but you know when she's a little girl and it's not me and I'm, I'm a grown woman and I wanted to want what I want to do and I don't need anything other than you and my mouth and that's the end of it. And he blew it.

Speaker 3:          00:45:47       He was just dropping loads on dresses and shit. He wasn't even and assistant, she'd get rid of the evidence. Maybe this could make people in another part of the world is my DNA. We can't have that. Yeah, he was a freak though. Stuck in the fucking cigars and bitches pussy. I don't know if it was a good president round. I don't know. Maybe when he was in, he was when he was on the show. The writers had it written in a more happy, friendly Wa and I thought you were insinuating he did your podcasts, your, you imagine he was on the show, get him on the show. I am the President for eight years, dad.

Speaker 3:          00:46:26       And it was a, for the most part laughs. Good guy in there. I mean there's only been though Buzzy, I don't know. No, Obama is probably a good guy. I don't know if any of them are good guys. I don't, I'm not sure what I'm going to do anything fucked up shit to get that far. Yeah, I don't, I don't think you could be just some regular fucking dude with some unique ideas and get all the way to be president. You have to have compromise yourself so deeply along the lines. And obviously I've done no research whatsoever to substantiate any of these claims and stuff. This is just talking shit at 10 o'clock in the evening after being in the hot sun all day and barely able to talk. Um, I don't know. I don't believe it though. Do you believe that like a good guy can make it this far? Now do you think you have to say, do they ultimately agreed to letting unspeakable things happen on the regular? I mean, you have to, I want to say anything. You just think, oh, it'd be even rewrite the script. Everyone entity. A lot of people don't believe that that's the case. A lot of people believe that it was Lee Harvey Oswald

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       and he got lucky and that people make a big deal out of nothing.

Speaker 4:          00:47:33       Yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe. I mean, I, you know, Kennedy, Martin Luther King, both Kennedy, I mean it just seems like anybody who's kind of like steering us towards some decent change winds up with their fucking head blown off by a fucking crazy gunman. Even John Lennon Dude, like, I mean, that could have started a revolution. He was like, the web isn't a popular guy

Speaker 1:          00:47:58       is, it is. It's so tempting to fall into the idea of conspiracy and collusion and it's very sexy. It's very tempting.

Speaker 4:          00:48:05       But I mean there's no, it doesn't seem like there's balance on the other side. Like, why didn't Nixon ever gets shot? Or like, I mean Reagan did. I guess that's a,

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       you mean balance on the [inaudible]? Yeah, right. Yeah. You know, he was one of the most raw raw wall, but like, I dunno, it seems like, you know Gandhi like yours. No. Well Shane, he didn't never got fucking shot at because he was on team psycho. And is it possible that the psychos on, they're always going to be four tab? Yeah, they target the guys who are for peace and love and change course. They went after Reagan. I wonder. Reagan might have been

Speaker 4:          00:48:38       been, maybe that was a random thing. Maybe that really wasn't planned because he didn't die or maybe they're just sending them a message.

Speaker 1:          00:48:48       Shoot you in the Gulch and watching that on TV going, God damn, they shot that actor dude as now the president, somebody has a joke. It was a little kid. You know,

Speaker 4:          00:48:57       him and Leslie, like if he never became president, he would have the same career that Leslie Nielsen had. I forget who

Speaker 1:          00:49:05       fucking joke it is. Oh, that's brilliant. So true. Bedtime for Bonzo. Did you ever see that? I don't know. I mean, I'm an engineer with a monkey. Yeah. Yeah. He did. A couple wasn't there? There's a couple of bonds. Oh, movies aren't there? I think so. I Dunno. I Dunno. I never watched like five seconds of it and go, what the fuck is anything more than one monkey movie? It just shouldn't be legal that if you're a person who is a professional pretender that you go on to be the guy who tells the truth to the nation. That just seems ridiculous. Well, you're awesome at lying.

Speaker 4:          00:49:35       Yeah. Well, it was just like, I don't think now him, I don't think he made one decision and the whole time I think there were people, there was like Dick Cheney was telling him what to say. Look, there was a commission of fucking assholes who were like, all right,

Speaker 1:          00:49:46       this is what we're doing. Here's the script. You're an actor, act. You know what I'd love to make? Loves him out through the door. He's responsible for one little speech. That is one of my favorite speeches of any president because he talks about how would we respond if we were all on this earth facing a threat from another world. You know, how would we respond? How quickly would we forget our differences? And I'm like, damn, that's brilliant. It's so true. It's a great speech and it makes you go, what the fuck does he know? Well, yeah. What was he really into the fucking Star Wars Shit.

Speaker 4:          00:50:20       Like he wanted to make that, you know, that missile defense system start like maybe the aliens who were like, Hey man, we're going to fuck with you guys soon. I don't know. Who knows what's going on with all that. George Lucas during the star wars thing go, hey, this is copyright and friends. Did He, what, why were they allowed to car wars program program? Um, I guess because they're not, they're allowed to do anything want, I don't know their government, but they're not doing it for like profit. Yeah. You know, it's a defense.

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       You know, there's a, uh, um, some big conspiracy theory about people who created star wars that the strategic defense system, Star Wars, yeah. That it was all bullshit and that the scientists one by one had been killed off apparently 22 different scientists who worked on it were killed in a strange ways. He's serious. His Fist reation suffocation, decapitation death leap, death leave, shotgun blast, missing person auto accident over and over again. All these different scientists.

Speaker 4:          00:51:20       I don't want this coordinate according to the Internet. Oh, operated by more than, listen man, I didn't at first thing I went to on Google did start. I'm going to regurgitate that as fact. Just go for it. 20 to 22 Sdi researchers all supposedly 22 out of how many out? It's a good question, but 22 periods. A lot. Let's say if there's a hundred comedians started dying, like I'd fucking skipped town. Yeah, that'd be gross. Would be hundreds. How many people you would think that would be, what if they, uh, if they did that, if they started killing comedian? Yeah. Oh, I was just saying if 22 comedians died in suspicious ways, I would fucking, you know, that's a, that's too big of a number for one. But I've out of all the, we'll get a puppet immediately out of all the scientists that were involved in it.

Speaker 4:          00:52:12       I'm sorry, my question was do you think there was like 300 guys? Like how many different guys do you think were working for this star wars company? Was it a thousand people with lives and yeah, I would say that even if it sounds that would be from this janitor wanting to kill themselves while oh yeah. Or just disappear. As the number becomes bigger and bigger, it becomes more and more silly. You start looking at and go, well there was a million scientists, 22 killed themselves. A bunch of them. Like there wouldn't be that many that had like crazy. Not everybody has like crazy security levels. Like you would have to kill everybody. Like every guy gets screwed in a fucking light bulb.

Speaker 1:          00:52:46       You would though. Cause maybe what was going on was so fucking obvious. You had a clean house. This is the conspiracy theory during me most

Speaker 6:          00:52:54       step back and do my Alex Jones voice we've got, here's a situation where special ops, what they're doing is they're victimizing innocent people.

Speaker 4:          00:53:06       That's fucking good, man. Thank you. I mean, did you hear them all? 100% of the signs created crystal Pepsi Guide. Shut the fuck. Uh, could you imagine if that is true? That what if there, I mean we're, we're, we know there's 22 scientists that died. We need to find out how many there were making a documentary. Did you hear about a

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       hydro collider thing? That guy I should go to Snopes for all of this is what I should do then is the guy that might be a need from the future. Arrested at the collider. Uh, last week. Yeah. Some guy was arrested at the, what's it called? The hydrogen large Hadron Collider. Yeah. He was arrested because I don't know why, what he was doing, but he was said he was from the future dummy. Oh, that's funny. Was he just crazy or was he from, I don't know. I just thought it headline. What a goofy fuck. That'd be so that's a funny idea. Show up there and a silver suit. You just have to ask him a few more questions and there'll be pretty clear.

Speaker 3:          00:54:02       Oh, you come from in the future. Okay. What am I right to? There was one guy with a website. There was a fuck, I forget the um, the scam g two t tour somewhere. I think they were calling themselves something t tour from the future and yet they have this whole John [inaudible], t I t u r and some whole thing about how he described how the civilization was going to fall apart and he had come from the future to write and get the fuck out, man. Stop John t toward whatever it is. It's just, you really think that someone came from the fucking future and came back to the past. You really think that it's just, that's what time travel's going to be alike. Yeah, it was Nicholas Cage. You see that shit. Now they're saying that, that, that Nicholas cage is a time traveler because there's a photo or something like John crew sack bro.

Speaker 3:          00:54:48       Huh? Not they have Nicolas Cage. They have John Cusack cause he, he never looked at the older, oh, you know, I'm sorry. No, not even John Cusack. The other dude from the Matrix, Keanu Reeves, Yana Reeves cannot reuse. They have him at the time machine. They're always saying that he's a vampire. Ever gets old. Yeah. He's beautiful man. It's like 50 depths holding up. Okay. If he's holding up pretty good. Good, good. Both have kind of Indian blood, fresh pussy like vampires, the pussy that's constantly swan diving under their cock. Every time they poke it out the house for some air, put it through their mail slot and it goes cage might be a vampire or so, one believer says, oh, photo, I'm from an old ass photo that looks like Nicholas Cage. It's creepy. Wow. That's pretty dope. I was removed. He's in a most powerful empires kiss. That's pretty funny.

Speaker 3:          00:55:39       The ghost rider, Bro. Did you see ghost writers saw that? No. It's terrible, but it's good if you're high and you know, it's terrible if you're like ready for a terrible fucking ghost motorcycle superhero movie. Yeah. You have little girls, right? Yeah. Um, did you ever watch the tooth fairy with the rock? The tooth fairy to rock? Yeah. No, I missed that one. That's a, I watched that man. Why did you watch that? Because it was like late. I took mushrooms with my and uh, and it was just that kind of like after we're done tripping but we're still like, you know, up and hanging out and that was coming on Hbr and we're like fuck it, let's watch it. It's probably good for a few laughs. And we had to, uh, we had to rewind it like 40 minutes in because we couldn't follow what

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       was going on. Like it's baffling. Like there's so many holes in it. Like he has this relationship with this woman, but you don't know if they're married and there's these kids, it's weird, like you don't know his relationship to the, it's not his wife and kids, but like he's hanging around there and he never kisses the woman

Speaker 7:          00:56:42       and,

Speaker 4:          00:56:44       and then he somehow like, it's never really clear on why he turns into a tooth fairy. Like he said, something like that, the tooth fairy is bullshit bullshitted kid like at one point. And then all of a sudden he's like in this weird tooth fairy land and he's got to be very, it's kind of like, it's, it sounds awesome. And then Billy crystal makes an appearance and I totally called it like,

Speaker 3:          00:57:07       because he like goes through tooth fairy training, you know, learning how to fly all fucking bumping into the tooth fairy training.

Speaker 4:          00:57:13       Well yeah, it's like, yeah, it's like, you know, where's tooth fairy land in his brain? He probably just got hit on the head or something. And this was all in his head. That was really the plot. Yeah. Yeah. And then he turns into the tooth fairy

Speaker 7:          00:57:28       and uh,

Speaker 4:          00:57:30       and then like we were watching it and it's like, and I was like, all right, Billy, Billy Crystal's old Jew characters going to make an appearance or what be Goldberg or like somebody like that. And then fucking right there, Billy crystal comes down this ladder like, okay, hold your horses, hold you. And he gives him some books on how to be a tooth fairy. And, and then he like turns into the tooth fairy randomly like ob, it, uh, you know, out in public in this wings just spurt out. I feel like I'm losing momentum

Speaker 3:          00:58:02       trying to get it. You've got me in a trend is you got me in a trance. That sounds ridiculous. It's really absurd, but when you have kids, you understand ridiculous. Keeps quiet, man.

Speaker 4:          00:58:13       It keeps moving, but there's no, there aren't a lot of dots connected. We were like, wait, how do we get from here? It's like, oh, you just needed to get from here to here.

Speaker 3:          00:58:20       So you just put some thing in the middle. Yeah. Yeah. It's really like, now I'm going to see it to be waiting for that. I wonder. We're waiting for the whole, Oh, it's renal. You doing something. I'm trying to open another root beer barrel, but I can't figure out how you silly silly dad can't figure. We got to change these microphones. These microphones are too. God Damn sensitive. You're doing a down by your deck and we were hearing it as if cracklin resume. I know. Sorry. These are the bags. The volcano bags I gave up on that volcano. Well, most people shouldn't be trying to open up our candy during a, what'd you say, Brian? That that kind of Mike would be worse though. Oh really? Yeah. Cause these are, you're supposed to talk into it. These are picking up every, here we go. That does at times a million.

Speaker 3:          00:59:03       No, no, no. It's less. That's less Brian. Those are more vocal miles. Yeah, it's less. No, we tried it. Remember it picked up way less ambient noise. That's our next move. As we expand, we're going to move this thing out into, I'm going to get an office space at the Ice House. Right? Well, we've got to do that too. We've got to do that too. But what we're to do with the ice houses, we want to set it up so the comics getting offstage and going onstage can have a little different podcasts, not my podcast, but we're going to call it like an evening at the ice house. Right. Habits. Just whatever comic is there, you know, within reason they hosted or whatever. They just figured out. It's just the reserve. Yeah. Brian's in town. He'll, he'll, he'll sit on it. Whoever the fuck is in town and we just keep rotating comics.

Speaker 3:          00:59:44       Like get off sick. Yeah, it'd be awesome. It'd be great for all of us. That'll be a lot of fun. That whole night with this stuff that you and hour talking about siding. It's great, right? We want to go there. There's a place, the ice house in Pasadena, it's this really cool old club. It's been around for like 35 years and they have this little tiny room. They just have like the 50th anniversary. That's insane. That's insane. 50 smothers brothers and shit performed there. There are a lot of albums recorded there, like if you're at a thrift store and go through old comedy albums, that's amazing. Pat's hall. It's a great, great club and there's two rooms. She was the big room, which is very small. It's only 185 people and then there's the, or somewhere around there, right? One 85 one 97 was a perfect size room by the way.

Speaker 3:          01:00:25       Amazing set up. It's amazing setup and then there's another room is really small. It's only like 85 people, 90 people. And we, we've been doing that. We've been doing subsets there and Brendan and I and Brian, Brian and one Friday out, magical came down and already went up. And you guys have one this Friday? Every Friday. Yeah. And uh, we're, we're going to start doing that on a regular basis and as soon as I'm done with this fear factor stuff, which should be pretty soon, then we're going to move forward in different dynamic podcast directions. So we'll call it a, an evening at the ice house or something along those lines we ever talked about that. Remember when we brought up how David Letterman social security number was on the wall and we went there the following day. Yeah. We don't know whether or not that really is still his social security number.

Speaker 3:          01:01:08       Will they change it? Like it got out there, they put it back up, they block it out. They made a copy of it and it looks like the idea that they're real one or they did something. It's gone now though. Well, we, we pointed it out to them. We're like, you know, you can see David Letterman social security number on this contract. And they were like, no way. Like yeah, there's a picture of his contract. Yeah, we paid him. Oh, okay. Near the bathroom. A couple of different ones. Yeah. And that one actually has a social security number on it. That's insane. It's ridiculous. Steals identity. Well that's what Brian or he did. He's trying to like, like viruses and shit. Like how I assume anybody who knows anything about computers can hack and all my shit. Cause I don't know anything. I'm really naive. I could do dumb shit, just trache shit. But there's kids right now that are growing up from the time they're little kids. They've been fucking with hacking into the registry and fucking with things and reading on forums and finding out how to do things and working on coding. And there's wizards out there, man. I know they speak a language. We can't even

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       fucking wrap our heads around. There was a documentary on one small area, I think it was a rush out. I forget what eastern bloc country it was, what they had. Um, this, uh, one town where they have a disproportionate amount of internet scammers and virus makers and people stealing credit card numbers in there. We're all just drive in Mercedes back at Fraley. Yeah. All these computer people, they just fucking hack the matrix. Found like, uh, an area like we're oil would come up drilled into it and the oil was coming up in there one spot. Ah, it's amazing, you know. Wow. I told just identity theft and shit and it was a lot of that going on for sure. There's a lot of, I mean, cyber crime. I would like to know the statistics of what, you know, what has happened since the Internet existed. Like it's crime up as crime down. What kind of crime is more prevalent now that there's a, you know, little online things that can rip people off?

Speaker 4:          01:03:12       Yeah. Probably some, like, I don't know. You're not leaving a paper trail, if anything. So if you just go in and move numbers from one place to him,

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       it just would scare the fucking shit out of me to think that you would have anything important on why, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:03:26       Yeah. I'm pretty, I mean, I guess that's one good thing of not really being a techie. Like I don't get excited about, I don't have anything. Somebody could steal my laptop tomorrow and they wouldn't really know any more about me than if they stole one of my notebook.

Speaker 1:          01:03:39       Yeah. I always look at websites that are up and I said, these are only up because someone didn't target you. That's it. Right. It's not like, oh, I could do anything about it. What are you going to do about it? You're not gonna do shit. It's like there's a, it's a wild west out there in some ways. I mean, they can track some people down if they're really sloppy and they find out the people that do certain things that shouldn't be doing, but for the most part it's, it's pretty fucking crazy, you know? Well, those guys like the anonymous and who laws sec those like they, I was pretty amused by what they were doing. Scary where it's like, oh fuck. It's like if they can fuck with Sony for like a week, what could they do to meet their, putting some of those dudes in jail though.

Speaker 1:          01:04:21       It'd be like, well that's the other thing you're going to get fucking, you don't get away with that kind of shit. This is going to be like a government agencies. It's going to be a bad ass documentary that we'll be able to watch and like 10 years. Like if you ever watched a documentary on the weather underground. Yeah, I saw radical hippie movement and the sixties wanted to get rid of the government and it's fascinating fucking documentary. That's what this is going to be like. You know, a decade from now when we're even more oppressed, we'll look back at the time that the internet and it almost rose before the Institute of the censorship on the Internet, that would really lock everything down. That would either lock everything down or cause a civil war. It'd be that would be the final push. If the government regulated the Internet, the way the FCC regulates television or the way they regulate radio or anything.

Speaker 1:          01:05:09       If they're like told you what, you couldn't, couldn't put out that Ooh, because that's where it all got out of hand. Everything was doing great until the and the nineties came along and all of a sudden people were getting their information from different places. They were getting it from a fucking computer with that Wiki leaks guy. I mean, aren't they essentially like, it's like you can't really put whatever you want out there while they lock that guy up and they gave that guy some sort of a house arrest deal. We had a show up at the police station and check himself in every day. And from what I understand, he's trying to fight, being extradited. He doesn't want to have to leave the country, but I don't, I have no idea what the fuck happened. But I do think that, I don't believe that this would happen this way if he wasn't that guy.

Speaker 1:          01:05:53       I think it seems pretty obvious it's someone's targeting him. Oh yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't, doesn't seem kosher. There may, you know that this what I mean, I don't believe she's even saying it was really rape. It was by some really broad definition of rape, like regret afterwards or something like that. The feeling of being deceived or something along those lines, you know, changed her mind. Like how when he was finishing up or whatever, something along those lines. Right. And he was already inside of her and he didn't want to stop. There's already like on the run like he was already wanted and you know when all that happened I thought wasn't. Yeah, yeah. It's just fascinating how, how you know you're not allowed to release information and less your, the New York Times or CNN or, or an established news organizations slash corporation that we can trust.

Speaker 1:          01:06:42       You're not allowed to just release that. So because like the, the real question would come up with what would the New York Times do if it was given that information. If it was given all the wikileaks documents, if someone came along and said, listen, here's a gigantic file. You're going to fucking shit your pants. This is all a bunch of shit that I took from, you know, US data banks and it's going to, it's going to blow the whole on this whole Iraq war thing and there's a lot of things in it. It's going to really disturb the shit out of people when they find out about real relationships between different foreign countries and different things that we're doing and all sorts of different parts of the world. What do you think, what happened? I don't think that would get released through a a real thing.

Speaker 1:          01:07:20       The New York Times would go, get the fuck out of here. We're not releasing this. Probably could give it back to the government, I think. Yeah, there was, it wasn't their property is that there's a, is that a law? I think that they're dealing with like a business, so we don't want to fuck it. Would it be stolen information? So there it would be illegal contraband or something along those lines because it's top secret. I think the government would just come and confiscate it. Somebody would call somebody and the government and be like, you have a lot or sending someone right down and then just like, does that ever going to change? Is that ever going to get to the point where that doesn't happen anymore? Is that like a remnant of the old days? That's like slowly starting to work its way out to the point where you know it's police aren't going to have like that kind of absolute power.

Speaker 1:          01:08:03       Is that possible? Uh, I don't think so. Really? No. It's gonna get worse. Right? Is it get worse like the future, you know, if you like, if you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot standing on somebody's neck forever. Something like that. Oh, Orwell's bitch rag I was Orwell to you are fucking killing me with this boot and neck thing. Why don't you just go to a massage parlor? You know, just a wonderful feeling of warm oil on your balls and just, ah, just sweet release. You don't have to think about x well needed. It's not all boots and next you fucking dramatic cock sucker. I mean, he wrote animal farm in 1984 oh, he's brilliant. Like the forties when I say dramatic cock sucker, I mean it was all due respect. He, he actually predicted a lot of shit that went down that, you know, is essentially science fiction at the time. Yeah, it's amazing. You know, amazing Internet essentially. I mean you could argue that, you know, that screen that everybody had in their apartments in 1984 1984 supposed to be the year where this, this story took place. Is that what the premises, isn't it amazing when you look back like on space 1999 they thought that by 1999 and we'd be like fucking living on other planets.

Speaker 3:          01:09:24       Yeah. Thousand 10 you know, 2010 was the year they made contact. Right. In 2001 a space odyssey. That's like 2010 they thought this is ridiculously far in the future. This is so far in the future that we're never going to have to worry about that. We'll just make our money now and we'll probably be right when 2001 Roosevelt, nothing. No, no fucking space travel at all. I don't know though, man. Like I, I was at, that's the one area though where we grossly overestimated how far we would advance space truthers unmanned space shit out there and the shore. But there's this space station with people on it right now, but space in 98 99 they were living on fucking, there were shows like Jetson's cars and yeah, I mean why didn't they have battles with like other like fucking aliens and Shit? I'm pretty sure they did probably. Oh yeah, no, that was the future. That's a prince song bitch.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       What's a ridiculous space in 1999 those smart cars are pretty futuristic looking. Well, you know Obama just passed some new legislation saying that by, I think it's 2025 that the average miles per gallon of a car, it has to be some insane number. It's like 50 plus miles per gallon and that's what's going to be the standard average per corporation. Like you could have one stupid car. They're like, you can have one Mustang gt with a fucking giant engine that eats gas. As long as you had a slew of electric cars, got like 90 miles to the gallon and sort of balanced it out for the most, like, yeah. It's kind of interesting. But did you ever see that documentary who killed the electric car? Yes, I did. Oh, it was pretty interesting. Fascinating. I mean, they had a pretty decent electric carts back in [inaudible] 86

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       yeah, and then they reap. They just took them all and destroy them. That's fishy. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:11:21       Well, I mean, conspiracies are real man, you know, and on the smartest men in the room. Do you ever watch that documentary? Can conspiracies are fucking real. Okay. Yeah, they definitely went to war because I'm looking on space 1999 and Wikipedia is that a show is shooting lasers at them? Yeah. Space 1999 you didn't know that was a show. I thought maybe it was like, oh, what I was saying that it was a show that I used to watch when I was a kid. Oh No, I thought it was fine. It was a moderate on that and oh my God, the idea really was, they were so optimistic. This is how crazy they work. Cause we had just gone to the moon, you know, supposedly, and it's 1975 so did they just stop the Apollo program and 72 so in 1999 they thought we would be fucking going to war, but there was only 20 years. There were only guessing. 2124 years in the future, 24 years. They thought, we'll dude, we finally landed on the moon. Remember when we invented cars? Now look what what we drive. They finally ended up in the moon. Listen Dude, by the time 1999 rolls around, we're going to be going to battle and space. It's fucking people who are living in uniforms. They had outfits and shit like that was the other hallmark of the future. Everybody wore the same clothes. That's how you knew it was the future. Future or aliens. You know, they're all wearing the same clothes.

Speaker 2:          01:12:32       Yeah. Well, I mean Walmart,

Speaker 3:          01:12:35       I know that that is a fascinating thing.

Speaker 2:          01:12:38       Matching silver jumpsuits. Most people were getting their clothes from the same four places, probably old navy. It's amazing that they missed so badly. 1999 they were so optimistic, you know, 2001 so optimistic. Know a lot of things. Got It right though. That, that old a ride at Walt Disney world. Uh, you know, the, in the future where it was like a thing where you just sat there and watched like the, what the future is supposed to be like, if you look at it now, it's pretty, pretty crazy. How similarity do you remember alien? You remember

Speaker 3:          01:13:10       Strauma when they're, when they're in their ship and he's working on the computer, it looks so fucking bad. Oh yeah. It's funny. I love that when Shit computer, you have a piece of shit with it's green fucking letters. It's green lit up letters. Oh yeah. Yeah. Look so stupid in the printer paper still has the holes on the side of the year 3000 out. He didn't even have a cell phone. Right. He had walkie talkies within the stromal the fucking computer. Man. They missed so badly. But there's like now we're at a point where we can imitate. You predict things a little like I think, you know, it seems like a lot of crews. What was that minority or that shit sort of shit and other movies too. So maybe that's the way things were headed. When I swiped my iPhone, when I'm going through like contacts or when I'm going through a email, I think I think of it that way. Like this is amazing. These things are amazing. Sliding this thing back and forth with my fingers. And then iPads, the same thing. I read books, the IPAD and

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       we haven't turned the page. Just slowly slide your finger and slowly curls the page over and then enrolls in the next page. Like, Whoa, this is, this is some freaky fucking futuristic shit and we're getting it right. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:14:25       Now like I went to a concert a couple of weeks ago and you just look, I went to smoke a cigarette and was like looking at the whole crowd in the Hollywood bowl and you just see all these little light up things. Yeah. And it's like, that's kind of crazy man. Like it, it happens so quickly. Really 10 years ago you didn't see,

Speaker 1:          01:14:42       I was typing an email today and I was on the iPhone and I f I just was just thinking about how crazy it is and I could just touch these little spots, knows pretty much what letter you're trying to say. And then you can just swipe your finger and it's spins through all your pictures and spins through all your music. Like this is nuts man. This is so specific to its so like

Speaker 2:          01:15:03       Joe, you got God to try out this thing called Spotify. It's kind of like rhapsody city. It's an all you can eat any kind of music, you know for $10 you get all the music you want. Pretty much thing. So for $10 one time fee, no, every month, $10 a month, $10 a month. I mean he was, but you sit there and you just have access to pretty much any song ounces mine. But it is, I don't really understand the service but yeah, you can like $10 a month. You could put it in like rolling stones and every rolling stones song will come up and you can download. But what's called, what's cool is it whoever has it connected to their Facebook, like a lot of your friends, like Dunkin is a good example is you're going to see his whole entire music, like what he likes, what he listens to.

Speaker 2:          01:15:44       So you can just like, if you're looking for new music is basically what it takes. And he just like, look at all this music. It's pretty cool. I would try it out. You can download their music too and you could also download it onto your phone and has that album. I want it. And you can put it on an iPhone. He put it on an iPod and you kill what the thing is the Spotify, it's like your iTunes, but it's held at some servers in a way. But I think there's a way to also download the tracks. So like if you have offline mode, so like if you just pick what things you want, it'll download the tracks onto your iPhone. That's annoying. I would want to, I don't, I'm Todd. I wanted on my hard drive. I want a physical, I think you can do that.

Speaker 2:          01:16:22       Really? Yeah. I think once you do that, yeah you can put it on your download or your iPad. Your phone doesn't have to be connected to the Internet to use it. Uh, no, you could download it. You have to be connected to the Internet at some point. You know what I mean? Yeah. To get it right. Right. But you just like refreshing it just, it just saves it onto your device and it is just like downloading it to a CD and I think I might have some kind of a time like fit. It only lasts a certain amount of time, like it has really see, oh no, no, no, no, no. I think that's how it works. Did I think it has to check for subscription once in a while or something? Oh, that's annoying. But uh, so as long as your prescriptions up, but you know, it's good to get a car driving around going. It's all annoying

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       man. When you got it, you got it right. I, I keep an iPhone or an iPod always charged up. I always listened to in my car. I hardly ever listen to the radio anymore. I just listen to my Ipod, know connects to my car. It's fucking, it's amazing. You can just choose whatever music, but all I have to do is just like sync it back and forth between my computers. I don't want to go home and then just fucking register and pay 10 bucks a month. I buy the CD on Itunes, I buy the mp3s. That's good for me. I don't want any of that craziness.

Speaker 4:          01:17:38       I have satellite in my car and I like it because I've been turned onto a lot of new music that I wouldn't have heard. There's one station in particular like I like that and d kind of rock shit. I like what type of road shit? Like indie, like I like nineties Indie rock a lot and like, you know like pavement, Shit like that. Sing me a song. Ah, well I mean, I don't know like dinosaur jr you familiar with any of that? I wasn't in the scene.

Speaker 1:          01:18:04       A radio station wantsW , a f and Boston and um, the, uh, one of the dudes from dinosaur Jr, what does it Maskus what does it say? Mass Mass just sang a song like right there and it was a real creepy like acoustic song. And I'm like, wow, what a weird dude this guy is. I bet this guy. Some fucking crazy, creepy, weird genius dude.

Speaker 4:          01:18:25       They are, I mean that's a certain genre. Um, like uh, well like Nirvana came out of that too. Yeah. It's like the Melvins and fucking right,

Speaker 1:          01:18:34       but is nirvana, if you talk about like that kind of music you want, that you like, if you say Nirvana, did they think, oh, you're all mainstream?

Speaker 4:          01:18:41       Um, no, no, because I mean their vinyl like naturally happened that came from like, they want it to be as big as sonic youth or dinosaur junior and just, they just wrote songs way too good and fucking just got huge.

Speaker 1:          01:18:54       They reinvented things. Hey, change the format, everything they fucked hairbands and vanilla ice and MC Hammer. Those guys were big ox. I owned it on. But yeah, like where'd this come from? Is All this truth and pain and reality. Dude screaming, rape me, raped me again. It's a great song. Oh yeah. I mean, rape me is a great fucking song. And it played on the radio. You know, just, just wrap your head around that. Imagine trying to put that out today. Rape me. A song called rape me. People would freak the fuck out. They wouldn't want to play that on the radio. Too many people would be complaining. This guy went on stage or a in the UFC this weekend, uh, there was a controversy. This, um, these two fighters went out to a controversial songs and one of them was, he went out to smack my bitch up. Okay. And so this writer was complainants that that was, yes, they wrote an article and Yahoo about how it was insensitive to have that song. And that song promotes violence against women and Jess, that people might find it offensive. And then the other son they complained about was the scorpions rocky, like a hurricane. Because obviously we're in New Orleans and New Orleans,

Speaker 4:          01:20:06       but meanwhile you watch them two

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       guys beating the shit out of each other and when that song came on, I don't think people thought that I didn't, that I didn't even, I didn't even assume that action until I read the article. Conti little writer fucking monitor cause a stir. Do you know how funny it is? And you just said that cause I got in trouble for calling is very writer Conti. Really? Yeah. People are like, you shouldn't use that word. Sounds like content. I didn't, I didn't, I did not inform you of this beforehand. We had no discussion. There was no coercion on your part. Nope. Ladies and gentlemen, nature finds its fucking course. She'll the other one was the, the scorpions. Rocky like a hurricane. When I heard that song I didn't think, oh no he did. And a hurricane hit here and devastated the population. That's just thought. I thought, oh it was a fucking jam.

Speaker 3:          01:20:52       Yeah. That's a good thing to listen to before you're going to go get in a fistfight. Yeah. It's a fucking good song, man. You can't not have that good song anymore. It's not responsible for the hurricane. Okay. Now if he played like walking on sunshine by Katrina and the waves that then that would be like, wait, why is he fucking playing this? This doesn't go along with this sport. I wonder if you'd be allowed to do that. And one of Dana [inaudible] cause he approves every song he approved smacked. By the way, smacking my bitch. I was one like all these awards, it's like, you know it's in Charlie's angels smack my bishop was in Charlie's angels. How does that go? It's like, like complaining, smacked up big bit.

Speaker 3:          01:21:31       It's like this crazy like techno. It's a really famous song. He never heard it before. I probably have the names just not ringing a bell. Is it like it is the chemical brothers and I am familiar with it. I have like all their stuff. I guess just hilarious though that someone would complain about that. Like that seems like kind of silly, you know? Of course. What is it? Anything about anything silly. We nerfing the fucking world. What is going on Brendan Walsh. Now, I asked you this because you're a a comic and you're also a fucking, you know, you, you go deep, you push buttons, you know, you're uh, you talk about crazy shit on stage. It's fun. It's my kind of comedy good. You know, when, when I saw you the other night at the ice house, I was like, thank God there's still guys tilling that laddering, man.

Speaker 3:          01:22:17       It's true. You, you been really dirty. The new stuff's kind of go deeper. I was there. Why? I mean, I look, I, I'm a huge fan of standup comedy. He's still, but it's not enough. People are doing crazy shit. I not enough. Not Enough people are going to the deep end of the pool, you know, there's not enough people are just making fucked up things really funny. You know? And there's a few, there's a few, but you, you were nailing a bunch of, I don't want to do any of your material, but you were nailing a bunch of left and right. I was like, this is really funny stuff and I enjoyed it that Taso does comedy supposed to be kind of fucked up man? The best stuff when you've got a couple of drinks in you. The best stuff like you know like Nick Dipaolo is one of my all time favorite guys to watch. When I got a little buzz on cause he would have

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       fake mean shit. I mean it was me and it was a but B. He's not a mean guy. He's a nice guy. He's a great guy. He's just fucking, that's the style of comedy and he's going after it and it's, and it's especially when you've got a buzz on, it's a fucking great art form and by people complaining about a dude coming out to rock you like a hurricane and by people trying to take some of the flavor out of, out of, out of the world tone things down there, they're ruining everything that's cool about life.

Speaker 4:          01:23:35       Yeah. There's this subtlety.

Speaker 1:          01:23:38       Yeah. Knowing what's right and what's wrong and knowing when, when to let things go and when to do this. This is a big fucking, it shows a big, it's like prioritization. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:23:49       If you're going to sit down and fucking like, you know, police Wikipedia on your fucking own time. Just because somebody adds, Jerry Seinfeld's started directing adult films after whatever, you know, like there's somebody who's, you know, policing Craig's list for like people trying to be funny or gross on it. Like fuck's wrong with you man. I like the prior like there's a million other things you could be doing right now.

Speaker 1:          01:24:13       Yeah. And that needs to be illuminated, right? It needs to be pointed at it. Like why are you doing this?

Speaker 4:          01:24:18       Well, because like usually what they're doing, I mean I'm just speaking from experience of like I had a fake Yelp account where I would just complain about businesses. Like I took businesses that had like, there was a car wash called the handy j and I wrote the review. Like I was expecting a hand job at the end of the car wash and it was blatant false advertising. And there's a restaurant called the happy ending on sunset. So either way I was just all written by this naive guy who was in a shitty marriage and he was just looking for a hand job. And none of these places hand jobs and his pink Taco place in Arizona. Like some guy beats the shit out of him cause he tries to get his daughter to fuck. I mean it was just a silly thing I was doing, but he got taken down because I guess somebody you know, complained or was monitoring Yelp and I lost all my fucking, uh, he didn't write hand John Anywhere again. No, I was like, I, that's before I even knew that you could do a screen grab. Like I just, I think I,

Speaker 1:          01:25:17       well wasn't there a thing that you could do on the Internet, Brian, where you could go back in time? I go, yeah. Not just that. Oh, you could go and, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:25:26       Uh, yeah, but that, that, that probably is not on there. I don't know. It was a couple of years ago. And how does that work? What it does is it's, it's just a program, you know, like a spider or a Bot that takes screenshots and kind of saves websites, kind of archives of websites called the Internet archive. And it works all stored at uh, I dunno, I think it's connected with some museum or something like that or some kind of weird thing. I'm like, hmm, need a base. But it, it, it does, it works like 70% of the time. Like you can go to your old website from like 91, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:25:59       Well website 91 or 92 or whatever,

Speaker 2:          01:26:02       98 and uh, you

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       could see it and some things will work. Some photos we'll work some things. Wow. You know, that's, that's wild. Yeah, it is weird. I Pepsi Spice Projects on there somewhere. Yeah. That's hilarious. Brian did a thing where he pretended that he was eat nothing but Pepsi spice for like months and he got Pepsis vice.com it was a titan new type of Pepsi did they had Pepsi spice.com he registered it because they were fucking slow on the take and they didn't realize the power of the Internet. It's the only writes his blog detailing these horrific fucking physical ailments that are occurring to shedding. So just eating nothing but Pepsi place. What was it? Spicy Pepsi. Ginger. Remember that shit at all. It was horrible. Awful was like thanksgiving. Do you remember new coke? They tried to farm member. New coach. Yeah. It was classic. It was like, what are you doing?

Speaker 1:          01:26:54       And then they don't do that anymore. Right now they got rid of Newco. Yeah, a new coach. This was w it was a slow introduction, you know, was like, it was like the metric system. They tried to shove it up and then they pulled it back there. All right. We give up, give up. We go up. New Coke just tasted like Pepsi. Do you think there's a different type of person that drinks coke rather than Pepsi? Fuck yeah man. I Hate Pepsi. Like drinking Pepsi is kind of the same. Diet Pepsi better than Diet Coke. Zero rows do dumber people like Pepsi or Smarter, Dumber Drinking Soda on a regular basis. I bet they are smart people. I probably smoked cigarettes. We, this guy is Daniel Pinchbeck. This brilliant author told me just quit smoking cigarettes. I was like, what the fuck you want, but you just quit to write tough man.

Speaker 1:          01:27:42       When did you quit? I'm flake. On my third day. So that's it. Not even, I quit for a year a couple of years ago and I smoked a joint with my friend, rolled a joint with tobacco in it and it fucking, it's crazy once you have that little taste that was like, hey, wrote me a cigarette. Like a couple of days later I was staying with them in upstate New York after Montreal and so it was kind of on vacation and that vacation mode and was like, oh, I have a couple of smokes until when I get back to La, I'll stop and went down to the city for a week and bombed a couple cigarettes. But cigarettes are like 15 bucks a pack there. So I was like, I'm just going to buy a pack and you know, give them the people and I'll smile either way. It just snowballed into, is that the only physical addiction you've ever had?

Speaker 1:          01:28:26       Um, Cock Brian. Yeah man, that's rude. That's rude behavior that you're fucking going out on the Internet. Other people are going to hear this, that to slander or liable and whatever it is in your mouth and cry. Okay. Listen, you took it too far back? No, I've never had any real like, you know, I like to drink and stuff, but you've never had like a, a physical craving like that before we got attached to it. Cigarettes or alcohol or cigarettes is the only one like that. I mean how bad is alcohol? Have you ever gotten to a I need a drink every day stage? No, no, no. It's cigarettes. My put, what I was trying to get at was like cigarettes are, they're torn and really tough and, and, and much stronger. They have a much stronger pull than a lot of the other things to get people.

Speaker 2:          01:29:13       Well because you don't get anything out of cigarettes to like cigarettes. If they got you high or drunk wake your poison, like do you get pissed off with those people that fucking telling you they can smoke and they don't ever get hooked because there's a lot of people that do though whenever I want. I think there are different kinds of, like I do lean more towards like an addictive like you know like if there's something that's kind of fun I'll like, my impulse is to overdo it. I mean I have self control and other things.

Speaker 1:          01:29:49       That's why you're funny. Almost all comics have that. Every conflict of interest. It's really funny cause impulsive Kreischer he's really impulsive. Brian Keaulana really impulsive. Joey's impulses. Fuck. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:29:59       I'm glad that they're still improving the technology of a cigarette though. They have camel crushes now, which are so awesome. Like you're smoking a cigarette and you're like, you know what, I'm bored with this cigarette. Then you just crushed a filter and we releases more chemicals under the filter. Then it tastes like mint. So now I'm in Boston but it's a little chemical. Bollier

Speaker 1:          01:30:18       wait a minute, wait a minute. So you can change your experience. You go from a regular or at any time back and forth? No, no. Just one menthol you or has this available to it? The whole pack. The whole pack. Yeah. They have little spearmint balls and I've got to find out that that gives cancer cancer. Yeah, definitely give your cancer

Speaker 2:          01:30:40       Batman, but once you get out of the woods, when I quit a couple of years ago, I mean I went like a year and it's been a year now that I spend smoking again. Uh, once you get out, or at least once I got out of the woods, like after a couple of weeks I was like, okay, fine. I don't need this. But then really? Yeah, I really didn't. I was pretty cocky about it. I was like, I'm never going to stick another one of those things in my mouth and I could have, I would hang out at bars. I'd go out with my friends when they went to smoke, I was like, I'm done. I don't smoke. I read this book that helped a lot. I mean, granted I'm smoking again, but because, well, but I mean, under my circumstances though, I kind of didn't really do it by choice. Like I smoked this joint that had tobacco and I knew I tasted it right away, but I was like, ah, I could fuck it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:22       I'm going to say this is like, it's been 11 months since I had a cigarette. I can have a pop tobacco demon talking to you fucked up. So it is the nicotine demon. Well that's the way the guy see that's the way he describes it in the book is like you're just feeding this little monster that needs to be fed over. Like it's a very short, I even heard that like after CCI or whatever you get to like it starts burning fat that has nicotine still in it and so you start getting cravings again after like a certain period. Love

Speaker 1:          01:31:47       is bullshit. Someone said that too and I thought that sounded silly. It seems kind of silly. It might be though. I mean I know marijuana stays in your system. I think if you're like really fat and he gets super high, we can stay in your system for weeks. Yeah. It stays in your fat styles, right? Yeah. So if that, I mean, if it's there, maybe, I mean it's obviously the grip of that stuff is way stronger than, I mean there's people that say they get addicted to marijuana, but there's nothing like the feeling that I don't think that they get with cigarettes. They don't need to smoke it all day low. It's more of a habitual, I think, marijuana to you get, you get hooked on the ritual of it. I also have this shit. Yeah, I'm willing to, I'm willing to believe that everybody has a different biochemistry and some people can get physically addicted to almost anything because I think people gets physically addicted to sugar. You know, some people that like have crazy sugar fixations where it's an addiction, you know, so they could get addicted to marijuana, but nothing like the addiction to cigarettes. That is one of the weirdest ones, man. It's like when you see people, like when Brian, when Brian started smoking cigarettes again, it's almost like I have to accept that he got bit by a vampire, you got

Speaker 2:          01:32:57       cigarettes, makes me want to have a cigarette. Oh Dude. Are you ever going to quit or you just, yeah. Oh really? You're ready to given today's been rough plaza, but no, I should, I've just been, you know, I keep fucking want in line, but it's like, yeah, it's that, what is it? Tell, explain it to me.

Speaker 1:          01:33:14       What is it? What does the, what's the pull as a person who's never, it's a, I've had a cigarette or two in the day, but I've never got it. Yeah, it's just, it seems, it's sounds like a really good idea. Like I just want to kind of fucking smoke a cigarette and there is a little bit of a, yeah, a little lake.

Speaker 2:          01:33:30       You know what it's like when you go and you're hungry is fuck and you like the movie theater and he smelled that popcorn and you're like, fuck, I need that popcorn. No, there can be, it's gotta be way crazier than that. Cause I can pass it down. No, because you can sit there and not get popcorn. But if you sit there and keep on smelling it over and over again, I mean he'll drive me crazy. Don't you still think of popcorn specifically? Think of like you're really hungry and you smell like fucking hell.

Speaker 1:          01:33:57       Fogo de Chao and the guy keeps coming back with the meat and I have my thing flipped over to read. Is it that good?

Speaker 2:          01:34:03       It's, yeah, it's, it's more than that. It just like, we smell like, like somebody cooking cookies or brownies in your house and you're like, oh, I need that fucking cookie now. It's like that. That's what the yearnings kind of like, like it's something where it's like, oh, when you get it, when you finally give into the beast and you're a bitch up and you suck it in, what does that like? That completely goes away. That stress. It goes away and then, but then I guess

Speaker 1:          01:34:25       no, mine's immediately going to be followed by guilt. Yeah, but you don't do, you don't think, okay, here I am. I'm poisoning

Speaker 2:          01:34:32       dude. Oh God, the thoughts I fucking go through my head. That's so dumb. I think about it like I don't think about when I'm doing it. Like I think about it the next morning went on, did

Speaker 1:          01:34:43       you start smoking a pipe? Yeah. Smells better. Tobacco, maybe you could smoke a pipe and be okay. Just, you just got to stop doing it because they're both junkies. You

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       guys can't help it, man. But you know, this is like, you know, yeah, it's my third day. So it's pretty, it's awesome. No, you see that's, I'm not a big daytime smoker. Like I don't, I use it for a lot of smoke during the day. If I'm with lunch. So you don't eat, like, if I'm really hungry, I'm just too busy. I'll smoke a cigarette and that kills it for another 30 minutes. Oh my God. That's so gross. Yeah. That's gotta be terrible for you. But I do, if I'm around people, like I was staying with a buddy of mine in Austin and he wakes up in the morning and has a cup of coffee and a cigarette and I would do that. Oh, well it's just, it's more like, oh, again, like when in Rome, like, okay, but I wouldn't do that on like give you a crazy head rush was I do for you?

Speaker 2:          01:35:42       You know, I'm not crazy about that. Uh, that Combo first thing in the morning? No, it makes my stomach whereby shitty. I know, but even before they have food. Yeah. No, I think, I think a lot of people are really, what's the big deal? I don't know. It just goes together. Perfect. It's the taste of the coffee and the tasty over figure shit out from that combination. Is that a combination where you start your day out with a new perspective? You get a little boost from the cigarette. Little boost from the coffee at the same time. It's kind of like a kickstart. Amazing, amazing shit. Nobody ever talks about getting rid of cigarettes. They're like little, little evil demons to the, they should be fuck elected themselves. Illegal. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing when you think about all the shit that is illegal. You think of the actual numbers that they're doing.

Speaker 2:          01:36:27       We were talking, I was talking to Henry Phillips about the, I don't know if you guys know Henry, but a guy who played guitar on Stan hopes and we were just like, you know, Kinda drunk talking on the phone one night and we were both talking about how like, God, what are we still smoking? You know, cause he smoked cigarettes too. And uh, he was saying like, yeah, if like an alien life form was like looking down on us and they'd be like, wait, so this fucking thing kills you know, like a million people a year and it's not illegal. Like why don't they just make it illegal? And it's like, well cause these five guys are getting really rich off of it. And he's like, when the aliens would be like, well why not just kill those five guys and save like the millions and just make it like, it seems like a no brainer, but it's like, yeah, that's just the way everything's fucked up.

Speaker 2:          01:37:14       It's like, yeah, why not just kill the five guys who are fucking everything up for everyone? Well there's two arguments. Is one the freedom of x or you know, the freedom argument where you're, you're free to do whatever you want to do, even if it's heroin if you want to, but why can't you? Because it's illegal. But should we allow more things to be legal? That's the other question. It's like we have enough. No, I'm saying make cigarettes. It would be hard because a lot of people say they want to be able to have a fucking cigarette. I know, but I think a lot of people want to fuck 10 year olds, two cigarettes. They legalized fucking 10 year olds. That might be way more addictive than cigarettes. I've never done it. The is

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       connecting to you. You fucking 10 year olds is you interfering with other people's lives. You're making your own. You have your own personal freedom to go and to this obviously being, I know of course, but it's a weird thing that you want to say that it is illegal because I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want and then if you want to smoke cigarettes and they, you know, they're addicted. I think we should look down horribly on the people who sell them. You know, just like any person selling any fucking deadly drug. I mean especially things that just, what are those 599 fucking ingredients that they've added to cigarettes to make them more addictive? Like what a crazy combo they've put together. Smoke those American spirits almost my whole career they have the, their whole thing is, it's 100% additive free tobacco, like whole foods, cigarettes. Is it less addictive? Nicotine's pretty addicted to nicotine. Nine itself is addictive enough and all the $500 shit is like

Speaker 2:          01:38:55       to make it, it's like, like what they do to food at Mcdonald's. Like it's designed to have to burn a certain way for the ash to be shaped

Speaker 1:          01:39:05       this certain way. Do you, um, do you notice the difference between the, the cigarette experience from Lego, the natural ones and the ones like the cool lights or,

Speaker 2:          01:39:15       yeah, as well as the different, what do you, you spoke about camel camel lights, but when I decided a really strong one isn't it? Campbell's really strong American spirits actually to me feel like they do more damage just because it's a thicker, they last longer, they last long. Like I'll smoke like, you know, American spirits the next day I'm coughing up black shit. Like I feel like focus many of them. I mean that's, you can't smoke as many or like I always find so

Speaker 1:          01:39:41       when z it's so ridiculous. Like how do you take your poison, uh, you know, you gotta be careful with the natural poison. Natural poisons. Hard to swallow.

Speaker 2:          01:39:49       Well I think it's just, it's a no, you see, I don't think it's hard to swell. I just don't think you want it as frequently. Like the other ones burn faster and like diet pop you can, you can just keep getting knocked down to camels for like one of camels used to have no filter. They are filled. They still have, they all, all cigarettes have like no filter and filter like lucky strikes, you know, come wherever it doesn't matter. Well they have some morrow. Yeah, they have non unfiltered Marlboros too. I don't know if they stole mine. I don't know if the camel, no filters. Awesome. No, I know that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:40:19       What is, what is that all about? What's the non, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:40:22       that's like some dude who's a fucking rockabilly shit. He going to the nth degree to fucking maintain. Why else are you smoking lucky strikes except for the package. It looks cool and goes good with your fucking bowling shirt with flags on it. Like a grease back hair.

Speaker 1:          01:40:41       You're fucking tattoo of a howling cartoon dog. I don't want to give any more descriptions cause has got, I don't get punched in the face of one of those guys. Know what? I'm an author and there's those girls that have that very specific to those files, but bro ask or you were talking about that? That's crazy. In Austin like yeah. Yeah. They all dress like or some shit. Yeah, they seem is roller derby girls. They're all cut from the same cloth. He went, the fuck is this longing for the style path that everybody has? I don't know. I have a joke about it where I say I love Roller Derby. I've never seen it, but I liked that exist because it cuts down on all the crappy girl bands. It would be around otherwise some attention. It's like, yeah, don't start a band dude. Yeah, dude, that fucking do bro.

Speaker 1:          01:41:30       Lasker, uh Oh, that's fun. Or Roller Derby. Have a friend from the message board that's in a roller derby thing. Vicky, from the message board. Well it's, it's just a joke, but she's her. She's a nice girl, but she gave me a roller derby girl tee shirt or wear it. Oh yeah, no, it's a cool thing. Like Roller Derby girl tee shirt.

I work all day doing fear factor. I'm out in the fucking hot sun all day. That shit cooks your brain. You can drink a lot of water and rehydrating helps, but it makes you really stupid.
