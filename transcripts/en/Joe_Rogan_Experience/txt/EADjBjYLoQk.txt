Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Changed my life. Five, four, three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Yes. Dan Dodi. Yes, we're live. What's up brother? How are you man? Good to see Ya. Good to see you too man. So, uh, for people don't know. Uh, I met Dan way back in 2012 does, that seems like a long time ago now. It seems like, uh, at least half of my life, which is not even close to, is that true? I mean why is it like five years? It was five years ago. Yeah, I thought a half years ago. Well that was back when it was October of 2012. I thought there was only two months left in the world cause I thought the Mayan calendar was correct and it was December 21st, 2012 was going to end the world. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       So yeah. So you fucked off and went to Montana to go on a boat ride with us. Yeah, we took a, we took a canoe down the Missouri River. That was fucking awesome, man. Isn't that wild? It's one of my favorite trips ever. Was cold, really cold, like not fun. Cold. It was cold. That gets sucked. But once he got moved and it was fine, you know, and I, I learned about Merino wool. That was the important, there was an important lesson like the first light Merino wool like that people don't know if you're ever in a cold area. It's so important that you have a base layer of Merino wool cause that shit gets wet and you stay warm. Even if you sweat in it, you stay warm and calf as much as, as the synthetic versions at all. It's weird like some people really liked synthetics in some weird way like use them or did you, do you have I have this, I smelled terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       So you actually don't care. I like them both but I just, you know, working with those guys for so long and, and firstlight I got used to it. I like it. I like it. But I use synthetics for 10 years before that and I mean I didn't smell good but didn't really care. A lot of mountaineering people like some synthetics because they dry quicker. Yeah. But I feel like the, one of the best benefits of the wall is that when it is wet, it's still retains your warmth. And I don't mind being a little moist. Well, the synthetics will keep you warm too when they're wet. Just it's slightly different value. Like cotton will not right it all night, but it's synthetic like a kathleen that Patagonia is, is there other things? They also will, they won't, they won't kill you. Um, but yeah. Uh, the, the Marino has some other better qualities.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       Yeah. Well the stink things huge because I fuck it smelled terrible. That was a fun trip, man. That was actually the first episode of that show that I, um, that I fully kind of shot and directed myself. So that was kind of a big stage from, it was fun. Yeah. I just basically hung out with Kalyn two per week. Will you have, when you have Cowan, when Collin has a, like a captive audience, he's the funniest man alive. I will never forget these things. I won't share them. Let's go ahead. I these scenes from that campfire, do you remember the ravine calmer? Oh, I remember, I remember him taking a shit. Literally 10 feet from our campfire is asked, sticking out and we put a flag in it. I took pictures of it and how that shit that we put it in aluminum flag on it and stuck in there.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       I've never touched another man's shit other than his, I tried to set up a hunt for myself last year and the brakes and it just ended up didn't happening. But uh, it's one of my favorite places. It's so lonely out there, but so amazing. That area is so, it's such a perfect place to introduce count and I to the world of hunting because it's so wild with multifaceted too. You have a lot of history there. You have the, yeah. You know, it's, it's one of those areas where it's a complete wilderness experience cause you're on the water right there. You weren't, we're not crossing roads like we got dropped off at the end of a road and floated to basically the next row down the river, which is a big deal. We floated 40 miles down over the course of, what was it? Six days is one of my, one of these bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:03:43       Yeah. That one right there. That's the buck right there. Hey Buddy. Hey Fella. That's a different time. That was in Wisconsin. That was one where it was constant, that video that you just put up. But um, when we did do that, man, it was a, that was where Lewis and Clark had made some stops expedition. And that's where one of the coolest things about doing it with Rinella, cause he knows so much about the history of the United States and the, the settling of the United States and also the Nez perce Indian stories that he would tell us. Oh yeah, he can touch shit years. Yeah. And that's when I heard the story about the, what the real story, the original story about the Leonardo Dicaprio movie. The revenant. Like what really happened? Oh, he told her to a movie. Okay. Yeah. He told me that story. The actual story about the guy that got left behind and crawled back many, many miles.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       What's the guy's name? I don't remember the actual guy's name, but there's so much they made up in the movie. It's just to kind of brutal. Yeah. It was a freaky movie. It wasn't pretty. The grizzly bear attack. Yeah. It was a real freaky thing. The real grizzly bear attack. So man, I bet the real grizzly just kind of swatted that dude once and then just he fell down and it left him alone. Why do you think that? Cause that thing would have torn to pieces. It was a giant bear too. And I just fuck bears, man. They scare the shit out of me. I wonder really the average length of time of a bear attack? Like how long has it lasts? Two seconds. 30 seconds. Well the um, that movie grizzly man, apparently the audio of him getting killed by the bears like seven minutes long and listen to that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       That was terrible. No, it's not real. The one you listened to online's not real. Oh no shit. It's fake. Yeah. Yeah. The actual audio was never released. Life is a lie. Yeah. I have somebody send it to me too, but then I looked into it and Werner Herzog and the woman who owns the actual audio, they got rid of it. They destroyed it. They never listened to it, and Werner Herzog actually told her to destroy it in the documentary. So the one, when you hear it online, it's just fake. And then once you know it's fake and you listen to it, you go, oh, this shit's fake. You like you can hear it. You want to hear it. I'm not going to listen to it again, but you can. Sure. Yeah. We really want to see, do you find that grizzly man audio who you hear it and you go, oh yeah, this isn't real. That's one of my top five movies of all time though. It's a great movie. Credible to one of the funniest movies ever as far as unintentional comedy. Oh my God. That's funny. Was it the sheriff? The sheriff goes, well, I thought he was retarded here, here, here, like screams and shed all the fox audio bear attack.

Speaker 1:          00:06:29       Why is it echoing here? The echo that was done in the room. All these, these voices, these supposed to be in the woods. Yeah, that's definitely, that audio is unquestionably done in a room somewhere. Oh Sierra. It's fake horse. See now you know those mother fuckers, they got us. Do you think they benefited from creating that? Probably. Yeah. Somebody probably put up some youtube ads and made some cash. All right. It's entirely possible. Or they just did it for fun. It sounded like people were having a good time. You guys, the guy's yelling. It sounds like you can almost kind of like here in his yellow. It's like, Holy Shit, someone's going to believe this. This is so ridiculous. But it's supposedly lasted seven minutes because they're just start leading them. Wait, so what's that? What does that stat that's not from like the real audio last bought actual audience because the bears not trying to kill him.

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       It's just eating them. Yeah. Cause bears apparently, well I've seen bears kill moose in videos and they just start eating them. They don't kill him right away. I know all of them down to wolves do too. They just eat right away. They start right at the back end and start eating you. They don't, they don't bother. They don't have the decency. Like at least a mountain lion kills Ya. You know, cats kill. Yeah. Bears and wolves. They just eat you. I guess they just don't need to, they don't need to incapacitate everybody there. Well, I think it's also a thing with omnivores. Omnivores, I think don't have that instinct to instantly kill. And that's interesting. Yeah. But that doesn't make sense though. My theory sucks because of wolves, because wolves. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe it's interesting. I don't know. I mean they, they do that because they have to, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       Like that's how they, they take, they take on a running animal itself kills. They snap at the legs, right? Yeah. And then they just, it's the easiest, softest part of me just start eating on the back end. I was listening to a podcast today about wolves and Idaho where they were talking about how when you go deep into the back country where people can't get to or where it's very difficult, really rocky terrain, the wolves are just running, ramping out there. They just have so many wolves there. Ever seen one in the wild? No, she put that on your list. I actually did see one, you know Berta I think, but it was at twilight and it was dog sized and it ran across the road and it was a little too big to be a coyote. Sure. In my mind. But I thought I saw a wolf for like two seconds and it was a squirrel.

Speaker 1:          00:09:05       So take that thought. I've seen a couple of the most memorable we where we were in a valley in Alaska and it was dusk and uh, you know, just too massive mountain ranges on each side. And uh, I don't know, it might've been the honest, somebody yelled and somebody spotted one across the river and we went and looked at it and it was, it was men. My memory is failing. He was either pure white, I think it was pure white and it just, I swear to God it's shown, I it just like emanated light and it was the most like regal, beautiful, just like perfect, perfect. And it just sort of trotted along the river and disappeared back in the woods and they're amazing. And I was thinking about it this morning on a hike here, I was looking for mountain lion tracks, but you know, the sign at the trailhead says, gives you warning about mountain lions are out here for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:09:54       Yeah. I never really, um, I don't know. The only thing that ever gives me pause in the woods is a grizzly because you know, Steve and I, we got charged that once and ever since that happened, my a bear radar is more intense and it's just such a freaky animal. Yeah. When you see what a grizzly really is, essentially a thousand pound giant wild dog, have you seen those in the wild yourself yet? Grisly. Yeah. No, never seen a grizzly. Not In the wild. I've seen them, you know, live in a sanctuary and I've seen a lot of, oh no, I did see a Grizzly, I saw small grizzly in Alberta, uh, last year. Yeah. But it wasn't that big. It was like maybe six and a half, seven feet. It was on the stand where you're pretty close. Yeah, it was very close. It was like 30 or 40 yards from us.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       Yeah. Yeah. But it took off pretty quick. But it wasn't a Grizzly, like they had some trail cam photos of like fucking tankers. They were Goddamn VW buses. This was like a juvenile. So it was probably like I said, probably like six and a half feet or something like that where I live in Bozeman. So it's literally a line right where we are. So south of us is the Gallatin range in the Madison Range, just full full of grizzlies. But just north of town, there's the bridger range and a couple other ranges too. And for whatever reason that is an impasse to the population of bears. Why is rls? Do they have any ideas? I mean, it might be, um, just physicality. And my actually Steve Rainelle would be the one that I've heard him talk about this. He would know exactly, but it's either a physical impasse or it's, it's the human and the proximity to humans, the of the, of the town and all this. But the way that it relates is that, you know, if I'm going to go hiking with my little baby boy, oh boy, I choose to go north just because, you know, I don't think I would always thought that way. And I carry bear spray. Usually I carry a pistol. I don't, I probably will in the future just because that guy he was from Bozeman got attacked last year.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       Yeah. He got tore up and that was horrific. Oh yeah. His scalp is hanging off his head while he's making the video. It was a gnarly, and he wasn't hunting, he was just hiking. He was scouting and um, he used bear spray and it didn't work. It was a sow with her cubs. Yeah. So that's about, I dunno, 50 miles from where I live. It's where he got hit 60 miles. Something like that. Close. Yeah. Jesus. Yeah. Nothing to mess around with. Man. I think it's awesome that they exist. I really, I think it's so cool that they exist. I don't want him to not exist, but at the same time I don't want to be near them. Yeah. You know, I don't want to encounter him. So it's, so uh, yeah, I'm, I'm more sensitive to them now. I have really have a deep, deep love for them.

Speaker 2:          00:12:38       Sharks on the other hand, we could just kill them. What's weird? People are getting like really touchy feely about sharks because they hear all about these sharks getting slaughtered for shark fin soup. Oh, like, yeah. The governor I think of New York caught a shark fishing totally legal and not an endangered fish at all and he got so much hate because people who, it's like we were talking before about science that so many people want to argue things online but they don't want to actually like look into like what are the studies that had been done and how much do people actually know? What is the, I know people want to have an opinion. They have this like narrow window of information and then I'm just going to run with my opinion and say, fuck you for killing that shark. Oh yeah. You know, it's like people have time necessarily to go investigate everything.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       They have an opinion about an issue. No, but they do have time to tweet about it. Get Mad at the governor. Was it the governor, was it the mayor of New York that that got in trouble for the shark? Well, you didn't get in trouble because what he did was totally legal and they cooked it and Maaco shark is delicious. [inaudible] ever had. And the Puerto Rico, they serve, they serve shark everywhere. Like you go to a food stand, they fry shark, put it on a stick. It's a fish machine. It's an ocean. It's an ocean out there. It is. New York governor sparks anger after killing threatened shark. But it's not threatened. That's not true. Why does it say threatened shark? That's not a threatened animal thresher shark yet. I don't, I don't think it said threatened. Right. It's it fresher. Did it say in the headline? Oh, threaten. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       So threatened. I don't think that's true. I do not think that's a threatened animal. I'd have to look at it. I have all three species of thresher. Shark is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for conservation of nature because of their declining populations. Fishing for them is regulated in the National Oceanic and atmospheric administration, but it is not illegal. Okay. Despite its legality, you and patrons of the ocean, Lewis said the killing and subsequent photos were a porn. Oh, it might be a Twat and worked against those trying to conserve dwindling shark numbers. Um Hm. Okay. Yeah. All right. Well maybe he's right. I know that some of them are not. I Dunno

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       man. I mean you can't really control what kind of fish you catch when you go fishing. And if you catch a fish that's legal. I, what do you do the problem with catch and release? This is a dirty secret, ladies and gentlemen, because people do go catch and release fishing and I've released fish before. A lot of them die. It's, it's kind of weird. Like is that a secret still you think for some folks? Yeah. Yeah. Not sure. Are you sure? Oh, absolutely. I mean, think about it. I mean, it'd be like taking you and I, Duncan is underwater for five minutes and putting us back you, or even worse, shoving a fucking barb through your face and then drowning us because all we're doing to it and we're literally drowning them. Literally. Yeah. Well, I mean, some people use barbless hooks, which are better, and the inside of the mouth of a fish is very different than our mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:15:38       So like, I mean, there's Pratt, right? There's best practices to, to, to harm the fish as little as possible. And I think, you know, that's why I say, sure. Yeah. Fly fishing with barbless hooks. Yeah. You can. Most likely you can. Most of them are going to be fine, but a lot of our night, it's a weird practice. I just don't, I don't putting them back. Yeah. Well it's just, yeah. I'm, I'm not, uh, I'm not a catch and release fish fisherman. I'm not even a huge fisherman. I love to eat it. I love to go to Alaska, catch a buttload of fish, come home and eat it for the rest of the year. I need to go halibut fishing. Jesse, do cause I've done that yet. No, no. I love how I've gone fluke fishing. I've caught flounder before, which a little baby halibut's but they're delicious.

Speaker 1:          00:16:17       But halibut is supposed to be like one of the most delicious fish to catch and cook like right away. Oh that's amazing. I mean I, it's um, it's one of those rule of fleshy white fish, kinda like grouper, grouper. Um, and uh, yeah, like chunks the hell, the deep fried, like, like a well coated and deep fried it the, the thing about how, but if you overcook it though, it's like chewing on a sock. It just gets tough. Real fascinated. That's true of other white flesh fish like that too. But no, it's delicious. It's not the most exciting to catch. Well, there are giant doors. Yeah. You just like holding up his heavy ass. They're so alien looking to two eyes on one side of their head and they flatten out at the bottom of the ocean. You know that they're, I migrates. Right. Really?

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       They start swimming up and down, eyes on each side and then started a part of their, uh, maturation processes. They flip over as they're getting older. Yeah. As they're getting older and there I literally slides onto the other side, but it stays there once it's, yeah. It's not like I can't go back and forth on that side. How fucking weird is so weird looking at it looks wrong. Yeah. Let me see two eyes on one side of their head. Their bodies flattened out and it's full of so much good meat. Oh yeah. Oh Man. It's like as heavy and like my aunt and uncle live on Kodiak island. We've been going up there since I was a kid and I mean it's, you know, it's, that's as much meat as a deer, right? You get to 200 pound halibut, which isn't the most common. They can be way bigger than that too.

Speaker 1:          00:17:44       You're supposed to release the really big ones though, right? Don't they say that? I Dunno. Maybe I, yeah, I'm not sure. A friend of mine caught one and there was apparently enormous and he was furious because the guide, they went fishing with a guide. The guide cut the line because it was so big. Do you think he just couldn't get it in the boat? No, no, no. He said, look, we got to let this go because it's a big breeder. Oh. And that these, these big ones are responsible for keeping the populations healthy. And because this guy made a living off of fishing, he's like, it's our responsibility to cut the sleeves. And the guy was like, what are you talking about? He's like, this is like, he didn't know that that was going to be an option. Yeah. And so he's pulling up this thing where he described it as like the side of a wall.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       Oh yeah. Like the wall of a room. It's like, it's fucking huge. I don't know if it's true how, but, but I know other fish, you know, sometimes the big ones don't eat that well. You're just not sure. It might not have been. It's not like he's going to get that mounted. I doubt. Right. Like a 400 pounds. They say that's true with deer too. Like I've never eaten a really old deer, but they say old deer just do not taste that good. It can be it. I know they can be worse for sure. Shoot an old dough. That was mo mo, mo. That's right. Yeah. And he said it was rough. I mean, how did it change rooms over a winter? But my little brother shot me a deer and gave it to me for Christmas and it was the first slightly off tasting animal that I've tasted in man, seven years, you know, and I've been eating a lot of animals, you know, over my course of time.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       Um, you know, we're talking about media, which I've worked on for a long time. I don't anymore, but uh, I a lot of animals and they all tasted exceptionally good. And my brother shot this one and um, I don't know what it was. It was cold. He killed it. Um, and it got dark and he had to track it in early the next morning and it's, um, did he got shot it? No, no, he hit it. Well it, it, it, it died fairly close. Um, but then it was, it was pretty gnarly and I even mean, so I made sausage out of it and try to eat that and that was hard to get down. We have a, we have a couple pounds of it left still. It just wasn't good. Hmm. That's weird. Well, maybe it was a tarsal glands or something. Like was it in the Rut? No, it was muzzleloader season in, in December in Minnesota.

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       And uh, I don't know what it was. I really don't. Yeah. Well you hear stories, you know, I, I'll tell you what, man, that was one of the things that really got me into hunting, not with just the, how cool that trip was and how amazing it was and how bizarre it is to be out there. And total silence. No cell phone signal. You don't hear. Not What do we see? Like maybe three people the whole week we were out there. Yeah. Two boats, maybe. I don't even remember seeing him. I remember we saw a dude's tent and he had like a little a woodstove and I was like, Steve, we got to go the stove. Fuck is this. This guy's got a stove inside of his tent because he used to stay at warm and his tent. We were freezing our dicks off and then we saw another guy who had a deer in his boat. He had shot up. Oh yeah. Remember that guy? Yeah. That was a memorable meal, man. Yeah, that was going to say the food was so good. Once we did shoot that deer and we

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       ate it that night, it was like, good Lord. It's still, it's the best meat ever and pos, there's so much connected to it, you know? It's not just that. It's like you went to a restaurant, you had a delicious meal. It's like, no, you like, you busted your ass for five days humping over mountains. Finally put a stock on a deer shot. The deer killed it, dragged it back to camp, cut it up, butchered it, and then we ate it. And like, and then when Steve took that dough head and buried it underground because, uh, what does that Guthrie Book? A big sky. Yeah. Right. It was in this book. Yeah. I think it's, I think that's the name of it. I think that's the name of the book. Right. And in that book he talks about cooking a deer head under the ground. So Steve wanted to try it.

Speaker 2:          00:21:33       We soaked burlap sack I've ever, it was incredible. It was really good. It was incredible. It was like some sort of exotic smoked pork or something like that. Yeah. But then, yeah, we ate everything, man. We ate the liver, we ate the heart. We, when we ate it all, it was amazing. Do you still have a freezer full of meat right now? Shot an elk. Nice. In October. So yeah. And I, I had shot a deer in November, but I ate that near pretty quick. Yeah. I had a doubt of the season last year and this year for the first time. A long time. I've been eating more local pork and beef and I'm just so sick of it, man. I can't wait until this fall again. And now when are you going back home? Back home from here? Yeah, I'm going home. Um, a week from two weeks from yesterday.

Speaker 2:          00:22:17       I have two commercial freezers in the back. I could hook you up. Yeah, yeah. I'm going to turn it down. How could you get it back? Um, let me think about it. I can, I can go buy cooler stuff. Go buy a small Yeti or figure something out and get you some, I have one of those Yeti hoppers at home I could give you that. That makes me really proud that like, you know, I was there the first time you hunted, now you're going to hook me up with me. That's good stuff. I live off it now. I don't buy meat anymore unless I go to a restaurant. It's very rare that I go to a store like a butcher shop and buy meat unless there's something I'm preparing, it's just not as good. It's just actually not as good. Well or I find that it's, it's different.

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       It tastes like a soft, lazy animal. It's weird like when you eat a steak, like from a butcher shop, I mean they taste good, they still taste good, but it tastes like, like this soft almost sick thing. Like there's a difference. Chink, grass fed beef. And that's one of the things that I noticed like way back in the day when I first started learning about grass fed beef, I'm like, well, what is the difference? And people explain to you, oh, there's a difference in the fatty acids and what's, what's healthier about it is these animals are not supposed to be eating grain. And when they eat grain, it's bad for their body. And that's why they're so fat. And the marbling is actually them being incredibly unhealthy and like, Huh, okay, so I'm gonna try some grass fed meat. And it was so expensive. And then it was a small, like they're smaller, like the stakes are small and it's a darker meat.

Speaker 2:          00:23:36       I'm like, hmm. And then I remember eating it thinking, wow, this tastes really different. Yeah, it does. Like a grass fed steak tastes different than a grain fed steak. They look different when you lay them out side by side. Oh yeah. But then you take those and then you put an elk stake next to it and you go, okay, that's the real meat man. That's what you're supposed to be eating. You're supposed to be in that deep, dark red meat that you eat it and you just want to run through a fucking wall. It's like it's got energy in it. Like it it fee. It makes your body feel different when you eat it. So what is it? What do you think that is? What is, is that, is that a a psychological thing? Do you think that it's actually biological in the meat? It is better.

Speaker 2:          00:24:14       There's something in there and more for you. How do you, how do you make sense of that for yourself? I have a terrible unscientific theory and my unscientific theory is things that run fast or better for you. That's why fish is really good for you cause it's hard to catch and they've, they've swim fast. Deer are great. They run fast, rabbits are great. They run fast. Cows just sort of wander around, you know, that just meandering and slow theory. But it makes sense that we have more cows cause I guess it's just all right there corral those bitches. Well you know my buddy Adam lives in uh, Australia, Adam Green tree and in Australia they have wild cows where cows at one time were domestic but they broke loose and they've been for many, many, many generations living wild and they're extremely dangerous. Yeah. Especially the bowls.

Speaker 2:          00:25:05       Like when you watch cowboys riding bowls and you're like, wow, this is crazy. We were like, yeah, that's a fucking big scary animal. But again, a domestic animal that is not fighting off predators. It's not, I mean it's just, it doesn't want you to fuck with it. It's got these giant watermelon testicles and they're just full of piss and vinegar and that we don't eat those. If Pete for people don't know, when you buy meat from a cow, you're buying meat from a steer and want to steer is a bold. It cut his balls off and he's young. So his testosterone stops. So there's bodies mushy and soft. Yeah. But these bulls that Adam sees out in the bush in Australia are super aggressive and very dangerous and one of his friends was torn apart by Juan Gord, like really badly. No, they lived, but they had a med vac to safety at tours, guts open and you know, he was, I don't even think he was hunting it.

Speaker 2:          00:26:01       I think like he was just in the wrong place. The wrong time. They see you and they just fucking charge. Yeah. It means a reason why they have those goddamn giant horns. Yeah. What's the saying that uh, you cut, you cut into a male animals balls off and they stop thinking about ass and start thinking about grass. So it's literal. Yeah. They stopped trying to get laid and they just eat, they just keep eating and they just, the lack of testosterone make some soft and mushy. Whereas I'm Cam Haynes shot of water buffalo in Australia and he said that he had one piece of meat in his mouth for half an hour trying to chew it down while he was practicing archery. He goes, I'm not exaggerating. Chewed piece of meat for a whole half hour.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       Yeah. What's it say about us though? Are as as humans though. I mean you could easily make an analogy there between cows and then a wild animal and us. I mean nobody's more domesticated than us. No. These things we domesticate. I think we are, you know where the domestic cater somehow, but I think we're even more domesticated. Like if you could eat one of the duck dynasty guys. Oh Man, they would cook up good. Oh Oh mushy. And you know there would be so much flavoring and marbling and plus they probably eat a lot of sugar. So there's probably like a lot of like sweetness to the meat. Yeah, I'm not advocating, it depends on what your tooth is though. If you're used to eating wild animals and eight one of the duck dynasty guys would taste like shit. That's true. That's true. But if you eat McDonald's and ring dings, what's, what's the ring thing?

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       Look, you're one of those little hostess things. So chocolate covered, cream filled jammies. I might have to get one of those. I haven't had them on those disgusting. They look great. Like, Oh, who is it going to enjoy this? And then as soon as you eat it, you're like, what the fuck is wrong with me, man? Yeah. I love just, I had some tacos. I got to town last night and uh, had to go to the first Taqueria. I saw it was the best. We have legit Mexican food in La. The Montessori does not have next, not really right. Not such good Mexican food, but Colorado has some really good Mexican food. It does. It does. Yeah. It, the, the line of that I think stops at Colorado. Maybe why I'm going, I don't think has it been north into Montana? You're, you're in a dead zone where you are is amazing though.

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       It's worth it. You could take a trip for Mexican food because where you are, it's like, I feel like, I mean, I almost feel like I shouldn't say this on the podcast because I don't want anybody moving to Bozeman is already on her foot to list. It's everybody. I mean it's the cat's out of the bag. It's not, you're making sure you're not spilling the beans here. I know, but I mean, it really is a special place. It's the people are so nice. Yeah. They're not dumb either. It's not like uneducated. No, no, no. It's actually that county has the highest percentage of phds in America. What bozeman really nail. Look it up. Fact. Wow. Yeah. It's a highly educated population, but it's also not like boulder where they're like, or my God save the butterfly. You know, there are no national about their approach to nature. It's balanced. You can find some, you know, you can find good yoga, you can find your boob and stuff, but there's also a rancher right next to you. It's really interestingly like diverse troll. Yeah, it is. Yeah. It's diverse some ways. Not with mostly white. Yeah. No.

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       Moving there from New York and, and uh, that is my least favorite thing about, about Montana and not a whole lot of flavor. No, but there's so many good things about, and the, the landscape, like what you get to see when you're there. So stunning. And the access to the is the huge, it's a huge thing too. I mean, I'm in Bozeman from my house in, I don't know how many fin fought four different directions, three different directions. You can be at a trail in 15 minutes and it's just, and it's just endless. You know, you can get on a trail ride side of, Oh man, I can't talk right outside of Bozeman. And you can go if you wanted to for days through the yellowstone ecosystem south. Yeah. And just keep going and keep going and keep going. I mean it, it connects you to, I mean real big wilderness, the kind, the kind that you can, I mean in Alaska you find it even bigger, but I think in the lower 48 yeah, it's unparalleled.

Speaker 1:          00:30:18       Man in the lower 48 is about, it's about as wild as it gets. And that leads me to what I wanted to bring up to you today because I saw this today where trump is his, his challenging some of the protection of certain national monuments and some public lands today. It was something that came out and like I told you fuckers, I knew this was coming and there were so many people that were telling me that trump is going to protect our public lands because his son is a hunter and like, listen man, that guy worships money. There's money to be made in delisting these public. Look at this trump order could roll back public land protections from three presidents. This is going to have a shit storm on his hands though may play there so we could hear exactly what he says of America's natural ratio sis

Speaker 3:          00:31:04       and I can tell you the group that's in here right now, they're really doing the job. Rightly said, they doing a good job. No, we're going to take care of Alaska too. Don't worry about it.

Speaker 3:          00:31:16       And they protect the ability of the people to access and utilize the land which truly belongs to them and belongs to all of us. Secretary Ryan Zinky is doing an incredible job and he never overlooks the details. He's a detailed person. Soon after he was confirmed, we had a snow storm, big one, and he was out there on the steps of the Lincoln memorial shoveling the snow all by himself. And he's a strong guy. He did a good job. Part the fuck am I. Very, very good job. Proud of heard the first 100 days we've taken historic action to eliminate wasteful regulations. They're being eliminated like nobody's ever seen before. There's never been anything like it. Sometimes I look at some of the things I'm signing, I say maybe people won't like it, but I'm doing the right thing.

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       What the hell? This is so weird that that's a president. But the way he communicates, did you see when he, he just pinned a purple heart? Jesus. He just pinned a purple heart on, on a return vet. I got lost. His leg just happened last couple of days. It's the most awkward and weirdest. It is

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       the weirdest single thing I've ever watched on a screen. His, his body language and his, uh, what he does. It's bizarre. Really Bizarre. And what does it

Speaker 2:          00:32:51       say there in terms of like what the uh, actual rollbacks mean and what the, the issue is here. Let's go largely ignored order, which trump sign. The interior department could lead to the reshaping of 24 national monuments, including the Grand Canyon Parish Shan't, national monument, Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, and the Bass and range national monument as well as the host of Pacific Ocean monuments, including the World War II valor in the Pacific National Monument though Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, he cast the move as a way to include local voices in the decision to designate monuments. The review of the antiquities act, which is the first signed by President Teddy Roosevelt in 1906 stands in stark relief two years of bipartisan work at conserving lands. Wow. The move comes after Western Republican lawmakers, including Utah Senator Orrin Hatch complained that Obama overused the law to overprotect land. How the fuck do you overprotect land? It kind of protected, but don't overprotect it, but I don't know, man. It's history

Speaker 4:          00:33:56       weird. The worry is going to be that this would be in the beginning of a, of a larger pattern.

Speaker 2:          00:34:02       It's a slippery slope. Well, I, what I wanted to, you know about, and what I think most people don't, when you talk about this, the vast majority of the people in this country live in these communities and cities and towns and you know, even small towns they do, they don't understand how much of this land that we live in is just this incredible, bizarre, uh, experiment in like the people having the, the actual American people owning this incredible swath of public land. I mean, it's, it's wild. Like what you're talking about. Like you can walk for days and days into that.

Speaker 4:          00:34:42       Yeah. I think they don't know that exists necessarily. And I think even to me, more importantly, they don't understand the impact that that actually has on people and what it actually means to be able to be part of something like that. It's, it's a really deep, important thing. And I think that people just, you know, you get your postcard tourists and you say, Oh, I love the national forest. I love the national parks and let's drive around and take pictures. And that's great. That's fine. There's a big industry there. It's very helpful to the economy and uh, but there's something way deeper to that. Brings a lot of people. Um, and I will even say culturally, something really deep there that we shouldn't be fucking with. No. You just shouldn't be messing with it. Well, it's been there for a hundred years, 110 years. It's the conservation part of it.

Speaker 4:          00:35:28       Yeah, absolutely. But the land itself has been there way longer and that's, you know, sort of like the deep time. Part of that is what really interests me is because, you know, step out into that in the right context and, and you're all of a sudden, you know, you're, uh, you're playing with something way bigger and more powerful and more impactful by just being part of the landscape that, you know, but you're right. Yeah. The, the conservation thing is present and real. And, uh, the, I grew up in Minnesota and North Dakota and my, my first wilderness trip was in the boundary waters of northern Minnesota. It's this million 8 million Acre wilderness of lakes that are interconnected by trails and you can go out for weeks at a time and canoe across the lake and then carry your boat to the next lake. And there's camp sites and it's just, it's paradise. It's where I fell in love with the idea of wilderness. It's actually where I fell in love with my, for the first lady that fell in love at the same, I was on a church trip. Oh No. Yeah. And uh, but you know, so what I, you know what I'm saying as far as it's shaping people and its importance. I mean that's first trip into the wilderness changed my life. Like, and that's a, that's a pretty mild way of saying it. It, it, it shaped who I am all the way.

Speaker 2:          00:36:37       Well that gets us to what you're doing now because you, you stop working for 0.0 and we talked about on the last podcast that you had done a lot of these wilderness therapy trips where you'd take like troubled kids that have lost their way and their parents don't know what the fuck to do and you would take them out into the woods and live with these kids for months. Yeah. For a long time. Yeah. Just crazy to think about like that, but make sense. Like just the five days that I was out there six days or whatever, when I first went to Montana with you guys changed the way I thought about wilderness cause I really had never been, I mean I'd kind of been to like wooded areas. Right. You know what I'm saying? But I maybe I went to yellowstone, I was a kid, but I didn't really remember it.

Speaker 4:          00:37:23       It's a different thing man. And then we went to Alaska. Right. And that was, to me, that's another level of which it was listened to you on that trip. You were like, fuck that place, we shouldn't go to that place. Sure. It was uncomfortable. But um, I'm glad we went though in retrospect. Right. I mean, and I'm glad you went just because of the level of how deep out we are. You know, the, the, the Missouri Breaks in Montana, you're out there, but in this spot and in southeast Alaska, we were really out there and you can feel in the air

Speaker 2:          00:37:54       fell. I fell off of this like six foot drop. I slept and just, and luckily I just landed good. But I was like, man, you could fuck yourself up up here and not be able to get out of here.

Speaker 4:          00:38:07       Like, especially if you do a solo trip. Oh yeah. No Bueno. No, totally. Yeah. Yeah. I'm addicted to that. That feeling. Yeah, that sort of immense. Kenny, it takes you over. You are so tiny. You are not, you know, you're not in charge anymore. It doesn't care about you.

Speaker 2:          00:38:25       That's the thing. Like the thing about like Prince of Wales is this solitude, this sadness. That's beautiful. It's really weird. It's a weird feeling that you get, you just like it.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       There's no denying your lack of significance in this particular environment. It doesn't give a fuck about your credit cards now. It doesn't care if like cell phone, it doesn't care who you know or where you live or what kind of car each, it doesn't give a fuck. Yeah. It's just tooth than Fang and claw and rain and constant rain and beauty. Just unbelievable beauty with the, like when the sun does color coaster. Oh yeah. I mean you're just in hell and all of a sudden you're on the top of a ridge and, and the, and the, and the sun peaks out in a rainbow pops up and the like the technicolor hyper vivid, just like crazy green. It's a, sorry about that. I have cold, uh, that place as a personality. Yeah. Right. But being in wilderness, I've been in wilderness spots all over the globe.

Speaker 4:          00:39:24       It's what's so fascinating to me is how they all have a different vibe. They'll have a different like life. And it is, it's, it's like, uh, I mean, sure it looks different, but there's a, like a felt sense or a feeling you get from places like the Brooks range in Alaska is the northern most range of mountains and it runs east and west. And then above it is the Arctic, the Arctic plane, and an Arctic Ocean. There is something about being up there. And especially I think in the summer when the sun doesn't really go down. It is, it is, it feels like being on a different planet. But man, I don't know if I have the worst to describe it, but yeah, man, I mean, and that's what I said. I'm addicted to. I am. And I, you know, I moved to Montana for professional reasons, but then also because it's where I wanted to live.

Speaker 4:          00:40:10       And so I get out hiking all the time, you know, I train, I hike with, that's Kinda how I stay fit. Um, but I come, I need to figure this out because I come home from that feeling like I just like got started. You know, I've missed the deep immersion of the woods when you were working for meat eater and you constantly on those trips or any time that I spent over, I think there's something that happens after, you know, depending on how long, the longest I've stayed out at a time is a 40 some days. Um, but there's some that happens, I don't know, a day, two days, three days, five days in where you really just kind of let go of the regular, you know, I don't know. I think he's actually physiological, some of it, but whatever. It could be just psychological too, but something shifts, you know, when you do a real expedition, when you do a real thing where you're not, your brain's not half stuck back in all the other stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:41:06       So yeah, I go hiking and I love it, you know, all the time and we get out in the woods, but it just doesn't really do it for me. I feel kind of unfulfilled. That's interesting. So you, you just got so addicted to being out there, completely disconnected that you, when you go on the hike, you know, you could always just make it back to town a couple hours. Oh yeah. It's just like a little, I'm trying to think of like an analogy, but it would be like a little taste. Yeah. It would be like maybe like a five minute

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       porn session versus a week long like lovemaking session that of your dreams, right? Just like a little, uh, yeah, a little teaser, just not as fun. Do you, do you plan on staying there? Is that, I think so. Yeah. I mean we think about we definitely won't move back east. We would either move somewhere out here or stay there. It gets cold as fuck in the winter though, right? It does. Yeah. Not, not that call to action. Like not compared to where I grew up in Minnesota. It gets really cold for a long time and Montana where we're at. I used to do that, but uh, global warming, something, something it's different this year was pretty mild. The year before was really, really mild. You know, like 35 average temperature. Really? That's it. Yeah. It's not that bad. I thought it was like 35 below. No, you go northern Montana up in the highline area.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       It'll start to, you know, more of a deep freeze. A lot more wind is kind of a nice little protected. We should stop talking about Bozeman so people hear me telling you we're going to get people into it. It's um, well just another factor and that it is the, I think the third fastest growing county in the states right now. Wow. So, well it makes sense. When I was there, we went there, took the family in there last summer. I was like, this place is magic. So pretty. I got a couple of other spots though that saving. Oh yeah. Don't tell anybody. No, I'm not. Gonna um, when you were in the brooks range, did you put a like masks on to go to sleep? Those, you know, sleeping masks, they say, yeah, I just use a tee shirt. Just cover your eyes. Yeah. Yeah. They say you have to because if you just try to like sleep, you'll wake up a couple hours later and be all be welded.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       Oh yeah, no, it's weird. It's weird. It's cool. It's cool. It's a very, it's a perception changing thing to go up there and watch the sun literally just kind of like, you know, kiss the horizon and then just keep going. And Yeah. I went to anchorage couple of years ago in the summer, we were there in July. Me and my friend Ari went fishing up there and we did some shows up there and uh, it was weird. It's like two o'clock in the morning, it was a light out. And we're like, what in the fuck is this like and that people are coolish shit. That's another place. There's something about like those people like Alaska even more extreme because something about those people that they deal with nature in a way that everybody else just doesn't. Oh yeah. Well they have, yeah, all the time. Whether it's gnarly.

Speaker 1:          00:43:53       I mean, you can't walk out your house for more than 10 miles before you have it, you know, giant, massive in front of you peak. The ocean's right there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean anchorage is a, it's a weird place too. I love it. Yeah. It's really interesting too because you think of it as like a bunch of like lumberjacks and fishermen and Weirdos and like people trying to run from the law or something like that and you get there and there was like honk free quality. There's a bunch of people with gay rights signs. People beeping their horns as they drove by. I'm like, oh, this is not what you think it is. Craft breweries and really good restaurants. Like, oh, okay, this is, it's not, it's not like Hicks. I feel like it has a little bit of flavor of the Pacific northwest of Seattle and Portland, but then then a, a big dose, a weird to a lot of weird, a lot of extreme.

Speaker 1:          00:44:40       I mean these are, these are people that are there. That's, this is where they're going to live and die. Yeah. And, you know, it was a grizzly bears everywhere. A lot of Minnesotans and folks from where I grew up there, there's a big connection. A lot of people move up to have moved up to Alaska. So I, like I said, I grew up going up there fairly regularly in the summer. So who did you say lives that you know, that lives on Kodiak Island? My Dad's sister family. That's a scary place. Those bears are fuck and John. Yeah. Yeah. They onto the biggest brown bears in the world. Uh, they might be, I think I've heard that the Kamchatka Brown bears in Siberia, in, in Russia across, I don't know if that is Siberia, but up across the, the water there, um, they might be bigger. I could be totally wrong, but I saw this video of this guy.

Speaker 1:          00:45:29       Do you remember that show? That was on a, it was called the hunt. It was, um, a show that, it was interesting because, um, James Hetfield of Metallica was the narrator of it. And people were so angry at him for narrating this thing that they were, uh, talking about boycotting metallica when they played some music festival. I never watched. I remember you talking about it and then, yeah, I know what you're talking about. And it was about a bear hunting, right? Yeah. It was about brown bear hunting, which is a really controversial form of hunting because you don't really eat those things. I mean, you kind of can, but they taste like shit. Well, the coastal ones special, they're just eating rotten fish all the time. Yeah, well like animals tastes like what their, what they eat, which is really, yeah, I mean it makes sense, but it seems pretty counterintuitive.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       I dare trump to try to take away some of those Alaskan wilderness areas and they, I mean, the way the real worry is that he's going to let people drill in them and they're going to destroy something. That's the real worry. The real worry is the reason why he's releasing or relaxing some of these regulations is that he wants to let industry get in there and as soon as they start fracking and polluting wells and rivers and it's just, it's fucking dangerous man. It's just not, it's something that if they do fuck it up, it could be fucked up for a hundred generations. Yeah. Did you ever live in New York City? Not In the city. I used to live in new Rochelle, which is right outside of the Bronx. I lived there for seven years or so. And uh, if there, if there wasn't the existence of central park and I lived in Brooklyn, so prospect park, if those two green places didn't exist while I lived there, I would have probably lost my mind or just moved.

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       Right. I feel like these big areas of wilderness we have, you know, as we will not be okay as, as humans. I mean like individually. Sure. It is it going to, here's my worry. My worry is that, um, you know, the general American public or the general public doesn't have enough connection or real life experience to know why to care so much and you know, that's a big deal and it's, um, I don't know, there's a lot of different angles you can take on that. There's the, there's so much, but there's just something that, uh, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, uh, I mean if it really gets intense, I'm going to have to basically drop what I'm doing and do everything I can to, to stop them from, from harming these places could be done. My, my real concern is not just this, what's going on now, but the future and then also when you really consider it overpopulation, I mean there's seven and a half billion people on the planet now and the most recent census, yeah, this is a, that's a half a billion increase over the last, I don't know how many years, but it hasn't been that many.

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       It was 6 billion just a few years ago. I remembered that was a number that they bandied about like a decade or two ago. Now it's seven and a half. Like what happens when it gets to be 30 like where are we going to put these motherfuckers? What is the carrying capacity? Then it must apply, amber. Yeah, it's weird. We're like rats on a sinking ship. Yeah. We're just scrambling everywhere. We're everywhere. We're like, it's going to have not another animal like us when we're on every fucking patch of land. You can find. Yeah, it's weird, but we're awesome. Except these wilderness spots, right? Look at this current world population. Is that real? How do they know that? Births today? It's based off averages. Look at the burst today. You could watch the, the numbers just roll in. Oh my God. The difference between the birth today and the death today, that's incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       That's why it's moving so fast because we're dying slow as fuck. Population growth today. So the, the average 139,000 people today, 44 million this year. Oh my God. It's weird, but that's scary. And what's the u s 400 million? I think we're 300 plus Mexicans. Three 26 it says c but that's, they're not counting. They're not counting all the people that snuck in. I just don't think they know. Like when, when they'd say Los Angeles, let's say Los Angeles, 20 million. I'm like, okay. And what about the Mexicans? Yeah, like, cause there's a lot, and I'm not anti Mexican in any way, shape or form. Ladies and gentlemen don't, I'm just looking at this pragmatically. Yeah. There's a fucking shit load of illegal aliens here, which I support also. How many people are here that any given time that don't live here but are here on vacation or working here for like a week?

Speaker 1:          00:50:09       That's a good question. Yeah. Just added people for hundreds of thousands, I would imagine. Yeah, probably. Yeah. When you get on the four oh five and you had to San Diego and it takes you six hours and you go, what is this? Like what have we done? This massive humans. Yeah, there's so many of us. But when you get here and you realize, oh you, you guys don't have any weather, that's what it is. Yeah. But you could also, you know, go 30 miles outside the city and have that same either. Couldn't ya? Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. But you know, you don't get the same Taco stands, right? Yeah. I get it. I like, I love cities, man. I miss it. I miss living in New York City. I really do to you. I wouldn't trade it at this point. You know, I was younger and single in New York, had a, had a fun time and moved to Montana, have a family now it's kind of perfect for, for uh, where I'm at in my life, so I don't really need anything else.

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       Yeah, that's the balance, right? It's like there is no really perfect place. It's like there's places that are perfect for certain things. Like if you're a comedian, Los Angeles is the best place to either Los Angeles or New York. I prefer Los Angeles. There's a lot of clubs, there's a lot of Comedians, like most of the best comedians in the world live here. It's a great place for us to network and we work together and stuff like that. And if you, if you want to be in that business is probably the best place in the world to do it. So that's one of the reasons it keeps me around here, plus the podcast and all that jazz. But for peace of mind, it's not the best place. No. Does that actually fuck with you? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. The numbers of humans is just, it's untenable. And you're close to North Korea. Yeah, that's right. That's right. But if you know what man, if they nuke California, where are you going to go? You know? I mean the whole thing's going to be a mess. Yeah. Might as well. You might be better off if it lands on your head.

Speaker 1:          00:52:02       That's why we say about asteroids, like you don't want to be that guy in the movie that like is like storing food in his basement and staying up all night to shoot vandals and because people are trying to steal your canned goods. That doesn't sound fun. Not like a healthy life. No, you don't want to live like that. And then what happens? You die of old age. Die Of old age. Protecting your canned goods. Yeah. In fight or flight your entire life. Fuck that. Fuck that. And then just let that rock land right on your fucking head.

Speaker 1:          00:52:31       I used to stress out a lot about what are the perfect place to live was I just gave that up. It doesn't exist. Doesn't exist. There's, there's places you don't want to be caught dead like Florida. I liked Florida. How dare you. I like it. And the part Sarah, so no, my wife was raised on Captiva island, which is on the east coast. Okay. Like Key West is pretty dope. Yeah. Down there. It's pretty cool. Yeah. That's a good place. You just want to drink and take naps or fish or, yeah. Yeah, yeah. There's some cool stuff down there, but it's just, Florida's just so fucked up. It's, they've, they've done such damage to Florida. Would their oxycontin regulations know one time there were more oxycontin prescriptions in Florida than they were the entire country combined? Seriously? Yes. I didn't know that was insane. How is this recent?

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       As, as like recent in these, in these late struggles? Yeah, there was a documentary that I called the Oxycontin express that was on vanguard. Wow. And, um, these people that, um, went down there, they went undercover and uh, saw how easy it is to buy opiates down there. They would, they have these one stop shops, they have these pain management centers. We'd go in and he'd say, Hey doc, my back is killing me. Doc said, you need pills. Go right next door. So he'd write your prescription, you go right next door, you get the pills and then boom, you're off to the races. And they didn't have a database, which meant that you could go to Dr Jamie and say, Jamie, my back's killing me. Dr Jamie gives you a prescription. You buy some opium pills or whatever the fuck they are. And then you come to me and he'd go, Doctor Joe, my back is killing me.

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       I'm like, Oh, you see where this just being sourced there and then so sold elsewhere or did we purposely made the regulations lax there so they can make more money. So people were buying them and then bringing them and selling them and Kentucky and up to Ohio, the, that's why they call it the Oxycontin Express, the highway that led from Florida to the rest of the country. It sounds evil. Yeah. It was sick and you know, a lot of people lost their lives and a lot of people lost like who they were because of the addiction. Wow. Yeah. The numbers were insane. Like Google the numbers. Like what, what were the numbers of oxy cottons or oxycodone? I still don't know what the differences, and you've seen the reports lately showing that the uh, the life expectancy or the early death rate of middle age white men specifically lately, it has dropped for the first time in, I dunno, dozens or cause of pain pills.

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       Yeah. Well, part of it and calling them deaths of despair. Woo. How they're being Jesus written about is literally deaths of despair. It's, it's, yeah. Jesus. Oh, it's heavy. It's real heavy. That's a heavy, he's been a spate of articles over the last three or four months. Just that's really diving into it. And it's guys, it's men. Here it is. Doctors in Florida prescribed 10 times more oxycodone pills then every other state in the country combined. Wow. And this is now, right? What ends this article from, this was actually from 2011 on NPR when the, probably when it came out. Ah, there we go. I can get the updated one. Yeah, it doesn't matter. It's just, it's a crazy place. Let's just put it that way. Despairs one of the scariest words, despair. When you hear about someone like despair and lonely, those are two like really? So that's the other word that they're using is, is his loneliness has been there. Now measuring it and loneliness is, is as or worse of a health issue in our country than smoking heavily smoking there. There's all this, there's this new only misses. Loneliness isn't overpopulation coincided with lowliness the same time we're thrust further and further closer together and we don't know each other and we're more and more disconnected and lonely. And it's literally, so there's a whole new, um,

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       I dunno how new, but it's called interpersonal neurobiology, which is the science of our brain wiring. And physiological wiring on how we're, uh, yeah, this is one of the articles. Loneliness might be a bigger health risk than smoking or obesity. Whoa, that's dark dude. It's dark. But you know, with the, in my life, the experience I've had in my life, I'm, when I read that I'm like of course Duh, Duh. It makes sense. Yeah. We are a disconnected people. We are electronically, digitally connected in a crazy way but in a human way and it's killing. It literally is harming. Awesome. People are dying and it's crazy. It's crazy stuff. Fascinating that like feelings have an effect on your health. Like the feeling of loneliness to feeling of despair. It's not like you could eat your vegetables, you can get your exercise in and you, if you feel despair and you feel loneliness, your body is actually like being harmed by that.

Speaker 4:          00:57:22       But there's a real like practical reason for that and that's because we are, when we come out as babies, we are the most dependent individuals. So like are, you know what I mean? Like on your parents, on your mother. We are completely socially dependent when we're born completely. And so, you know, April Maslov's hierarchy of needs. You ever heard of that? So it's like, you know, to be okay, you have to take care of breathing and water and your basic functions. But there's, there's been studies recently by these neurobiologists that are showing that these social needs are just as, or even like come before some of these physical needs. There's, there's, it's, it's crazy man. And there's literally, there's a book called social by a guy named Matthew Lieberman. Like you gotta check it out. And so what they are finding is that there's like two, uh, parts of our operating brain, and this is, you know, going to be me paring it down, but one is the analytical thinking, deciding thing.

Speaker 4:          00:58:20       And the other is this social awareness sprain, which is always like always checking in on how am I in relation to others. And it's also the part of their brain that actually we can, you know, like the metacognitive part and the part that I can, they call it mind reading, but really it's just, it's just by US sitting here, I can kind of get a sense of how you feel and what you're thinking right. Just by the, the connection that we have and just, it's part of who we are. So when our analytical brain is offline, this other one, the social one pops on immediately. So, so what they're theorizing is that that is like the fundamental need for humans in safety and survival is how are we relating to each other as a, as a group. But it makes sense if you look, I mean to me it makes sense in, um, you know, we are social animals.

Speaker 4:          00:59:09       We forget that I think, but you look at other species of monkeys or wolves or whatever. I mean, you know, there might be a period of time where say, Oh, a wolf will, we'll get kicked of a pack for a while and he'll go do his thing, but eventually come back to a pack. It's not safe for us as humans and animals, social animals like these to be isolated. It's not. And, and so there's all these parts of us that just, if we're not connected to other people in a, in a very direct and true way, there's these sort of a deep down emotional and physiological, uh, fears that come up. Right? And they, and they're the real, and that's what the neurobiology is showing, which is really interesting. And when we can just think about that, but they're actually showing it now that if we're not really connected to each other, we're going to be freaked out.

Speaker 4:          00:59:59       We're not going to be okay. And, um, you know, I really believe that this really drives a lot of the internal struggle we have. And we're really, and this is part of, you know, getting into it, but that's part of my, what I'm trying to bring into the world and my platform now is, is just to, you know, stand up and say, hey, we need each other and we can do it. It's not, and for guys pitch specifically, right, it's such a social stigma of ours to not be real or open or connected or vulnerable with guys. And uh, and it's, uh, it's cool to see the science coming out because it's, I have all this anecdotal evidence of being out the woods in the woods with kids or being in a, in a management with guys are running a retreat or whatever this is of how powerful it is to like set down all of our differences and just be there with them.

Speaker 4:          01:00:48       But now the science is really lighten it up and yeah, man, loneliest. I mean we can all think about a loneliness isn't fun. It's not a, it doesn't feel good. But the other, this is crazy too that they're showing that emotional pain, the lights up the same centers of our brain. It's physical pain. And that the one study showed that, um, an insult to someone had much more painful and long term effects than slamming somebody with a hammer hitting their hand with a hammer. So like our emotional pain literally actually exists in the body. Like it is actual pain. And the reason that it's so uncomfortable to feel our emotions, which it is, you know, I mean I'll just say it is, is that it actually hurts like actually hurts. I mean, and there's like people say things like, you broke my heart or I'm dying of heart ache or whatever, but the science is catching up and showing us that this pain is actual, it's real and we're not addressing it. We're not even aware of it. That's really interesting. That's deep.

Speaker 2:          01:01:51       You know, it's interesting too because what you're saying about us being disconnected and how unhealthy it is now on unhealthy loneliness is it sort of confirms these ideas that I've always had, that the human race itself is not like a group of individuals but a super organism. Much like the human body is like the human body like requires all the bacteria in your gut, all the skin flora, all the different things that compose the actual physical structure of the human body. Whereas we think of it, I think there's some nutty number of how much bacteria, how many bacteria cells are in your body versus how many human cells and is he far out numbers, the human cells. And it's just that we think of ourselves as I'm mike and I put my shoes on and I go to work cause I am Mike and, but Mike, you're a system, you're a system of individual organisms that are collectively keeping this whole thing alive. And when the imbalances off, like when someone takes an antibiotic and it fucks up their gut flora, like literally you've like nuked a part of your civilization and you know to try to save something. Like if you had some sort of a surgery and you're worried about an infection, which is kind of like an invading army coming in and taking over part of your leg that you have it operated on.

Speaker 4:          01:03:08       Yeah. Or It'd be like slashing the tires of all of our transport system in the country. Like that's how it got. That's like the first things in an in and out. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:03:14       Yeah. And even has an impact on your, your health mentally. Oh, in terms of like how you feel and your depression. A lot of that has connected, led, legitimately connected to your diet and how that affects your gut flora and it affects the way your body produces serotonin and dopamine and it's bananas, man. Oh yeah. No, I get it. Is Scientists Bust the myth that our bodies have more bacteria than human cells. Decades old assumption about Microbiota revisited. Okay. What's the new new data one instead of, oh, so it's why you are as much. Okay, so they used to say it was 10 to one but now it's one to one. Okay. Wow. That's still crazy, man. It's still like you're half bacteria. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:04:00       I like that analogy though of the body is like a civilization or what it means to think about if you're one of your, I dunno, one important neuron, one cell neural cell or something decided just to go rogue and not be in connection with the rest of you. Right. I mean, I don't, that wouldn't work so well. Right? I don't know. I don't know what happened. Your body would probably get rid of it and get it out of there or I don't know, maybe so I'm just really reaching here, but it's some sort of rogue cell at that point. Right. Like cancerous cell or something and it would probably be attacked. So yeah, if I think that if you'd take that analogy, you know, our civilization here is we're hurting, really hurting because we're, we're really not, you know, we are working together obviously in practical ways. A lot of times, you know, work in commerce and you know, the world is functioning. But I think on a like a health and fulfillment level, we're, we're missing something pretty deeply. Yeah. Well also like

Speaker 2:          01:04:58       let's talk about people that are disconnected from actual humans but connect them the cyber way. Yeah. Like how many people are like really lonely in terms of like physical touch and communication with friends and, but they sit in front of their computer all day and they interact with people online, which shows you like some of the most unhealthy communities you'll ever encounter are like online message boards and forums where people are just the anonymous and interacting with people without what we were talking about earlier. Like one of the reasons why I like to do podcasts with a person in the room. I've only done one podcast ever through skype. Um, and that was with John Anthony West cause he was living in New York and he's just this really important egyptologist and I really wanted to talk to him as the only way I could get them to do it was to do it through skype. So I did one, I prefer to sit there with people because I want to look at them. I want to feel their energy. I want to, I feel like you and I doing this conversation, you get to understand each other.

Speaker 4:          01:05:51       Totally. No, I get it. And I, and I think I can hear it in your podcast too. And I think that, uh, you know, and again, I'm not going to keep hitting the biology part, but there's, to me, I think that it means, I can sense that there's something else in me is getting, is triggered, right? If we were just talking on the phone, there is something, and it's might be this other part of your brain, but it's lit up right now. Right. Because I can, I can spatially, you know, so you can feel where you are. We can, we can have social content, all that, all of that. Yeah. And it's, it's set sense of connection. It's that real. Um, I think, and I think that is, you know, really apparent in your podcast is that you, yeah, you sit here and you really connect to somebody and just run with it.

Speaker 4:          01:06:36       And I think that's a, it's a big, it's a big thing, man. I mean, I mean, I think of like, um, so part of what I do is I help proliferate this idea of men's groups across the country where guys get together for exactly what we're talking about. It's just like, you know, the, the intent of them is to, um, get together to challenge and support each other's growth or personal growth, you know, and it's just a simple sort of protocol and a simple sort of, um, uh, design or are sort of, there's a structure to it. But the whole point is it's remedial in a sense. It's that, you know, our culture in general, but guys, especially in our culture, don't have this, this on fettered place to really show up and actually connect with each other. And it's a scary thing. I mean, it's, uh, it's, it's, um, you know, it's until now and still now, but hopefully not too long. I really like that stigma of not being connected is, um, it's a big deal. And, and I think that back to the cyber thing that you're saying like we can, we can get that hit of Serotonin by getting a, like on facebook or instagram or whatever. We can get that. But that pain, I mean, I don't even want to make a comparison toward actually sitting, sitting down with somebody and actually feeling and, and experiencing them. Yeah. It's, you can't make a comparison. No, it's not okay to me. I don't, yeah, it's just something different.

Speaker 2:          01:08:09       I'm in a tricky position because I rely on social media to let people know that I have a podcast coming out, you know, like right before the podcast I was like, what's your twitter? So I can tweet it. And then I also like to promote comedy dates and to let people know about cool shit that I find, but the, the interaction is so, it's so weird. Like especially there's like a bunch of different kinds of interactions. Like instagram is one of the weird ones because the Qantas people all have blocked pages. It's like they're blocking, don't look at me and they just say nasty shit to people. But they have these block pages. It's like, but I think that that's, it's so funny how that seems to be like it's so common, but it makes sense. It's like they're blocked off and they're attacking people in Saint Shitty things.

Speaker 2:          01:08:55       To be blunt, I'm not even talking about, to me, I'm talking about like when I go to someone else's page and I read [inaudible] things, I always go to that I go, let's see if that guy is blocked. Yup. He's blocked. How funny. Like it's super common. It's like this weird thing that people are doing with each other. What's not real interaction and I feel like the people that are perpetrating it are extremely unhealthy, which is why they're saying such nasty, vicious shit in the first place. It's really, really odd. They're lonely. Yeah. No, I mean in some way or disconnected or disenfranchised or they feel inferior and so they lash out. They want other people to feel the way they feel.

Speaker 4:          01:09:33       And so what I, what I feel when you say that, like one thing that's missing there is empathy in that, in that interact, whatever that interaction is. It's this removed story that you're making up some, some like whatever you want the world, you know, projecting your shit out into the world. You're not actually slowing down enough to, you know, you can sit here and give opinions or whatever all day long. But you know the, but to what you said though, it is a weird position, but I think the way that things are going, so we are using these tools, social media to connect us and to get messages out. But you know, the way that the, like the millennial generation is going is that what they value and what they want to spend their money on. There's meaningful experiences, which means, you know, generally speaking, alive in person event.

Speaker 4:          01:10:19       And I think there is a wave of things going back to this. So, you know, as a tool we need that. I mean this is amazing. You know, this platform, this podcast, you have the touching so many people or just twitter, whatever it is. But then it can be used for incredible good to bring two people together I think. And then, and then so what's missing in that? In that social media interaction. Uh, I don't know. Maybe it balances out. Maybe it doesn't, I don't really know. But a message in a bottle, he just got to make sure it's a good message. You know, you're not going to,

Speaker 2:          01:10:49       you're not, you'd have to like be cognizantly aware I think of how other people are going to receive it without actually getting that perception back from them. You know, it's, and that's where it gets real weird and you have to like, I think apply the same principle

Speaker 4:          01:11:05       goals that you would in communicating with other people, like without actually communicating with, without seeing them, without getting the social that look in

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       them in the eye and

Speaker 4:          01:11:15       where, where a weird thing, man, this might not make sense, but I'm going to bring it back to connect to the wilderness stuff. What we're talking about in this sense of this sort of isolation and loneliness that we have and for me in my life where I learned to connect with others, where I really learned to sort of give it up, let go be present with people was in the wilderness. It was, it was doing that job out in the desert with kids out there for eight to 20 days at a time with these kids were, that was my job. It was my job to simply be with them and in a way, uh, to be with them in a way that was, um, you know, obviously we had a lot of boundaries and everything, but to be really real, just to be totally real and honest and straight forward call bullshit when we saw bullshit, be empathetic and it was just like this crazy crash course in human connection.

Speaker 4:          01:12:09       And I happened to be out in the wilderness, but so what I think this is, this is, it'll tie it together, but for me I started to feel way, way, way more human being out there in the wilderness. Like just being out there. What was quiet being out there where like, you know, if I sat on a rock, I was sitting on a rock in the sun was on me and all of my senses were engaged, you know, very aware of my body. We were in these groups where we're being practicing, being very aware of what we felt and being able to feel and express that. And it just felt like, um, you know, since then for me, it all comes back to, to being out in the wilderness. But since then, all the other things I've engaged in meditation, the men's group stuff, all the other person, even psychedelics, things like that.

Speaker 4:          01:12:56       All the things that I've experienced all for me tie back to that thing and it, it comes down to what I feel is like being totally as much as you can truly present. Yeah. Like just, just here right now. Right. And you can write a twitter message from that place of being present. Right. That's fine. I mean there's, there's nothing necessarily wrong or bad about that, but um, but don't check the responses every three minutes for the next six hours. I'm like a fucking maniac. Yeah. It's a, it's a matter of, I guess, rationing, rationing some of the,

Speaker 2:          01:13:31       some of that social media stuff are rationing some of that online interaction with other people. I feel like as time has gone on, I've, I've gotten much more of my online interaction in like an educational forum in terms of like interesting articles, right? Science things, things that don't involve like a social interaction or opinion as much as they involve really fascinating facts. Yeah. Like, um, something that I've found today, they think that North America might have been settled by humans as much as a hundred thousand years earlier than they thought. I saw that. You see that? I did. It's insane. Like that

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       kind of Shit freaks me out. I love that kind of stuff because that kind of stuff is just pure curiosity and pure wonder. And the imagination goes wild. Thinking about what it must've been like to be one of these early humans surviving are trying to survive. And if they didn't, we wouldn't be here. And these, these, uh, mastodon fossils, they found them, the bones were shattered and there's rocks nearby that do not seem like they were broad anywhere. So it was 1992 they were doing highway construction near San Diego and they found these odd looking bones. And then they started doing these, um, uh, studies on them, and then they found that their mastodon bones and they didn't have the ability to do carbon testing and get a real accurate assessment back then, but now they do. And so now when they're checking these bones and the way these bones had been shattered, they're pretty sure that they had been shattered, purposely like to get to the marrow. Wow. Yeah. So that, yeah, that's a great example of a, a positive benefit. Yesterday I, uh, I, I meditated for about 80 minutes or so, and then I, and I, I sat up afterwards and I clicked on my phone and open facebook. And the first thing I clicked on it, let's say with a video of a woman in slow motion who stuck her ass out the window of a bus and just shat the street.

Speaker 1:          01:15:34       And I just, I just, I had to laugh to myself, man. I was just like in the zone, you know, I was in this beautiful place and then we'll open once I says, oh my God reminded me of Calvin's one joke that shitting out of the car at 80 miles an hour, that youtube video. I think, yeah, I've, I've definitely seen too many of those videos. I've seen too many videos of people getting beat up too. Too many videos of street fights. Too many videos of people like skateboard accidents where they fucking flip and fall on their head. It's hard to not watch that though. Right, right. Hard. Very hard. Very, very hard. I mean, I feel like there's something to be learned in those videos. Like I almost want to show my kids, Hey, don't try to do flips if you don't know what you're doing.

Speaker 1:          01:16:17       Atlanta in your fucking head. But you know, I mean, understanding the consequences and having someone else do it so you can learn from them. They've already done it. So here learn, this is what, this is why you don't fuck with a tiger. See, look, the guy got killed by the tiger. Now, you know, this is why you don't do, this is why you don't do that. Like there's gotta be some educational value in those. Ah, yeah. I'm sure that's all I can reach a little bit. Yeah. I mean, we have some pretty strong instincts in us to say, don't fuck with the dumb kids, man. It's like, it's almost like dumb kids are there as educational tools for the survivors. It's like you're supposed to see that one kid poke the tiger and get mauled. He like, shit, I can't believe he actually broke into the zoo and now bobby's gone. You know, like bobby, like I mean, that's the Joseph Campbell a story. The hero that it

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       goes all the way back to the one person who sacrificed their life. Yeah. And got killed by the Predator in front of the tribe and so that the tribe could survive and then they, they worshiped that person for doing that. Yeah. Yeah. The, the hero goes off, learns some lesson, brings it back to the community and everybody's better for it. Or You watch the hero get mauled, he's a martyr. Then you escape. All the hyenas are eating them. One of the things we taught or we've worked with kids out in the woods was that we call the natural consequences, right. Which, which just means that when you do something, something else happens, there is a natural reaction and it was used a lot of times, um, in opposition or instead of of like a, uh, penalty system. Right. So if you do something bad, we could, we could lay this punishment on top of you.

Speaker 4:          01:18:00       Like what kind of stuff I made. Oh, well. So for example, if, um, if somebody was going to harm themselves or somebody else, you got target, you got to you, we put out a tarp and your shoes and everything will be taken away from you and you, and you couldn't leave the tarp like that. That was where you had to stay because you can hurt yourself. You couldn't hurt anybody else. Wow. Um, so that was, you know, at some of that to do with their shoes, ate them. No. What did you put them in your tent or under your tongue? And so they had this day, like under a tarp. Is that the idea or a, if it was raining it happened. No, I mean otherwise it's just, it was just basically a timeout. Let's see. Now you got to stay here. You can interact with the group.

Speaker 4:          01:18:42       You're by yourself, whatever. Uh, that's actually not the best example, but I'll just use it. So if you swore you could, some programs would maybe have a point system you get penalized for clients. Yeah, yeah. I mean that wasn't named Sol. So yeah, it wasn't really upheld. I'm reaching for a good example here. What I'm trying to say is that if you do something Shitty, generally you heard others around you and things things happen. And so what we tried to show is that if kids would do something shitty to, uh, pay attention and that they would see the harm they're creating themselves by courier, by harming other people rather than just like, you know, uh, in society, just locking a kid up for breaking the law. Um, it would be, you know, maybe if you break a window, you in this other way, you would go and actually see and experience the, the, the shit that other people had to do to fix the window and do all that, you know, more repairative type of justice system rather than like a, a penalty punitive, punitive.

Speaker 4:          01:19:43       That's right. Yeah. Right. So when you did take these kids, like what was like the most extreme example of someone who's like really disturbed? Because I would imagine there would be like a big sort of, uh, like there was a lot of variables. Like some people would be kind of fucked up and some people would be really fucked up. It's probably a spectrum, right? Oh, absolutely. Generally speaking, very few where I would say actually fucked up. Very, very, very, very, very few. What were, what was the case with most of them? Um, they were kids in families and like communities that didn't know how to make space for and deal with them. They didn't, the mentors, they didn't have people to, didn't have parents that, that gave them the right direction. I don't know. You know, like being a kid is, is uh, you're supposed to test boundaries, right?

Speaker 4:          01:20:29       It's like that's the part of your development in your ontogeny that it's like you are defining your personality, you defining who you are and you need to test the boundaries. And um, you know, some of the kids made, uh, only two. I probably worked with at least a thousand, maybe more kids altogether. Uh, maybe that's a stretch a lot, right? For a lot, for a long time. And only one I went to bed at night worried I might get my head kicked in just one, one kid. And um, maybe one or two other kids that I walked away actually not enjoying being around them. Almost every other single one. It was just like walked away as you do about the one that you worried about getting your head kicked in, you know, just kind of just kind of sat with it and there's really nothing easy did, it was just like initially or through the entire experience that was through the whole thing.

Speaker 4:          01:21:24       She, that was through the whole thing that was uncomfortable. Fuck that. What happened to him? Oh, he's doing now? No, I have no idea. You know, there's, I mean there's laws and there's things you don't generally get to stay in touch. Oh, right, right. What was actually at a, uh, a state program. So this was, uh, um, in lieu of a jail sentence that came out. So, so this kid was locked up. Wow. What did he do? I don't remember. I don't know. Probably stole a car or beat somebody up or, I don't know. He was just super aggressive. He wasn't, no, but if he had that he had the, I had the feeling that he had no empathy for others pain. Right. And he couldn't feel that that's the, that's the only time it ever got any interaction with any of those kids ever got, you know, that that sent chills through me.

Speaker 4:          01:22:11       You know, that was like, and maybe maybe I didn't feel in any practical sense that he was going to hurt me, but I had the sense that if he did, he wouldn't care. Right. Oh Wow. Because there wasn't that connection and the same thing we're talking about in a sense, like that's a thing. Get dropped in a, in a group of eight boys or young men. And, uh, it was so funny, like you could, you know, we worked with therapists with therapists come in, all this stuff, but all like the fundamental thing I took away from that experience was that in order for these, for these guys to grow up and sort of move on and get going in their lives, you know, what they needed was just somebody like me to just show up. Like, because we're really not complicated, right? And, and so just let them air things out and talk about better ways to do things and sort of get some perspective.

Speaker 4:          01:23:00       Now, you know, we maybe talked about this last time, but then they'd go home and not necessarily have that support anymore and be back in their old, uh, arena where we're, um, you know, they're old friends and their old family dynamic and all that and it, and it, you know, it's hard. That's a hard way. And so I left that whole experience, just feeling very strongly that a, we can as a community and society just way better with some simple, simple changes we can do better at raising our boys. We just can't because done it. When you have someone that has no empathy though, what can be done to instill empathy in someone who lacks it, if anything? So I don't know. You know, if you go on that far end of the spectrum where there's nothing, I don't know. And I don't know if that's possible, but I do know that it's a muscle we can practice. Empathy is something that we can get better at and that we can pay more attention. That's fucked up

Speaker 2:          01:23:58       young kid without empathy. Like how, what, what sort of motivation do they have to gain empathy if they feel like no one has shown it towards them or I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:24:09       So that's, that's it. That's it. Right. So the motivation that you, I believe you could show is for them to, if they could let you caring about them really in, if they could really feel cared about and what's incredibly sad but real is that I think some people you know, grow up in, in, uh, their brains develop, they develop as humans where they don't have that. And so the actual wiring, the actual state to Ha to receive that isn't there, I think that that is possible to gain. And you know, there's been, what does that a child called it, you know, have you heard of that book? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think it's possible in a much, in a less extreme cases. Um, I mean in a sense that that's kind of a lot of what I do is help guys become more empathetic and the not just for the benefit of others for the benefit of themselves.

Speaker 2:          01:25:11       The reason why I brought this up, there's a podcast I'm on radio lab about Bernie madoff. Okay. And, um, where this guy contacted Bernie Madoff, he sent him letters and then finally Bernie madoff called them and they did this interview together, or the way it works in prison, I guess at least the prison where Bernie madoff is, you get 15 minutes to talk on the phone and then you have to wait 15 minutes before he could talk again and then 15 minutes again. And so they, this is how they did the interview, like 15 minutes on, 15 minutes off. And after a while he sort of gained his trust and he went deep into how this whole deception started and how Bernie made off. If you don't know the whole story, burning man off as a guy who had this gigantic Ponzi scheme and stole billions of dollars from people and it's called Ponzi Supernova is the a radio lab episode.

Speaker 2:          01:26:02       Wow. And, uh, one of the things that was the most chilling was how little empathy he had towards the people that he ripped off, right. Whose lives had been destroyed. His son committed suicide. Um, uh, people like literally went from having all this money to being so broke. They were like dumpster diving and he didn't care. Didn't give a fuck. Yeah. I mean he, he, he had no empathy and he's a monster. I mean it's, it's really, it's really interesting to see like this guy's reaction to Bernie madoff's lack of empathy and realizing somewhere along the line like, oh, this guy does not care. That was one of the things that the investigators had said about him, that it didn't seem to bother him at all. That he had done this to these people that would, what bothered him was that he had gotten caught, but it didn't bother him that these people had been devastated.

Speaker 2:          01:26:54       What bothered him was like that people had made money, weren't giving that money back. Like he'd called one guy and told him the guide made like $9 billion. He was worth $9 billion, rather, it's 7 billion of it had come from Bernie madoff's Ponzi scheme. And he told me how to give that $7 billion back. The guy had a heart attack drown in his pool, which is kind of hilarious because you can't live with 2 billion. Yeah, I guess. Well, maybe it's not liquid. Maybe he couldn't give back the 7 billion. Maybe it was impossible. It was tied up in real estate and holdings and this and that and the other thing. But isn't it amazing that one person's reality could, I would love to step into his head for a second. I want you to, Bernie made him just to see what it felt like. I think that'd be very helpful to be able to step into that because just to see, I can't picture it.

Speaker 2:          01:27:42       I just can't picture it. Well, I could also couldn't picture not being able to live with $2 billion. He like what? What is it? I, it's that weirdness of the game, right? It's like you, you score a hundred points. You want to score a thousand point score thousand. He wanted score a million score, 1,000,001 score a billion. It's like you never stop and people never, they never achieve peace. Like that's what I always used to say about Bill Gates. Like why the fuck is Bill Gates still working out here about him being the richest and now he's not. I mean he really did sort of find some sort of a balance and now almost all of his work is done towards humanitarian efforts. He's, you know, he donates a lot of money, a lot of charities. I mean, a lot of really good work, like post his Microsoft career, which is like really kind of unique that a guy sort of found his way, found his back, kept a shit load of money.

Speaker 2:          01:28:32       Don't get me wrong. You know, apparently he's got some stupid fucking house with a submarine in the Pacific northwest where like if someone tries to break into his house, he could fucking escape in a submarine. I kayaked by his house one second. Jim, did they let you to secret service fucking swarm you and ask you where you're going? Yeah. Nobody, I couldn't see anybody. They're probably all lunch. Are you allowed to just walk by his house? How's that work? Well, it was a private island, at least the place that I was at. I was just told by the guy I was with, we were actually throwing crab pots

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       out of a Kayak and, um, I was just told it was his house. I don't if it's mean house might have been one of his houses, but, uh, we were, you know, I dunno. 50 yards off shore and it was a private island, private island. That's when you're, yeah. Paul, when you got, you're on an island, you know, what does an island,

Speaker 2:          01:29:19       Tyler Perry, the guy that makes us shitty movies and TV shows those awful shows.

Speaker 4:          01:29:24       Tyler Perry. Yeah. He has a private, now he has a private room where, I don't know, you can't know if you know, I actually feel, uh, some sadness for Bernie madoff. Really? Oh yeah, man. I mean, that's, I dunno. He's as tortured as you know. I think it's harder to feel empathy for him, but he's as tortured of human is. I don't know. Pick anybody maybe. Right? Yeah, maybe. Maybe not. I, yeah, I'm, I'm projecting. I don't know. That's a fact, but I don't know if you, if you're hurting that many people, are you, are you kidding me? Like you, you, you aren't feeling, you don't feel all right. Yeah. You know, it's a

Speaker 2:          01:30:01       weird line. Like, when do you feel bad for someone? Do you feel bad for Jeffrey Dahmer? Like how did he become that cannibal murderer guys? How did, how did that happen? You know, like what, what causes someone to go from like, you have a boy, what causes someone to go from your cute little baby boy to being some monster? Yeah. Like how does that, what is it about people that makes it possible for someone to go even not for to a monster, but how about that young boy that you were working with? It had no empathy. You worried about sleeping near like, Woo Hoo. What happens? Like the developmental process of a human being is way more fascinating to me, uh, as an adult with children than it was when I was a young man when I was young man. And I was single and I didn't have any kids. I just thought people were fucked up and some people weren't. The people that are fucked up, fucked him and death penalty and like kicked her ass. And Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:30:52       So I've been obsessed with this. My, all my life has been absolutely like what, what is this process of growing? Have you ever heard of the novel sidharth no, by Hermann Hesse Hessa I'm not sure how to say that, but it's a classic novel, an author from Germany and, and it, it chronicles the life of a young guy named Sid Arthur. But the whole book, what it is, is it goes through his entire life from when he was born until he dies. And in it are these like very specific stages of life. So He's, you know, he's like young wandering years and then he needs to work. So he goes to a city and he learns from a, from a trader and then he needs to learn about love. So he, so he gets with a prostitute but, but all in these big stages and that book did something to me at an early age.

Speaker 4:          01:31:39       I just got obsessed with this process of maturing. And there's a, there's a term for it called ontogeny, which is the, the process of an organism's growth over their lifespan. It's just this natural sort of arc, a tree. Then ontogeny of a tree is, it is a, you know, a seed that drops and then it sprouts and then it routes and then it grows and then it dies and it, and it is, yeah, it's been an obsession of mine and you know, getting thrown into that work of working with kids and yeah, it's, it's, um, uh, I'm, I'm so fascinated by it and I don't have obviously any, you know, solid, here's how it goes. But, but I've been looking into it for a long time and, um, I just, I think that, oh, anyway, back to the book, the, I used to read that book out loud to these groups of kids I was working on.

Speaker 4:          01:32:28       We'd sit around a fire at night and I'd read a novel and it would be out there for days. So you've got the time to read a novel out loud. And, uh, you know, it's just something poetic, not about just the words but about watching the life, someone's life unfold as a whole story and watching them, you know, I dunno, grow up and yeah, it's just, it's this weird fascination I have and it's specifically because in an all com and it keeps saying it comes back to that time in the woods, but I only worked with males with boys and it wasn't, I didn't choose to do that. I felt like, do a lot of girls do the same sort of therapy? Yeah. Yeah. I think they must go with women too. It's probably a problem with men going out there with girls. They'll do mixed a leadership group.

Speaker 4:          01:33:14       So like a male and a female from, for both boys and girls. But yeah, there's always a girl with the girls. Um, but yeah, man, I just got obsessed with this. What, what, how do we grow up? What does it look like? What's it feel like? How come it's not happening? Cause that's a big part of what I felt as I looked around is that I think that a lot of adult physically adult men walk around with, uh, parts of themselves that are still in their team, six to 18. You know, like there's, there's this human maturation process is human journey that we all have available to us that I, um, you know, I think we're too busy a lot of times to let it actually flow and happen. Well, I think that true, that's true. But I also think that there's a maturation process that comes from overcoming obstacles.

Speaker 4:          01:34:04       I would, a lot of people just don't encounter, they don't encounter difficulty so they don't learn about them. So that's part of it. But I think that a lot of times, even if they do encounter difficulty, they don't let themselves actually feel, they don't let themselves experience it. Right. Like everybody has shitty things happen to them. But you can keep that shitty thing at a distance from you. You're right, you can't, you can like kind of address it. You can sort of, I dunno, act out against it, but unless you actually feel, you know, I mean, think about this, this gets into things like, uh, trauma and resilience and how people are able to move on from hardship. Right? And, and a lot of the research, um, there's a, uh, psychiatrist called Bessel van der Kolk. Never heard of him. No. Fascinating dude. He's a, he started working with the va in Boston and, uh, worked with returning vets from, um, from Vietnam and then did this whole lifetime of study about trauma and how it comes into humans and how you can move through it and how can heal it and all this stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:35:11       And uh, it, it just, it, it basically comes down to, uh, being able like to be more resilient, to be able to get over things to say a death in the family or an attack or an assault or whatever, whatever that trauma could be. That if you don't allow the body and the, your system to actually go through feel and process what's going on, you lock it up, you lock it up, you like it. Uh, and it, it doesn't, I mean, it's almost like it gets implanted in you somewhere and then it just festers esters. And it's, and the cool thing is, is that the, you know, the, the science now is, is showing the, the very specifics of this. It's not just, I mean, it's still theory, right? But it's, um, so I feel like I got off of what we were talking about there.

Speaker 4:          01:36:02       Uh, but yeah, I, I feel like, like you said, being able to overcome things. Of course. Absolutely. And part of that is just to me, um, again, speaking more from a male perspective here, but part of that, and I think a lot of what our culture says is, okay, is let's, uh, horse our way through this. Right? Let's force it, let's push harder. Let's, let's conquer our fears and our feelings. That's, let's not address it. Let's just push, right. Run through the wall. Basically we're taking the depressants. Well, right? So that's, that's the thing. Then there's this other whole way to, to get through hardship, which is by actually surrendering to it and letting your in this like brilliant system that we have as humans to process it and get through it. Right. And that's, that's a way to wholeness and health in some ways, right? I think they're both important. I mean like, yeah, you need to be able to, uh, you know, ignore the pain and, and power your way up that mountain or, or save somebody that's getting hurt or whatever. And then there's this other part I think that needs to be in balance, which is accepting what's happening and getting through. I just a way to accept what's happening and let your body do what it needs.

Speaker 2:          01:37:16       Well, I also think there's an extreme lack of discipline that a lot of people have and the discipline, a lot of it comes from overcoming difficult obstacles and understanding the work that's required to get things done. Making these little leaps and bounds, making these improvements in your life, getting better at things. I think those things are really critical to the human mind. Yeah. I think the mind has desires and one of the big desires is it has a desire for improvement and his desire to achieve goals. And there's a lot of people that these goals are laid out by other people. These goals are like graduating from third grade, graduating from fourth grade, a lot of shit that you don't want to do. So these goals are

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       meaningless to you, so you never feel like you've accomplished anything that you actually want to do. And next thing you know what, you're a 35 year old man working for an insurance company. You don't want to be there and you don't have any real part of you that you've nurtured. You just sort of plugged you into these other weird shapes and conform to them and then you just want to go fucking crazy and probably bitched about it all the way along probably. Yeah, you probably complained and you're annoying and you're a whining little twat and you're out there just clogging up the freeway, beep it at people and giving them the finger. I mean, that's a lot of humans that you run into. That's a lot of, it's a lot of this life. So yeah, and that points directly to what you know I do and what I'm building is, is that, so you take eight of those guys and you set up a room and you say, all right in this space right here, fuck all that.

Speaker 1:          01:38:45       We're going to be actually honest and say what we're feeling but maybe can't even really access. So like all that frustration, all that shit, whatever. It could be anything that's so hard for people to do. Right? Like what, what kind of techniques do you employ to get someone like say if you've got some guy who was closed off and it's been bullshitting his way through life and then all of a sudden here he is, this 35 year old guy that's really troubled. It's in a room with you. How do you get that guy to open up safety and safety leading by example and being vulnerable by example. And when somebody says it's part of this connection, like sitting down with somebody that if you, after one of these last retreats, one of the guys came up to me and said, safety is the new Iowasca, which is maybe a strange thing to say, but he said he'd been all over the world doing drugs, trying to find growth, trying to find himself.

Speaker 1:          01:39:33       And when he went home and went to this retreat and all we did was sit down and say, okay, our intention, all we're doing what we actually are doing here is just, uh, making this, you're not going to be, you're going to be supported. You're not going to be laughed at like, like it's a safe space to do it. And then you just, uh, you dive in and lead by example and that example, like plugs, others right into it. Like it's this amazing like symbiotic thing that happens, right? And, and people just sometimes break open, sometimes cracks slowly open. But you know, all of a sudden, so maybe after 35 years of only being other people's program, you get in touch with what you actually feel, what you actually want and who you actually are. It's just like this fucking, it's like Holy Shit. I think for a lot of people it's really difficult to try to do what you actually want to because you've spent so much time rewarding yourself with material items for these little accomplishments that you've, you've become in debt and you really can't escape the system. I mean, that's totally real problem with people. They have all the car that they're leasing, they have a house that they're renting or even worse that they bought and then they, they're stuck and then they don't know what the fuck to do. They have to keep this insurance company job and they're just rotting them out from the inside.

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       Totally. Yeah. I mean there's like a whole society built on, on uh, trying to keep you not who you are in a sense. I think, you know, but so what we're finding, which is really amazing, is that if you stay on that surface level, if you stay on that sort of, um, I don't know, like, so trying to improve yourself goes so far, but it's kind of like an iceberg thing, right? So like if your goal is to make more money, right? And here's your goal and you're going toward it and you and your, I dunno, listen to podcasts or you do all this stuff and you try to figure out how to do it, how do I, how do I do it? How did it, and you keep hitting a wall, you keep getting sort of, uh, thrown down and you don't really understand that underneath meanwhile is this massive sort of like pent up shit.

Speaker 4:          01:41:41       And if you address that massive pent up shit, then all of a sudden getting to that goal is a whole different story. It's a whole different story. It's a, it's, um, it's like always trimming the, like if you need to get rid of a tree in your yard, but all you do is every day you chop the leaves off the leaves off. But if you address that, the roots, the deeper stuff and uh, you know, and again, there's a stigma against that, especially for dudes. Right? So there's this, like, guys don't want to go to therapy, guys don't want to get into woo hippie spiritual shift do, and they're annoying. Sure. Right. They don't want to get into it. Right, exactly. And I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I pull this off or not, but I feel fluent than in a like, you know, broke.

Speaker 1:          01:42:30       Sure. And fluent in, you know, like I've, I've, I've gone down that spiritual route two and, um, well you recognize when the spiritual route is legitimate and when the spiritual route is like a rose as well. Like sometimes even the spiritual route. It's just something that someone has plugged themselves into to try to find some meaning. Exactly. Meanwhile, it's not authentic. Exactly. Um, so how are you doing this if you don't mind me interrupting? Like what? So you're, you're planning on taking guys, like say, say if I'm that 35 year old guy that works in insurance company for example, and I'm just fucked up and I just, I'm going crazy, man, I need to do something. Hey, this seems interesting to me. Wilderness therapy. What does it mean Dan Dodi, what does that mean? How do I get involved in this and how do you, how do you get me out of this regimen?

Speaker 1:          01:43:12       Yeah. So three things we're offering right now. And um, the first is a is the wilderness route, which is a like a six day expedition and you can sign up, pay some money, and go out in the woods and change your life. Like pretty well climb mountains will go fishing. Well, uh, and all along. So I'll set up this sense of safety in this community and this sense of a brotherhood. And how many guys do you go with, you know, 10 or 12 for that? Just you and these 10 people. A couple of the leaders in my couple leaders, right, because you have to deal with interpersonal disputes and all the nonsense you're going to have to shoot likely in shelter. Right. And I'm, I'm working

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       with, uh, some guides to just take care of the logistical stuff so that I can manage the, the group, the group stuff more. That's one offering. That's, that's, that's uh, that's kind of our capstone offering. We're doing weekend retreats and we've been doing these for the last six months and they'd been just catching on fire about 30 guys at a time, uh, in a lodge, been doing them in the Berkshire's. So out in the woods, it's a couple hours from New York City, 30 guys there and just set up sort of an intense weekend experience of practicing this stuff and we'll hike and do trail work and, and all that stuff. But more importantly to do with the, the self, you know, diving into yourself with in the presence of other guys, which is, um, just, you know, I've done therapy. I've been in therapy. I'm not a therapist, but, um, when it's been very helpful, like if you work with a good therapist, that really is really good.

Speaker 4:          01:44:43       I couldn't recommend it more, but there's something about this, these men's retreats, which I totally understand sound on attractive to a lot of guys. I just like, sounds like a lot of butt fucking yeah, of course. Of course. That that is, that is your, that is the big first sort of response, right? Well, it's, Huh? Tell me more. We, I can be open in the woods. We what we made a, uh, one of our advertising videos for it and it just starts out that a guy stands up and says, yeah, I heard about a men's retreat and I thought the first thing I thought was this is going to be fucking awful. And so I get it. But, um, yeah, I think we're getting further enough along where the guys that are going through this or are literally coming back with the most positive feedback that I could, I couldn't write this shit like, like changing their lives and just like literally, um, because it's, uh, you know, back to that thing we're, we're offering a place for them to accept a part of themselves that's been offline for a long time.

Speaker 2:          01:45:45       That's a big fucking deal. It's a really, yeah, it's all, it's probably also a big fucking deal to just separate from the high for a little bit and just be outside of cell phone range and be in the woods and just take a big, deep breath of fresh air and look around at the wilderness and just realize that this is, this is reality as well. And you're, you've been plugged into this civilization reality, this, this city, this urban environment, which is entirely unnatural and is only been a real thing for the past couple hundred years. Like literally didn't exist for the gigantic swath of humanity that, that existed before that.

Speaker 4:          01:46:26       Yeah. I think that it isn't the right word. They're not really, I think it does a couple deep things. It, it lights up this, this, um, this neurobiology that, that of us as social animals. I think it, it goes back to, um, more of a tribal sense of living too. It's, it's like all of a sudden you, you went from being isolated and lonely to heaven, 30 dudes who would honestly fucking do anything for you in that moment. And I got a buddy, a good buddy as a return special forces operator and he, he sits in my men's group in Bozeman with me and really struggled with coming home and then found our group. And within a month his life was back on track. Like I like just killing it man. Just like kicking ass. And you know, I mean there is a connection between, I wouldn't say the general military, but the special forces, you know, you read books and hear about the aspect of brotherhood and how they're there for each other.

Speaker 4:          01:47:22       You know, this is definitely a very different venue. But the, I think the bond and connection that that has created out of it is, um, and this is, you know, from, from his mouth too, is it's, he went, you know, I don't know how many years, several years in special forces w living with in close connection to guys got thrown home. It was all of a sudden isolated and they came into our group and just had this, this closeness again, and it just Bam, just like back to back to killing it. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, I mean, I've very aware, I mean it's, I've been scared to start speaking about this for years, man. I mean, it's very, uh, to me even I look at advertising for similar man's programs and things that

Speaker 2:          01:48:09       done it just so turned off. I'm like, go, seems weird. It does seem that people need resets. You need some sort of recent, and we've talked about this before, about, we've both experienced those resets through psychedelics or, or through these hunting trips, you know, and these wilderness trips like, but I think people get caught up in the momentum of their daily existence and all the requirements of that daily existence and they become overwhelming. You know, like we were talking about like the your lease that you have on your car or your mortgage that you have in your house and the credit card bills that keep coming in your student loans, you need to eventually get to and blah. It's a fucking overwhelming grind. Yeah. And sometimes people need something that removes them entirely from it for a certain amount of time that allows you just the fresh air, not, not just literal flesh air, but the metaphorical fresh air of allowing you to just separate from the all these weird influences and all this weird energy and momentum, the momentum of the life that you've created or that's been created for you, that you're sort of trapped in.

Speaker 2:          01:49:12       Yeah. Yeah. Man. Aye. Aye Fit. So that reset thing, I mean, I,

Speaker 4:          01:49:19       I think I want a warning is that if you start getting a reset, I mean from my own experience I needed pretty regularly. Yeah. You know, so the actually the biggest goal of, of this, of every man, the organization I founded is to, our goal is to get a million guys in man's groups because that is the same. And it happened. So this last retreat had 30 guys show up. Um, about 20 of them wanted to immediately get a weekly group

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       to, to basically continuing regularly experienced the same thing gets, it's like a hit, you know, like too about men in this culture where there's not a lot of sympathy towards men that are struggling. And it seems like there's this thought that men are the patriarchy and we're dominating the world and we're almost like sub human. We're responsible for all these issues. So men with issues like, Oh, cry me a fucking river. What about women with issues? What about Trans people with issues? What about gay people with issues? What about black? Oh, Jesus Christ. Like a regular white guy with issues like your issues are bullshit. They can't like, but it doesn't matter. You are who you are. You can't change the fact that you're a white guy. So if you're a white guy with problems, nobody gives a fuck. Can't they see that it all connects though?

Speaker 1:          01:50:32       No, they don't see that white makes everybody else unhappy too. When the dope man they don't because it's not convenient for their narrative. The narratives that you're responsible for all the problems in the world, even though you're just Dan Dodi from Bozeman, Montana. No, I get it. But it's, it's so, I mean that's one of the most powerful, so the podcast that I'm launching is a self improvement podcasts for guys. But instead of going to experts and saying, hey, you know, what's the best morning routine that you can do? Designing a routine or whatever. I'm talking to regular guys and, and asking them to share more vulnerable than they would normally would because that's what happens in these scenarios is that we learn from each other just to simple human fucking beings. We're just like, you know, like one guy might share that he's having trouble with his son, for example, with his kid, he doesn't know how to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:51:24       And you know, like no matter what, I don't care. Like a bunch of other guys will say like, Holy Shit, I thought I was the only one feeling, you know? And it's just all of a sudden you and it's back this isolation thing, you think that your, I don't think we're fucking special, right? We all think that we're still unique and the actual, if we actually took the time to connect with one another, we'd be like, Oh wow, we have a lot. And just that, just that is enough to, uh, drastically change somebody's Day. And what is motivating you to venture off because you were working for 0.0 is big production company and they make no meat eater and Anthony Bourdain's show and all these different shows. What's motivating you to step away from that and start doing this? This is what I've always wanted to do and this is what I've been, what compels you?

Speaker 1:          01:52:18       I want to help guys, Eh, yeah. I just, I, and I know that I can, you know, even if it's just one guy, whatever it is, but working out there with these kids and seeing all of this, it just, it just left me with the, the deepest, deepest satisfaction, fulfillment, satisfaction, but also a sense of purpose. It's like, and then I tell you what, man, I had a, I had a boy, I had a son last year and when he came out and there was something inside me that said, if you don't do, if you don't act on what you know, you can bring, if fuck you, fuck it. Like this is your key. Like, like there is, um, I dunno, I'm also, you know, I was born, uh, a fairly sensitive, I could feel I was born a sensitive kid, right? I could feel other people's pain. And when I'm, you know, working with these kids and now these men, I mean, I dunno, I want, I want good for people, right? I want good for you. I want good for my family and I want good for, I don't know, I feel connected and I, and I want to do it right.

Speaker 2:          01:53:22       It's a noble purpose. I was just curious about like what, I mean, you, you have a very promising career in a lucrative career with 0.0. So for you to leave that it has to be like a really compelling sort of a,

Speaker 1:          01:53:33       yeah, I mean, that job and that career was an amazing wild ride and in some ways felt like, uh, you know, a temporary sidebar from what I'm really meant to do. You know, I've been, I've been writing for a long time and um, yeah, I think that, uh, whatever this thing is that I'm doing it, it chose me somehow or I don't know. Maybe that's, I don't know if that's true or not, but I don't know. How long can you ignore the thing inside you that screams at you that says you have to do this, you have to do this or you want to do, yeah. Well, you shouldn't. Yeah. You definitely shouldn't. Yeah. I mean it's obviously beneficial and so obviously something you're compelled to do and it's obviously something that you feel is very fulfilling. So why ignore it? So when do you start this podcast?

Speaker 1:          01:54:21       It's out. It's out. It's out. What's it called? It's called the every man podcast. He every man podcast. Yep. Evr Why man? What about checks? No fuck off. Fuck off chicks. You got your own. You got Oprah. Okay. I know. I mean, that's a good question. I don't think it's uh, why uh, why do you spell it that way? Cause Shit out of people. Well, because the full one was like a lot of money or it wasn't available. The website, it was just a practicality thing. Okay. Yeah. E v. E r. Y. M. A. N was uh, not evie. Our why. So evr why folks? Evr Why man podcast? How many episodes do you have out to now and then? Yeah, to writing. Are you doing them every week? Like how are you doing it? I'm going to try. It would probably be a every two weeks to start and then just got to get in the swing. You're on itunes. Yeah, the whole, all that jazz. Beautiful Man. Yeah. All right, well let's wrap it up.
