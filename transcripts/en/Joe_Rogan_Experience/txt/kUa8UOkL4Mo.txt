Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Here we go. Four, three, two, one. Boom. And we'll live cat. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good to see you here. Thanks for having me. My pleasure. My pleasure. I'm looking forward to talking to you for a while. I know it's, uh, I feel like been a long time coming. I don't even know how much time we have affiliate. There's a hell of a lot to catch up on. Yeah, there's a lot to talk about. Always. You're a getting ready for Boise. That's your, uh, your next fine pleats fighting. I'm Marijn renowned, um, July 14th, the end, the century link arena. Now you took, you took a good stretch off, right?

Speaker 2:          00:00:37       A couple of times. Yeah, a couple of times. I, um, let's see. After I fought Meesha, I blew my knee and then the world exploded in. So I had I think 18 months off between that and fighting, uh, Amanda. And then after I fought Amanda, I saw Amanda was like September 27, something like that. And I fought Ronda February 28th. And then after Ronda, uh, took another big stretch off, fought Juliana the following year, July 9th, and then this was another big stretch off. So yeah, it's been a little bit scattered, but doing what I can.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       Yeah, you are, you are doing some crazy therapy to write some, some interesting stuff down in San Diego.

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       Yeah. So, um, there's, there's been a few things I've been working on, like I'm not a huge fan of western medicine, you know, like, uh, even, I mean, you can call it alternative medicine. It's like original medicine. I, I appreciate looking at things like that way more than, you know, big farm. But I, uh, you know, one thing that, um, you know, fighting has gotten me and, and stuff with, you know, I think it's more prevalent in women, although I'm thinking it's happening with men too, is like our endocrine systems are not happy with these weight cuts and they're not happy with us. Like getting hit in the head a lot of go figure. Right? Yeah. So, um, you know, within all of that I've just, you know, had medical problems and things that like I'm constantly working on and I feel really good. I'm, I'm constantly improving.

Speaker 2:          00:02:03       But, um, one thing I was feeling a little bit stuck on was a wine, I like some of the endocrine problem issues, but, um, like I dunno, I, I had, uh, had I went to this facility in, in San Diego is called, um, Dang, why can't I remember, oh, a mindset. And actually the UFC sent me there because I mean, we have Usada, we have all of these things like, um, after fighting Amanda, I got my head pounded for a good four minutes there. Um, I had a Tbi afterwards, so that was like, uh, immediately lowered my, a estrogen lured my da ta, my testosterone and I'm hypo thyroid. Like I will always be hyperthyroid now. Like I have to that fight. Yeah. Yeah. And um, you know, still toughed it out. So it was trying to do what I could to go and fight Ronda as soon as I did afterwards. And, you know, part of my game plan is don't get hit and which means like, let's just dart out her and see what happens. You know? So what, that's what happens when you do that.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       No, Tbi is traumatic brain injury just in case if someone is listening to this doesn't understand what we're talking about. And then in the Rhonda fight, if people don't know about that, you just charged after and he got caught in an arm bar and like, what was it? Very quick,

Speaker 2:          00:03:16       14, 13, 14 sayings. But I did hit her with a knee. I did throw her ass, but she practiced a little Ninja move and comedy alarm and it was, it was over, you know, but I mean even even her coaches were like, you did what you're supposed to do there. And She just got you. You know? So, um, that would be an awesome fight to be able to revisit one day as she even said we'd do it. I mean, who knows her career so open right now. She need to really,

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       I don't think she wants to. I think, I mean, who knows? You'd have to ask her, but there's a lot of lessons to be learned. And what happened to her in terms of like all of the distractions and Hollywood came calling and there were scripts and talk about doing road house and there was all this, all this shit going on. There was other than fighting, you know, and then it was also, look, the sport has evolved so rapidly in the women's, women's MMA has gotten so high level so quickly. And if you, I'm sure you saw a man to his last fight with Raquel Pennington, I'm like, Holy Shit. I mean that was a fucking, the high level performance from her and five rounds, super high cardio, just put a beating down and Raquel painting, it's one of the toughest girls in the world for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:04:39       Right? I do like, I mean I'm curious, I was saying the same thing as the fights going. Right. And then I have, uh, some people in my ear next to me, they're like, well how long has it been since we're cal? Fuck, cause she didn't look her or like [inaudible] she, she looked a little tired. She looked a little like not her typical and then it's, it's like she's a year and a half off herself. Right. Like right into a title fight, which I have to say I'm a little bit envious of because when I beat Misha, I, when, uh, I was supposed to coach ultimate fighter, but that was all ultimately going to end up in a title shot with Rhonda and I blew my knee and my husband passed away and there was like a long moment of silence in there. And then when I was able to come back, they made me read, earn my title shot, you know? And so it was like, wait, oh, we're doing that now. Or just like

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       what would attractive contenders are available.

Speaker 2:          00:05:31       Yeah, it looks good. I agree. Yeah. I mean it was very young at that, at that age or at that at the time.

Speaker 1:          00:05:37       Right. And in Bantam weight right now there's like, there's no standout contender and Raquel had beaten some really good fighters and she looked like the next in line. And did she blow her knee out as well?

Speaker 2:          00:05:48       I want to say she got like, Oh, I could be lying, but I think she got like some accident with a four wheeler, like rolled over and broke her leg or something. I could like totally be making that up though. She could have just twisted it walking down the street too. So I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       Yeah. Now that you're saying that, I do remember something like a Bro, a broken leg, Jamie, you'll find out what it is. Um, but were you a, were you surprised by that fight

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       between Raquel and Amanda? Yeah, I mean, I didn't, I didn't see where cal being the one to beat her, you know. Um, I do feel like Amanda's been working and doing like, you know, improving, I mean, she changed her camps. The coaches that she's working with. I tried out for a while at, at one point too when I was trying to find my spot and they're legit. They're very good. Um, and American top team has a lot of high level training partners, both girls and guys, you know what I mean? She had a good, uh, a good decision made there. So I, I see how she's improved. Um, I think with the time off with Raquel, I wasn't sure how it was going to go, but also I just, I just don't know. I just don't see Raquel being to be being the one that beats her.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       It's so hard to tell you no, right. I mean, anybody on any given night at the highest level, the game someone can, when someone can be off, someone can be a hard, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:07:03       there's no math to be done in this sport. There really isn't a, math is ridiculous. So, I mean, sometimes I hear like statistics on me or definitions on me or labels on me and I'm like, wait, I'm a, I'm a known striker. Like, I'd never would've thought I'd be known as a striker. I mean, I've been doing Jujitsu and wrestling my whole life slog me and I'll take it. Fuck yeah. You know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But even that is, yes. But I mean that, that in itself was like, I love to wrestle and what can I do once I've closed that distance? While it's those, those short and goals strikes, you know, there's, there's needs and there's elbows there that those are the most destructive things I could possibly do to someone when, when we're that close. And to do all that work to get that close. But granted, that's all influenced by my time, what I got to learn from that discipline. So, you know, it's all relevant, but um, you know, it's, uh, it's always just interesting to hear how you're now being categorized.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       Yeah, it is weird. Right? But you are, you are definitely a dangerous striker. I mean, you're dangerous.

Speaker 2:          00:08:04       I agree. I mean, I like it and, and I'm, I'm enjoying constantly learning and new things like the, the basics were always hard for me to get cause I wanted to do the big girl stuff, you know, and uh, you know, found my way, like right in the middle of all of that. And, and find a way to use how aggressive I am and how, just like Dominique domineering, I can feel in there and all of that. So it's, it's like, I don't know, the, I want the maximum amount of damage without taking damage, which is obviously the goal. Right. But like I want to put it into a dance, so it's like a little, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:08:39       What made you decide to go to San Diego? So you were at alliance now? Um, moved from Colorado to San Diego.

Speaker 2:          00:08:47       A few things. So one of them, one of them was like, Colorado is a complicated situation for me. I mean, I had gyms that they're like, a lot just happened up there. Um, and I love my team elevation. Like I love ice. I'm still close with everybody. Like I go to Colorado for Christmas holidays, I get still home, you know, but a couple of things. One with the head injury. Um, Colorado is amazing for training, right? It's amazing for building your, your endurance and whatever. But it is not good for healing. Like you'll never see a doctor tell someone with Alzheimer's or a Tbi or heart problems or even like massive allergies or um, what's the, uh, arthritis arthritis like those are not, that's not a good place for people to live with. Any kind of inflammatory or like major thing that needs to be healing because your body's already working at such a high level because yeah, because the altitude, I mean the thin air, the, the things like that, it's just like I spent so much time and so much money, like figuring out what the hell was wrong with me that, you know, I ended up at the Mayo clinic spending weeks at a time going to all their like specialized different, uh, doctors and situations like that for them to tell me like, you know, if you want to heal, you want to give yourself the best opportunity to hill, you're probably not going to do it up at altitude.

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       Like we would prefer seeing you at sea level. Um, so combined like I kind of, I needed to almost exiled myself from Colorado cause I want to love it. And I was starting to, it was starting to get like less colorful for me, you know, cause I felt like I had the best there was as far as coaches and the best there was as far as training partners and the situations like everything was as good as it was going to get. Like it literally was as good as it was going to get. And it was like this can't be it. Like I don't feel, I don't feel right. No. And, and I was like, that means I'm gonna have to take a change. You know, when I was scared, like I have a little boy, like I'm taking them away from everything we know and we just packed a u haul and we left and we got to San Diego in San Diego I went, I wish I had written down like all the gyms I went to and showed up at like anonymously to, because I didn't want them to, like, I wanted to kind of catch them with their pants down.

Speaker 2:          00:11:03       Like, what are you guys like right now versus if you're prepared, I don't want to show up and have you have people here watching me. I don't want you to put on a show, like I want to catch you how you are and like have you decide what you think of me too. Because these needs, this needs to be a fit. I mean, fighting and coaching and training is very intimate and it needs to be authentic and real. The days I'm sitting there, ugly white girl crying on the ground, but I need, I need you to tell me to keep, stay on the erudite and you know what I mean? Like, just let me cry, you know, that kind of thing. And um, it's, uh, so I went to all these places and like I, the best part about it is that I got to learn and train with so many fighters in so many coaches that I like. I'm so excited about the relationships I made and the people I know. But, um, like all of them, it was like, this is awesome, but it's not the place. This is awesome, but it's not the place I came up to.

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       And I was very close to going to American top team. They had an awesome deal set up for me to go, like helping me with my kid, helping me with a good percentage for training, like how uh, living situation was going to be, they're going to accommodate me really well. Um, but when it was time to like pack my car and go like something was like that wasn't it, you know? And so I'm like, I mean sweaty all the time, like right here, like in that look hot, there's a lot of cool people in Florida, but there's just, there's some subhumans down there. Yeah. I really appreciate it. Like the Latin culture. I mean, I'm all about, yeah, it's Florida. There's some fucking swamp people though. There is no joke, no joke. Um, so, uh, then I looked west, you know, um, I know ed stores out here, he's my manager and, and I had it a few pockets of people I knew that can maybe be a support to me and my kids.

Speaker 3:          00:12:55       So, um, came to la. If I was here, I was going to go to the black house. Uh, I think, um, uh, oh, where's Kelvin Gastelum train again? 12 and gasoline. You got to say his name wrong every time. But where is he coached the MEU ticket kings. Kings, Kayla's going to kings black house. And I was still trying to pick Jujitsu. Like I wanted like a art of Jujitsu guy or, or uh, you know, just someone really good. Yeah, because I came from traditional traditional Jujitsu and like I love MMA and mixing it up, but I need that. So I felt you were introduced to purple for like ever like six years. How come? So long? Because I'm being a Weirdo about who promotes me. Cause my husband, my husband promoted me to probe about and like I really want what whoever takes over their lineage to be like that.

Speaker 3:          00:13:49       Like I don't want it a different one from 10 different people. Like I want that like I want to pick and it be right. And so actually now I'm super excited because I just started training at Aptos and I have so much respect for Andre and his wife Angelica. There's so many good fighters come out of that gym to Great Jujitsu fighter. I, I've been changing there like four weeks now and I've, I mean I've trained there before but like every day for weeks now and I've only had like one day where I walked out feeling like a rock star. The rest of the days they were whooping my ass but it was good, you know, like I needed that and it tells me, you know, yeah. And there it's just been so good and to see myself that way and to hold people that way. Like I was the jit at Jujitsu me and I was like killing it on the circuit for a long time and then Emma May comes in and puts this pressure on like even those kinds of competitions, even though they're not even the same animal. And I'm annoyed that I let that bother me and keep me from competing in between fights because I loved that name in MMA. You feel

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       weird about competing in Jujitsu tournament? I think I did. I, or maybe I thought I'd pick up bad habits or I would do whatever, but because maybe other people had that experience, but like for me, I need to see it for myself. Like if I go and I do a tournament and I do great, then hell yeah, I'm going to have higher expectations of myself in a fight. If I go and I do shitty. Okay, well, like now I get to learn like that competing is where I get to learn everything and spacing out these competitions. Especially at the time I've had to take off in between fights. Like I'm not, I don't believe necessarily in ring rust, but like when they say go, I don't know what go means until a little bit later than I'm expecting. And it's been the pattern in these last two fights.

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       You mean when the fight starts, you still feel like, is this really happening? Kind of. Well, even this last night, this last fight with Caitlin, like we got in and I was like, do I remember what to do here? You know, and I was like, fuck it, I'm just a throw bombs. And the whole time I was just like, and I'm not eat, that's not me there, you know, it was just like chucking my hands at her and hoping they land and if they didn't like the fuck out, you know, you feel like out of composure. Yeah, until the, until the third round. And then the third round I was awake and ready to go. And I mean, I felt warmed up. I felt right. And you know, she was looking at the clock and backing up and all of this and I was just like, come here, come here.

Speaker 2:          00:16:10       Like I'm ready to fight finally, like come here. And uh, you know, I don't know. So there's something to be fixed about that. And I don't think it's a secret, but, um, I dunno. I think maybe something with the warmup I need to like fully like have like a respiratory exhaustion before I go in so I can simulate those first rounds. Beating the hell out of the way. Even in wrestling, I don't know. You know, there's, there's a lot to it. Like, Gosh, we're bouncing around all these different things. But I mean, one thing with the, with that treatment center that I went to is like, um, doing different things, like dealing with your psychology, dealing with like the synchrony in your brain, you know, having your brain function and then on the same hurts at the same or different areas of your brain. What did they do exactly?

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       So it's therapy. So it's these magnets, right? Like the, the main people in there. I mean, it's beautiful. Not Beautiful but beautiful to see sitting in the lobby waiting. When you see people with Alzheimer's come in, like there's a man that wheels his wife and every day and, and you can't, you can, I think at the beginning of the week she gets like an ivy so she's like a little bit more up and Chipper, but by the end of the week, you know, she's a little bit more slouch and, and stories like his, where he's talking about, um, you know, before they started going in there, she would just go to the bathroom all over and every day this man takes care of his wife, puts her makeup on her, like goes and gets her hair done even though she doesn't even know, you know, and now she can at least tell him that she needs to go to the bathroom.

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       Like, just be like, hey, it's time, you know, and he can get her there and you know, sort of, kind of have like meaningful moments that they haven't had in awhile for, there's a ton of veterans in there and active veterans to active military guys that are, they're doing these door breaches and then they get their head rattled up too many times and they're noticing they have problems with some depression. I mean, and these are high level navy seals, high level, like, like special forces that need, um, need. They're expensive people. They've, there's millions of dollars poured into these people and they're not ready to let them go yet. So they're like, how can we fix them, give them this like performance edge but still get them like he like healed enough. But we need, we need to throw them back in there. We need them, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:18:30       And so I've had to sit in on appointments with the Department of Defense in talk about my experience with it. I had to, uh, I, I don't, I don't, there's some really famous people I don't even think I get to say cause I'd be a dick and I'm probably be in trouble, but, um, that I've sat in on and you know, they've had their own issues with mental health or PTSD or um, uh, they're like autism, different things like family members of theirs or whatever that I've sat in on and kind of been helpful in talking about because I went in there on two different antidepressants. Um, and these, I was put on at the Mayo Clinic and

Speaker 1:          00:19:07       felt like post the Nunez. Yeah, this is how crazy am. I mean math is right. You lose to Rhonda in 14 seconds. You Kao Amanda Nunez, Amanda Nunez beats the shit out of Rhonda and 48 seconds. That's, that's, you might be like the perfect example. I'm a math, you know, and I mean crazy. It's crazy. I need you beaten down to UFC champion.

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       Well, in it, I mean, I took, it took two and a half rounds for me to, for me to sub Pennington too. You know, like there's nothing like, you know, but who is it? Pennington goes toe to toe and round around with Holly. Holly Knox Out Rhonda Too. Like it's just this division.

Speaker 1:          00:19:52       His fight with Ashley. Evan Smith to this day that the ending, when she got her in that bulldog choke. Oh Robert and blood and finished her like literally one second. It was a violent, crazy. I, I screamed so loud at the end of that. It was just fucking chaos. That was, she's done. She's had two fights that ended like that with like one second to go. She finishes the fight. It's tough girl. So the, anyway, MMA math is ridiculous. It doesn't work. And you might be the best example of how it doesn't work, but so you go to this, the, the Mayo Clinic puts you on antidepressants because you just feel like shit. He like

Speaker 2:          00:20:33       shit. And because like the different endocrine problems that I had, right. So I can't have any of the medications that'll help that. So I have to be more conservative with it. And one way they thought to do it is because my cortisol levels are really high.

Speaker 3:          00:20:47       They're talking about, um, and I mean granted I have a lot of stress, especially like, you know, life hasn't been easy

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       fast. Like mom, your husband passes away toughest, probably the toughest sport on the planet, trying to be the best at it. So yeah, elite, you're in the top 10 so you're, you're in this weird position where you never know when you're going to fire to who you're going to find. There's a constant amounts to, and it's not like you're making millions of dollars doing it either.

Speaker 3:          00:21:11       No. Well, and it's expediting healing for me in, and I also have a kid going through what I'm going through, so it's not like I get to like split and cut corners and just, you know, it's like there's maintenance to be done at all times with that. So I go there, they tell me, you know, we could probably lower your coders all levels if we could load or lower your stress levels. So we'll try it. Antidepressants, what did that make you feel like? Flat as fuck. And like I didn't get my, can I say fuck on this? Cause I said okay. I know, I just didn't know if I have a quota for, I'm like a bad person. Like did I get handed to like a duck? It added to a certain level, zero restrictions. You can say whatever you want in the shit out of it.

Speaker 3:          00:21:50       Okay. So got it. Um, so yeah, they, they put me on the flat flat, which like all that training camp getting ready for Juliana. I'm just like, I'm like, okay, I'll, it'll, it'll take off in the fight. Like I feel good in the fight. Like when they say no ups, no downs, no, no pissed off, like want to kill, you know, nothing, you know, and not scared but not happy. No. And I was like, why am I not nervous the way that I get nervous? Like, like I was okay, which you usually like, especially two weeks out, I have this like flesh of emotions, you know, where I'm like, fetal position in the corner, like what the fuck? And then once it's over, all I want to do is kill, you know. But, uh, like, and I didn't have that either. What kind of made me nervous because my, my other friend buyer pancheck we, she, she's a new 20 fiver. Um, we would always like call each other and laugh at how dumb we are being at that point. Like look at me, you know. And uh, but that was all gone with the shit that they put you on. Um, oh, it was this one. Oh my gosh.

Speaker 3:          00:23:03       Keep going. PROZAC. What other have, do you know what I mean? Jeremy affects her Effexor and stupid crazy pills twice a day. Just tic tacs.

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       So they put you on this stuff and did they try different ones?

Speaker 3:          00:23:27       Uh, no because a lot of time there isn't, you know, and, and they're looking, I'm like, I need the side, this side effects matter. Like these can be ones that made me gain a bunch of weight. They can't make me like I need to still be able to sleep. Like I have to be able to have like enough highs, lows to be able to

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       function and learn and, and whatever. And so this is like the best they could have for me. So anyway, I fight that fight with Juliana. You know, I, I feel like the first round I came out how I wanted, you know, and then halfway through the second round, like it was just awful. Like she had my old coaches in her corner. You know what's weird about that fight is I could hear you and I could like, I, this is where the flat came in is like I wasn't, I didn't feel like I was in the fight. Like I could see her beans feet and I could hear you talking about us and I, I saw like I could hear Juliana's coaches and it was breaking my heart. They were coaching against me because they were my Colorado gym and she went and trained with them and I know she had trained with them previously.

Speaker 2:          00:24:33       So I mean, before she had taken the fight. But to me it was like fucked up to here, you know? And it hurt me in a way, like it's, I wish I could explain it better, but it was like I heard them and I just wanted to go home. You know, I look at the clock and I'm like, can this just be over? I don't want to go back to Colorado. I want to move. Like I literally on this side of the cage, I had my past in Colorado, I had these coaches, I had the drama with that, with that Jim, like how everything went and, and then on this side it was like all new problems like San Diego, Eric, and then we're good. Like there was a lot of training partners there. It was sunny, it was similar to Colorado at different but in the right ways, you know? And it was like, I just wanted it out. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:14       You were in San Diego trainer for that fight or no? Yeah, I can't, I just flew out for it. For, for the training camp and why you flew out there, you were still taking the antidepressants and did that fight convince you to stop taking them?

Speaker 2:          00:25:27       Yeah. So after that fight I went to a, what did I do? I think I went to the, I was at the Pi, I was working with Novinski and people on like what to do about that. I haven't talked to Gordon. Dr. Gordon Moore. Gordon. Yeah. To help me with all of that too. Cause he thought there was a more conservative way to help me with those issues as well. And so I knew I was talking with him. I had him talk to them. Uh, they were all trying to figure out a way, but still there's like, there's no way to even just naturally bring you up. I'm thinking about retiring. Yeah. And that, that's the thing is the center was really the place that was, is like, okay, I'm going to go here. I've tried everything else. I'm going to go here and if they can't fix me then, then I'm, I'm going to have to be done.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       How crazy is that? How fucking hard is Amanda Nunez hit?

Speaker 2:          00:26:14       It's nuts. She does it like she, I don't want to say she hits like a dude cause that's kind of weird, you know. But, uh, yeah, it's uh, I remember being surprised. I remember like having this open guard on the ground and kind of like, come here, you know, like I dare you. And then she hit and I was like, Oh, oh, oh you have those

Speaker 1:          00:26:39       and that you could see the look on people's face when she hits him. Like where you saw it Rhonda like right away. Yeah

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       there's a part in that fight. Cause I watched our fight after and like you, uh, she hit me and it like did say I think it's right when it had to be when I hurt my head cause it like drop my arm and it dropped my neck. And I just remember like seeing like the little twin eat tweety birds and I was pumped because I was like, that's where the cartoons get it from. Cause somebody explained that shit. That's exactly where they got it. It's like woo. And uh, and my arm, like I couldn't get my arm back up and I remember listening to you and you're like, cousin not intelligently defending herself. I'm like, listen Joe, that fucker won't work. You know? And then she screwed up because she grabbed my knee and my knee was the one that was like the catalyst to all my problems over the last couple of years.

Speaker 3:          00:27:30       And it was just like, don't fucking touch that. And after that it was just like, I just angry when she grabbed you in. Yes. Who's the wrong knee? But I knew what she was trying to do. Right. Yeah. And then on top of that it's like, it's just, I don't know, the rest of it was just like punishing her. She's Kinda like Sassy before the fight anyways. Like in awkward ways, like not even like cool hypey ways, like just staring at me really weird in a room where it was just like me and Tim Kennedy sitting there eating like watermelon and stuff after ins and I look over and she's just like staring at me all weird. I was like, Damn. Tim's like, dude, what do we do? I'm like, I can throw out a plate, a watermelon water. I can throw a table. I don't know. I don't know what tone we're doing here. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:28:16       Wow. When, uh, when you stopped her. We've played the recording of you screaming like maybe 10 times on this podcast because to this day, that is one of the Ra's moments I've ever seen inside the octagon. Like when you, when you jump, like when they stopped that fight and you screamed, it was fucking bone chilling. It was, it's so, I mean, I'm sure you've heard it, but that here it is right here. Play at Jamie. That's like from your genes. That's like, that's some cellular level shit. Yeah, that's intense. Hey

Speaker 3:          00:29:03       Leaf. It's like I didn't like, like we lived, you know, like we lived, they didn't, we, we get to eat. They don't, and you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a relief. It's,

Speaker 1:          00:29:16       Oh yeah, yeah. I mean you were, like you said you lived, cause that was, I mean, look, it's just a fight. There is a referee, you're going to be saved. But one of the things that George Saint Pierre said last week when he was on the podcast, he said, the mentality that you go in there, the way you fight, you are a warrior. Like you, you know that you're going to be rescued, but you are fighting for your life. And when you're fighting a fucking killer like Amanda and you get lit up, like you didn't survive that first round and then go back and stop her. That's where that comes from. I mean that was just fucking tense.

Speaker 2:          00:29:52       Well it's the, it's the practicality to me, right? Like, yes, exactly. We have a referee, we have cage walls, we have whatever, you know, fans, it's entertaining people. But like I need to know, I need to know that like, well that'd be a nature, you know, that'd be doing whatever that be self defense that be, oh fuck us fighting over a territory or food or whatever. Like I need to know what would happen. Like if we had like that's why I want these finishes. We only get 15 minutes to be able to tell ourselves what would have happened in that situation. You know? And, and when it goes to a decision, I'm pissed cause I don't know, you know, like you don't know, especially these three round fights where I'm waking up like these last couple fights, like late in the fight, I'm pissed because I'm like, I don't know if that would have been another 30 minutes or another two hours that we're scrapping in the woods. Like who gets the bone? You know, I want to know. And, and so that's, it's, it's crazy and issue of practicality and the sheer survival. And this is the way I get to know myself.

Speaker 1:          00:30:50       That's deep. Who gets the bone? Ooh. Damn the way you just put it. No, I don't think I've ever heard anybody put it that way. You need to know. Yeah, that's intense. But I get it. I get it. That's where that's cream comes from. You got the bone. So you go down to San Diego. What was your shortlist before, by the way? I'm a huge fan of, uh, Eric. Uh, alliance is just one of the best camps for sure. And I think Eric Delphia, it's like probably one of the most underrated. And because he doesn't toot his own horn. Yeah. He's like in the shadows, laid back, doesn't want any intention. She's not trying to get any attention. Like he's the last guy to like request attention, you know, but super, super knowledgeable and one of the best guys in a corner too. Like his advice is always excellent. I never, never heard him say the wrong thing in the corner. He's always like on point. But what was your short list of places to go to besides the wines?

Speaker 2:          00:31:57       Um, I went to, did you go to New Mexico by? Yes, but I feel like I'm not trying to walk in on Holly and like make sure weird. Then they were going to fight each other at some point. I know. And that just, you know, I don't want to be that guy, you know? Although I know I'm welcoming. I know that everyone there always been nice. I've gone and train there before and it's been good. Um, but it's just not a cool move, you know? Um, I went down to Arizona with crouch. Loved it there. Another great guy. Yeah. Great. I feel the same way about him. He same. Yeah. Very, very, very humble. Very good. I'm super knowledgeable to up in La. La was cool, but it was a lot of that

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       driving around in the traffic and congestion and I couldn't sacrifice the like the um, yeah. Is, is so many people here. Yeah. And, and coming from Colorado and coming from like chill out doorsy you can drive 20 minutes and be somewhere no one's ever stood before too, like stuck in traffic, breathing air. You don't want to breathe like, like everyone's a little pissed off, but no one really knows why Jan is right. Jamie's been saying this forever. Yeah. Yeah. Where would you go? Maybe Colorado is so dope. Get their food culture could be better there. I wish we could combine that food culture of culture. What do you went to? I mean, I mean I'm, I'm in a health food. I mean like ethnic food. I like every, I like, I like trying new stuff all the time. I'm not very like Food Cheney, you know, I'm in a fire and meat. Yeah. Are you are, you know, it's so good. So good. So I've decided I was go for the steak.

Speaker 3:          00:33:48       First of all, it's a great, I love vegetables, but you can get them anywhere. I can get them in Colorado. Not really. I mean it's not exactly the produce capital of the world, but you can get them. Yeah. It's not the best. Yeah. Just get a greenhouse, grow some tomatoes on my spare time. Yeah. Did you try Montreal? Did you think about five star? I, I did not. Well, I thought about it but um, I don't, I didn't get up to Canadia. Aye. Aye. I went to Thailand, I went to Mexico. I went to you think about going to Thailand. Yeah. Yeah. I mean when I'm there especially, it's like such, it's a Buddhist culture. People are so happy. I mean that you have your shit. They're just like you have everywhere else. But at the same time like, like the Moyie Thai training is good.

Speaker 3:          00:34:36       I know the places I would go to Jujitsu, the fair techs and pet TRS is, is coming around in, in pretty solid. Like, I've been considered that for this camp just to kind of like make some changes cause I really want to have that influence and that like exposure to the authentic when we tag. And like when I looked back at my most successful and most happy times after these three fights, I've lost three in a row. Like that doesn't happen. I'm not saying, you know, I'm like, no, I'm better than this. Like something's up. And I know there's a lot that I need to work on. I mean like, uh, my, uh, my life in general and I'm doing it and I'm happy to be doing it and I'm happy to be getting the lessons, even if this is how I have to get him. Like fuck it. At least I know. So, um, I tried to look back and analyze like, what was I doing when I was my favorite fighter, when I was feeling the best and it was like very traditional, thick Moitai in very traditional tech, Jujitsu. So that this camp has been something that I'm gonna also be outsourcing because I want to be like that

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       element. So I'm doing my, I'm doing an actual Moitai with John Ex. He's uh, uh, Jeremy Stevens, Muy Thai coach I think too. And then my Jujitsu with Attos. And then, cause before it was like I would do these separate disciplines, put them together and drills and sparring and then go mango people and then like have fun with it. Cause it's like these little goals I had set this little bucket list I would take into a fight with me and try to pull those things off and that and then go learn new stuff and then go try to do that. That's why I was constantly evolving. Every fight, even the fight with Amanda and I like snapped her down and I had her by her head and everyone's screaming news news and like hold my beer. And that's what I go to throw her with the, you know, the old, they call it a DDT.

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       I it wasn't, it was a freestyle like front headlock suplex but it was like, like I want, I want every fight to be different and fun. Like know what I have, but see what else I got right thing. And, and that, that I don't even get to play that right now because I'm fucking up and I'm, I'm not doing what I want in these fights. So I decided to take steps backwards. And how do you start and training and training? I, I don't know. It, it's something's, something's been missing and I'm partially wondering if it's that, you know, so like every fight I'm looking to make improvements and change. Like I'm not going to ever sit here and say I know everything and that it's just, I have no excuses. Katelyn found a way to beat me, you know what I mean? Juliana found a way to beat me.

Speaker 2:          00:37:04       I kinda beat myself in that one too, cause I let my head get into my, you know, and that sucked in again, another thing for me to have put time in and I'm happy I did, but I mean, that got me to move to San Diego. So I mean, I'm, I'm happy for that message. It costs me a lot of money to get that message, but I'll take it. Um, and Caitlin, yeah. She found a way to beat me in, into, have been beaten by Jujitsu when I feel very accomplished in Jujitsu that like stung differently. You know, it's done way differently than just someone else getting their hand raise.

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       Do you feel when you're in training that you're the same as you were before, when you were at your best?

Speaker 2:          00:37:39       Um, when I was at my best, no, but it's something I'm working on. Like I have, I know I have like the hangups that I have. I know there's a ton of mental stuff, you know, one, um, just how life happened and, and constantly having, like I had this expedited adaptation to training. I had to get new coaches, I had to find new gyms, I had to do all of this while in grief and being under like, like this isn't the most forgiving crowd, you know, like when, when you're having a shit day, definitely not the worst. It's crazy. It's crazy because it's such a,

Speaker 1:          00:38:13       like you're so exposed and you're so vulnerable as a fighter and the fans might be the meanest.

Speaker 2:          00:38:19       Well and yes, there is so mean and, but I feel like I have the best fans too. Like I have the ones, the ones that really old, there's no ride or die and like I'm so proud of him, but um, like I didn't even start doing my own social media. My, my husband did my social media and so all of a sudden I get thrown in to social media and how social media works when I'm at my most like low vulnerable and all that shit. I didn't know you're not supposed to, I'm looking at it like investments, right? Like I'm like, Oh, here's the stock. I'm going to put money into this stock and let's just see how it turned out. I was like, ah. And I think the first person that ever told me not to do that was callin like later, he's like, never read the cop. What are you doing Brian? Cal doesn't reach because I don't read the comments, but I'm like, well how will I know how I did? He's like, just fucking no in here.

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       Peers, you're, no, you'll know from your coaches and you'll know, you'll know.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       Well it's, I mean it's sex when you know, like six hours later you wrote some shit that people are taking wrong or I mean it's like an opportunist situation. They like wait for you to fuck up and they're like, oh, right there, right there. I'm like, you know, I didn't mean to say that or you know what? That's not how I meant it or whatever. But hard

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       because everybody's text looks the same. Yeah. The tax that you would get from a Holly Holm or someone you respect versus a text he get from some fat slob sitting there eating Cheetos, farting into their hands. The same person. Like it looks the same as on text, but it's just you're going to get like some people that just want to hurt your feelings because they suck and their life is terrible. Like I've never met a hater that's doing great. Like there's no, no. Haters are like, man, my fucking life is awesome. But you know what I liked doing? I go on Youtube and I just go make comments that are just trying to hurt someone's feelings. I just try to cut them to the bone. Just say fucked up shit about dead relatives, what they did wrong. Those people were all just losers, just fucking losers, you know? I mean, there's just no way around it. That's all they are.

Speaker 2:          00:40:20       It was so foreign to me because I mean in wrestling, like I did wrestling, I did soccer, volleyball, swimming. Like I never ever heard anyone be discouraging like no one ever came to me and was like, fuck you. You suck. Yeah, you wouldn't

Speaker 1:          00:40:35       get that from someone who was a fan or someone. Even if someone's from an opposing team and like she ain't shit this. They're just saying that because they want to beat you. You know? It's like, but the, the haters that you're dealing with online, they just, there's a lot. Look, life is fucking complicated. It's hard to get right and as you're seeing with your very difficult career, there's, there's a lot of like decisions to be made. There's you, you can fuck it up. You got to build back up again. Try. Right? And you're a smart person who's strong and successful for losers. Life is impossible. It's impossible. And so they go through life just angry and depressed and sad and failing at everything they do. But they still have a phone or they still have a laptop and like you fucking con flooding loser. And that's what you're getting.

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       That's what you're getting. You're getting the all that anger and you didn't even know this person. Why are they angry at you? Because they're angry at life because life is fucked him in the ass. That's they're angry. They're angry at life because they got dealt a shit existence. Right? They have bad genetics, they have a bad family, they have a bad job, they live in a bad neighborhood, they have bad people around them. They feel bad, everything's wrong. And, but they still get to talk. They still get to talk shit and they still get to type things, type mean things out. That's, that's why he can't read comments cause it's fucking, the only thing you could do is inspire with your work with you what you do. And you do that already, you know, and you're a human being. You're gonna make mistakes and you're going to do things right and going to do things wrong, and you're going to have these epic moments and you're going to have these failures because that's just a part of like doing things that are complicated, but you can't read the comments. You definitely can't take them to heart.

Speaker 2:          00:42:18       Noted. Yes, no. Did he got me good a couple of times I get, Oh, fuck up your day. Yeah, day. Yeah. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       Ken, what then happened? It's sad because those people that are doing that, they're in pain. This is the know, the only reason why they would lash out at you like that and they go, no, I'm just telling the truth. Who just can't handle the truth. Even if it was the truth. The way in which people say it in the reason why they're saying is because they want to hurt your feelings. They're not being kind. You know, there's a lot of that going on today. I mean even then, even in the media, the way people tell stories and write stories and write articles about people, it's like they're not, this is not just that. They're trying to tell the facts and explain what's happening. They're trying to cut people down and hurt people and it's, this is, I wonder how much of it has to do with the fact that our fucking president does that because it seems more prevalent now than ever before.

Speaker 1:          00:43:14       It seems like there's like a trend and I think a lot of like one of the things about the president, whoever the president is, it's like there's some people that are not going to listen to anything he says, but there's a certain amount of people that are gonna take his actions and use it as almost like a barometer. Yeah. Example of how they should behave and how this country behaves. It's like he's the top dog and when the top dog is insulting people all the time and saying shitty things and holds it can be successful. Yeah. It's, it lets people know there's, or you want to get ahead. I want to get ahead. You got to do like him and then they, they go out and act like assholes too. Yeah, that's a bummer. So anyway, you go down to San Diego and what, what are they doing for you that gets you off of the antidepressants and gets you feeling better?

Speaker 2:          00:44:01       Whoa. Uh, it's again, like you get in there and I mean it's, it's scary to go. Again, like I said, there's, there's all these different people in there. The man found the, the research on it by, um, treating his own autistic kid and, and you can see the before and after videos of this kid and it's like, damn. Okay. And then, um, I brought my son into, cause he has ADHD and he's off his medication now as well. So I'm going in there. Uh, they do a EEG first and then they can tell which of your brain are firing it, what hurts in seeing, um, the congruency is in like how all of that is happening or not happening. And then they kind of prescribed these, these different, these machines like on your, on your brain that make, uh, these like electric impulses, but they're magnetic to, um, kind of speed up or slow down the different parts of your brain.

Speaker 2:          00:44:54       So if the front of your brain is moving slower than the back of your brain are those or, or whatever. So, um, they're noticing obviously, uh, patterns with fighters, hockey players, football players, like, like people that are leading with their heads basically. Um, having like, uh, and then with the veterans that are like emotional things to where I mean, and yeah, and then like, I mean, having to compartmentalize as well, like some of the shit they see should be upsetting, you know, and, and, you know, but there's, there's different ways that we can train our brain to, to drop things like that. And then PTSD is when it's an involuntary and it all comes in and, and that, so, you know, I, I've been diagnosed with PTSD. I had walked in there with medication because of being depressed, uh, and the anxiety and all of that.

Speaker 2:          00:45:43       Like my symptoms were terrible. And I know they're a combination of things, but even like my startle reflex, like, you know, I could hear someone come walking around the corner like clack, clack, clack here, their shoes. But the second I'd see them, it would, it would stop my heart for a second. And that's like shit on your adrenal glands, you know, and, and, um, all this stuff was, you know, an anxiety that, um, I don't know. It was, it was hard to fall asleep at night. Uh, you know, my memory was crap and this is all, you know, different stuff happening in all these other fighters that I know as well. But I mean, like I said, I've been trying things so much, so much over the past few years that I get excited about and either it works or it doesn't. And, um, the, the point is, is, is now I found this and I feel better from this, but I, I was so excited about all these other things.

Speaker 2:          00:46:35       Like, I can't just start telling everybody of the new thing that I've found because I've said that and been excited about like everything else with this one, this one, like the equal scope, it's like, uh, it's uh, um, same thing. It's kind of like a tens machine or stem machine, but like a super, super low frequency and that's bad ass to like it, it helped on injuries. Like if I rolled my ankle or hurt my toe, like you could bring the swelling down from this to, to normal essentially in like an hour and a half just working on with this like tens unit on it. And, and I mean, they originally used it for race horses and for, you know, super expensive million dollar horses. Like the equipment they brought over, it was like 90 grand and like s like these really specific like special metals that were put into these plates and you know, they would do stuff like that, but that wasn't working on my head.

Speaker 2:          00:47:28       It was working injuries and it was working on, um, I want to say it helped with like my, like digestive system maybe or my, um, uh, I don't remember some, some other things it was helping with too, but what, you know, I, I started doing that or I was doing that when I walked into mindset and started doing that treatment. And so what do they do it? So you sit in a chair, you know, and they ha they put this prescription in this machine and the machine has kinda got like a, like a arm that goes on in a specific part of your brain and you, you know, you close your eyes and it sends these, these magnetic pulses into your head. And I mean, you don't feel anything. It's almost like you can hear what it feels like, but I don't know how to describe it.

Speaker 2:          00:48:15       It's, it's a sense, it's essential, but it's not, it's not exactly hearing and it's not exactly feeling, um, yeah. And I mean you, you leave the place after your treatment. Like I go, I would go twice a day. It's 45 minutes away both ways. So I am driving a lot everyday to go to do this cause I want to give it a fair shot. You do it every day? I do everyday. I haven't gone these past couple of weeks cause uh, stuff with my kids. Uh, schedule school's almost out and then wanting to try out different things with different coaches as far as these new disciplines go. So I haven't been there as much. But um, yeah for the last August I believe is is when I was like really, really getting into it and go on twice a day and 45 minutes each way. Twice a day. Twice a day, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:49:05       So you would, you would spend 45 minutes one way and then go back again and then go back, watch his fucking move closer to where the places, because the alliance was down there and so I would, I would drop my kid off at school. I would run and then I would go there. I would do my treatment, I go back to practice down in southern San Diego, then I'd get my son and then we'd go up there for the afternoon session. And then I'd come back down and, and we'd go to his sports and then I'd have my second two a day that does not leave a lot of free time for cats and Ghana. Oh Hell No. Oh No, no. Just that alone can be stressful. But I was seeing the results. That was the crazy thing is I was feeling better. The results when I just walked in, like, like God, like I couldn't sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:49:55       I had just, uh, anxiety, like I had that, that startle effect going like the, um, my memory was shit. And these were all things that I went to the UFC pie to talk to them about. Cause I'm like, I don't know what to do. Like I, I want to fight. They offered me to fight Chris Cyborg at one 45. And I was like, yeah. And I was like, well, like hell yeah, let's take that. But like, can you guys at least help me get this shit figured out first, please? You know? And they're like, sure. Um, so Dunkin French, he's at the, the, he's, he's, he's, so he went to college and t and was that an oh no, he was at Notre Dame using this treatment with the doctor. I'm Kevin Murphy that runs the mindset. So, uh, he was like, this guy is doing a lot of things with people as far as brain health.

Speaker 2:          00:50:44       He's like, go see them when you get back to San Diego, it's kind of far from you. But like give it a shot cat. And I called the guy, I'm on the phone, super frustrated, like super emotional. I'm like, I'm, I'm at my wit's end. Like I've tried everything I can think of like holistic views, like chemical views, this like everything. I mean, spending money out of my pocket trying to figure this out because none of this is covered by the UFC. Especially because you know, not something I claimed in a fight. I mean, I fought Amanda and if you don't claim that stuff within the 30 days, like you're on your own. And of course my head hurt. Of course I'm dizzy. Of course the lights are bright. Of course. I can't think. Right. I got in a fist fight, you know, and I, I wasn't doing good in it for awhile, so I, I figured, you know, but then a month and a half, two months out when I wasn't better. It's like, sure.

Speaker 1:          00:51:30       Even though it clearly came from that fight, you still don't get covered.

Speaker 2:          00:51:34       [inaudible] what? Not One. It's endocrine stuff too, you know? And it's like there's very, there's like how could they

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       dispute that? That's where it came from though. You go, hey, sit down. I want you to watch something and just play that first round. Go. What the fuck do you think happened? I don't know, but I mean if you play that video for them, if any buddy in the insurance business was denying you coverage, saying that didn't happen. D while you were under the banner of the UFC, like you're out of your fucking mind. Watch that video. What do you think is happening while this fucking assassin is throwing bombs at your face? I mean that's it. That is crazy. That that's not covered.

Speaker 2:          00:52:14       Yeah, that makes me sick. Oh, it's frustrating cause bye by like literally you look at the papers like it costs me more to fight then, then it, then I make Lucy now

Speaker 1:          00:52:25       makes sense. If it was dealing with a broken hand or a torn ligament or something like that, it might make sense in Mike. It does not make any fucking sense. If you're talking about brain injuries cause anybody who understands how brain injuries work know that there's, there's a considerable amount of time after a fight where you still are suffering from symptoms and you might decide 30 days later, 60 days later, 90 days later you've got to do something about it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:49       All right, well I mean now I know now I come out of a fight and I'm like, my pinky hurts, my elbow hurts, my hair hurts, my eyebrow hurt. It's like when a claim all of this, you know, because before I was just being tough, you know? Yeah, I'm fine with fuckers do. This is why it's so crazy and I didn't like, I didn't get it and I didn't know. And then,

Speaker 1:          00:53:07       but they should know if they're in the, they're in the business of insuring fighters, they should have a larger window where people can claim head injuries. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       Well that's, I mean that it kind of goes together with like any kind of, any kind of mental, anything. Like any, you talk about mental illness, you talk about head injuries, you talking about Tbi, it all goes into that stigma of like, you can't see it, so it must not be real, you know what I mean? Or, or whatever. So it's like, but that's the head injury business. I mean, basically, yeah. The point is to make them drop and be done.

Speaker 1:          00:53:40       That's what everybody, I mean, it's not, it's not the worst thing in the world. The wind with a body kick or an arm bar. But the reality is what people like is to see head injuries were in the head injury business. Right. You know? Yeah. Yeah. So how long after you starting with this treatment do you start to see results?

Speaker 2:          00:53:58       So the first, I would say the first thing I noticed was my motor skills in practice. And so, you know, I would go,

Speaker 1:          00:54:06       so you think your motor skills were impaired?

Speaker 2:          00:54:08       No, I, well I just feel like I had a block. Like I said, like it's, it was comical and I mean you can even ask them at alliance. And it was funny. It was funny, but not to have like we're in class, you know, we're learning, I'm watching the coaches, like they do a drill and they explain it and they look up. All right, everybody ready? Ready? One, two, three go. And we clap and I have no fucking idea what we're doing. You know, like we walk off and I'm like, like there was even a couple of times where they're like, they clap and they're like, Kat, what are we doing? And I'm like, um, three kick. And they're like, no, 20 pushups. And I'm like, man, I'm not even like, I'm not just a bad kid like talking and like, no, let's say like I'm in trouble because I don't hear you.

Speaker 2:          00:54:55       I can like not lose eye contact the whole time, like sit here and I'm like focused, but no, I'm not retaining it and less like if it has to be the last thing that they do. Like we can't talk about shit if, if, if it's the last thing I see I can go do it, I could go do it. But if they're like all right and then they explained some philosophy about it or do some movement or whatever, like then I lose what we're doing. Like my, my mind would just go right to something else. Like I had a very hard time concentrating and you know, it's, it's crazy because when I got to this facility, you know, I didn't know, I didn't necessarily know what I was walking into. But they have, you do this questionnaire and like on this questionnaire is like all of these things.

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       I'm like, that's part of something like me not being able to focus as part of something my sleep, that's part of something, this startle effect is part of something like me having these like completely like specific things that are all on. This was like, damn okay. Like I didn't even want to see the EEG because I was, I was scared. You know, I was like, what if you can't fix me and now I know all the shit that's wrong with me like that, that sucks. But then you know, they show you different egs and they show you the, they take it every single week and so you actually get to see it and you get to see the level that you were functioning at, especially the different parts of your brain. But then, and the thing is that's awesome about this is you get to keep the results.

Speaker 2:          00:56:14       Like unless you go do exactly what you did and go fuck it up again, like you get to keep it. It's not like this maintenance package, which is you know, a problem for these pharmaceutical companies. There's, there's, there's not a whole lot of retention on it because once people get their brains functioning, as long as you're not sitting there hitting your head against a wall, like you get to keep feeling better. Like these, these veterans get to go back to, to combat or whatever it is, their job is like we fighters get to go back, football players get to go back. Like I, I sat in with the chargers, uh, medical staff and talked about our stuff there as well. I, I, I don't even remember who else there was people from all over the country coming in asking about this, you know, and, and needing to sit in and, and, and they're looking at these egs in particular.

Speaker 2:          00:57:02       So what is it doing? Like go, how was it fixing it? So wine, um, I think it, you know, there's something with what goes on in your brain with, with the thyroid stuff, with the endocrine stuff is like getting your damage to your hypothalamus. Right? And that's like, that kind of directs all of the information that goes to your thyroid, your thyroid, you know, then sends out everything to your body. And there when there's like a disconnect there. Um, no, it just screws everything up. And then on top of it, like now that we're cutting the same way we've always had to cut, but we don't get ivs. I mean, I mean you, you cannot 100% rehydrate your brain within 45 or 48 hours. Like you can get your body decently hydrated, I believe, but your brain is just, it's its own thing, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:57:51       And so now we don't have ivs are hydraulic system in our brain is down and now we're rattling it even more like dehydrated. I mean, we're just going to have, you know, bigger side effects, uh, tire brains being dehydrated that now, um, the damage that comes to the hypothalamus to the pituitary, to the, um, your thyroid, all of that that goes on there, that, that they're, they're saying that you can, you can get it firing back at a level that it was before it got hurt. Like, as long as the cells are still alive in it, they can reenergize those cells. Now if you have like just a dead part of your brain, you know, they're not bringing it back to life, but they can um, use these magnets to kind of fluff on backup, give them back their energy, their, their life and, and put in a, put them in back into a functional way that was something similar to you at your healthiest and, and make it, I mean not more or less durable just back, right?

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       Yeah. When you, when you were saying motor skills, like what was wrong? Cause that's one of the things that they see in fighters that have taken too many shots. They start having the, they analyze fighters, gates and one of the things that happens is your legs get closer together. Um, your, your balance is off your, your steps are shorter. You don't have that sort of like dynamic fluid motion to your body and you're having a heart, a harder time with balance and just motor skill.

Speaker 2:          00:59:16       Yeah, totally. So how I felt before going into there, it was all I had was the gas pedal. I was like, just will, you know, and just fuck them. You know, just cause I, I wasn't reading patterns of people anymore. Like if someone leans this way a little bit, I'm like, okay, I know what you're thinking. Like if they set this way or that way and, and even me juking them and like trying to like faint at them. Like I, I wasn't, I couldn't even see the reaction I was making them make, like I knew what motions in my muscular memory to make them do, but like I wasn't getting the feedback because it, it just like wasn't, so that was one of the first things I noticed was, you know, going back into practice and, and watching people's angles and beating them to it and, and, and like remembering, I'm like, damn, I don't just have to shoot to shoot.

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       Like, I can wait and do it when it's the right time or I can even like, like take advantage of, of the fact that, you know, I'm making them step back or I can flash fire and they're facing and jump on them at their knee jerk reaction, you know, like these things of like being able to manipulate the situation and make them adjust to me. Like I could see that again and I could see, um, would you him before, like when I just had go, all I had was when you didn't see movement, like say if someone was going to spin and they're like we're loaded up their hips. You didn't see, no, it just hit, hit him first. What were you seeing? I all, I didn't, all I saw was get their first, all I saw was like close the distance, don't get hit in the head.

Speaker 2:          01:00:45       Like make like get down and get low and just be a linebacker, you know, and, and hit him because I knew I wasn't seeing that stuff. And the more I tried to see it, the more I would just sit there and wear it. Cause I'm like any minute now. I mean any minute now I'm going to, I'm going to catch the pattern, I'm going to catch the pattern. And it wasn't popping up. So then all I had was just super light sparring. Just moving around. You didn't see it? No, no, not really. No. Yeah, that's fucking terrified. I was like, yeah, it was really scary. And like even I'd even get to like a good position in Jujitsu and I'd be like, I know I know stuff here. I know I know stuff here. But she didn't know what to do. What was it? What was it?

Speaker 2:          01:01:25       What was it? I know, I know stuff, you know? But like it wasn't like, especially with adrenaline firing, like it wasn't just happening for me. And so like three, four weeks into that, all of a sudden like that fog was starting to go down a bit. Right. And like part of it was, and then, and then I'm also sleeping better, you know, to go before like during like the first week. Oh yeah. Cause every fucking person I went to could fix me and driving 45 minutes. Like what the fuck? Yeah, yeah. In a, in a, in a car I leased. So all those miles, you know, it's like damn. And um, it's uh, it's super frustrating. Yes. Everyone can fix me, everyone can fix me. And then they don't. And then my heart's broken again and then I go to the next one and then my heart's broken again and then, and then the next one.

Speaker 2:          01:02:12       So this one I'm like, I'm like, I'm not even going to tell people about this because I'm sick of fucking hitting up and being excited about it and telling them to come with me and then it doesn't work. And then I'm that guy again, you know? And so going into this and then watching it work and then seeing all the other people that was working for in there that, and they were never trying to push me to promote it. They were like, just come in, just get here. You know, and if you like it then until the, cause the UFC was talking about getting one of the machines at the Pi and they're kind of going to have me be like a Guinea pig for it. Ian Mccall went in there too, but it didn't like he, he was doing his own kind of other stuff that was making it so it wasn't working for him, but like I was all in, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       that was making it so it wasn't,

Speaker 2:          01:02:57       I don't think he was coming in often. So I think, and the thing is is that it does stir shit up, right? So like they, they, they mess with your, the the levels because again, they have to like if the back of your brain is running at four hertz and, and, okay, eight is technically where like you're sleeping, you're at rest like year, there's part of your brains that could be under your resting hurts, right. While the front of your brain is running at 12 so that's like high anxiety but like low energy and, and, and they can, they can almost tell you how you've been feeling lately, which was like nuts to me. Right. And they can tell, you know, because of this and this that, that you have some OCD tendencies versus this person constantly feels like they have no energy in, their memory isn't working and they're emotionally and capable of like being in, you know, being a positive force in a relationship right now cause I don't have it so they could reach you should, you should, you should. It's scary though cause I cute when you see that like little like and they're like what's that?

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       But it's for me it's, that's a two hour drive. Shit.

Speaker 2:          01:04:00       Yeah, I know that there, I don't know if they have anything up here. I know that they've, they have a bunch all over.

Speaker 1:          01:04:06       That is what it's called. I couldn't, the website's not coming up but this personalized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, a noninvasive therapeutic approach to the treatment of Ptsd and other neuro neurocognitive disorders. Kevin, Tim Murphy, MD, Vice Chair, department of Radiation Medicine, applied sciences, Uc San Diego Director, Pediatric Radiation Oncology Program. Uh, Rady children's hospital, San Diego. Wow. Yeah. So that's where you're going. And um, I mean obviously during this whole thing you have to be questioning what you do for a living.

Speaker 2:          01:04:41       Oh yeah. Well, and it's like, okay, so they can fix this. Say they fix it and then I go do it again.

Speaker 1:          01:04:48       Cyborg. Right. I mean you were, you were thinking about fixing it and you, you were going from one girl who hits like a dude to another girl who might hit like a bigger dude. Yeah. I mean cyborgs fucking terrified.

Speaker 2:          01:05:00       And it's like, I know healthy at my healthiest, like no, no problem. I believe that I believe in myself like that. Like I can figure them out, especially in find a way to not get hit doing it. Like I didn't get hit in my MMA career, significant a hit, not one significant hit and tell Amanda. And then after that I was getting fucking lit up. Right. And, and not even that. Even Juliana, like she kind of opened him, bitch slap me a little bit from the sides but I and but like I can find a way to, to like still control it enough to be like, like very effective without taking too much damage. But like that, that slow of my, my motor skills, my mechanics, it was, it was really bothering me. And that's not how you go fight someone like Cyborg. You don't go in there with that weight in your pocket. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:05:50       it's so important that you're talking about this because this is a, this is such a factor that we don't see on the outside. Other people, you know, other people than the people that are really close to the talk to about these things. Like if we were seeing you fight and you know, when we see the decline of certain fighters, you know, you see certain fighters, they, they're in a couple really hard fights and then you see it decline, like a real obvious decline in their skills and their abilities. Very, very rarely are they opening up about what's going on, about losing memory. About not being able to see patterns and people about not, not having their motor skills in tune anymore that things are off. You know, so you talking about this I think is, it's so important and it's so important for young fighters to recognize like, Hey, this is also on the table. Here's a great therapy for it. But this is also a possibility of, you know, if you do fight a fucking killer like Amanda Nunez, this is one of the things that can happen to you.

Speaker 2:          01:06:47       Oh, and it's partially because I have, man, I have teammates. Yeah. I have people that are 10 times worse than me that are just like, I mean the stuff I hear, the stuff I see, it's, it's sad and it's scary and they have kids and they're not going anywhere soon. You know what I mean? And they're passing their Mris, you know what I mean? Like

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       their MRRs cause what does it MRI really see? I don't know. I don't know. But if they went to this place and got all their brain mapped out and find out how everything is firing, it might be a completely different result. Like we might be retiring people way earlier, at least forcing them into therapy way earlier as possible. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:07:28       I mean in that, and that's the thing is it's like the risk needs to be worth the reward and, and you know, like right now in this sport it's, it's a juvenile and it's not getting us like this kind of like, like I, I can't afford to take another two years off because I went and I fought cyborg while I'm sick and something bad happens to me. You know what I mean? Like I want to be sharp and if, and if that means I have to take time, take the time I took off off and get healthy and do all of these different therapies, the conservative, traditional and nontraditional, like all of that. And so I can feel the way I feel now. Like I'm pumped and I'm excited. But like that is something that I really want to know that people know they can go do.

Speaker 2:          01:08:14       And it's not vulnerable. It's not saying you're weak, it's not something wrong with you. Like, like it's your health and your longevity and your future because that shit, if you don't treat it, it doesn't get better. And like you don't understand the depression, you don't understand like, and there's an identity that goes away with, they see me and like, you failed or you can't do it anymore, or whatever. Like that, that mental health aspect that comes with the physical health of your brain, like that, all that all needs to, that all needs to be more educated as far as, as these fighters go. As far as all of it goes. Like, I'm happy to be the Guinea pig because I'm damn, I just want to see everybody. Okay. You know?

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       Well, I'm, I'm happy that you're talking about it, but it's, um, it's been something that, you know, I've talked about quite a bit and, um, the, the, the real problems behind traumatic brain injuries because I've had a bunch of experts and I've talked to a bunch of neurologists and I've talked to neuroscientists and people that are really studying this stuff. And, um, I've been real vocal about it and it's, it's a tricky situation because obviously I'm a commentator, but like when someone gets knocked out, I'm very vocal about them taking a long time off. And it was one of the things that happened after Rhonda got knocked out by Holly. Um, they were talking about getting her back within like, it was like four or five months later to to fight again and I was like, [inaudible], we're going to have a rematch with Holly. And I'm like, you guys are fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:40       Like you're crazy. She shouldn't be doing anything. She shouldn't be getting hit. She shouldn't it be sparring. She, there's, she shouldn't be getting her head rattled and she definitely shouldn't be fighting Holly fucking home who just kicked her into another dimension five months later or whatever it was six months later. I'm like, there's no way this is not, should not be happening. Like you don't even know what's going on yet. You don't even know what kind of damage. I mean, think of what happened with you and Amanda did you stayed conscious at least? I mean, Rhonda got fucking flat lined and then got hammer fist. It didn't the head while she was lined, it was uh, one of the most brutal knockouts in women's MMA ever. And you know, and you saw when she came back and fought Amanda and, and got hit like right away, that hesitation.

Speaker 1:          01:10:25       Oh, she was just stiffened up and the fear. And then also Amanda, I felt even before the Holly Holm fight, I felt like Amanda was the, the more dangerous fight for her because of her hands. Because Rhonda is always in this position where she's closing the gap. She's getting close to you because she wants to clinch up with you and throw you and take you to the ground and arm bar you and what have you. But with Amanda, you're dealing with a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt who knocks people fucking dead with one punch. Like it's a terrible match up. I felt, and obviously that true proved to be true, but what drove me crazy was how dismissive all these people behind the scenes were. All these agents and Hollywood people and all these people that just have no idea what business they're in, they really don't even understand this business, the business.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       It's basically the business, like we said, of head injuries and you're just like, you're trying to sell this thing where you're, you're dealing with someone who had a fucking significant head injury and now you're pushing it back in. There was someone who's really good at delivering head injuries and is this, is this really all been mapped out? I mean, what kind of training have has changed? I mean, what you, she's still with the same coach. Has she done anything differently? Like what, what do you think? What, what result is going to be different? You know, and the downplaying of the significance of a fucking ruthless knock out like that I just don't think can be understated. I think people should take a long time off when they get knocked out like that. A long time.

Speaker 2:          01:11:58       Yeah. Well, and I mean in especially some sort of like invasive treatment, like from out the gates or something like that. I looked at they should be studied and I mean, I mean, I know they put a flashlight in your eyes and ask you if you okay, send you to the doctor, do whatever. But I mean like, and, and I think honestly that's what the UFC is like effort was in, in this, in an offering. This information of this treatment to me was to see like, hey, is this something that would, would benefit fighters in, in a situation like that? It's at the Pi. I, it's not at the Pii, but what they were saying is it would be at the Pi, um, still. But the trick with it is that it is something you need to, you need to go to, I need you to go to twice a day and have that like schedule of it in that routine of it. But, uh, says fighters like flying to only Vegas for it and paying our own room and board our own flight, potentially having to fly our coaches and to have to, you know, keep us working and doing whatever while we're working. I mean, it's just, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. It's just tricky business. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:13:04       it's real tricky business. And how old are you now? 35. Do you wonder how much longer are you going to do this?

Speaker 2:          01:13:09       I like, I feel like I got like a good couple of years left. Like I'm, I'm still having fun, you know, and like the chest of it is still fun and like the training is still fun and I'm still learning and like enjoying it. And, um, I dunno, like getting through everything that I'm getting through and learning everything that I'm learning is like, it's so inspiring to me because I definitely don't feel done. Like I still have so much fight in my heart and like I really love putting my hands on people and in always like advancing and improving in, in the day I stopped improving, you know? Uh, then I can look at that. But right now, like I don't care about plan B, I don't care about what's next because that's not what's happening. So your passion for doing this still there? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:13:52       And the purpose, the passion is, is huge. I love the passion, you know, that to me is huge. But the purpose, like the bigger picture, the, the what I'm doing here, what I was born to do, what I was born to get through. Like I have to get through this, like I want to get through this and I'm getting through this. I'm, I'm watching myself and that is like, it's bad ass to me. It's exciting to me. It's, it's, um, it's what I'm doing here, you know, and I, um, I'm all in like in, in, I can make, I can just make things for myself that, um, I get to show myself every single day that like no one could have ever told me, you know, it's all stuff that I know firsthand from my experience, from my world, from me trying things from me, risking things like all of that.

Speaker 2:          01:14:44       And, and, um, to understand myself in, in, to know myself. Like it's been the biggest reward out of all of this. Know yourself through the struggles and know yourself through the fights. Yeah. All of it. I mean, and even how much you get to learn, just even going into a fight, right? Like, realizing, so going into a fight, being on antidepressants like, okay, I'll wake up, I'll wake up. I don't know what this will do. I feel flat. I don't feel flat. I'll be okay with these people there. I'll be, I won't be okay with this. These people here, like, like all of that is very clear about things that like, this has my attention, whether I know it or not, that that's something in my life that needs, needs to be looked at and needs to be addressed. Okay. There's direction. Like all I ever want is understanding and direction.

Speaker 2:          01:15:33       Like, I just want to know, you know, and so, um, I get to deal with that, that, that leads me to come to San Diego. San Diego is, is a new chapter in my life that I get to name, you know, uh, also for my kid and myself. [inaudible] I get a reveal so much to myself through trying different things and to just kind of like letting life take me down the path that I'm supposed to without me sitting here freaking out about control, freaking out about things that I, I can do nothing about. You know, I just want to walk away from all of this like content and happy with how I did. Whether that means I never have my hand raised again. I don't think that's the case. Like beating these girls, having the belt that is not a pipe dream. I already beat them, you know, it's not like I'm incapable of that and I'm just wishing I got my fingers crossed.

Speaker 2:          01:16:26       You know, it's, it's not that my whole journey of my life in sports from being a kid was to meet my highest, best, to be my highest good. And, and that is what's driven me the whole time. I look at these girls and I respect them because they're here doing what I'm doing. We're all just out here trying to be the best at it. We're all trying to participate, we're all trying to, you know, find ourselves in it and learn what we can learn and go implement it, you know? And, and so for that, I have respect for every single one of them. Some of them I like less than others. Some of them I like more than others, you know, but, um, really like we're building this stage together, we're doing this together, you know, and I'm, I'm extremely proud to be part

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       of something like this and my position in it and my purpose in it is to, you know, find my personal good, my personal best. And you know, this has been extremely long road for me. Nothing has been easy and I respect that. Like I'm grateful for that. Like all the things I know because of the hard times. Like I feel fortunate to know, you know, and I would never have learned them any other way. And I get to handle them. And not only do I get to handle them, I get to like, like relate and understand people and see things differently because I get it, you know, maybe not exactly word for word pinpoint per pinpoint. Oh, I'm having a chat to say that I was going to make me fall over. But you know, it's, it's all there and it all matters to me and how I get through this really, really matters to me because I know it matters to other people too, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:18:05       And, and how they do inspires me as well. Do you know what you're going to do when you stop? I, I just don't, I mean, I feel like there's this thing is there's this awesome resume and building, right? You know, like I'm a UFC fighter, I'm a national champion in wrestling. Like, I'm, um, um, I don't know. Constantly advocating and working on working on myself and try and help get other people working on themselves too. Like, I don't know what all that's going to look like. And the thing is, is I don't even want to, I don't want to look, I don't want to care about all that yet because that's not where I'm at. And like, I want to be all in here. I don't want to think about what's next or plan B or, or how all of like all of that because my heart is here. Right. You know, it's like what are you going to do in your next marriage? Right. You know? Yeah. You know what I mean? Like I, I'm right now I'm, I'm, I'm here, I'm doing what I'm doing. I'm not looking towards what's next because right now I'm here.

Speaker 1:          01:19:04       Yeah. No, listen, that's what you want to hear from someone who's fighting. I mean, fighting should be all in that study is the only way to approach it. If you're a fighter and you're also a neurosurgeon to part time real estate salesman, good fucking luck.

Speaker 3:          01:19:17       You don't have 100% to give everything. You got one 100%

Speaker 1:          01:19:22       especially with something like fighting, it's just such a crazy way to make living. You really have to be 100% committed to it. It has to be your life.

Speaker 3:          01:19:32       Yeah. I appreciate the opportunity. I like. I like, I like everything I'm doing right now, you know, and I feel like all of that will be part of what's next, but I like that that'll manifest. That will figure itself out. I don't, I mean not to knock the like hippy way of oh, everything will be great. I'm sure like when it's time I'll look at that. But right now this is what I'm, I'm looking

Speaker 1:          01:19:55       at also the, the kind of drive and discipline and work ethic that you showed to become a top level MMA fighter and a national champion in wrestling. You could do anything with that. Whatever you set your mind to. I really believe that. I mean, I think the biggest problem that fighters have when they retire is finding a thing to put their energy too. And then their identity because their identity is of a fighter and when that is taken away from them, there's that. And also the thrill. I mean there's, you guys are experiencing a level of excitement and intensity. Like when you're talking about two weeks out, you're crying in the fetal position and going, what the fuck am I doing? But that all builds up to these moments like that crazy primal scream after you stopped Amanda Nunez. That's a experience at very few people other than people fight to the death are feeling there's, there's something, there's something that you guys are experiencing that unless you're the person in the woods fighting over that bone, you really don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:20:59       You don't know. And then for you to go to regular life after that, it's going to be hard and it's going to be hard for a lot of fighters. It's, it's very difficult for a lot of fighters to find another thing that excites them. The way finding excites them because it's such a crazy pursuit. And then on top of that you're dealing with what you're dealing with, but you're dealing with it publicly. You're talking about it, which I think is a, you're doing a great service to everybody when you're talking about your problems and your issues because there's so many fighters that you know that they were experiencing this and that I know that are experiencing this and you know everybody who, anybody who's done any sort of martial arts competition and been in gyms, you're going to see people that have that have taken too many shots. It's just part of the game. And you, you know, it's what you're doing by talking about it so openly while you're still a top level fighter is I think very, very important for everybody. Huh, thanks. I'm trying, man.

Speaker 2:          01:22:02       It's been allowed to try and things, but I do, I do feel value in this. You know, and I mean exactly when people are done, like there's some pride in, in having to go get a nine to five or whatever, you know, after being a level, a fighter at this level, mind you should, you not have the fucking brain cells to be in. Like, it's like, like I got high functioning thing that you can be proud of. You know, I mean it's, it can be really stressful to not live up to the capability that, you know, you have what you're just not like there's that wall or that fog or whatever, you know. So I mean, I just think people maintaining themselves and doing everything they can, however vulnerable it feels like, fuck it. Do it. Like it is

Speaker 1:          01:22:42       well that they could spread this therapy across the country. And how big are these? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:22:45       they have, I mean they look like they, so they, they have, um, like mobile units, but again, like it would need to be on, I don't know if it's on some sort of route or whatever that people would need to be able to show up to or what. But um, they uh,

Speaker 1:          01:23:02       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:23:03       I know they have one in Indiana. I know, I know they're going to have one in Colorado soon I think relative to the training center.

Speaker 1:          01:23:09       And when you say mobile units, like how big are these mobile units and are these effective as the one that you're going?

Speaker 2:          01:23:15       It's a creeper van. You know, it like a little dish of candy in there. Yeah. It's like you get in and um, it's the same exact chair, you know, and then they have their, they're trained to a nurse, nowhere to put it on you. I don't. And then even the Eeg, I mean it's like a, it's a wireless EEG. So I know that every week they make you do the EEG, like same time, a relatively the same time. So they can keep good track of what your brain is doing. And, and how to prescribe the levels to be at what on your head. Um, and I, I think they have one in, uh, Arizona. I know there's one in Texas. Um, I want to say there's 12 over the country, but I can't tell you where.

Speaker 1:          01:23:59       And the mobile one. I mean, how big is this? I mean, is this something that uh, Jim could get and how is it prohibitively expensive?

Speaker 2:          01:24:07       I want to say again, I might be full of Shit, but I think they're like $100,000 for that machine. But I do know that they're being, um, insurance will cover it because, uh, for the insurance will cover it for Migraine, uh, PTSD and autism I think. I think that insurance will cover it for that, but then, um, tricare's also accepting them as an insurance as well.

Speaker 1:          01:24:36       Wow. And so when they're doing this to you and you know, you said you got it in August, you started doing it and you started seeing improvements after he said four weeks.

Speaker 2:          01:24:47       Yeah, four weeks was like the first time I saw improvements. And then the bigger improvements where caming leader. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:24:52       Does it, does it keep getting better? I mean, is it better now than it was last month?

Speaker 2:          01:24:56       Yeah, I mean, to the point where I can, I'm, I'm okay not going for three, four weeks, you know, like, like I said, these last few weeks I've been all about me getting everything right to be in training camp right now.

Speaker 1:          01:25:07       So you feel right now like you felt before the news,

Speaker 2:          01:25:11       right. In the way I'm changing. Like I'm having fun with it again. Like I'm, I'm watching people, I'm like fucking with them. Like I'll get them to step that way and then I'll step that way and then I'll be very satisfied. Oh my God. Especially on for a while. Yeah, it was gone. And, and like that is the art to me is the games and the playing and, and the like getting you to do this so I can do that. And then, you know, like that was what was fun. Yeah. Good. Getting in a fight is not fun. Right. But the chess, that's what's fun. The game, like, like making the oohs and the Ahs and the crowd happen because you know some gangster shit, you know what I mean? Like that's fun. That part's fun. Going in and getting cut up and bloody and having headaches and like your ankle hurts for a month and it's not fun.

Speaker 2:          01:25:58       No one wants to do that on purpose. You know, I want to go in and do what I can not get touched and then have it go on a highlight reel, you know? And that wasn't happening for awhile and even on this last one, it was just like, man, I felt better. I totally felt better and, and, but what I needed to change wasn't that, that that was fine. What I need to change as is other things that I'm changing and I am, and again, like if that's how I have to learn it, cool. But like it's all part of the process, you know, I'm not no second in this entire thing. Have I stopped believing in myself? No second. The only thing I worried about was like, it was like, all right, am I going to be, is my son changing my diapers here in a few years if I keep doing this shit, you know, like, I don't want that, does that, but I never stopped believing that this is what I'm meant to do right here right now. And I have time and I have more fights and I have everything it takes to go out and be every single one of these girls. Some of them again, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:26:57       I do know now when you're in camp, um, how many days are you doing? Two a days.

Speaker 2:          01:27:05       Yeah. So some of them are, it'll be like, sometimes I'll have to add more cardio in the morning. And so like, if there's fasted cardio, if I'm heavy, you know, depending on how that goes, as it's like a science at about 45. Like what do you walk around? Yeah. What do you walk around? I can get all the way up to like, I've, I've been all the way up to 76, but that was before. I didn't know that was when, uh, I didn't, I was, I didn't know I was hyperthyroid. Oh. So then we now I was eating like 600 calories a day and doing fasted cardio and two workouts in my weight wasn't changing. My coaches were like, what the Fuck's wrong with you? I'm like, I don't know. I guess the women in my family get kind of big, so shit, maybe it's just not Midwestern style hitting me now, you know? But, um, no, and then when I went and I got my panels does that, and like everything was all screwed up, you know? And then that

Speaker 1:          01:27:54       Nunez fine before the Nunez five. What was the heaviest I got before then? I had never broke a hundred. 150 552. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:28:05       Yeah. I walked around like one 40 I didn't even have to cut cut for Misha. I walked, I woke up in the morning like two just didn't eat breakfast. Wow. Yeah. And then now I'm a big Mama. Jamma like how I look at food and I get fat.

Speaker 1:          01:28:20       No, but I don't hate it. Armour thyroid or something. Um, uh, leave levothyroxin. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I take it every morning and like 15 minutes before I can eat anything heavy. You should look into armor thyroid. It's a thyroid that's made from a pigsty Roy. And uh, apparently it's a, it's more bio available. A lot of people have better results with it. I would, I would, I would try it. I won't try. I wouldn't try it now just cause I'm in camp, but maybe in between the next ones. Yeah. I'm hyperthyroid to really yeah. Runs in my family. Yeah. My family too. I didn't, um, I have a weight problem cause I was working out a lot, but I was getting headaches and uh, I went to a doctor, get check at the end of the day, like a say around like seven o'clock at night. Um, uh, after dinner I would be so tired that I just like, I couldn't talk.

Speaker 1:          01:29:12       I just had a lie down. I couldn't hear it. I couldn't, Oh God, we're going to talk. Boom. And I'd go out and it was like, God, these headaches are weird. Like this is, it didn't seem, it didn't seem normal, like the, the late, I guess it was like after dinner headaches, like right before bed, it was just, it was, it was not a normal exhaustion. I started getting nervous about it and then when I got to checked out, it made sense and my mom has it. My sister has it, it runs in our family. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:29:42       I don't know if it's that genetic for my family, but you think it's from the head and I, yeah, I mean it was right away. Yeah. It was onset. And then, um, you know, and then you do these Mris and you do all of this other stuff and it's like, all right, well there's where your head hurts and they're just what's wrong and you know, so I mean, it was just, it's all too perfect, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:30:02       puts together your camps, like who decides what you're going to do as far as like how much work you're going to do, what kind of training you're going to do, where they're going to do sparring or they're going to do, so

Speaker 2:          01:30:10       this training camp, um, I, I'm, I'm outsourcing different things, so I have like, I, I talked to Eric Delphia about it and like I said, I said I wanted to outsource the Jujitsu and the Moy Tai and those are going to in itself takes so much time. Right. And then, um, my strength and conditioning and I'm doing with Chad missy is he's, he's mad ass. Uh, so my strength and conditioning coach, Lauren Landauer, do you know who she is in Colorado? So he's like family to me or he's been there for everything. Like I didn't even know when he got there. He, but he was always there, you know, um, he told me about Chad. Uh, and so I started doing strength and conditioning with him. I'm going to do that, um, three days a week. And then, um, I know that I want to get working with the more traditional Moitai again.

Speaker 2:          01:30:57       So I'm working with John next two days a week, um, and I think he's going to arrange my sparring as well. And then, uh, Andre Galvao I'm going to try to work two or three days a week. And then, um, so I handed all of that information to Lauren Landau and my other coach, my nutrition issues, Josh Ford. Um, have you seen him before? He's got like a tattoo goatee on his face? No. Um, he's been doing my nutrition and um, I've, he's known me since all I did was Jujitsu, you know, so he's been around, he knows my style. He knows me as a crazy fighter and all of that so close to between Lauren and Lauren, Lando and Josh Ford there, they're putting it together based off of what they've seen out of me in the past.

Speaker 1:          01:31:41       But if you're going to Jujitsu and you're doing a lot of Jujitsu training and then you going to Moitai and doing Muay Thai training, when do you get together and do MMA training? Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:31:50       That'll be the sparring days and then there'll be a light spar slack, like Kinda drill day in the middle in there too.

Speaker 1:          01:31:56       So are you sparring Moy, Tai and sparring MMA?

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       No, I'm going to be swearing mme. So that'll be where I mixed together the and like that's kind of how I like it too. Like I like doing the disciplines separate and then and then me finding where to put them in in a lot of times that's where my freestyle wrestling just ties it all together. So you're more training would basically just be technique drills, Thom Mayne, a Ninja moves on that and your moves and then Jujitsu, are you going gear? No, gay. I did know Gif or I did give for like the past four weeks and yeah, fuck man, shit hurts your feelings. But then obviously it's more practical to do with the, to do the Nogi and now they took the g off of me and man, I'm like a thousand miles an hour. I'm so happy with myself. Slippery. Yeah. I'm like, you can't grab my share.

Speaker 3:          01:32:48       And what about wrestling? Are you doing any wrestling training? That part I, I will. I still got to figure it out down in San Diego. I want a freestyle wrestler. I'm not like, I got a great shot, I'm good at shots and whatever, but I'm, I'm way more about throws. Like I like there, there's so much more efficient from, yeah, I got awesome hips forum in. It's just like, man, they're, they're high risk, high reward, but it's my funky style. Like I just get them done. Right. And it's so much less effort when you taught someone over their head on the ground and they don't know where they are for a minute. There's so much to capitalize on there with the equilibrium just off. And like, those are things I like, like I count on, so I need to find that freestyle situation yet. Um, I have good freestyle wrestling myself, but obviously like, like it's good to stay on top of those.

Speaker 3:          01:33:35       Like it's my strength, but I need to keep my strength strong. So I'm looking, I'm going to make that happen. So what do you walk around that? Right now I'm like one 55 and 56, seven 45 is a possibility. Yeah. I mean, and I, I've, I've wanted to go there as well. I mean, like I said, not having that fluid on our brains when we fight kind of bugs me. Like if I can walk down and one 45 and eat breakfast, like, yeah. I mean I won't, I'm like eating clean eating right everything perfect. I'm one 55.

Speaker 1:          01:34:07       Yeah, because I watched one of the, uh, they had a video of Cyborg cutting weight to make one 40 [inaudible] which didn't make any sense. There wasn't even a weight class for one 40. Yeah, they were, I don't know what the fuck they were doing with her or they were trying to prime her for one 35 or seeing if she could make one 35. Yeah. But she was like weeping and it looked like she was dying and like what the fuck man? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:34:29       Did she do the water cut and that one like the, the bathtub? Well she did a lot of shit but it was just hard to watch. And she gets big too. Like they uh, I'm friends with the way I'll be who's her boyfriend? And he like hit me up when I was supposed to fight Ronda, they were hitting me up during my training camp. Like, Hey, cause I think they have, obviously they have beef and I think they wanted it to be like kind of political, but I'm just like not in to that. But they were like, hey, how about Chris? You do you have

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       any girl training partners? How about Chris come train with you to get ready for Rhonda? And I was like, oh, maybe. I mean, how big is she? And they're like, like, oh, one 82 and 83. And like, what, what is the, how does that help me?

Speaker 1:          01:35:12       Another big motherfucker on me. Like, Oh God. I'm like, um, thanks. But like I got Neil Magni right there. Dude over like these, those guys are one 82 yeah, I'm not paying her hotel. She so fucking big. That's so crazy. I mean, she really, she probably be fighting one 65 yeah. And there there's a 55 you know, common, hopefully. Yeah. I mean, I just don't know. I mean, there's only so many 40 fives. I mean, she's obviously got the belt at 45 but I think even 45 is a brutal struggle for her. And you know, as you said, you could only do that so many times. It's taking a little bit of your life. Every time you do that you're, you're chipping away at Oregon. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:35:53       And I just remember like, I remember coming into MMA and like I used to cut to one 25 like dying, dying and that, so I was, I wanted to be ranked number one at one 25 that it was my goal before I moved up. And like I, I did, I was ranked number one, their beat everybody I could be. And then it was just kind of like the last time I made one 25 I just, I, I fought a girl named to k Ohashi from Japan and I remember it was like last minute cause I suppose to fight a girl, something happened to her and then they replaced her with Tko. And I just remember being so happy that we were at altitude because I was like, I think I had a heat stroke at the, the water cut, like the bathtub cut because I was in the water for like 20 minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:36:40       And I remember at 10 minutes I was like, something's wrong, something's wrong, something's wrong. And they're like, you have to stay, you have to stay. And so the 20 minute line, I like dove like a salmon, like out of the water. And I passed out on my floor and they gave no shits that my managers there and I'm naked and like I don't, I don't know, I'm out to the point where they're doing the knuckle rub on my sternum, you know, to try to get me up and then um, I'd rub on your skin, you know, trying to wake you up. That's how they wake you up. Yeah. It's like in your sternum. Yeah. Cause it's like something with the nerves hero, like hit your adrenaline awake is crisis so bad. And so I'm up and I'm like, you know your hands and arms are tingling and everything cause you're like waking up, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:37:21       And I'm like, I don't want to get back in that bathtub. Like put the sauna suit on me. I don't like put it on me. I don't, you know, so not that that like, I mean health wise I was not okay, but it was like I'm not getting back in there. So they put this on a suit on me and my hands are like freaking out, like doing this weird shaky like t rex arm thing and cramping so bad in my feet were doing the same thing. But it was like, like they had to cover me in the blankets and put all of the stuff on me to keep me hot cause I was not getting back in that hot tub or the bathtub is terrible. And after that, like I remember I felt it in the fight and I was like, I'm so glad we're at altitude cause I feel horrible. I can't do this again. And then I went up to 35. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:38:06       Is the worst part of fighting. It really is. And it's so, it's so unnecessary. There's gotta be, I mean, what one FC is doing, they've got some, uh, they're, they're eliminating weight cuts by doing hydration tests and testing people several times during the camp, finding out what your way, finding out what your actual weight is. And Ben asked for him, went into, uh, the, the, the way they're doing it in detail when I did a podcast with him, but that seems to be the way, and they made everybody move up a weight class essentially.

Speaker 2:          01:38:36       I mean, and that's the thing is I, okay, like contract contracts can still exist, but maybe you're just contracted as a fighter and you have to fight certain amounts of time a year or or whatever. But to have people contracted to weight classes is like, it's hurting the sport and it's obviously hurting fighters individually as well. But like,

Speaker 1:          01:38:53       it's just unnecessary. Well, you should do as fuck. I mean, it'll be way more weight classes. There should be more weight classes. So there's more opportunities and you should be fighting what you are when you're healthy. It's hard enough. Well, fine.

Speaker 2:          01:39:06       And I think especially because the sport is, we can, I mean it's very blatantly clear that it's, it's, this is not a bracketed sport. Like this is an entertainment sports now it's clear like we're doing what puts butts in the seats, right? We're doing what's best for the fans. So at that point, what are these divisions really matter? It's about the matchup, you know, you can throw a belt on it, any fight these days, like, so I think if we're going to evolve the sport to, to having entertaining fights or entertainment type fights, like we should just evolve the, the contracts to that as well. Like, shit, I mean, it'll still save the entertainment value. Like, look, you can get a, or catch weights even like, what do you guys want to agree on? You know? Right. Like who's down for what? If you had an ideal weight, what would it be to fight out?

Speaker 2:          01:39:53       Yes. Uh, probably 45, 45. Yeah. I feel like I'm skinny enough that I'm like flying squirrel, flexible stuff, you know, but, uh, but still a hell of a strong, you know? Um, but when you're dealing with someone, like Cyborg is coming down from one 80. That's the thing that was me healthy. Like it don't matter. Like, um, I'm the water, she's a rock, you know? And that, that's something I remember thinking when I was going into 20 fives. It's like, I'm going to be huge against all these girls, you know, like they, they may not be as dehydrated and fucked up is me, but I can hold them down, you know, and, and I can do what I want and eventually break them. Right. You know, and she's, um, she's got that in her back pocket too. Yeah. But like, you know, you get the, I thought watching the Tonya Avenger fight, like there was a lot of things that I, I saw in that fight against Chris and I was like, damn, like that, that right

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       there, there's, there's, uh, there's, there's something I could do there to me seemed like Chris is being very cautious and conservative and that she was just picking her shots and just trying to be very professional. Like the way she was fighting was not like this marauding rampaging destroy or like we've seen in some of her other fights, she fought much more technical and just, and Tanya evenger was throwing wild fucking barstool type shit. She was just, she, her hands were down. She's whinging big bombs. She knew she had to go for broke. And you know, Tonya, every Jew tough as fuck just to take that fight. I mean the difference in size was so apparent between the two of them when he saw them inside the cage and you know, is just, just a really tough woman. But her style, she was just trying to be unpredictable and wild, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:41:43       And cyborg was just moving in, let just real, real professional and technical. I felt like she was cautious. I mean he was a big fight for her too, you know? Yeah, yeah. That was the first, was that the first defense? What was that? No, that was the first ballot because her winning the belt for the belt. Right. And then that didn't happen again. Yeah. And there may, it was like, see Ya. Germania randomly is like not interested. Yeah. Wait, does she go there? She said, oh she's still fighting. Well she remember right after the fight, I interviewed her after she won. First of all, that fight bothered me. It bothered me a lot cause she hit Holly after the bell twice, one hard and really rocked her. And I watched that. I was like, fuck man, that was a big shot. And like you, you could say you accidentally did it once maybe, but she did it twice and one time hurt her bad.

Speaker 1:          01:42:36       And even so when I watched the fight, I'm like, that's the, the, the times when she hurt Holly was after the bell, but Holly fucked her up twice in that fight. She hit her with that question. Mark kick cracked her and rocked her and then she hit her with a straight left hand and dropped her too. I felt like Holly deserved the nod in that fight and I definitely think she deserved the nod if you take points away, which I definitely think she should've taken. She hadn't points taken away from her. I just think I just didn't, it didn't sit with me well, and then after the fight she said she needed, when I asked her about Cyborg, she's like, yeah, I'm getting surgery. She's like, I'm good. I got something wrong with my thumb or something. So I was like, okay, she's going to get some surgery.

Speaker 1:          01:43:16       And then, then it became a ped issue. She said the Cyborg is a lifetime ped cheater, that she's a performance enhancing drug user and that everybody knows it and she's not gonna fight her. So she basically just gave up her title and went back down to 35 I think. So she is fighting again. I don't know if she went and got surgery on whatever it was gone going on with her hand, but she is going to fight again. But she hasn't since I don't believe. I don't think so. Anything, see if he could find that Germane to random me. See what she's, who she's fighting next. She hasn't tweeted since November about a fight then. Damn, November. Yeah, that didn't happen. See, that's the person not investing in social media. Are you doing it right? Are you doing it wrong? No. No. She was like, I'm just not interested in this anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:44:04       Which is crazy because this is how fucking Tufts cyborg is Germane to random. He fought a dude and coyote them. I mean there's a Thai fight with her fighting. Yeah. I remember when I first started fighting and like getting pointed at looking at like that. Like, here's why you want to learn white tie. And I was watching her, I was like, that girl is, she's looking dance to some wars and she's like older too. I mean, I can't say older. I'm like one of the older ones now, but she older than me, but she, um, she fucked up a dude. She Kao to is tray right hand? I mean it's a, I mean, and then if she fought a guy like knew it was a guy signed up to fight a guy I fought on beat him and they're like Cyborg. Yeah, I'm not doing that. That's how scared she is a Cyborg and I get it. I fucking get it. Cyborg walking around 182 pounds. I get it.

Speaker 1:          01:44:59       I mean, it's a really open division one 45 right now and Megan Anderson, it's about to fight. Is that at 45 85 I believe that's it. 45 Megan innocence. Big Girl. But girl legit 45 [inaudible] she's, she's strong. She's in her prime. She's really tough. She's good at everything. You know, she's a legit girl fighting Holly in her first fight in the UFC. Also, it shows how much they think of her, but I mean, how many fighters do they have at 45 he's like fucking three mean. Who the fuck is there? You've got Holly who fought Cyborg and lost, and then you know w what else you got? You got Megan Anderson who was over in Invicta and most people other than the hardcore fans don't know about her. You know? And she was trying to get her name out there. So what do we got here? Is that the whole division?

Speaker 1:          01:45:53       The whole division? Jesus Christ. Oh yeah, I know. Well, Yana fought Cyborg. She little, isn't she? She got nuked. Yeah. That was a, I mean, she did her best, right? She, when did she fight Cyborg? Same night. I thought she looked good until Cyborg got ahold of her. It's just like one of those things where when Cyborg starts landing on girls who see the look in their face, what in the fuck? What am I doing in here? I mean, I was most impressed with Cyborg on her kickboxing loss when she, when she fought jewelry and a barge. Did you ever see that fight? She fought her in Moitai Terina bars is up fucking beast, man. I need her. The room in the face. Yeah. Bars knocked her down with a, a front kick to the face and she dropped her and still cyborg was still chasing after her for every fucking round.

Speaker 1:          01:46:49       Yeah. I was like dot girls. I mean, she's, she's big and she's strong and she's, but mentally she's tough too. Like she's, I mean to just a fight that girl at during the bars had, she had I think almost three years without a fight where she couldn't get a fight because nobody wants to fight her because she's just a fucking bad ass Moy Thai fighter real long and tall and just classic Dutch style Moy Tai, you know, and um, cyborg stepped up fodder in lion fight. I mean, when she was the most feared MMA fighter in the world and said, fuck it, I'll take a Moitai fight. Like zero Moitai professional fights fought like one of the best girls ever. It's really pretty admirable. You know how bad ass she is in that regard. It's cool. But you know, when you have a division that's that small, it's like what, what do they do? You know what I mean? What are you going to grow the girls, make them get bigger, like, hey, girls want some food. Hey, you know, I mean this isn't, this isn't the pride days where they can just fill them up with, um, you know, whatever the Fuck Gabi Garcia is on know, toss him out there. You'd hate to have to be legit, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:48:04       I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. I mean it's, it's a, it's a weird situation cause I, I mean I don't, I don't follow enough to, to know what is out there to follow

Speaker 1:          01:48:16       victor or do you pay attention to any other, uh, organizations outside of the UFC?

Speaker 3:          01:48:21       No. No. I'm going and honestly, I don't watch the UFC that much either. Cause I like, I don't have cable. Like don't know, I have Netflix and a DVD player, like in school. Yeah, we go crazy on eighties and nineties movies. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:48:36       Well look, with Netflix, you kind kinda don't, I mean, you could watch good shit all day long. You don't really, I mean, so many people have severed their cable now. They just don't want to do it anymore. Fuck a commercial. And how much is cable? It's like a hundred bucks a month or something like that. What's Netflix? 10 yeah, something like that. Like get the fuck Outta here. And it's not like you run out of shit to watch. Like you could watch Netflix all day for the rest of your life and never run out of shit to watch. You know? It's a weird time for those cable companies. It's like the only thing that really keeps people buying cable, I think. Or, or direct TV. One of the big things is live sports. Yeah. Like live sports is like one of those things where you kind of have to have direct TV or cable or something

Speaker 3:          01:49:25       generational too. I mean, there's a lot of people that just always had it.

Speaker 1:          01:49:29       Yup. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My generation, these young kids, they don't give a fuck about it. Yeah. John Young kids don't watch CBS and like, see what the fuck is that? And if the weird thing is if you watch regular TV now it's seems like you're watching a machine. Like you're watching some, some shit from like a bygone error, like laugh tracks and then cut to commercials. They're like, what is this cliff hangers to be continued? What is this? This is weird. So what do you do when you're not training other than the watch

Speaker 2:          01:50:03       DVDs? I'm not really much like I'm trying to get out in San Diego and like, like live, you know, in play by the like, I'll get to the beach when I can try to soak up the sun and whatever. Um, really like I have a struggle because I realized I came here to, to work. Like I came here, I changed in my life to come out here and be all in and be as successful at this as possible. So my day is about training, about doing the like rehabilitation type things that I need to do and then making sure my kids' needs are met and you know, wash, rinse, repeat with that. Like I recently went to like, I've been to a couple escape rooms. That's fun. Yeah. They're super fun. Unless you're not getting out, you sit there and they're like, hey, let's take your picture at the end. I'm all pissed. I'm still here. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:50:56       Yeah. I didn't get out. We didn't get out either. We got out of one room but it led us into the second room and we're like,

Speaker 2:          01:51:02       yeah, it's hard. I feel like there's a, there's hard, it was hard for me being an athlete because I'm like, there's harder we can do, like I can work harder at this, but there was no working harder at it.

Speaker 1:          01:51:11       Right. It makes you smarter. Yeah. It's also like weird shit to put pieces together.

Speaker 2:          01:51:18       Yeah. And then, um, let's see, there's like a, there's like a horse, a rescue that I go down and I'll like put time in down there and just kinda like be with the animals and feed them and like you can re try to rehabilitate them. Some of them are scary man like, but it's cool cause they're actually like something really to be scared of like half the shit we're afraid of is just in our head anyway. But there's this like gigantic animal that doesn't know if it wants to kick you. I love you. And it's like, you know, trying to be friends so you can help it and teach it. Stuff like that. That's taken some of my time. It's been cool.

Speaker 1:          01:51:52       That is weird with horses, right? Like you could break them, you can lasso them and they'll let you ride them. Like fuck, like wild horses. People go out and catch wild horses and ride them around. Like what other fucking animal can you do that too? That's so strange. You know like that is really strange that you could like get a horse. He got him in the bar and the horse was like, fuck you, fuck you. And you're like, no, fuck you. You get a rope around them. And they're like, all right. All right, you got me. You're riding me around now. It's very strange. I mean, it would have weird relationship people have with fucking horses. It's very strange. Oh Man. My friend Whitney Cummings has a horse and she's all in. She's all in with his fucking horse. She rides it bare back. She's like, you have to have a connection with the animal. It has to feel you like not a satellite. Alright, crazy. Absolutely. I've

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       seen Clint Eastwood movies seems like he's riding the horse pretty good with a saddle on. She doesn't do that. And she rescued this horse and she'd like on her Instagram, she's always like riding around with this fucking horse and hanging out with it, you know? And she's like spending all this time with it. It's like

Speaker 2:          01:53:00       it is, I they call it equine therapy and like, like I was trying to get, um, just because my brain was working in all these ways, like I got really excited about that treatment center, that, um, the mindset place. And then again, there's all those other people in there that are in there and the veterans and stuff. I was like, man, if I could get someone them down there working with these horses, one, it gives them something to do cause the ones that are disabled like their hate in life and in that place, like it's awesome because after a few months of being there, they all want to know how to help their like, like, tell me what I can do around here, you know. And, um, even that without, I'm like, man, if I could even get them down there, like sometimes if all you do at this place has shovel shit, you know, it's, it's still like you're around these horses and um, this place in particular, they're all rescues and it's called Ferdinand's familiar and they've all been mistreated at some point or they were trained to be something that they never graduated to being.

Speaker 2:          01:53:55       And so they were trash and now they need to turn these horses into like rideable like horses or whatever. Like that's the goal. And then they have this, um, it's near imperial beach. It's like on that land, like right on Tiawana. So you get, the goal is to take them on this like trail that goes all the way to the beach and you can ride up and down the beach like freely.

Speaker 3:          01:54:19       Can you ride the beach to Tijuana or is there a wall? Oh yeah, you can write it both. And it's like a see through wall and you see them in through, yeah, I mean it's just like, it's like panels. You can see right through it. Like I went down there and you could swim around it. Yeah, I was thinking that the other day. I'm like this, you guys are almost too tempting. Like I almost want to go over there. Is it right here? Yeah, it's there. That's exactly where we ride. Fucking strange to me. That is so God damn strange. So which side is Tijuana? This is tia one or the other side is the United States. Right. And yeah, that's exactly what it looks like. They have their little umbrellas. They're having their little barbecues, like Chilean playing music, having fun. Meanwhile we're all over. They're like, Huh? Like I almost want to try to swim over just to see if anyone is going to stop you because there is a little bit of like, if you keep going up that fence, they have like one car with one dude who's watching, who's watching the border patrol. And it seems so easy to get here from Mexico, right? All you have to. Oh, and how deep can that fence go? Yeah. How deep can it go?

Speaker 3:          01:55:28       I mean, it's put up here, put up your umbrella and like a special angle and you're good. We'll just climb. This doesn't seem like it's impossible. I mean, I'm not the best climber in the world by fucking guarantee you. I can make it over that fence a hundred percent look. Yeah, you just grab a

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       whole the Av, some gloves on so you don't fuck. You're hands on. You're going to have to do some soft soft sand Shane and cause that sprint afterwards. Again, bend your legs out. Yeah, the sports world, but unless they're on Dune buggies, they're not going to catch you. Those fat fucks. I just, I feel like swimming is the move. Why climate? You just swim a couple of hundred yards over. Yeah, right. It's like 200 yards. Maybe it shit go left and then come back. It's so weird that like build that wall, build that wall. People are so crazy. The whole thing is so strange. I think one day we're going to look back on countries like the human race one. I think one of the things that's happening to the human race for sure is that we're getting closer to each other. We're getting, we can, like I'll read like tweets that someone will post in Spanish or in Chinese or whatever and you just press translate and then you get to read it, you know, translate to English. And I'm like, wow, there it is. I could read this guy's words. And they have this thing called the Google Pixel. Uh, it's uh, you know, it's a phone and um, they have these pixel buds, these earbuds and these earbuds will translate in real time. Like you could say some shit to me in Spanish and it'll translate it in realtime to English. Yeah. And how long is it going to be before that's way better and that we're going to realize that countries are stupid.

Speaker 2:          01:56:59       See, but I think, I mean, I agree on that on the social media side. Like I feel like social media has made that connection for us on that, like that I guess mental, social side or whatever. But us as humans individually, like here and now, right next to each other. Like, I feel a huge disconnect, like look at, I mean a century ago, more than less than, like you knew who the town butcher was, right? He knew who the blacksmith was. You knew who the mayor was like you knew like, and everybody had their position, your kids were safe to run around, like everything. Like everyone knew and there was value to every single person for, for what it is that they're, their craft was or who they are. And now no one knows anyone. And like people don't want to like, like I almost feel weird sometimes that like, you know, my kids, my kid doesn't see all of the same pictures that I see because I have Facebook and he doesn't or you know, but I'm not ready, like to have my kid exposed to the library right there, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:57:56       And it's a terrible thing for kids to be exposed to. Yeah. And, and I think that, um, you know, so like shoulder to shoulder person, a person, I feel like a bit of a disconnect, you know? But social media, like we get to share information sometimes not good information. Sometimes you get information like the fact that people are communicating I think is important. Um, it's, it's making people take stands on things that they're all finding out. Oh, you believe that too? Or I think that too, like cool. Like I can find my people, you know, but on the actual like oxytocin, like social side, people actually getting to know each other, like those like intimate relationships. Like I feel like that part is, is suffering a little bit from it.

Speaker 1:          01:58:35       Yeah. I think that's suffering a little bit in real life. Um, because people were in cars, they're in traffic isolated than they go to work and then a cubicle all day and they'd get home and they're in their apartment or their house. Yeah. There's not a lot of like interaction with people and it's just stink. This is just a side effect of modern life, you know? And it's weird that there's so many, like in La, there's so many people next to each other and almost nobody knows their neighbor. It's a very strange, right. But what I'm talking about is I think countries are stupid, like states. I think countries like states, like I think we should build a wall over Florida before we should build a wall for Mexico. I mean, it's a, Florida is a state, right? But Florida is just as alien as like say Finland or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:59:21       I mean it's just, just the fact that you can move out of Florida and like, Fuck Florida, man, I'm going to, I'm going to move to Atlanta and he'd go up there and like, nobody stops you. You just go. But if you're in Tiawana like you like no dog, there's a fence up your pitch like this. No, there's no crossing did to, to me that seems like super fucking strange and almost like guaranteeing that those spots are fucked forever and the only way those anything's ever going to level out is if you let anybody travel wherever they want. And nobody's willing to do that because it might fuck up the good spots. Like la Jolla would be like, no, no, no. You can't just like, yeah, we're not equal. Yeah. You can't just come over from, I mean you think about it, La Jolla has some of the wealthiest real estate in the world. Right. And unbelievable. Beautiful views. And you could walk to Mexico from La Jolla. You could walk, I mean, what's the distance between Tijuana and La Jolla? Let's guess. Let me guess. I'm gonna say it's 50 miles. Is it 50

Speaker 3:          02:00:18       I'm going to be 50 no, I, it's not that many cause it's already it depending on, oh yeah. I would say it's a 30 minute drive. Like, like moderate. Yeah. Normal speed limit. Yeah. No traffic. 35 maybe.

Speaker 1:          02:00:32       So maybe it's 30 miles. So it's like a marathon, like a marathon run. Which people do. They run it all. They've run marathons. All Tom 2030 to 32 miles. Nine 30 so you're in fucking Tiawana. You were in a third world country and one of the worst neighborhoods of a third world country and 32 miles away. You have like these unbelievable mansions on these bluffs overlooking the ocean. Look Nigga, that shit crazy. That's crazy. And Clara Natto it's very weird. Yeah, exactly. It's very weird.

Speaker 3:          02:01:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:01:08       And, and yeah, that corn auto, the island, that's all super wealthy people, right? Yeah. That's where Dick Cheney lives apparently.

Speaker 3:          02:01:17       Yeah. They, they have the ability of shutting that whole island down. If there's like vandalism or like, cause it's, it's got its entry and it's out like, um, what is it called way? So it's not exactly an island like it does attach to the land. What does that call the peninsula? Yeah. Yeah. So, but they have an ability, uh, both the peninsula edge and

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       the bridge to shut it down as a community. If Shit's going down on the island and they don't want someone to

Speaker 1:          02:01:45       get off, that's how rich they are. Yeah. It's only one of the wealthiest places in the world. And another one, there's one off sawed off of Miami. There's like some little tiny island that's filled only with rich people. Star island, I think so. It was called. Yeah. It's like one of the most wealthy places on the planet. It's one little spot off Miami just filled with rich folks. Waiting for a hurricane to fuck up though. Is that it? Star island is a tiny neighborhood of massive houses in drama. Oh, there's drama. I only see the big x on it. Like fuck this place. Okay. Got a drama. Damn bad ass houses though. But they have good brunch to, yeah, that's a little too. So they have a little bridge and it's a little tiny island. All right. Good luck people. Weird people are weird cat.

Speaker 1:          02:02:33       That's not safe. It doesn't feel safe. Not in Miami. I'm like that whole crocodiles, the place is filled with pirates. That place is filled with weird shit. It's just Florida is so strong. I love it. I'm joking around but I hate it. But I love Miami. I just, it's so strange. It's such a, every time I go down there I'm like, you should have to have a passport to come here. This is not America. I don't give a fuck what anybody says. It's great, but it's, it's chaos. But then there's some Florida spots like we like, okay Pensacola, if you just go fuck yourself, would you say it's basically Alabama? I might as well be. It might as well we, other than Roy Jones jr I mean he came out of there. You put pence on the map? Nope. Do you do any boxing training?

Speaker 2:          02:03:16       I do. So I um, alliance has been real helpful on my hands. Like I would say there's a ton of improvement as far as that goes. Like, and I never really focused on boxing before. Like I worked Muy Thai and kickboxing and between Dutch and Thai style, you know, and then to go there and have my hand sharpened was, was pretty cool. Uh, I just never, um, I, it was hard for me to like to relate boxing to any sport I'd ever done. And like as a, as a athlete growing up as a kid, like if I don't, if I can't understand something that I'm learning, I try to relate it back to some like muscle memory of some motion I've done before in some other sports like volleyball or swimming or like what's the mechanics of how I've moved in, something that I can even dance, like turned into getting like some kind of value out of so I can learn this thing. And like boxing was not like anything that I'd ever done before. Like you've never had a predominantly hands on sport that I was good at. So it's been the, um, the most, uh, what's the word? I don't know. There's the, the most work in the less, the least natural of all of the disciplines. That's

Speaker 1:          02:04:32       a come into cause for this word, but you've trained Moitai so much tie his hands of it. Right. The

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       thing I'm excited about, the most employee ties the clenching and the cakes, you know, so to set up your wrestling, right? Yeah. Right. And just having the, the hips and everything with that, that came with wrestling and that came with, you know, the footwork of, of soccer, of dance, of all that, stuff like that, that contributed I think, easily and translated easily over to that. But boxing was, um, not so much, you know, but part of me also thinks like, you know, some of that had to come with, with learning, like, you, you gotta get hit to realize you don't want to get hit. I'm like, I don't, I'm not ready. I don't want to talk about that. Right. Like I don't want to get it. So best way to learn how to move your head. Yeah. Yeah. And slip and roll with Shit. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:05:20       It hurts my feelings and get punched in the face I'm sure. And I'm happy. I'm the kind of person that it pisses off, you know, like, so it makes me, it makes me fight harder, you know? But like it's stunning. It is stunning. Especially when you get one of those good ones in the nose and now your eyes are watering but you're not crying like that. That weird stinging sensation. Yeah. Yeah. Learning all of that, that, that all was definitely within the last few years and it's been, it's been fun. It's been not fun but fun. When you see like

Speaker 1:          02:05:53       the evolution, you know, a lot of fighters are getting into yoga. A lot of fighters are doing yoga. A lot of fighters are finding that they have like real benefits and uh, protecting their back and strengthening a lot of their joints and their ligaments and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          02:06:09       Yeah. Do you feel like it's supplemental towards like the physiology of it or because it's something as far as adding to the combative side?

Speaker 1:          02:06:16       Uh, I think both. I think for sure it's good for your mental endurance because it's, it's hard. I mean it seems like something that should be very easy. You hear about Yogi, like, oh, housewives do that shit, but if you do it 100% in, especially hot yoga, you're stuck in that fucking box at 104 degrees for 90 minutes, sweating your ass off. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:06:36       And I'm pissed at about 60 minutes and that one. Yeah. So there's definitely some mental toughness that goes into the 90 [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:06:43       you endure, you endure a 90 minute hot yoga class. But I think for your joints, for, for your range of motion and flexibility, there's almost nothing better because you're so, so hot and sweaty. Everything's loosened up and do, you can get into like deep, deep stretches and deep poses and, and also like for your foot strength and posture and balance, all that stuff is amazing. Amazing for your back, strengthening your back, your knees. Um, it's really good for Jujitsu fighters. I mean, Jujitsu people love it. So one of the best things for Jiu Jitsu because Ju Jitsu so static, you know, so much of it, it's like holding on and like trying to advance position and slowly, and then there's these bursts of uh, you know, like explosive movements, but so much of it is just clenching and isometric. Yeah. So much of it is that, and I think you really benefit from being able to, you know, in these yoga poses, holding these poses for 30 seconds. When you're, your body's burning and you're, you know, you're, you're having a difficult time to standing up.

Speaker 2:          02:07:44       I think adding the heat component to it too, especially if you're a weight cutting finder, like getting to know your body and in teaching it how to sweat, right? Like this last training camp was pretty awesome with that because I got a sauna for my, when I got us on a while ago, I was using a red light for healing and I was using the sauna because I know that you can naturally boost your a growth hormone if you're in that every night and and help yourself before you go to sleep. So I was in that every night. I tried to go in for like 45 minutes and that was so helpful in going into the fight week wait, cut. Because it was like, I know what it feels like when it's time to get the fuck out and I know what it feels like when it's time that I'm like, that sound like when I'm dripping like crazy. I still got another good 20 minutes of me sitting here like this, you know? And, and I think it's really hard on fighters when they're not in a sauna or that hot for their entire camp and then they just expect that out of their body the day before a fight. Yeah. I think you're right.

Speaker 1:          02:08:47       This is really, really good benefits as you said, two for recovery or reducing inflammation.

Speaker 2:          02:08:53       Yeah, I thought it was hopeful. I got a portable sauna to bring up my fights with me. Oh that's nice. Is it one you climb into and like just your little head sticks out is uncomfortable as hell cause you can't lean against anything or it'll burn your ass in the chair. Yeah. The chair is like this little half chair and by that point you're like, Oregon's are so depleted in and you're like leaning all weird anyway. So it was just hell. But I mean it gets it off and you don't have to leave your hotel room.

Speaker 1:          02:09:17       Oh that's nice too. Especially if you're doing something on the road. Like who was it that um, somebody that somebody was fighting somewhere and they didn't have hot water and they couldn't make weight because they didn't have the, the bathtub. I think it was a fuck. I'm trying to think of who it was. Thomas have been stressful. Yeah, they were, I think they were fighting in Brazil and there was no hot water for some reason. Like the hot water was down and they all like, what in the fuck? And they couldn't, they want one up not making weight. I don't remember who it was. I wasn't there for that event. But I remember thinking like that is one of the real problems with doing these, some of these gigs in the road, you know, you're traveling to these places and there's no fucking hot water if there's no sauna and no hot water. How he's supposed to make weight.

Speaker 2:          02:10:06       Oh, and it's awkward to be in a sauna with your opponent too. I fought Carina Damn. Uh, again as a 2,400, 25, like a few years ago.

Speaker 1:          02:10:16       There is Eric Anderson look show was very respectful. Damn.

Speaker 2:          02:10:22       Yeah. Yeah. The is Brazilian. He knows. He was like, yeah, yeah, but we, we were in North Dakota and we had to go in and the same song in it became a competition there. I'm like,

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       God, I'm not getting out. And when she, when she, like there was a point, like I'm sitting there with my coach and I'm just like biting down yet, I don't even know how long we were in, but it was like hard. It was rough. And, um, it's Kinda, yeah, exactly. Like who's going to break first? Who's gonna go first? And she ended up being like, fuck it. And she goes and she gets out. And I was like, Oh, you have quit in you. And I already knew I wanted to fight. I won the fight. I was like, I saw everything I needed to see. We're good. Crazy. That's so true.

Speaker 1:          02:11:06       Look, there's something to that. I mean, you definitely don't want to die in there, but there's, there's moments when you're in the sauna, you know, I have one here and there's this thing that happens at like 30 minutes. We like, what in the fuck am I doing? Well, you start fucking weird now. You're like, I gotta get Outta here. I gotta get Outta here. It's like claustrophobia. Yeah. Like you're, you know that if you just opened that door, this cold air and you're gonna feel great, [inaudible] just lost someone that asks you a question, just hoping it just opens the door for a second. Let's open a door. Let me run out that door right there. But that is what creates those heat shock proteins is that your body realizes that it's in this terrible situation where your way overheated. So your body starts creating these anti-inflammatory proteins and that's what's so good for your body.

Speaker 1:          02:11:51       They did a study, I think it was in, was it Norway? A doctor, Rhonda Patrick brought it up on the podcast that they showed a 40% decrease in mortality from all causes, from use of daily Sauna, 40% decrease in heart attack, stroke, cancer, everything across the board. It's unbelievably good for you. Do you use the car? Yeah. It's because your body in reaction, the, the, the response that your body has in reaction to the extreme temperature is just to create all these anti inflammatory properties and that's just so good for your body. Inflammation is just the root of so many different diseases. And problems that we have. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:12:31       So do you, what is like the temperature, induration duration recommended for that?

Speaker 1:          02:12:34       I think it's 170 degrees in, I think 20 minutes is what they want. They want 20 minutes at 107 degrees, 170 degrees for um, for, I believe the test protocol was four days a week.

Speaker 3:          02:12:48       Is that the same statistic for say like a Red Light Sauna?

Speaker 1:          02:12:52       It's a good question. They didn't use a red lights on, they didn't use an infrared sauna, so they just use the traditional sauna. But the theory is that it doesn't matter because what matters is your body reacting to the temperature change and that doesn't matter how it's getting to you. They used a regular like hot rock sauna. That's what I have regular hot rock sauna. But I don't think it matters. I think what really matters is just extreme temperature. And there's a lot of people believe in those infrared saunas. I think they're better. I don't know. No, I just know your body, your body likes sauna. Whenever I do it, I just feel better sleep all good. It's just better. It just feels better for my brain to, I just feel better about everything. I just think it's just like getting your body heat it up like that and then it cools off. It just chills everything out. You just, everything feels looser. Quiet. There's like a quiet afterwards. Yeah. But yeah, it just, everything feels like it works better, you know? And then when I do it on a regular basis, you know, but I feel the same way about cryotherapy when I do cryotherapy on a regular basis to everything seems to work better. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:13:51       See I, I only do crowd therapy a couple times and it hurt my boobs like so much that I, I'm, I just, I don't want to go all ice bath and I mean, the thing is I'll get an ice bath and I'm really like, I'll get in, but I'm complaining the whole way, you know? Like not, not saying one nice thing to you or your Mama. Like I'm getting in there and I'll do it when I'm ready and oh man, it's awful. Awful. And those cryotherapy, things like I appreciate the speed. I appreciate like the, but like do you really feel that they get through all of those layers of skin, like down to the optimal level on your tissue?

Speaker 1:          02:14:33       Well, it's the same thing. It's cold shock proteins. What happens is, I mean if they really got it through your skin, you'd be dead. Okay. They're really got through though. But the idea is that your body produces these cold shock proteins in response to anything that's over are under 150 degrees below zero. That's the sweet spot. Apparently when you hit that hundred 50 degree below zero, your body produces all these massive in anti inflammatory properties. Cause again it thinks it's going to die. So it's like freaking out. And people with arthritis and people with severe autoimmune issues where they have a lot of inflammation, real, real problems with their joints in their hands. They have huge results from cryotherapy. And there's a bunch of people that go to my place that um, they say that it's really essentially change their life. They were just in pain all the time and now they know all they have to do is go there, step in that thing for three minutes, leave and they're going to feel better and they just feel looser and relaxed and whatever their flare ups and instead of their condition deteriorating, their condition improved and stabilized.

Speaker 3:          02:15:34       Thanks. So it's about your body in the chemical value, not the cold itself. Exactly. It's about your body freaking out. Yeah, go Yag is what does this bitch doing? It's 150 degrees below zero oh my God.

Speaker 1:          02:15:47       And then when you get out of there, you feel so good. That's what does it for me. When I get out all my God, I feel amazing. It's like this rush of, it's just the, what's it called, norepinephrine. Yeah, you're, you have this rush of it in your brain. It's like you just took an awesome drug. He's feel fantastic. I get out, the sun feels great, people look better. Everything just feels better. You know, I do two sessions too. I do three minutes and then I go out for 10 minutes and then I go back in for another three minutes. That's how many times a week I try to do, depending on how many times I'd do the sauna, I want to do one or the other four times a week. So either I'm doing the sauna or I'm doing cryo. So you don't do both in the same day. Temperature manipulation? Yes, four time, four days a week. And if I don't do that, I do hot yoga [inaudible] which is another form of temperature manipulation obviously cause you're 104 degrees and you know, you're there for 90 minutes, sweating it out. And that, uh, I mean it's not as hot in the room, but your body absolutely has that same feeling that it has inside the sauna where you're just like claustrophobic. I gotta get the fuck out of here. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:16:57       I'm going to try it. I'll try it. Um, I will, I'm gonna send you this Emoji. Like that's how you'll know I'm there for them. One Sauna, I'm good. I sit in there and I just turned up the jams. Well if you look good,

Speaker 1:          02:17:11       the song and just stick with a sauna. I mean I think that they're both really good. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:17:16       What if I get in the cold shower after the sauna is that account? It was this thing

Speaker 1:          02:17:20       doing that too. I like doing that after yoga, especially in the winter when the water gets real cold. I like to get in that fucking cold shower and just really large. Yeah. I feel the two of them and you know, the UFC has that set up to where they have the Jacuzzi right next to the cold bath that they got that cold plunge. It's like set to below 50 degrees. That's right. You hop in there, freeze your ass off and then hop in the sauna. Apparently there's like really good benefits to doing that back and forth like that.

Speaker 2:          02:17:45       Yeah, it was um, the last fight out there is, uh, I was sitting in that hot tub and then, cause I didn't have the sauna, uh, hooked up. I just wanted to go in the hot tub and, and then I laid on like the partition and it had like one leg dangling in the cold pool and one leg dangling. And then the water's really good looking, I'm sure. But when you're just starving and dying and give no fucks anymore, it's just like I'm laying there like that Mackenzie dern was laying over there. I look in the little worse than me, but it's like, I guess, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:18:14       What did you think? Would she miss weight by seven pounds? Dutch shit's Kinda crazy, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          02:18:18       It's crazy because she, like, I was literally sitting in the locker room with her, like we're giggling at UFC two 22 like, because we're both like curvy, right? And we're sitting in the locker room laughing about how much that shit ways, you know, and it's like, what can you do about that? And even if you could, do you really want to like, I mean, I, I don't hate it, but sitting in there and I'm like laughing about it. And, and that was what, what was the date of that? March 3rd and then to come down much over like she got her fight right away, announced right away. You know that she was fighting me. What was it, Nate 19th or something and it was just like that. Like when you have that data in mind, I mean granted it's, it's not me, it's her. It's, I don't have her body. I don't have her problems. I don't have her life. It's not my not, it doesn't mean anything to me. But to know you have a fight and it's signed up and it's ready, like at that point it's maintenance, it's maintenance like that. That's not even doing anything different. It's just maintenance. But like these weight cuts are harder and harder on us. We get older.

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       I don't know what her body's doing. I don't know. Yeah, she's, I think she's 25 she's young and I don't, I don't know. I don't know what that, to make 115 pounds asks of her and, and I don't know if she's on her period or not. I don't know if that makes a difference to her. With me. I always, I always get mine the day of wins I have other, I have like three other girls for other girls that I know that it's the exact same thing. Like the morning of made way about to go downstairs and there's that fucker looking at you right then just like there's why I couldn't lose it last two pounds. Sweet. I would like to

Speaker 1:          02:20:01       the John Crouch about what happened cause uh, he asked her to leave the lab. Oh that was where she was at when you asked, did she ever say why? She didn't say why. He didn't say why either. They're both playing it professional. I don't know what happened, but she was

Speaker 3:          02:20:19       long time too though, wasn't she? Well like, cause when I went to go train down there, she, she was already, she was there one in the days.

Speaker 1:          02:20:25       Yeah. I don't know. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But I know her dad. He's doesn't he teach in Arizona? Magnetite I think so. Yeah. I'm hurt. Jiu Jitsu is fucking nasty though, isn't it?

Speaker 3:          02:20:37       So gnarly. Woo. Yeah, she's good. We competed against each other. Yeah. Yeah. I was beating her ass. Well, yeah. Well it was rough. It was rough because I, I, it was worlds, we were both purple belts. I think it was the open division. So I was like, I was heavier than her by the next weight class. And, um, I, I went to take her down. I double leg are all big and then like where we landed. So if this is like the square, we landed like right here. And so they called it out and so they reset us in the middle. So no points. Oh, so we get in the middle because she's Mckenzie because I'm not resilient enough. Maybe. So I would, they start us again. I'm like, okay, no, did, I can't, don't go near that line. Right. So I go and I shoot another double picker up, go take her down again.

Speaker 3:          02:21:26       Same thing, but like, it's out of bounds again because it was too close because my double is like a tackle, you know? Right. And then, um, so we go back in the middle and we shake hands and we go. So this time I go, shoot, I pick her up and I look at the ref like, like here, good. Is this good? Okay. Put her down here. Yeah. So put it down, go to pass her guard. And I passed. And then, um, I think she had, I sat back for a straight ankle lock and they're like, and they disqualified me. What? And they're like, you can't have an ankle. And they're like, you can't do that. I was, I can't do what? And they're like, you can't do that. And it's in the rule books. I'm like, okay, if I'm going to look in the real rule books, what am I looking up? What can't I do? Thank you. Can't, you can't do that. You need to go, you're disqualified. I'm like, tell me what I did. And they said that I reaped the knee, but I like, I didn't like, I don't, I really don't think I did. You know?

Speaker 1:          02:22:20       So you think they were just juke in the system to try to get her to win? She's Brazilian. I don't know. I don't know. It does. And it's happened to some tournaments.

Speaker 3:          02:22:31       Yeah. And I mean they, they, they sent, the thing is, is like, I love Ibj JF tournaments and I want to compete in them for the rest of my life. Like I, you know, so, but, but yeah, there is, there is some themes that go on there. Like there's definitely birthrights that gets you places that like that I would really like to have, but at the same time, I don't really know. I don't want to have been born into, I want it to make the statement of like happier birthright. Like, I got this, you know, I made it to some pretty bad ass tournaments in, in, you know, just like fighting the way I fight and trying not to give a shit about all of that. And like I continued to do that. I want to do the same, you know. Um, but that was, that was a rough one for me. Like I was excited about that tournament. I trained hard for that tournament and I think we were each other's like, I don't remember what match into the tournament. It was what to be disqualified. And I was like, but I still,

Speaker 1:          02:23:24       Carl specifically reaping the need. Don't you have to go against the joint?

Speaker 3:          02:23:28       I don't know. I don't know. Like, I wish I could draw you a picture, show you a finger, Bang. Come up with an excuse. We'll be, I mean, the first two takedowns like we weren't, okay. Maybe your first one, maybe the first one. We were on the line out fine. The second one, like we hit the ground and then we get it a little. So, but we were in, you know, and then the third one, I'm being a Dick, you know? And I'm just like, yeah, yeah, here good. You know? And so they like, they gave me the points and then I pass and they give me the points and then I sit back for that and now I'm disqualified and it looks like swallow. It is. And I like her, you know what I mean? Like I like her. Her Dad was at my gym teaching a seminar at my gym in Colorado, like months earlier. And so when the match is over and we go and we're like standing next to them, they're like, sorry.

Speaker 1:          02:24:21       Did you see the video that somebody made on Instagram of her after one day in Liverpool? No. Do you know people make fun of her accent? That it's not real? Oh, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu one just told me that recently that she apparently, I don't know. I mean people accents or weird to begin with. Like why do people talk the way they talk in the first place? Because the sound with the people around them. Geographical. Yeah. I mean it's, it's weird, but there's a video that somebody made of Mckinsey during, after one day in Liverpool and this basically her talking, but Darren tills voice instead.

Speaker 1:          02:24:55       It's a rough, it's rough. I'm not playing that. Don't play a JV. Don't even pull it up. I will not do that to her. But it's pretty funny. Yeah, because I was super confused when I interviewed her. Um, when she won in the UFC, they wanted a translator and I was like, what are you talking about? Like she speaks perfect English. Like this is really bizarre. So George Greer Gel came in, me and uh, he's like, just in case she gets messed up anymore, it's in like, I didn't even question it. I was like, okay. I was confused. I'm like, but wait a minute. I know she speaks perfect English. Like this is ridiculous. Raised in Arizona right now, but she fucking speaks perfect English. So I don't know if they were selling it, you know? I don't know whose idea it was. I don't know. I don't know. I don't get it. But the fucking Internet. Got It. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:25:50       Maybe they went, they went crazy. Everybody was like,

Speaker 1:          02:25:53       what in the fuck is happening? I didn't question it. I'm like, look, I'm just here to interview her. I just want her to, I mean, she wants to speak in Portuguese, wants speak in English. I don't give a fuck. But I was like, why do you need a translator? Like, that's, that's insane. Damn. I don't know all of that. I don't know all that either. You know? She definitely speaks English really well though.

Speaker 3:          02:26:13       Does it? Is there a benefit to not Brazilian? Well, yeah. I mean, obviously that's a huge demographic in this sport. Huge, Ooh, primarily the biggest other than an American American. But I'm curious if there's like a benefit or a marketing, like is there there's or something to that that would make that more,

Speaker 1:          02:26:33       well, Brazilians have immense national pride, you know, and her being a Brazilian and the daughter of a Brazilian Jujitsu legend and you know, and speaking perfect Portuguese and English and, and just, I guess maybe that's the idea behind it. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          02:26:49       She's killing it though. Like technically and with her style and I mean like everything that she brings to the table is, is already good. You know? It's like don't fuck that up. Don't fuck with it. Some. Yeah. Who knows what your dad again. Yeah. I don't know. You know what? Sometimes when I get around people, like I feel bad because like I try to be like really empathetic and, and when I'm around like foreigners and like I will totally slow down my speaking, so they will get it to the point where sometimes I think I look condescending. Right. You know where I'm like, I just want this conversation. Who is easy as possible for you because I'm already awkward and like let me help you out. You know? That's a different thing. But it's like, you remember when Madonna had a fake English accent and everybody was like, pitch, you're from Brooklyn or wherever the fuck you're from, not from England and you can't do that stuff. Yeah. I mean, depending on who she's around, I guess. I don't know. Fuck. That's the thing, like if you're around people that have that accent, you'll, you will pick it up. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:27:48       When I was a kid, I definitely had a Boston accent, but I heard myself talk on TV once when I was like 19 it was a Boston bag.

Speaker 3:          02:27:56       No, I've got to get rid of that. Like how did I pick that up so quick and my family's all Minnesota rural, you know? And so when I go home I get that and it will stick around for a few weeks. Sure. Especially if you drink, right? Yeah, for sure. I'm real tired. Yeah. Or You have your round. All those people, it's like comforting. Accents are funny.

Speaker 1:          02:28:15       It's strange. You know they're, they really are strange that the like specific to regions, it just shows you how people are,

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       you know, southern accents and even like England like you have like, like very, very different like British accents, which I'm sure to them sounds exactly like, you know Texas versus versus need work. You know, just the different twain. Yeah. My friend's wife is from Liverpool and she was trying to explain scouse to me like the way they talk and Liverpool versus the way they would talk and like say London and let y'all sounded English to me. You might as well be Australia. And I was like, I don't get it. I get that. You sound different than me. I don't get what's happening though. I don't get the accent until like somebody like, like, like Darren tills clearly has like that Liverpool accent. It's so clear. But I don't, I still don't get it. I don't know what it is. You know, you can say he's from London.

Speaker 3:          02:29:12       I'm like, oh, okay cool. English, English isn't there? Is it like that or like whoever was a rain there had like a list and so then it'd be set and then that ended up being the people picked up as like, was it a compliment or just how it happened? Cause that's how things were like pronounced when they were being explained. Like, I don't know, maybe there's some kind of like speech impediment that went along with every different dialect. And I mean that is what it is with Spain, the way they pronounce certain words is because like some fucking king somewhere along the line had a list. Strange, strange shit. Did you know that a place in Brazil that has a list also? I forget. Really? Oh I'm not, I'm sure there must be like different axes. Brazil, right. Brazil is fucking huge. I mean definitely different singsong type tones.

Speaker 3:          02:30:00       Tones. I would say more. Yeah. Did you ever, uh, train down there? Yeah, I've been down there I think three times, four times to train to chain in the visit. I did. Uh, uh, I wanted big old Jujitsu tournament down there before. Yeah. I think it was like Brazilian nationals, something like that. So we, I would go down like get fully ready to train, get there the day before and cut because once you're there and then compete the second day I was there. So the rest of it's vacation cause it's like once you're there, all the food, all of the like beach and like lazy, like there's nothing in me that wants to work hard as I could do. All I want to do is just enjoy the music and the sounds and the people and I know how to cook down there. Those two. Haas Korea's holy shit is brilliant.

Speaker 3:          02:30:45       Brilliant. Well you guys have them in San Diego. They have them everywhere now. Thank God. But a style of cooking is the best. Those skewers oversight over fire. That's what I'm talking about. Meat over fire. That's it. That's it. And then the little sauces, like the creations, just oil and lime and, and seasonings. So good. Talking to more, you won't make, wait. Oh my God. I'll always make, wait, I'm just a little bit more dead than others. Why is cap cut off her leg? We just did two and a half hours time just flew by. Right. So, um, good luck.

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       Good luck in, um, in Boise. I'm looking forward to seeing you fight. I'm very excited and I'm glad we finally got a chance to do this. And, uh, it's, uh, is it causing Gunno MMA on Twitter? What is your, do you know it?

Speaker 3:          02:31:33       She's got to check her phone. I know how to send stuff out, but I don't know what it is. Uh, it is Alpha Katz and Co at Cat Zingano. And then on my Instagram, it's Alpha Cat Zingano. And then Facebook. It's cat Zingano, MMA fighter.
