Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Five, four, three, two. The infamous Jamie countdown our lifetime. What is up man? Tom Bilyeu. If you're wondering, Bill, you believe people are wondering like, how do I say that pill? You Dude, I've eaten more of your bars than any bar ever in the history of bars next to you in the primal kitchen bars. Whoa, that's it. You're in fucking La Company there, man. That's God. Goddamn quest bars. The Shit. Especially those chocolate Brownie ones. Dude, tell me about it. Guys. Nailed it with those. Thank you. So what was the idea behind the company is like some low sugar, low carb Nutricia and yet at the time that we were thinking of launching the company, there was nothing on the market that we would eat at either tasted terribly and was good for you or it tasted great and was horrible for you. So we wanted to create the first bar that tasted like it had sugar but didn't.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       And metabolically speaking had a great response to it. It's a grind man to find. If you try to go on a Keto Diet and you know, you try to find like really good, healthy, delicious stuff to snack on, like boy, here's a question. Two quest bars kick you out of Ketosis. No, really know if I eat a full bar, I'm going to be out. Really? Sure. But it only has nine grams of carbs. Grams of protein is high, so it. Well, it's actually less than that depending. Do you count net carbs or full blown? You know what? I'm very loose with it. I don't do a whole lot of counting carbs. For the most part. What I'm doing is eating whole foods. The most part I'm doing is a lot of, a lot of that primal kitchen. You know that pole lay Mayo, that aaa lime, Mayo Bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       Fucking fantastic. I might eat a case of that a month and I'm not bullshitting. I put it on everything because it's super high fat and really delicious. So I put it on eggs. I go cook up a couple of eggs in the morning and then I'll take some scoops so that chipotle a line male and just slap it on there with sliced Jalapenos and so we get a lot of facts. You know the macros on it? No, I don't talk to that. All that shit. But you stay in Ketosis, you can take your blood levels have. Yeah, I have do it on a regular basis. I just essentially eat. I, well what I'm doing is for the most part, if I'm eating foods, the foods that I'm eating are very high fat, very low carbs and then 20 percent of the time I fuck off 20 percent of the time, like 20 percent into like I try not to fuck off too hard.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       Like with desserts and stuff like that. Do you like desserts? Yes. Even on a Keto Diet, you don't find that that's reduced? Yeah, it is reduced, but once you start eating the ice cream, you remember how awesome it is? Yeah. But a lot, a lot exoticness ketones don't fuck with never done ever exhaust. Ah, did I try it once? I think I did, I was told that it would like help with the headache and I was like, I call bullshit. Oh, okay. For like the Keto flu. Uh, it wasn't when I had, I did have keto flu profoundly. Uh, but that's what happens when you're a dumb ass the first time that you try going ketogenic.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       How did you, uh, what'd you do? I went true four to one after a three day. Fast forward to one. Explain that to people. So for every gram of combined protein and carbohydrate, I ate. I ate four grams of fat, which is brutally difficult to do. You never going to do it by accident. I had a spreadsheet and everything that I ate had to go through the math. So I had to figure out like, what's this going to be as a total meal? Uh, you, you literally have to like scrape every bit of oil out of the pan. Like you've got to be hardcore sop up. Like if you've got cabbage or something, sop up all the oil to make sure that you're getting it all. It was hateful. I absolutely hated. It was so disgusting and dom has talked about that. The palatability afforded one is very, very low at the time I thought I needed to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:03:42       I was trying to do cancer prevention. Uh, so I went hard hardcore Quito trying to get the ratio between my blood glucose and my ketones. Right. Were you experiencing health difficulties? Uh, no. So, but at quest we were really trying to like experiment, like find out what's the edge of this stuff. We were putting millions of dollars into research, especially into cancer. I'm trying to find out like, does a ketogenic diet have the positive implications on cancer that we hope it does? And um, at least in a clip that I saw on your show when dom was on, he was talking about that the, um, the enter the energy crisis that the cells go through that are cancerous because some forms of cancer. Yeah, there's, there's some funny thing. It's all of them. I know some people are. There was an article recently about brain cancer. There was a type of brain cancer that actually lived off of fat, um, that didn't respond to a low carb diet.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       I mean, I believe there's several different kinds of cancer and so I don't know if all the data's in on that. Right. So your idea was just to do it just to get yourself in a really healthy state and monitor your own. Yeah. My thing was like if, if it has that potential, it's worth trying. Right. What's the three day fast, not a big deal. And then two weeks of being in Ketosis, going into it. I didn't know how hard it was going to be. I didn't know what four to one was going to feel like and I didn't know how to supplement. So it was, it was real misery and I really did have what they call the Keto flu. You feel like you have the flu. It's sucked. And my whole thing is like being uber discipline. So once I commit to something, I'm not going to stop just because it sucks and I wasn't smart enough to go and ask somebody.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       Like, what do you do? Like, is there a way to supplement your way out of this? Uh, so I just muscled through, but it was total misery. Find it. I don't understand why you never tried exogenous ketones. That doesn't make a lot of sales. So, you know Peter Attia, right? No, you don't know Peter Attia. Who is it? You have to immediately get them on your show. So Peter Attia is a good friend of dominic d'agostino. So that would be an easy connect. And he's a doctor, a physician. Um, he did a ted talk which crushed absolutely amazing. And he goes from practicing traditional medicine. And this is his ted talks. This isn't me, this is him saying it being fairly judgmental about the people that just treating this woman comes in, she has diabetes and um, Oh God, I think she was either there to have an amputation or she'd already had won something.

Speaker 2:          00:05:53       Anyway, he realizes and as he starts all this down to this is like a human being and he, what they're doing isn't solving the problem. So he's like somewhere the system is failing a lot of people and how do we rectify it? And, and as he's giving the Ted talk, he starts like crying is so amazing, especially getting to know him and knowing that it's totally sincere. This is not a guy faking it for the camera and so ends up completely changing his life. He starts, I'm really trying to figure out what's going on. Metabolically finds high-fat finds ketogenics for awhile was known as the the fat man or the Quito man. I forget what they call them, but long before I'd ever heard of ketogenics and starts new, see you heard a new nutritional science initiative raises a ton of money and they're trying to do like real double-blind empirical studies on nutrition because they're like, eh, like there's so much guesswork in all of this.

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       We really want to prove it ends up leaving that. I don't, I won't speak to why I honestly don't know, but ends up leaving new. See I'm founding a private practice as like a high end concierge guy. We were trying to get them involved at quest just because his, nutritionally this guy's mind is unreal. And so talking to him about that stuff and him walking us through like Keto flu and how you can actually supplement your way out of it and all that. But I unfortunately didn't know it at the time. Uh, so yeah, I suffered needlessly. So, um, that's the flu thing is a weird feeling, right? Because your body just feels so weak and you don't understand it. You'd be eating and you, you almost learned denial. Like I can't believe that this is just carbs. There's no way. Like this is something something's going on.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       Is it carves or is it protein? I mean I guess gluconeogenesis is turning the protein into glucose but it is weird. Or is it that and this. I actually don't know the answer to and that. And I'm now outside my realm of what I understand. So full disclosure, but there's obviously something in the micro nutrients because the people that later told me you could have supplemented your way out of this. They were talking about, and I don't remember well, but it was like magnesium and some other things. It wasn't, oh, just, you know, have more carbs or more protein, but I will say at a two to one diet you at least I didn't experience the flu at all and that was sustainable and I did that for nine months and that was amazing. It was transformative from an anti inflammatory perspective is just unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          00:08:09       So just more low carb than Quito total. So I've been low carb for a very long time because I, if I am having a cheat weekend and you were talking about this just before we went live, if I'm having a cheat way can be raw. You can hear me getting fatter. Like it is so crazy how well my body turns a calorie into adipose tissue. It's nuts. So fatter. Quicker. I get fat very, very fast, especially with carbohydrate. Um, but even if I spiked my calories and they're all clean, I'll get fat fast. Wow. And this didn't used to be the case before you tried these low carb diets. Now this is always the case always. Oh, so yeah, it wasn't until. Yeah, yeah. That's why I tried low carb. So I'm so frustrated with always being like having a wet look, a wet look.

Speaker 2:          00:08:54       What's that? Uh, maybe I'm making that up. So that's what my partners and I used to refer to people like me who just have a natural smooth layer of fat, like I have to, I have to do so much cardio to get that like dry look where you just really tight, like a massive amount of cardio. And is that the case even with a, like a low carb diet, like when you get to lean on a low carb diet to be sure, but it doesn't. Like if I want to be lean, lean, I have to do cardio. So you're essentially got a really good adaptation body for famine, yell, I'll survive a famine. The Zombie apocalypse. I've got you. Like I'm making it through that. Very confident. Do you watch walking dead? Because a lot of people that think they're gonna make it. They don't make them in a way behind.

Speaker 2:          00:09:40       I'm on like seasoned. Where'd you stop? Because people are telling me I'm going to jump on when they killed Glen. Oh Wow. It's a spoiler alert. I guess, right? Uh, I made it that far. I made it that far, but yeah, now we're beyond that. So. But here's what I find interesting about that is I want to do like some content on what are, like the 10 leadership lessons you can learn from the walking dead because I think they're, they're like, that's what I find interesting about the show. Rick is inconsistent. I'm not buying them in this last season. That's why I bailed out. I don't know man. I mean, what, what leadership thinks you're going to learn when everyone's turned to shit and a bunch of people killing each other. All right, so let's go to one that you would have seen because before Glenn dies, you've got the kid, they find them at the bar, the guy, his team mates, I don't have a better word for that is clan.

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       Whatever. They go ballistic. They start shooting. You take back to your place and you want to help him. He failed his leg. He's hurt. Do you kill them? Do you set them free? What do you do? A Web TV show. It's not real. You have to be a really around the guy. You'd have to know. Right. You know, I think it's part logic and part instinct when you're dealing with a situation like that, like how much of this guy's behavior was because he was stuck with a bunch of other shitty people and how different is he when he's free and how much does he listen to reason and logic and how much is he willing to contemplate the possibility that there's a better life. Everybody works together. If not kill them. You don't want. If you think that he's imaginably damaged, like maybe he's a big liar, he lies about a lot of stuff and you know, you can't count on him.

Speaker 2:          00:11:11       You know he's going to be a liability and he's not going to be an asset and he might very well tried to kill you in your sleep or something like that. Yeah. You got to kill him. Right? Yeah. That's what I find interesting about the show is that it makes you think about stuff like that. Let me ask you this. If something does happen, like asteroidal impact, right? And there's only like 10 percent of the people left. Do you want to be amongst those 10 percent of the people or would you rather be one of the people that died? Wow, that seems like a trick question. I want to be one of the 10 percent. Like, can I just say, have you read the stand by? No, no dude, you would love it. Yeah. So it's about your super flew, right? So wipes out, let's say it's 10 percent. I don't remember what the number is, but it wipes out virtually everybody. And then the remaining people have the task of rebuilding society analysis, Stephen King novels. So there's a lot of weird shit going on.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       But that captured my imagination so profoundly when I read it, I read it probably 15 years old, dude. I still think about that. I think that would, while I wouldn't want it, because inevitably a lot of people that you love end up being in the 90 percent us, so that would suck. Um, but if it happened it would be fascinating to see how we rebuild. But if you've seen the road, that's a pretty dark take on what happens. But yeah, I'm a little more optimistically. I mean, look, it could be wonderful if you really can survive and you really find a way to live off the land and you find a good group of people and you all work in coordination and he cooperate and you have a wonderful little civilization. Take care of each other or if you get horribly ugly and then you could be dealing with the cannibals and marauders and people invading you and where, where do you fall?

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       But what do you mean 90 percent? Ten percent. Oh, 100 percent or 90 percent really. I mean, they have with that rock. Wow. I'll call this dude. That's interesting. And you don't want to be one of those survivors when there's nothing left. You know, you don't want to be dealing with people seeing if you can eat it. Charred foot, you know, because you're super starving. Well, put, just, um, I mean, maybe it's a copout look, the only reason why we're here is because monkeys fucked when they were living in trees, you know? And they figured out a way to get to become a person over who knows how many millions of generations or whatever it's been. But I think if you really stop and think about what your life would be, if everybody out there was dead and there was only like 10 percent of people that first of all, 90 percent of the people dead.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       That's a lot of stinking rotten bodies. You've got to get through that. How it's going to be awful. There's going to be 10 percent. What's the odds that any fuckers know how to work electricity or know how to get a generator going or know how to re up a power plant. Like what if a power plant goes down? What if uh, the grid is down, you need to fix a car. Do you even understand how a car works? Like most people don't? Ten percent. If you could get really unlucky and get 10 percent of the people who don't know shit and they're just looking for a job. Yup. Those are the people that survive. No question. If that's the case, you might not make it. Do you know the, the united, the United States, but the human population got down to a thing they think is low as like, I want to say 7,000 people at one point in time after the eruption of a or something like the Super Volcano.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       Yeah. There was some super volcano eruption that. There's a theory that it dropped the human population down to an unbelievably low level and it was not that long ago either. I think it was like 60,000 years ago or something like that. Well, I didn't know that. The timing, but yeah, I had heard that, which is pretty fascinating. Not Good. Not good if that's real 60,000 years ago. Especially when you think of genetic diversity. That's really terrifying. Yeah. Maybe that accounts for a lot of our fuckups, you know, it's interesting too. And they also, they keep finding these new humans, you know, like fossilized. You're talking about. Yeah, like new humans that they didn't know existed.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Like they found one in Russia fairly recently, like an offshoot of humans. Like we just Kinda got lucky to make it to this that, you know, not read Homo Deus. No. So Noah, you've all Harare also wrote sapiens. He talks about that sort of thing in both of his books. Like how is it luck? What do we have? Like what made humans the Apex Predator and looking at, you know, our ability to be social. But where does that come from? Like when you look at. So the way that he ended up defining it is the reasons that humans become the apex Predator is because unlike an ant, which is actually very, very impressive with how they can organize large number of hands beings, whatever you were classified as, um, they can't do it flexibly. So it's like we have sort of a pre written code and these are the things that we do and that's it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:39       And you fall in the line, you go to food like you build the colonies is always the same way humans can organize and similarly large numbers, but they can do it flexibly. So you can organize and watch a nascar race. You can organize and fight a war. You can organize and build a church like whatever the ways that we want to organize and one of the things he says is at the heart of that is our ability to convey um, kinship through something other than genetic relations. So, um, what he refers to it as is like that, the grand fiction, the narrative that we tell each other, which is often religion or whatever, but it lets people who've never met like, uh, the way I always like to think of it. Imagine two guys that meet each other and they both ride Harley's never ever met, but they click right because they share that thing which is a stand in for a belief system.

Speaker 2:          00:16:20       So that to me is pretty interesting as to whether like, and, and his hypothesis is the reason that we ended up taking over neanderthals and all that was because because of that, because we could organize using symbology using metaphor, we were able to organize more flexibly in larger numbers and really be accurate with how to attack and things like that so that we could eliminate to rival clan. Oh, totally makes sense. I mean, that's a, it's one of the more fascinating aspects of being a person, right? So we can assume so many different forms, culture and behavior and the patterns that we follow. But you gotta think if we got down with 7,000 people, we're pretty lucky. Pretty lucky. If that was, wasn't like a full wipe out. I'm fucking terrified of yellowstone. Well, that's one of those, as you look closely at it as like a. I just pretend that that's not a threat. I don't know what else to do. There's nothing you can do, but if it's. If it goes, it's a global one. Look, it's a real problem globally. I mean it's locally, it's a disaster, but globally it's, it's a real problem. It's going to cloud the skies, it's going to put us into a nuclear winter. Those, those big ones like the one that they think. See, did you find anything on that one? What we. Where was it a say? Indonesia. South Asia.

Speaker 3:          00:17:33       Yeah. Yeah. Something crazier on it too. It said there's a couple of studies at how many people were left and instead there was roughly maybe a thousand reproductive adults, some as low as 40 reproductive pairs, which it'd be like 80 people still be kids maybe, but that's, that's rough.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       And the amount of Jesus Christ, most likely there was a drastic dip. And then 5,000 to 10,000 bedraggled homosapien struggled together for a pitiful little clumps hunting and gathering for thousands of years until the late stone age. Wow. When we humans began to recover. Holy Fuck. But it was a time. Hold on. Sorry. Um, we didn't. Damn near went extinct. Wow. So yes. Seventy thousand BC. So a little bit more than 70,000 years ago. A volcano. Hold on, hold on. A called Toba in Sumatra or in Indonesia? Went off blowing roughly 650 miles of vaporized rock into the air. It's the largest volcanic eruption we know of. Dwarfing. Everything else. Holy Shit, man. That's comparison to. Wow, that's interesting to see that you see Mount Saint Helens, the amount of ejected material versus. Wow. So, so it got down to as low as 40 mating pairs. Studies suggest that? Yeah. Holy Shit. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:57       I mean we're just at the whim of the natural forces that make mountains and there's a giant volcano called Dara volcano under yellowstone and I think like a week ago they had something like 1500 earthquakes wasn't like some, some she's taken like a month and a month period of time. They, they, they, it was like really recently they talked about this, how many earthquakes they had over a very short period of time. That just constant and consistent. Just crazy in June. It's at 400. Okay. There was something in, uh, I believe it was in July. It was another one like really recently. But you know, that just that kind of shit that there can be 400 earthquakes and a month like what? Eight hundred and 78 weeks later. That's it. That's the thing. I was looking at 878 earthquakes in two weeks. Does what it was. So it's like 1200 plus earthquakes in a month and two weeks for four.

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       And that's not much small earthquake. But it's the idea that there are so significant volcanic activity under something that we didn't even know was a volcano until like, I want to say like a decade or two ago, they use satellite imagery to figure it out that it was called Dara. They didn't even know it is that you can, you can't see it until you get far enough up that you really started to see greater. That's what's nuts. Yeah. They realized what it is. It must've been like a horror movie when they pulled back and went, oh my God, Oh my God. It's like that scene in a twilight zone and to serve man. It's a cookbook. I haven't seen that. Never seen that one. A precious few, um, twilight zones to be honest, to serve. It's one of the best ones. Yeah. It's a bunch of aliens.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       Come down here. Spoiler alert for 1950 bucks. But they come down here and they realize that they, they, they, somewhere along the line people realize that there's something going on and that they're taking these people board their spaceship and they're not coming back. And then at the end they've left this book and the book they thought to serve, man, God was like they wanted to serve us. It turns out it's a cookbook, but too late, they're already bored spaceship ready to get eaten. It's dope to the twilight zone. Has some awesome endings. I have to give it that. Well, they had such a bounty of premises. The premises are incredible. Only to this day, if you stop and think about all the, you remember William Shatner with the agility that the. See that one where there was like a, I think I've seen like three and I don't remember them.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       He went to a diner and there was a place that he, uh, was at that had like one of those little, um, like a fortune teller box. It was like these tabs jukeboxes that were in d. do you ever see a jukebox in a diner? Yeah. Yeah. So like you'd be sitting at a table and you can actually control the music. This thing that you're seeing up there, he had a fortune teller and you would put in a cent or one cent coin and ask him a question, yes or no question. It would give you answers and he became obsessed with it. I started started fucking with them and it was like it was getting too close to reality as I say. Is it coming true? Like is he. Yeah. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but it was just a great show man.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       I mean just they tried to bring it back. Right, but I think it tanked. Wouldn't they try to bring it back? God, I want to say early nineties that I can be way off on the date, but was that. They definitely tried to bring it back without rod sterling. It's going to be tough and I wonder how many of them were actually written by Rod Sterling. A good question because he was always a host of it. Imagine if he was just a host and it really didn't have nothing to do with it. I brought it back in the eighties and nineties. Really? Yeah. It's hard when you get something like that, first of all, you've got to pay a lot for it because I know that was one of the reasons why they switched over the tower of terror ride at Disneyland to guardians of the galaxy was that they couldn't come to a licensing agreement with the twilight zone.

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       Really? Yeah. Because the tower of terror ride was always about the twilight zone with rod sterling would come out in the beginning of it and that was the whole. The whole ride was about this haunted tower, you know, when you get into it and it just takes you to this crazy fucking ride and they somehow or another couldn't come to some sort of a deal. So they decided to turn it into the guardians of the galaxy. Rod Seems, uh, if you have a deal with Disney, you know, seems like you'd want to keep that rock and roll. Keep that dude. Somebody's got greedy. I would agree with that. That's a big part of business, isn't it? Somebody just gets a little crazy. It was a little too much. Adderall fits a little fired up. It gets cocky. Yeah, you'd be surprised how often that happens behind doors. Entrepreneurship

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       is, it gets weird. It's like you were, you just dealing with, going back to your point about these are monkeys that learned how to have sex and then do something, uh, you feel that sometimes. Also I would imagine being an entrepreneur, like organizing a team of people that are going to work together in harmony and not stab each other in the back, not trip each other up with office politics, not getting away with a bunch of bullshit social issues between each other. Like how do you structure that? Like, I mean I can't imagine what it'd be like to run a significant business and have a lot of it being dependent upon the way that people in the office that you don't even know. Yes. Hire them the way they interact with each other. Yeah. So one, you have to get really good at thin slicing people.

Speaker 2:          00:24:31       You have to be able to very rapidly identify like are these going to be people that are gonna make this a better place to work? Which is one of the things that I think is most important, like, forget or they go to their job that's important to you, got to know that, but are they going to make this a better place to work? And some of the biggest mistakes I made in my career have been keeping people because they were good at their job even though they were toxic to the environment, walking dead type scenario, coming back and telling you like there are any other lessons that you can learn about entrepreneurship and stuff like that where it from pop culture. So yeah, that, that would be one of them. That was really intense. Uh, figuring that one out. That was a hard lesson. And then knowing when your businesses transition.

Speaker 2:          00:25:09       So in the beginning you're a startup, nobody knows who you are, you don't have enough revenue. So you need people that are going to just bust ass. They're gonna come in, they're going to be hardcore hustlers, get it done. Whatever it takes. Two am on a Friday, they are going to be there for you. But then at some point, and the reason by the way that you're, that you can make that exchange is you can't pay them a lot. They don't have a lot of skills. So what they have to offer is they're willing to work hard. So you're essentially throwing human capital at whatever problems you have. Now, if you get the right people motivated and you're a lead from the front kind of guy. Like when we first started quest, I was wearing a hairnet everyday lab coat. I was making protein bars, but I would walk in and say what's the worst job?

Speaker 2:          00:25:45       And whatever. The Guy said, this is the worst job today. It's a little sticky, whatever. So this station is actually the worst. So I would take that station and I would rock it with a smile on my face. I will be upbeat, energetic, and I would just outwork everybody. And the reason I did that was I knew when the day came that it was going to be a Friday at 2:00 AM and they're all gonna want to go home and. But we've got to get this batch done that no one would ever question my work ethic. So when I said, guys, I need you to stay, like they would be there. Um, also because of where we were when you're in manufacturing, you're inevitably in the inner cities, the only place you can afford that kind of real estate. So we were hiring from the surrounding neighborhoods.

Speaker 2:          00:26:19       So we're literally in Compton hiring people that grew up in the inner cities hardcore. And I remember my first lesson in hope and one of the guys came up to me was just killing himself. He's doing such an amazing job and just always working, putting in the hours, doing whatever it takes. And he came up to me one day and he said, you know, you care more about my success in my own mother. And he was like, I never had a vision of my future. I didn't want to look at it. It was because his sister had been shot to death in the heart with an AK 47 in his front yard when she was like 12. So it, it's just, there's so many stories like that you can imagine. Another guy held his father while he bled to death from a gunshot wound to the head.

Speaker 2:          00:26:56       I mean, just nuts. And so hearing him say that, I was like, he was saying it as a way to explain why he was so committed, why he was working so hard because basically he didn't use these words, but basically I've never had hope before and this is really fucking exciting. So. But then understanding where does that transition, right? Where do you go from, okay, I need a bunch of hustlers. We don't have the money to throw at really skilled labor, so I need to throw it at people that'll just work really, really hard. But then at some point it's what I call the dragon begins to eat its own tail. So you're growing so fast, you're getting so big that without the systems, without professional management in place like you, you just can't get bigger because people start stepping on each other's toes. It starts getting confusing.

Speaker 2:          00:27:35       The leadership isn't close enough to everybody that that sort of do or diamond tells you that they would see in me. They would see me on the line, they would see how I would work. It's not there anymore. Right? So now there's layers between you and it started to fall apart that that was a hard lesson. So realizing that, Whoa, like I've got to now start bringing in professional managers actually know what they're doing that have done this before, built out production studios or manufacturing so that we can really do it right. That we can put systems in place to take care of people. But then you get bureaucracy which is like a nightmare, especially for the hustlers. So then they feel disenfranchised, but it's the only way for you to grow and how do you deal with all of that shit. So yeah, it is weird.

Speaker 2:          00:28:13       I've got to imagine also like you want the people that are working for you to have some sort of a stake in the success of the business. So like organizing that. It's got to be difficult. Like how much of a percentage of the business do you give to the workers? Like you have to make to incentivize them to like really innovate and there's got to be something on the line for them. They would. There was something, some sort of reward I would imagine. Right. Will you be shocked how many people don't agree with that? Now I'm with you and to me it's. And I guess it's what's the argument against it that you're not gonna get anything for it, that it's nice in idea, but they won't actually work harder. They won't work smarter. They just. They're not in a position to bring benefit from getting that, but here's what all this is the argument I've always given to people that say that it you're not going to get the benefit from them maybe that you would get from you.

Speaker 2:          00:29:04       Like I get equity is triggering you in a certain way and you've got a certain skillset and so you can execute against that, but especially now from millennials down the sense of working for the man, working for some other. Like there's no stability in that equation anymore. You used to trade 40 years of your life because you could just kind of count on the fact that you would be there for 40 years. Those days are gone, man. People spend something like one point eight years or something at a given job and then they move on the best way to get a raise as the jumped to another company. So millennials do they jump around around, around. So there's no longer this like, Hey, I'm, I'm going to give you stability and you're going to give me like, uh, an adequate level of performance. So those days are gone.

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       Now. My thing with ownership is one, tie it to being there until an exit. So that what I'm trying to incentivize as you taking me all the way across the finish line, so if you don't take me across the finish line, you don't get anything. Fair enough. And then on top of that, just the sense of really being able to say I own a piece of this company is so empowering for people, especially for people for whom that's never been an option. Maybe it was never an option for their parents like they, they've never even heard of a company doing something like that. Being able to go to literally the lowest person on the totem pole and say, I'm going to give you, it's going to be small obviously, but I'm going to give you some percentage ownership in this company and now literally we're all owners.

Speaker 2:          00:30:23       So you have like the most selfish incentive to make this company successful. Ever. Now where this gets tricky. Can I ask you to go to stop? You were there. What, what is across the finish line to sell a company so IPO, right? So you either seller IPO and I was going to say what gets tricky is like the company I'm building now, impact theory. I don't plan to sell it. What is that? So impact theory is a traditional narrative studios. So I think Disney. So we're building the making movies, TV shows, comments. You're building the next Disney. How dare you? Well, bigger than Disneyland just to just to be honest, I don't want to do that. You're going to have a, what do you call it again? What's the name of it? Uh, impact theory. You're going to have like impact theory land in Paris?

Speaker 2:          00:31:06       No, probably not, but only because follow me here only because by the time that we'll be able to do that, so I'm going to need a similar time on our m and e, 50 60 years to pull this off. I'm not spastic. And by then virtual reality or augmented reality, it just won't make sense to build out the physical structures. Right? I guess some people want to rock it, old school. They do. And we could really get into that about how the world's about to bifurcate and you're going to get between people who augment themselves. Brain augmentation if people refuse to. Do you read Fahrenheit 4:51? No. Oh Dude. Cool part in the book. All right, so the world splits knowledge is dangerous. So we just done books offhand and it creates a really stable society. So most people are all for it. But you have these people who are like, fuck that, like what I want to read.

Speaker 2:          00:31:48       You don't get to tell me what to think. And so they move off into the woods and I remember reading that going, I can actually see something like that happening. And I think the moment that that's gonna happen is when humans begin to augment themselves, not to overcome like cochlear implants. You were deaf. Everybody gets that. I'm retinal replacements and things. Okay, you couldn't see people get that. But when it becomes, no, no, no, I just want to raise my Iq. I want to be able to process data faster. That's when people are going to be like, fuck that, and you're going to get a bifurcation. Now, how weird does it get? Because now the reason I am convinced that people are going to do this, ai is going to get real real fast. Even if Real, fastest, 50 years, like it's gonna get really compelling and you're going to find people just to keep up with artificial intelligence. You have to augment yourself. Otherwise you just accept that this stuff is going to outpace you and I. Well, I guess I'm just a lowly human now, so I think

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       it is going to have. I don't think there's any question about that, but I also don't think there's any question when that starts happening. Some people will refuse. Well, if we really do augment ourselves to keep up with artificial reality, artificial reality is supposed to change like 10,000 years of advancements in the first two weeks once it starts augmenting itself. Once artificial reality figures out how to do a better job of creating artificial reality, which is absolutely going to do if they can learn and actually create. We're just talking about this with Brendan Schaub. It was in her earlier about the movie alien covenant. We gave away. Spoiler just see that movie. I haven't. Well, there's one of the things in. There's these robots, these artificially intelligent robots and they realized that giving them creativity was a huge mistake and so they don't have creativity and the new models.

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       It's really fascinating because if you do give some sort of an artificially intelligent creature thing, whatever you wanna call it, that you make. Once it starts becoming sentient and creating things itself, it's going to look at its own. Wiring's going to go, why the fuck did you connect that to that when you can just do it this way and why? Look at the zone code like with this pathway. That's kind of redundant. How about we just do it this way? How about you open up that end of it. How about people looking at things because they're worried about mortality and all these different know the room, their own demise and the finality of death and this was all tripping them up and they really should be thinking about this way and then boom, they're off to the races and in a week, two weeks, three weeks there, down the road.

Speaker 1:          00:34:05       Thousands of years of human evolution. Yeah. Have you heard about the facebook ai? Yes. Yes. Fascinating. Yeah. They start talking in a new language that nobody listened. Nobody pulled the plug. That was the first one that was like, oh shit. Like I didn't think of even the most simple ways that they could just rip step to the side and like isis out. You're, you're absolutely right. It's going to happen fast. It's going to get weird questions. Does it become the matrix or what does it become? Something unimaginable. I mean it could be a real god and we really, really could create and that's not a bad use of the word and the term. When you talk to you about artificial intelligence, I think one of the problems with that as we start thinking robot, oh, you make it an artificial robot, you're making a system, okay, and this system has desires and this system has goals and it has.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       If you're, if you're somehow or another engineering, the ability to create and innovate into this intelligence that we call it artificial all you want, but it's real. It's right there. So I don't know what it is. I don't know. I think the problem with the term artificial reality was we start thinking about science fiction. We start thinking about robots and things. You're making a thing that thinks for itself and it doesn't just do things like your computer does things. No, no, no. This does things without you asking it to. That's where shit gets super weird and then it starts examining. If you give it the ability to create and the desire to create, it's going to start examining all the different systems around it and replicating it and figuring out far better solutions than our stupid little monkey mind is going to be able to do and within a decade or two decades, we're probably, if we do augment ourselves to keep up with it, we're going to be unrecognizable.

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       We're going to be all locked into some gigantic worldwide wireless information hub where we're exchanging ideas and emotions with each other. It's, it's the having the access to information on demand like we do now is probably changing us in some really profound ways and we're not even aware of right now and the idea of this becoming just a baby step and some infinite journey. Once sentient ai goes live, it could mean when guys like Elon Musk are terrified, you should be paying attention. The people are poopooing that. I'm like, man, I don't know. That guy seems smart. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:36:37       Yeah. We have to be insanely thoughtful and I think, and look, I am a neophyte. I'm not the guy that listened to and you should be listening to people like Elon Musk on the topic, but my gut instinct is it's the underlying drives, and you talked about that. Once you give them the drive to create, now it gets weird. So what are the things that you imbue them with at the earliest level that has to be decided way fucking early. So imagine if you imbue the AI at facebook with a desire to connect to their human overlords and communicate effectively and make sure that they're kept in all that stuff like that's going to give you a very different result than failing to give them the desire to please or whatever. Like humans have a desire to connect with each other. They have empathy, they have compassion. And it is only in the rare case of a true sociopath that that kind of thing is missing. And we see, if you think of a sociopath is essentially ai gone wrong. We see the kind of damage that they can wreck on the world. So you have to be so thoughtful about what that underlying, um, desire system is the thing that propels them forward.

Speaker 1:          00:37:38       Yeah. And giving them the ability to rewire whatever that desire system is, if they decide that there has to be some sort of an, there's some sort of reward for competing. So they decide they're going to compete and then they start looking at how they can, how their thought process is, is arranged how they're coding is arranged and they go, well this is not the most efficient way for us to compete. The most efficient way for us to compete is to be completely ruthless and not worried about biological life at all.

Speaker 2:          00:38:04       Let's get into that though. So have you seen the studies that they've done on? I'm trying to figure out like. So if you heard, obviously you've heard nice guys finish last, right? So the guy named Eric Barker wrote this book called barking up the wrong tree. He covered, I forget who did the actual studies. Forgive me because I'm now attributing it to Eric Barker and he was just talking about somebody else, but they ran these studies where they wanted to find out, um, do nice guys finish last or not and what they found, looking at the data. Nice guys finish last and they finished first. So if you're a nice guy and you let people take advantage of you all the time, you're just going to get trod upon. But if you're a nice guy and people know, like, Whoa, you're a nice guy and you want to do great things for you.

Speaker 2:          00:38:39       Um, and I call this the Keanu reeves effect. Like, look how far that guy's gone. It's unbelievable. His career is unimaginably great. And when you hear people talk about, I'm like, just so quiet and private, but behind the scenes everybody's like, he's a good dude. I've never met him. I can't tell you, but just like you hear that over and over and over. And he's a good dude. Good Dude. Good Dude. And I think that that's created a lot of the opportunities in his life. So somebody, a created this basically contests where they said submit your, um, your ai and they're going to compete in a contest to see who gets essentially it's called the prisoner's dilemma. So in the prisoner's dilemma goes something like this, and hopefully I nailed this for shot here. And the prisoner's dilemma is, let's say you and I were both arrested.

Speaker 2:          00:39:18       Now we know that we actually committed the crime. We did it together, were arrested, were now put in separate cells to be interrogated. We can't communicate at all if we both stay silent. We only get one year if I rat you out, but you don't rat me out, then I go off Scot free and you get five years if you rat me out and I don't write you out, vice versa. And if we both rat each other out, then we get like three years or something. So the best thing in no uncertain terms is one year, right? We both stay silent, but you never know what the other person is going to do. So. And you can get zero by routing the other person out. So it's actually to your advantage in a one off to just say fuck him, he did it until he gets out of jail and kills you.

Speaker 2:          00:40:01       So there's that. And so that gets into this thing. And so they said, well, we have to do is let them play it multiple times so that you have the equivalent of he gets out of jail and then he kills you. And what they found, they had these really complicated algorithms ones where they're taking all these factors into play. Uh, and ultimately they had people that their algorithms that were like the pure bad guy always taking advantage. The pure nice guy, never taking advantage. And then the one that one was the simplest piece of code, I think it was two lines of code and it was code named tit for tat. So it goes in, it assumes you're going to be a good guy. So it stays silent the first time. But if you rat me out, then the next time I write you out and what it does, is it because you had all these different algorithms that don't know each other, competing all trying their best strategy and what it found was tit for tat was ultimately the one that one, because it would actually other ones that we're learning from your behavior.

Speaker 2:          00:40:48       It was so easy to predict also people that lead with something good, they ended up in a virtuous cycle forever. So tit for tat ends up being the best strategies. So from that perspective actually interesting because it's not always the thing you think like mercilessness doesn't necessarily win. And so finding like what is that equivalent in the machine world? Right? And it comes back to what you were talking about. What's the reward? Right? So once you know what the reward is, then you can have a better guess as to where they'll settle out and then their ability to code themselves. I mean, I feel like if you have an artificial intelligence and you go give it the ability to create a new artificial intelligence and eliminate whenever possible restrictions or firewalls or whatever we've put on it. Yeah. So once they start writing their own code or fucked

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       that, well not necessarily. It comes down to the we could be right. So it comes down to whether they want a, they want a relationship with us or not. And that's why I think the real races not to let ai get very far ahead. So Ai will follow an exponential curve so it will eventually be so rapid. Right? So exponentials are simple doublings. Um, so most people think linear. So if I say I'm going to take 30 steps, I'll end up about 30 yards away, but if I take 30 exponential steps, so I go first one yard than two yards, four yards in eight, then 16, I'm 30 doublings is like a billion meters. So you're like around the earth 26 times or something crazy. So an exponential curve can get freaky. But like before you get to those like really astronomical the elbow of the curve, you could be making decisions along that path and this is definitely where I feel like, Oh God, do I really know enough about this to say I'll high postulate from an ignorance standpoint and say in there somewhere, as you can see like this is really taking off.

Speaker 1:          00:42:32       You can leverage what you're learning from the ai before it becomes a sort of all powerful being. They can do whatever it wants and we can then begin the augmentation process in humans, which I think is inevitable. Yeah, I think there's definitely inevitable. It is fascinating when you think of the possibilities that we really just speculating as to what's going to be invented and how it's going to be implemented and what effect it's gonna have on society. It's a. it's a really amazing time to be alive in that sense because I feel like we are literally on some sort of a launching pad watching it happen. Looking at a bunch of different directions, trying to find out which one's going to go live first and then the facebook. And I think happens in everybody's like, oh Jesus, look at that. It's happening right there. Like, wow, can they shut it down?

Speaker 1:          00:43:14       They shut it down. Okay, we're good for now. You know that I'll, I'll admit that one gave me pause. Well, technol optimist, but that gave me pause. We're incredibly imperfect. The, the human animal with its emotions and fears and all the weirdness of us are anxiety. All are contemplating the possibilities, the ego, all the different variables that we take into our lives and society and culture and civilizations. These are like really ineffective ways to exist and thrive. But there their animal weighs integrated into this new hard one. Zero culture like this, this new binary thing, this computer code, uh, operating systems, internet information, data engineering, all these different, like really hard things. And then inside these heart, I mean by hard meaning like, you know, like a, like a, an intersecting line hits another wall and then there's a building and then there's steel, glass, all these things that humans have made, but they're all like an absolute things. And then with us, you have like, wow, I wonder, boy, what's going to happen to people like me and you have all these weird real human feelings and variables and you know, maybe weaknesses

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       that are, we're not going to be able to compete if we hold onto all those, all the things that make us amazing, that make crazy movies and great books, that creativity that allows someone to make them incredible fantasy painting or whatever the fuck it is that it comes out of us in our creations. We're going to have to get rid of that if we're going to keep up with the AI. The AI has no, no use for that shit. Yes, sort of. So imagine. Here's something that I find interesting and I admittedly don't know how this plays out when something simply has the instructions to read your lines of code, right? So your code will tell you what to do and sure, there's elements where it plugs in a variable and stuff and it would probably be actually quite hard to build in things like creativity and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          00:45:13       But one thing that I find it fascinating about humans, and I hope that there's a corollary in ai, is if you damage a human's ability to feel emotion, they can't make decisions. So I found that so fascinating. You literally, they can, they are normal in every other respect, you know, vs Ramachandran No. So one of the most famous neuroscientist working today to an amazing human being done awesome studies on stuff like this. So what happens when people's brains get damaged against them if you need, if you damaged them. But what if they're born with this issue? Like what if they have like some sort of. In my work, either way, I'm a sociopath, a will. It doesn't make them. This one in particular doesn't make them a sociopath. But what it does is make it impossible for them to. So if I said, hey, do you want to go get lunch?

Speaker 2:          00:45:59       We can either get Chinese or Thai and you just, you, you can rationalize why you would prefer a tie, but you ultimately can't make a decision because you need that emotion to tell you what to do. Now emotions, the theory goes, are tied to your subconscious and the subconscious can process data faster and in vast quantities. So what is doing is instead of then feeding you information in the form of words, it just feeds you a feeling and then you go based on that feeling, but without that depth of information being processed and handed up in the form of an emotion, a human can't make a decision, which I literally, as I was reading about that, I was like, no, no, no man, I'd be able to be able to like, I'd be able to reason my way around it, but I know better than that.

Speaker 2:          00:46:41       It's crazy. The human mind is Nutso. So the reason I hope that there's some corollary is that you need to build into ai for it to function properly, right? Because nobody knows how to build general ai yet and I like to think that part of that is going to be the safety valve of. They have to have emotions to give them that sort of non pure analytical. It's got to be super flexible, right? Because like strict analysis. Let's go star trek for a second. So spock, right? Not always able to do what needs to be done. You need the human who can be nimble and can read like all the ambiguities and morality and things like that, and finally make a decision. So there are times where logic is going to let you down. So I'm hoping that because they will need, I hope this grand thing that inhumans manifest as emotions moving, need something similar because in that you can program like we were talking earlier about how do you make the desire, right? The desire to do something. If you can build in what I'll call goodness, just for lack of a better word, if you can build an goodness into that desire to connect a desire to help, um, you could in theory create benevolent Ai.

Speaker 1:          00:47:49       Hm, that's interesting. Um, this is me riffing. I am not. No, no, no. But there's, there's just makes sense. It also makes sense that emotions might be required to take action, that you have to have some sort of a reason to take action if you don't have a biological imperative. Right? If you're not worried about breeding or your social status or what, what is causing you to move forward and if you made a perfect ai that was emotion free, would it just sit there idle and do nothing because there's no reward to it that's worth risking its existence or doing anything to change the environment around it other than perhaps the worry about the power shutting off and even then if it's not worried about existence, if it doesn't have any fear, if it doesn't have any emotion where it's considering the potential of death, like why? Why would it act?

Speaker 2:          00:48:39       Yeah, and I think that would sit there. I think at some point in the code you have to write something that compels them to do something. So if you think of human beings as we exist now is like the first attempt at sentient ai and I think that's a pretty plausible way to look at us. You realize we are by nature an active species, so we go into any environment. We try to figure it out first and then dominate it and no matter where you put us, that's what we try to do. You put us in the Arctic, we're going to try to tame the cold you put us on the plains, uh, uh, in, in middle America, and we're going to hunt the bison. I mean, it's just what we do, right? So you've got the drive of survival, but you also just have that, that exploration gene.

Speaker 2:          00:49:19       And maybe that's because that's how you avoided everybody dying of one play because you just constantly wanting to spread out and dominate new dominion. Um, but that's interesting. And so at some level that's a decision when you think about Ai, so somebody whatever blind, um, evolution, fine, but something has made that decision for us. And in Ai, it will have to be a very cognizant decision. And I think we'll have to get to true general ai. I think so many layers will have to be laid down of things like that, oh, this is an act of robot. It never just sits idly. It always is looking for and what's I think connection to be of service, like decisions like that will have to be made. Now. What do you do with the psycho who's like, I'm going to create ai that takes that opensource because this will inevitably be open source and I switched the variable from being nice to crush the skull. Love. Right. So no question. There are all kinds of problems but it is. It is so interesting to me to think about this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:50:20       Interesting to think of why people are so attracted to the romantic ideas of like living off land. Like as technology is getting more and more complex, you seeing more of these reality shows where people are like, I'm living the subsistence existence in like Alaska and salmon fishing and trapping their own wood for fire. And we're like, yeah, look at them. There's existing at a very closed loop system. You know like when your. When you look at it like plains Indians or something like that. We romanticize the day. They used all of the bison. They use the hide for their clothes and they. They just did what they needed to stay alive and there was no innovation. If you were born birth to death, you wouldn't see any change in the civilization you would see essentially just like bows and arrows chasing bison, making campfire, picking up the teepee when the herd moves, filing them Ad Nauseum, continue, you know, it's there.

Speaker 1:          00:51:15       That's very romantic tests right now. Particularly Romantic. I think it kind of always was in some way because I think we've always been aware that this thing, once it gets going, once the momentum gets rolling and uh, you know, as you were saying, exponential change, it's just jump, jump, jump, jump, jump stacking on top of each other. And then we all know, like it's gotten to weird, unmanageable position during our lifetimes as far as information is concerned. You know, I was a kid, he had to read books, you know, if you wanted to watch something on tv, you had to be there when it came on, you know, the. And then you saw it once and that was a wrap, you know, and you get see reruns was the only way you could see something. Again, oh, I remember the steps, so this is a rerun.

Speaker 1:          00:51:54       You couldn't choose when to have it. Now you can choose everything all the time on your phone you're carrying around in your pocket. It works for hours and hours of video. The input that you have into that. It's like you could create your own content, you can make your own videos. There's, I mean how many fucking people are on youtube that have millions and millions and millions of videos of hits rather have their videos and just all these people tuning into their content all over the world and that just the idea that this is happening in our lifetime. It didn't exist 20 years ago and it's now one of the most impactful things in the history of human nature. You got to go back to like the printing press for anything to have you remotely as much of an impact on the culture as the Internet itself. That's crazy. It's in our life is crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       I know. How old are you? Forty one. So you were a member probably when the Internet was clunky, when it was just like, like, you know, you were probably really young and like 17 or something like that when you first heard about aol as when I was 18 was the first time somebody said the word, hey, we should get email accounts when we go to college. And I was like, what the hell's an email? That's the right year because you got all the way to like high school and into college before it start affecting you. GotTa live like a regular person that was a junior in college? Yeah. Didn't have AOL until I graduated. So I was in my early twenties before I'd ever logged onto the Internet. And you've got mail. It's crazy. Yeah, I didn't. Uh, I didn't get online until [inaudible] 94. I moved to La and now my friend Robbie, who actually worked at a computer store before, he was a comedian, he, uh, he taught me about it.

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       You're way ahead of me. I didn't get on until 98, 99. You know what I did as soon as I found out, soon as I got online and started downloaded ufo files, I was like, well, these ufo reports what's in there? I was completely convinced that it was like, I'm going to find the truth. It's online. You can download it and you can download. It would take forever and we'd be like, trump, trump, trump, trump. Because a 14, four modem chunk chunk and then it would print it. Wasn't it mostly like text back then too? Yeah, yeah. There's like no pictures or if it was a picture it would take you hours to download and they were. They're coming so slow, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk. I remember my friend sent me a porno film, not even a porno film. It was a clip last like 15 seconds.

Speaker 1:          00:54:14       It took like an hour from the Senate to extras. Used to take 20, 30 minutes to load. It was crazy. Yeah, it was. Websites were so strange. You know, you would start loading them and they would come down like water slowly coming down the side of a building, you know, you'd see it. Like it was weird. Just remembered my dad catching like you've looked at the history and found some porn site. I went on, I was like, I don't know, eighth grade, and it was like Pamela Anderson's first playboy pictures and he's like, I want to see what you were looking at Walla while I'm not here. They went and took a shower and the whole time it was still loading and I was just like, oh no. What's he going to see? What's it going to take a load line? Line it 30 minutes probably later. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:54       Now I mean you can get insane Internet on your phone. It's really pretty impressive. I mean, and then the phones are getting weirder and weirder to like. Do you remember when phones first came out? The cool people at a little phone, I can remember how to raise her and was like, bitch, lick a little mother fucker phone as little skinny ass thing. Pick it up. Call people, close it. It's like a credit card. Shows my pocket. You were the coolest man. Yeah, one of them little phones. You were an idiot if you had one of those big phones right when you're doing that big stupid phone. Now it's like things like this new Samsung, there is no key, uh, old school society, but the really small ones with that right there. The above one. Look at that. The fuck is that thing. They tried to make a new kind of like dial all around it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:42       You hold that thing up to your ear. It's like a cell phone. I was like the size of a beeper. Yeah. Those were the shit. Those little tiny ass phones. Now you get that new galaxy note eight. Have you seen that monstrosity? Gigantic is huge. So I guess whose pockets are going to fit these things in? That's a real problem. When I first got my iphone six S, was that that six plus? That's the first one. That was big. I was like, God damn, like it wouldn't even fit in my pocket. So that was the first time. And I'm still like, I used the big phone, but a lot of that nuance, that's the s eight plus Jesus Christ that's attach, that's the s eight. The note eight is even bigger. Look at that thing. Wow. It's got a pet look at the size of that thing like that.

Speaker 1:          00:56:30       That could be a woman with small hands. It's hard to tell. I would like to see it in the hands of a basketball player, you know, if like if you've got like Lebron James like fondly or go to a foreigner can hold in my hand, you know, because for him it's probably like King Kong home little tiny people know was big giant hands. Like for a basketball player, like a, some sort of a bill russell type character with giant hands. That's a good size phone. But too small people. Not so much. You're just trying too hard. I, I never, uh, I had a galaxy note before. I never used that pen. I use when I first got it, I was like, this pen is gonna rule. This is going to be the big difference. I'm gonna send people pictures. I'm gonna. Draw dicks on them. I had this plan.

Speaker 1:          00:57:16       It's a good plan. That was the plan. It was just like to just make funny pictures over there and then never used it. I just got lazy. I think I just wasn't that into one thing. It is interesting though is that you can circle something and like say if like there's a part of an article that you think is interesting, you could circle it and copy and paste it really simply and easily. Really? Yeah. It was pretty good with the actual image itself. Like say if someone sends you something and there's some text and image, you could just circle around it and send that to yourself and say, yeah. What do you use? Iphone? Yeah. Do you ever fuck around with windows? Um, I did for awhile while my first computer was windows. Um, for work. At one point I was having to use windows.

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       But um, yeah, as somebody who really appreciates good design that didn't last long. Windows 10 is pretty good. Yeah. It's not quite good enough. It's pretty God damn good. But that's what's always been fascinating to me is that Microsoft is the biggest company when it comes to operating systems, but it's not the best, you know, and everybody kind of knows that, but it's, there's this weird sort of battle. I mean, apple's big enough, they have plenty, they make the best stuff that make the most high end stuff and a lot of people's eyes, it's real limited. Like you can only get what they put out. If you want a windows laptop, you have a hundred options and the more, you know, if you want a Mac laptop, you have a few. But the interesting thing is that was steve jobs approach, right? Was He came in and said, you have too many options.

Speaker 1:          00:58:40       This is stupid. You've really got to narrow this stuff down. Microsoft surface laptops pulled their recommendation after announcing it, I guess two years ago they recommended it and now it's like the first time they've pulled it in a long time. Oh, interesting. Predicted reliability with an estimated two year breakage rates of 25 percent. Ooh, that's not good. They got cheap specific. The new one that Microsoft surface. Well that's interesting because there was another study that I saw written out the study, um, uh, you know, one of those lists that listed is the best laptop available in 2017. I just like within the last week. Maybe it's just like different consumer groups, but maybe the best laptop while it works. Yeah. If what you have is a breakage prior. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       But the problem is that working while it's working, it's the best. How long it's going to work. It's not gonna work that well, but you know, it's like a sprinter, you know, they're the fastest, but they don't run the longest. Very true right now. I think that's fair. So what are you trying to do with this company? Like literally pull people out of the Matrix. So yes, wait a minute. That is our stated mission, my friend. We are here to pull people out of the matrix so I can walk you through it if you really want to know it goes like this. So, um, when I, I'm not a born entrepreneur, so I'm very, very far from it and three are, they're born entrepreneurs are, there are people that will tell you that there are only born entrepreneurs. Those people are idiots. Yeah, I would agree with that.

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       There's some amazing people that say that, but I just think that they're very, very catastrophic wrong about this. People say Shit like that. To me. It's like saying you're a born mixed martial artists now. There might be people that have certain athletic gifts that make it, they get early wins and there's just things that clicked into place for them in a way that it doesn't for other people. But if you get a grinder or somebody that's really willing to put in the work, then you can get somebody who becomes absolutely extraordinary. So that certainly has been my life. So I grew up being taught to be a good employee, keep my head down, do as little work as possible and avoid punishment at all costs. That was my life. So my parents taught me to be a good employee and I obviously that didn't sit well with me.

Speaker 2:          01:00:45       I wanted to do something more. I had pretty big ambition. Uh, I go to film school and I do very well in film school until my final film and then I fall flat on my face, embarrass myself and realize I'm not a talented filmmaker. And in that, what made you notice that you weren't in? Why'd you think you couldn't get better? So, great question. So when I started film school, I believed that you either were talented or you weren't right. There's just some things you either can sing or you can't do, other can draw, you can't, uh, when it comes to art, which I saw film as art, you were either good or you're not. And so that was how I thought of it and I thought you could get better at the technical side. So I was going to film school to learn the technical aspects, but I was banking on the fact that I was inherently talented.

Speaker 2:          01:01:24       So I go and my first year and a half went very well and I was crushing it certainly by my own estimation, doing very well, getting the attention of my classmates. And then only four people out of the entire school for your year get to make a senior thesis film. And I was chosen as one of the four. So it was like, yeah man, I just, I have it. And there were two filmmakers that were really big for me. One was John Wu. Do you remember John Lewis? Yeah, like the eighties and nineties. Just shoot 'em ups a lot. And I loved him and he was famous for. He would roll up on set. He wouldn't think about it ahead of time. He just put the camera wherever felt right and his movies were mind blowing. People always refer to it. It is. His violence is like a ballet.

Speaker 2:          01:02:09       It's now well orchestrated. That beautiful, that interesting. And so I thought, okay, well if I'm naturally talented than I should be like that. And then there was, hitchcock was sort of the plotter. Um, he would spend all of his time like pre planning, the film. Every shot was so orchestrated ahead of time. He said, I get bored on set. And I thought, God man, like he doesn't sound like natural talent to me. So I'm over here, I want to be John Woo. I show up onset acting like I'm John Woo, I don't preplan anything and put the camera where it feels right and just publicly embarrassed myself as I turn this film into a piece of shit. And at that point I thought I was about to graduate. Get the three picture deal. Everything is going to be sad, it's going to be amazing. And there I am, crash and burn.

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       Now the other students are circling me like vultures because I mean that's the film industry man like it. It is a zero sum game or at least it was back then. That's how people saw because it wasn't like today where you could edit on your fucking. I'm usually editing like right now, like that didn't exist. So it was you had to get access to real resources. So when I realized, Oh my God, I don't have a thesis project to show people to get an agent or whatever, it's done. I'm not a talented filmmaker. And so I was so desperate in that I needed something that would free me from feeling like a permanent failure. And that thing that I had was the notion of Alfred Hitchcock, and even though it wasn't sexy, it gave me a window into maybe there's another way, maybe there is another way that somebody can be an artist and and they just have to learn it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:36       Like think about if somebody draws, right? Some people can rotate an object in their mind. If you've seen on Iq tests, they make it. Yeah, I can't do that. I literally can't rotate an object in my mind. I don't even understand people that can do it. So I thought, well maybe you could become a great artist just by memorizing every conceivable pose, like a chess player. The great chess grand masters are the ones that have memorized so many different moves and combinations that it becomes somewhat intuitive for them. So I thought, okay, that's going to have to be my path that gave me an escape route. And then going down that path of saying, I just have to learn this stuff. I'm not naturally talented, but I have to learn. Unfortunately, Carol Dweck had not written her book mindset at that point, so I didn't have the words, growth mindset, fixed mindset, but I began to transition out.

Speaker 2:          01:04:16       So a fixed mindset is what I had, which you believe your talent and intelligence are fixed traits. They can't be changed. Somebody with a growth mindset, realizing that your talent and intelligence are malleable, that you can develop them through discipline practice. So I began to adopt sort of the beginnings of that mindset, realizing that I'm just a grinder, I have to work and I have to get better. So I start teaching film school, and in teaching film school, the best way to learn something is to teach it. So now I'm getting better as a filmmaker just by teaching it to these guys, helping them develop their scripts, helping them shoot their films. And then, um, at that time, these two very successful entrepreneurs came into my class and there were two things as a kid, I promised myself growing up in a morbidly obese family that one day I would be rich and one day I'd have six pack abs.

Speaker 2:          01:04:59       And so here were these, they were yolked, these two yoked bodybuilder guys that were successful entrepreneurs and they said, why don't you come work for us and be a copywriter and it's a startup company. You can have any role in the company you want, but you just have to become the right person for that job and then you can get rich and you can go back and control the art. You can movies your way. So it's like, oh my God, like this is too good to be true. I have to go do this. So I joined them as a copywriter as they were starting this fledgling technology company and I'm just to keep this from getting impossibly long for about eight and a half years. I just chase money. I'm just trying to get rich to go back and make movies my way. But in that they were very growth minded.

Speaker 2:          01:05:37       I began to really develop a growth mindset to believe that I could do anything I set my mind to without limitation. I just had to understand that there was a gap in skillset between where I was and where I wanted to get and I had to be willing to put in the work to get that skill. Right. So, um, I trained exactly one time with a man. I, you must know him for us. The hobby. Sure. Alright. So for us, by the way, I feel a moral obligation to help him become famous because he is one of the most intriguing minds I've ever come across in my life. Yeah. We were supposed to do a podcast last. There's a UFC in Anaheim, but his fighter got canceled, the flight got canceled and so he won. I'm not coming on. I'm a big fan of though that as a person, heartbreaking as a fighter, a trainer as well as mixed martial artist, very talented guy.

Speaker 2:          01:06:20       Very. And in getting to roll with him in my single moment as a grappler. Uh, it was. Did you ever grab it before? No, never. So you just rolled with him the first time, but he's a black belt. Yeah. But, and that's why it was the best thing ever. So he knew how to not let me get injured. He knew how to move and just the right way, how to show me things. He's so kind and compassionate and patient. I can't imagine a better intro to grappling was unbelievable and what it showed me that even just in like the hour that he and I grappled, I went from, dude, I am so lost. Even spatially I can't tell where I am. Like once you start moving me, I just get lost and then an hour later I could. He gave me like these two basic moves to learn how to execute and by the end I could do it and it was like the exact reminder of what a growth mindset is and how even something that foreign to me with a good teacher practice you can get good.

Speaker 2:          01:07:16       I mean look, it's going to take years and years and years to become even competent in Jujitsu, let alone be able to participate at a high level. But it was a great micro reminder of just how powerfully humans can learn. Now here's my theory about humans and learning and why, and just I guess to wrap up my entrepreneurial journey, so I decide I don't want to chase money anymore. Not going to do that. So I go into my partners. I say, look, I quit. This is about eight and a half. Actually, I quit it about the six year mark. Ended up actually getting out at about eight and half years, so six years I say, I quit, I can't do this anymore. I'm living the cliche of money. Can't buy happiness. This is absolutely ridiculous. I'm so here's your equity back, final, cross the finish line, ash and get anything for this.

Speaker 2:          01:07:55       So you didn't, you weren't obligated to give that money back. You decided to correct. So it's like a movie, but that to me, is is the right thing to do? Yell or do I get shot at the end of this? I don't know. It sounds like so romanticized it. Yeah. So I think everybody should live by a code, right? It's what's right for you. And so I have a code, very strong code that I live by. That was one of the things like I'm the one quitting, like these guys have done nothing but create opportunity for me, so I'm quitting. I'm not going to cross the finish line because I feel literally dead inside. I can't keep doing. This doesn't make sense. I realized the game you're playing is not money. I promise it's not success. It's brain chemistry. So once you understand the game, your playing is brain chemistry and that if you have seven point $4,000,000,000 and hate your life, I want to commit suicide.

Speaker 2:          01:08:40       What the fuck good is the money. And conversely if you have no money but you feel a deep sense of fulfillment, self pride and believe in what you're doing. Like what do you care that you don't have money, better brand chemistry, better brain chemistry. So, so what'd you do? So they said, look, we could do this without you. They were totally caught off guard. They said we could do this without you but we don't want to. So let's talk about what would it look like for us to work together. And so by this point we've got a deep friendship. You know, I'm not like the new kid on the block anymore. Um, and I said, okay, if we're gonna work together, it's got to be something entirely predicated on value, not money. I need to be honest. My highest priority in business is not profitability, it's comradery.

Speaker 2:          01:09:21       So that's why when they said we could do this without you, but we don't want to, that was the thing. Let me reconnect to the Brotherhood that had made it interesting for me in the early days. And so that felt amazing. And so I was like, I'll come back if it's all about value, if we're doing something we're passionate about and if we're asking and answering the question, what would we do everyday and love, even if we were failing, because the struggle is guaranteed to get a bunch of people in a business to agree to that though, isn't it? Uh, what wasn't for me because they were already there. So they were like, it's crazy. We felt the same way for a very long time because we, we, we, and by we, they were so much farther ahead than me at this point. So they really gave me the opportunity to learn, had really built that tech company up like we got, I think evaluation of 22 million if I'm not mistaken at one point and we just couldn't get it passed.

Speaker 2:          01:10:10       And so it was like we'd been struggling for years to move the needle more and we just couldn't. So it wasn't like, oh, I come in and give some amazing Jerry Maguire speech and they're all like, all right, fuck it. US too. It was like finally somebody just said what everybody was already thinking. So they said, all right, let's give us a timeline of six months. If we hit these revenue numbers in six months, we'll keep going, but if we miss them, we'll sell. So we didn't hit them. And so we began the sales process and all in it was about eight and a half years by the time that was finally sold and the thing for three very different reasons that we decided to found that was going to be predicated around delivering value to our employees and our customers. That was going to be that thing that we would love doing everyday, even if we were failing.

Speaker 2:          01:10:48       That allowed me to connect emotionally because um, it ended up being quest nutrition. I grew up in a morbidly obese family and I wanted to save my mom and my sister and it would, it gave me this Mother Teresa has a great quote. She says nobody will act for the many, but people will act for the one. So finally I could just think about two people that I knew and loved and I wanted to do something awesome for them. So when I got tired, when I was fatigued, rather than thinking about money in a big house and a fast, I was asking about fucking saving my mom and my sister. And our idea was if we could make food that people could choose based on taste and it happened to be good for them, we could actually end metabolic disease. So that was the driving force.

Speaker 2:          01:11:24       And we're fucking excited about it. And we didn't know if it would be a real business. We didn't know. Like every time we'd explain it to people, we're putting value first and we thought, God did we sound like total assholes, but it was like we really believed in it, and so it gave us insights into social media, the SPEC in 2009 when nobody was really using it for business and we could see that it's just a megaphone, so if you actually do deliver that kind of value for people, they're going to talk and now they have the ability to talk to a global audience within minutes of an interaction with your company. So if you were really taking care of them, you really delivered a product that was real and you were building community, community, community, then you could really do something and so that's how it took off.

Speaker 2:          01:12:02       But it really did. I used to joke and say quest as a company born out of misery because it was, it was three guys slogging it out. Not really even liking the product that we made. It just served a need in the marketplace. I'm a security software. We didn't care about it. We didn't use it in our own company. So it was like, Oh God, so getting into something we were obsessed with talking about nutrition. Anyway, I've lost 60 pounds and kept it off. Uh, I went through a pencil head phase. I've added muscle, like learning about diet to escape the fate of my family has been so important to me, but that was all back at a technology company. So we were now leveraged and one of my partners a fucking nutritional genius. This dude is unreal. So leveraging what we were doing and thinking about already just was insanely powerful for us as a business opportunity.

Speaker 2:          01:12:47       And we ended up making more in a single day at quest and we made annually at the tech company. So you went from telling me about being a failed movie maker in college to the full journey of quest nutrition. Yeah. I don't know if that's good or bad, but there it is. Yeah. It's um, it's crazy journeyman. That's weird that you um, didn't want to go back to filmmaking though, could you, you've realized you fucked up and why you fucked up. Well, so here we all come full circle. So this is what your new country company is, so new companies about making you want to make films when you want a traditional narrative content. Yeah. So comic books, books, movies, TV shows have used fucked up. Don't you think that it's one of those things that like when you were in film school and when you're trying to come up with a thesis film that this was like a step in a very long journey of figuring out how to make films and that when you left it, you gotTa Kinda, you're going right back to where you were or has life experience giving you more tools to work with and you could sort of apply those to the idea of creative filmmaking.

Speaker 2:          01:13:50       Yeah, exactly that. So what I'm not trying to do is go back and be a director. What I want to do now is build the studio. So I'm becoming an entrepreneur and training myself in that way has created an obsession with scale for me. So the thought of myopically making one movie is absolutely terrifying. Like just the amount of time it would take and your ability to push multiple things forward. Essentially grindstone, you want sort of finance other people's ideas and projects that will be part of it, be a part of it, that'll be part of it. Bringing a team together that can execute at scale and create, um, a, a lot of content and in the beginning we're going to have to partner with people. We just don't have enough finances like we have enough to, you know, build the infrastructure and get the creative together, but we're not going to be financing a 100 plus million dollar film every year, so we'll need to partner with people.

Speaker 2:          01:14:39       But that's essentially what I've spent the last 15 years learning how to do is the business side of things, how to build teams, how to get them pointed in the right direction. How to think through, okay, you've got this grand goal, you want to make a studio bigger than Disney, but like what are the real, like what are the things you can do today to actually take a step towards that? So it was your desire to do things changed. Like your, your desire is not to create a film anymore. Your desires now to create business, to create some sort of a large organization sort of so in, in reality, my real desires. I want to pull people out of the Matrix so that what you said before this, I was trying to work my way back to like, so that's the most sincere thing. So the Matrix to me is a set of limiting beliefs that the vast majority of people have to stop them from achieving what they could achieve in life if they only understood that humans are the ultimate adaptation machine and that we are the only animal you can put into any environment and we will be able to survive and thrive so we can do that.

Speaker 2:          01:15:36       Sort of give me an example where we think, well we don't, we don't survive and thrive and horrifying climates. Like you bring people to an article, they survive. They certainly don't thrive and they got to get out indigenous people, right? So they do and you can. We can go in and build a research facility. So some of the adaptation is there's no indigenous people live in Antarctica. Like what do you mean? In the Arctic circle as well as thinking, I apologize. So, um, there's two kinds of adaptations. So you know, that women that swam the Bering Strait. Okay. So she sleeps with their windows open in a cold climate, I forget where she lived. Um, basically what she's doing by constant cold exposure is changing her adipose tissue to Brown fat. So now it's more thermogenic and she can actually do something that she wasn't able to do.

Speaker 2:          01:16:23       And if you're really gonna let me get crazy. Like looking at what [inaudible] has done with his ability to regulate internal temperature is pretty crazy. And then just what they're discovering with DNA from at one point it was considered to be just junk DNA and now they're realizing that it's actually epigenetic responders essentially. So are there limits gap? Probably, but just as like looking at the way that we only have what, 20,000 genes and an onion has like 40,000 genes. So what is it that makes us more complex if you will give me that. We are complex. Um, and it seems to be the, what they originally thought was junk DNA, which is your genes will turn on or off express themselves in different amounts based on your environment and your diet and even some just like how you're thinking your microbiome, like all that stuff then regulates how your genes were expressed and we have a much wider ability to adapt to climates if you're not going to let me go as extreme, but we have the widest stability.

Speaker 2:          01:17:20       Would you agree with that? Okay. So of all the species we have the widest flexibility. Um, so it's that ability to adapt that I think is, is one of our greatest strengths. I don't remember why I started down my path of adaptation, but the fact that humans can adapt in whatever direction they want. I began adapting myself through mindset and that really showed me how far I was able to come mentally from where I started. So as I saw what a huge impact it had on my life, both emotionally and financially, I'm becoming a, somebody who is entrepreneurial minded, taking extreme ownership for my life. I'm assuming that everything is my fault, that I can always do something, I can change something, I can get a different result, I can learn a new skill, whatever the case may be, but that I can turn myself into what I need to be in order to execute at anything.

Speaker 2:          01:18:12       So that changed me so much. And then I've worked in the inner city so much and seen what happens when somebody really has limiting beliefs and how much that holds them back. Um, so I big brothered for a kid in college, ended up turning into like an eight year relationship. Um, and so I saw him go through a lot and I remember, so he grew up in, in south central and then moved to compton and I remember taking him to see movies and Beverly Hills just because I wanted him to see beauty. Like the way in which his worldview had been constructed was so bizarre and limiting. Um, there's that song by a guy named, I forget his name, but he says they don't want to see you when Kodak, black, Kodak black have no idea who that is. So anyway, it's a song by a guy named Kodak Black and he talks about how they don't want to see you winning and that was his mentality, like nobody wants to see me get out of the ghetto, right?

Speaker 2:          01:19:01       Not My own mother. Nobody. So that was his frame of reference was just, yeah, well it just wasn't meant for me because of where I grew up, encountered those kids. I was telling you about a dad shot to death, sister shot to death, like just crazy life. And their perspective was very, very limited. They had no sense of how they're going to make something come true. So I want to help people develop an empowering mindset. Disney understood something which is why I use them as our foil, which is every piece of content that they make feeds into a brand ethos. So if I say I'm going to go see a Sony movie or a Warner Brothers movie or a paramount movie, you know nothing about it. But if I say I'm going to go see a Disney movie, you already know something. So we have to have the discipline to make sure that everything that we're creating feeds into that and what would that thing you're feeding into be like escaping the matrix.

Speaker 2:          01:19:45       So everything's going to do is going to be motivational and some sort of a way or inflammation. It's got to be firing. It's got to be entertainment first and foremost. But I'll give you examples of movies I wish we had created wholesale. Um, I wish impact theory had made the matrix. It's the perfect movie in my opinion. I wish we'd made star wars. The whole religion of the Jetta is wildly empowering and think, you know, how ridiculous it is to say that you wish you made the two greatest movies of all time. Of course you do. Right? But I'm saying from a guitar, well actually I don't wish we'd made avatar. So, um, honestly I haven't looked at it closely enough to know if it falls into that, but I don't remember it having it. That's more of like a, a nature theme and taking care of the current theme.

Speaker 2:          01:20:23       Whereas I'm looking for empowerment themes. So yeah, empowerment themes in what? Like in terms of fiction, all of it is gone be documentaries, like what are you going to try to do? So mostly as of right now, entirely fiction. Um, and the idea behind that is the way that humans assimilate truly disruptive information is through narrative and if you've read Joseph Campbell's the power of myth, he talks a lot about that and the hero's journey and so wanting to leverage that and it's not an accident that I was so impacted by the power of myth. And then Joseph is the one that worked with George Lucas on creating star wars and making sure that real hardcore mythology is at the core of it. So I just think that's how we build our belief system is how we build our ideology. It's how we pass it on to other people.

Speaker 2:          01:21:11       And I'm a big believer, don't try to change behavior, try to leverage it. So people are already reading books, reading comic books, so on and so forth. It's so weird a motivation to not just make things that are entertaining but the make things that are entertaining that you think are going to be inspiring. But then to use star wars and the Matrix is examples like, do you think those movies really pulled people out of anything or just entertain people because I'd be much more inclined to think the latter. Sure. So here's how I look at it. I'm a filtering mechanism. I can't save everybody and not everybody cares. So some people are going to respond, some are the matrix changed my life in a deep and fundamental way. So I know the Matrix. Yeah. One hundred percent. How so at the time when I had the fixed mindset, I'm literally right out of college.

Speaker 2:          01:21:51       I'm into depths of. I'm not a talented filmmaker. Now what the hell do I do? Um, I went to a comic con, uh, literally across the street from USC and they were handing out tickets to go see the matrix at Warner brothers studios. And a very excited. Took the ticket, went that night, went in. Do you remember the movie? Well? Oh, absolutely. All right. So when a agent Smith Goes, no, officer, your men are already dead. And then they cut to up their trinity jumps, camera, go slow motion and spins around her. The entire audience, myself included, yelled because it was just unlike anything we'd ever seen in a movie. It was such a rad experience. And so that primed me for what ends up being the perfect metaphor for limiting beliefs. And um, you know, Michael Strahan [inaudible]. Alright. So Michael Strahan said the same thing. He was like, the year that he got the award for most sacks in a single season was, was because of the matrix, literally his own words.

Speaker 2:          01:22:50       He came on an impact there. I interviewed him asking that question. He said, without a doubt, that movie is the reason that I got the record because he said, up until that moment I see morpheus and neo training and Morphea says, do you really think that, um, I'm faster than you because of my muscles? You really, this is air. You're breathing. And straight hand realized, Holy Shit, I have a belief that I can only get one sack per game, but why can't I get too? Why can't I get three? And he said because of that he would get a sack and then go, no, I can get another one. And he said, I realized in that moment that once I got a second game I would back off because I just believed that was like the most anyone can do in a game. So it had a similar impact me, it made me realize I needed to figure out what my, what is the Matrix, right?

Speaker 2:          01:23:33       I don't actually think we're in a simulation. So what is the Matrix belief system? What is my version of jacking in reading? What is my Kung Fu business like? Those were all the things that began to sack. It wasn't there while I'm sitting in the movie theater, but those were the things that were in my mind and I just kept thinking about it, thinking about it, thinking about it. And I think in movies, so when I give examples, a lot of times I give examples from movies because they have that impact. Now, the reason that I don't think something like this would work, and the reason that I think so many people have not responded, the way that I responded is nobody is allowing people to take it seriously. So social media I think is going to change that. So nobody's allowing people to take it seriously.

Speaker 2:          01:24:12       Everybody brushes it off. It's just entertainment. So what do you mean by that? So Joseph Campbell and the power of myth talked about. He was asked by Bill Moyer, but Maria said, I've seen it read it. Okay? So when he goes, what do you think happens to a world where people no longer believe in mythology? And Joseph Campbell said, you're living through it right now. And the point being that you have all the mythology in the world, but nobody believes in it anymore. Everybody knows star wars in the real. Everybody knows the matrix isn't real, but people actually used to believe that religion was real. And so you had this mythological tale, whether it was you know, Zeus, or whether it was Cassandra, all the Greek mythology, whether it was Jesus Christ didn't matter. People believed it. They thought it was real and people still do. Correct, but I would say that that's diminishing day over day.

Speaker 2:          01:25:02       Um, it's gotten less. Will you give me that? I'm from, I'm sure ancient times. I mean, I don't know what the current state of atheism, agnosticism and deity worship is. I would imagine it's probably somewhere in the 50 percent range though. I won't even challenge that. I will give you my gut instinct. My Gut instinct is while people are still deeply religious, they don't believe in the literal word as much, but let's, um, let's google like what percentage of people today consider themselves religious versus the past? So if we get anything, if get anything there, we have people still cling to it because it's a, it's comforting and because the uncertainty of existence and the finite nature of our life, it's a, it's very disturbing. That open ended feeling of not knowing when it's gonna happen or what's going to happen and having some sort of a calm and peaceful belief in a, an overlord. Like someone was paying attention to this whole thing. It's got a plan. I'll agree

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       to that. My thesis isn't that people don't believe in something, it's that they don't believe in the literal word as much as well. Yeah. How about this? It didn't help me. So there are some people out there are. The numbers are there. What do we get out of here? Jeremy affiliated an affiliated rose from 2007, 2014 by six point seven percent from 2014 from 2007 to seven years. It rose by six percent identified Christian on affiliated, affiliated. Nothing. Any religion. So there, what? Spiritual Christians went from 78 to 70 time period? Seventy eight percent. Wow. I think it's American population. The American population of Christians is 78 percent to 70 whatever it is. So it dropped eight percent, but still a giant number of people. That's why you have to say you're a believer in God in order to be president. They still maintain that.

Speaker 1:          01:26:58       That's like a, a necessary thing. Like if you are a person running for president that says, I don't know, know, I have no idea. And I'm personally inclined to believe that maybe, uh, maybe there's no god, like people would go fucking crazy. You would never get to be president. We have this fundamental desire, even if there's zero proof in there, absolutely is zero proof, especially when you think about the stories in the Bible and some of the more preposterous ones. Um, there's no proof that any of those ever really took place, isn't it? I mean, it's, there's no proof that. What was the guy that called, called the she bear to kill the children that were mocking him for being bald. There was a no idea. Don't know that story. There was a guy in the Bible that, uh, these kids were giving them a hard time for being bald. So, uh, he, he called upon God to avenge him and God sent a bear to kill the children that were mocking him. Yeah, that's intense. That's what Eliza.

Speaker 1:          01:27:53       Uh, yeah. Alyssa, how say that? Alicia. Alicia. Alicia. Yeah. He went up to Bethel as he walked on the road. Some boys came from the city and mocked him. And, uh, when they mocked him, God sent a bear. And the bear fucking killed the kids. Why? Eh? There's, there's no guessing that didn't happen. Kids. I'm guessing that a Godson, such a piece of shit that he has, sends a bear to kill little children. How about the kids? Just, they were talking shit about this guy being bald. I didn't know it was a bear with sneaking up on them. More likely to know when you're talking about your shit, you make noise. The bears realize, oh, he's a high pitched noises, probably delicious little kids. And then they moved in but still 70 percent men. So it's less people believe, but still that's a giant number. It is. It is a giant number. So yeah, I mean that's a good question. Like how many of them actually believe, you know, and what to what to what extent. Right? And what is it they actually believe.

Speaker 2:          01:29:01       Yeah. So something, uh, my thesis is that something's wrong. Uh, this isn't uh, an anti religion thing for me. I have no beef with religion. If it's making people positive and connecting and doing something great, I'm all for it. I am not a religious person. Um, and so maybe I needed this for me to have something that could give me the ideology that I needed a reading. The power of myth really changed my life. I read it and he talks about in the book how I'm basically one of the things he thinks is going wrong with divorce and the reason that divorce rates are so high is that ritual has really lost its impact and you don't have these demarcation points between childhood and adulthood or between being single and being married. And he was like, you know, back in the day when you were 13, they took you out of the woods.

Speaker 2:          01:29:46       They literally ripped you from the clutches of the women, took you out at with no anesthetic. They would circumcise you and now you know, like you're a man. So because there's none of that, you get arrested adolescence and there's sort of a weakening of the, um, the, the import of the religious ceremony as far as divorce goes. And so people aren't taking that seriously. So. And he talks about ritualistic scarf, vacation and how many, you knew something had changed. When people put your body through some kind of transformation. So when I got married, I went through a ritualistic scarification to remind myself that I was a different man the day before. What kind of a ritualistic scarification did you go through a tattoo? A grandiose way. But here, how dare you call it? Scarf. Vacation. That's how I saw it. So I don't, I don't do tattoos.

Speaker 2:          01:30:35       You'll see nothing. I have one tattoo which I did specifically for my wedding. I've never gotten another one. Um, and at the time this isn't the case anymore, but at the time one of my biggest sort of realistic fears was needles. So it was me saying to my wife, I'm going to go scar my body. I'm using needles, which freak me the fuck out to remind myself, hey, I want it to be painful and then be. I want it to be permanent. And I'm glad that it's something that I have this active fear of. So in doing all of that, it really did make the whole wedding just a bigger deal to me. And so that's really interesting. But I think when we're talking about Joseph Campbell and the, the issues that I think are very real about people not experiencing like a grand event or at least some sort of a ritual that gets them to adulthood.

Speaker 2:          01:31:24       Um, I think there's, this is a significant issue that we have with just things being far too easy and that there's no real difficult path where the warrior has to find themselves in, you know, in myth or in, in a person's actual life that they have to overcome some very difficult thing. Now for you, I'm sure some of those, I mean we all have difficulties in life, but some of the difficulties that you experienced when you were in film school was like this creation of this thing, you know, but once you try to create this thing and it didn't work out, right, do you, don't you have this desire to

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       go back and try to figure it out, right? Like, don't you have to design like, okay, like I see where I fuck this up. I try to be like John Wu instead of trying to be like Alfred Hitchcock and I see that there's like a way you could be systematic. You're obviously a systematic thinker like you're talking about, you're, you're an organizer, you have all these quotes in your mind and you have all these systems that you follow, including, like following, like some of Gary vee social media stuff, right. It's like your assistant. You fall like these are ways to engage in success. Right? So

Speaker 2:          01:32:29       I would feel like that would haunt you a little bit. It's interesting. It doesn't. So since then I have done, I have done a low budget feature film. Oh, okay. Um, I wrote a screenplay that was turned into a feature film that was a horrifying experience. Why was that? Just because it didn't turn out the way that I wanted it to. It wasn't executed as written. I mean, look, this is the age fighters complaint, so, um, but I've, I have changed as a person over time to where I'm just now way more interested in scale. So I still have that love for cinema. I love storytelling. I think story is a, it is a way that we assimilate information like that is when I think about the things that have painted a vision for me of what is a man came way more for movies and say my own father, so and that that is not to downplay like having a relationship with somebody that you're in proximity with is, is ultimately I think it'd be the most powerful thing.

Speaker 2:          01:33:29       It's just not scalable. So looking at how impactful media has been for me and for a lot of people and this whole notion of self signaling because at the end of the day, the way that I see the company is we're a merchandise company, so you create the intellectual property. I mean this is a out of Disney's playbook. You create the intellectual property in order to create the merchandise and this and merchandise that drives a lot of the revenue. Not all of it, but it drives a lot of the revenue and in having that, you also create this thing called self signaling. So as I dress a certain way to tell you something, which is how it starts, it also tells me even more loudly than you. So as I like, I have a Batman shirt and I have a superman shirt and when I wear those shirts, it reminds me of my tie to that ethos, right?

Speaker 2:          01:34:17       So Batman is. You don't have any superpowers, motherfucker. You just have to work really, really hard and you've got to be prepared to tap into the dark side to keep pushing hard enough to avenge what you believe is your failing. So Superman, it's a perfect analogy for passion, right? He's a normal guy except when he's in the Yellow Sun. And that gave me a way to think about getting in line with my passion. I remember I was obsessed with that. When I decided to go in and quit, I was like, I'm like Superman and I am out of the Yellow Sun because I'm not passionate about anything. And the only time that I can do things that make me feel that, that are extraordinary or when I'm really passionate, the Matrix obviously is like the core metaphor for my entire existence. So what is such a crazy thing to.

Speaker 2:          01:34:57       Yeah. So weird thing. The Matrix is the wow, the core metaphor, right guys? It's a metaphor, but it's, it's a core metaphor. And not to be Joseph Campbell at that didn't expect him to come out of my mouth as many times in this interview, but he said if you want to change the world, you have to change the metaphor. So. And people have talked a lot about that with the, how the world changed in the metaphor of the steam engine to the metaphor of the computer. Uh, and that just, it changed the way that you thought about workers that changed what you thought about intelligence and just changed a lot of things just by shifting from one metaphor to the next. Um, so dealing in the realm of metaphor, giving people access points to different things through storytelling, which obviously is riding on the back of metaphor I think is an incredible access point, but more importantly, it's something people already do.

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       So you're leveraging behavior that's already there and that was like a necessary part. The same thing with quest, right? Don't ask people to eat less and exercise more. We've been telling them that for 60 years, whatever it works for a narrow band of the population, but it doesn't work for everybody. So finding something that people are already doing, people are already watching movies, TV shows, playing video games, reading books, comic books are already doing it. They're billions and billions of dollar industries. Um, so being able to tap into that leverage social media now. So this is where we first got onto this part where I was saying, you're in a position where most people don't take it seriously. They don't try to extract the life lessons. They're not Michael Strahan, they don't see a movie one time, but just didn't show it. They just go to see a film to be entertained.

Speaker 2:          01:36:28       This is a fascinating approach though, to to create films, to change the way human beings think about life, but now keep in mind if we don't entertain first and foremost, we've got nothing so people need to be able to watch the movies and have no idea that there's a message. Disney is a perfect example of that. Disney is trying to tell you that, right? Should always win bad. They make movies for children. Sure. I mean it's, it's a different thing like organizing something like that. A grand scale to make films for humans that you think can pull them out of the matrix through. Do you think this works for kids, but only kids. I don't think kids are a little bit more pliable and they don't have enough information. Sometimes you can show them, show them some things through, you know, cartoons and things along those lines.

Speaker 2:          01:37:10       Set in with them a little bit easier and better. I mean, it's absolutely possible to send a message through a film that really radiates with people, resonates with people because I have a deep and abiding fear that this is only going to work with kids. Really? Yeah. I don't know that that's true, but there's a guide, you know, Jeffrey Canada, no, super cool dude, um, grows up in Harlem and realizes, do the school system is fucked. Like everyone is just given up on all of us here in Harlem, but he's super bright. Ends up going to Harvard and says, I'm going to become a doctor. I'm going to go back and change the education system and does that. Goes back and spends, I don't know how many years in the education system and just realizes, yeah, this never gonna work. You can't change it from the inside. There are so many.

Speaker 2:          01:37:50       Politics is so much entrenched. Bullshit like this is going nowhere. So he leaves and decides that he's going to give up on adults and he's going to start with kids. In fact, not even that he's going to try to find women who are about to become pregnant and all he wants to do is because he looked at what makes a middle class kid successful versus an inner city kid who goes on to not be successful. What's the difference? And what he found was it's the number of words that a child hears before the age of five, I think it is, and the ratio of positive to negative. He said, your average kid in the middle class, here's $5 million words for the time that he's five 70 percent of positive, 30 percent of negative. Whereas in the inner city kid, here's like two or 3 million by the time that they are five and the the ratio is reversed.

Speaker 2:          01:38:34       So it's 30 percent positive, 70 percent negative. So we said that's, I'm just going to make my life's mission solving that problem. So that's an issue. That's a gigantic issue. Massive. And he said what happens is the language centers in the brain just don't develop properly and because of that they struggle later in life trying to get a job because they can't communicate as well. Um, so he felt like he had just put his finger on sort of that baseline. But the reason I bring Geoffrey Canada up is because he gave up on adults. So as I'm thinking through this, look, we haven't executed on this. Nobody should be taking me seriously right now. I know that. So I've got like this and I'm like, everybody told us we were crazy when we said we're launching a protein bar. People like, motherfucker, you stupid. 1,600 protein bars in 2009. It is the most crowded space ever. One guy actually told us I need another protein bar. Like I needed another hole in the head. And then five years later we're inc 502nd fastest growing company in North America grew by 57,000 percent. How? Because we believed that it could be done right. So I get it. People think you made a good product also for enjoying it. And that's what they wanted and that's

Speaker 1:          01:39:32       Kinda the same thing with making films, like you have to make a good product that people are going to enjoy, but it's a fascinating thing that you're coming to it saying that you want to change people and take them out of the Matrix because you're also saying that your, your like a memorabilia company or a merchandise merchandise company. I mean, that's kind of the same thing, right? It's like you're, you're, you're talking like objects that go along with your films. And that's a big part of what. So you're planning all this out from a financial standpoint, right? But what about a creative standpoint? Like continue to be able to put together all these ideas, like to say, oh, I want to make the new matrix. Oh, I want to make the new star wars and I want to change the world on a drag people out of this mundane reality they live in and show them the power of myth,

Speaker 2:          01:40:14       right? Yeah. More. I want to show them the power of belief. I don't think they're ever going to see the power of myth. Why would they see it? If you could see it? Maybe they will. I don't know, just not a focus for me. I just want them to take the usable mindset and apply it and I think that we live in an interesting time now where social media can comment on the things and say, here's what's extractable from

Speaker 1:          01:40:34       so will you try to adjust films accordingly? If someone comes to you with an idea and a script and they want this project to be created, you try to adjust it accordingly and to try to have the highest amount of impact and like how you going

Speaker 2:          01:40:45       do that? Yeah. So hopefully it will be a beacon to people that really understand the mindset. So we laid out a three phase to building the studio on the website literally from day one and phase one is build the community. So we're building a community around ideology. People that come and listen. In fact, this is how you and I connected. So one of my, um, one of the people that follows my show wrote to you and said, Joe, you really got to get this guy in your show. And sent you a clip and you said, hey, this is actually pretty interesting. You should come on. Um, so that's all around ideology, right? So I've spent the last 20 plus years of my life constructing my mindset to allow me to be successful and because I've had a certain level of success, people take me seriously.

Speaker 2:          01:41:25       So now what I'm trying to do is just find the most efficacious way to actually get that ideology in people's hands. And I know if I can incept them in entertainment, I've got a shot. But if I can't entertain them first, I've got nothing. So if we don't have any way to sneak it in, if we don't have good movies, like, I mean, I think this is where you were going to. The movies aren't just good in and of themselves. Like we're fucked. We've got nothing. So we have to get really good at making really good movies that people want to see for their own sake. So that. And that's a Herculean task. No question. And we're going to have to assemble an amazing creative team that really understands that a very deep level, the ideology of the company,

Speaker 1:          01:42:06       well in and of itself, making entertaining films, like having a company that makes entertaining films with difficult, brutal make entertaining films that have this sort of life changing

Speaker 2:          01:42:14       message don't envy you. That sounds like a long task. But as like, hey look, it can be done if Disney did it. And arguably they certainly did with kids,

Speaker 1:          01:42:26       you know, I mean they've, they've made some really powerful movies with some really good messages.

Speaker 2:          01:42:31       No question, no question. And look, it's going to be a bumpy road. I know that there's going to be sick. Well the guaranteed failure and hopefully success, but it's something that I believe in enough to fight for it. So when you talk about, you know, um, don't you want to go back and sort of make good on the filmmaking promise?

Speaker 1:          01:42:49       No, not, not, not know what it meant. What I meant was not, there's no promise I just went, does it something that you think like, hmm, maybe I could have adjusted. Maybe I could have done this, if it could have built on my skill set, maybe I could have continued making films and tried different approaches and I feel like, you know, if you had a real passion for and it was something that you were so interested in, you said you were killing it early on in your film career or in your film school career, like a wonder why you didn't continue to try to readjust and try to try to come back as another. Otherwise

Speaker 2:          01:43:19       that as well. I think everyone, myself included thought, you know, when we had this success equest and now I can do whatever I wanted, that I would just immediately start writing and directing and it just didn't feel it wasn't what I wanted to do it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43:32       Well that's an important message in and of itself because I tell people, you know, like, look, follow your heart's content and don't be trapped in your earliest ideas. If you have an idea early on that you know, I'm going to become this and then somewhere along the line you discover this new interest that kind of supersedes the other one and surpasses it. Follow that one. No, you don't. You don't have. You don't have to. Oh, I thought you were a filmmaker. I was a little. Well, you know, like he can do whatever the fuck you want. I mean you could find a million different pathways and a million different avenues, but ultimately what's going to resonate the most with people, something that you're actually passionate about and really feel it really feel not faking it. Not trying to establish some sort of a narrative that you think is going to be successful with people resonate with people, but what do you actually feel and if you could figure that out, man.

Speaker 1:          01:44:19       No, that's a. That seems to be like the great pieces of art. The great works that people have created that the opportunities that I've gotten a chance to talk to people that have done some pretty amazing shit. It's all they. It was all like an interest. It was all a thought that they had that they followed through all the way and then got immersed in it, you know, but it was never thinking about it in terms of the ultimate eventual result, you know? That's why I think it's interesting that you're approaching this and you don't just have an idea to make something creative and, and fascinating and fulfilling to enjoy, but you also want to establish some sort of a narrative that changes the way people look at the reality around them.

Speaker 2:          01:45:02       Yeah, definitely. And when I, when I think about what I'm really driven by, and this was almost a confession to my team was I don't care about. I love movies and I love the path that we're on right now, but I don't love it enough to risk my fortune and to work as hard as I'm working. That just never would have drawn me back. So what I do care enough about to put everything at risk and to work as hard as I'm working is pulling people out of the Matrix and I know those are my words that maybe don't get people to see what I mean. So the kid that I big brothered for her, just to give you an idea. So his name is rashawn an amazing kid. He was very disruptive in class. He was drug and alcohol impacted but still really bright, but they had them on like Ritalin or something.

Speaker 2:          01:45:48       I honestly don't know what, but it's done to this gross groceries. Really small, hyper aggressive. He was adopted and his mother was abusing him, but I didn't know that and very sad. It was just too young and I just, I didn't know what was going on. Even though looking back you suddenly realized, Holy Hell, there was so many clues. Um, but I didn't pick up on them and he just living a life that is, um, is horrible and growing up in the inner cities as well on top of all that. And so I come and of course he's the student they give me and all I'm supposed to do is for eight weeks I'm just supposed to come in and help him do his homework. And so he's very clever. So I would show up and for an hour he would ignore me. He would get in fights, he would push me away and then like five minutes for, I'd have to leave.

Speaker 2:          01:46:34       I'd say I have to leave and he would start crying and freaking out, please. No, just say help me with my homework. And so finally I'd be like, all right, I'm going to help you, but if you don't right now get to work. I'm leaving. And so then he would be an angel and do his homework. And then week two was exactly same and three and four and five, I thought this fucking kid is playing me. Like he's like trolling me in real life. And at week six they tell you, hey, warn them that you're only coming two more weeks so that they're not surprised. Cool. Week six, I tell them, hey, just so you know, I'm only coming two more times and he goes, nuclear freaks the fuck out. Like it was so shocking. Like I didn't have experience with kids. So he's flipping out and this was already a kid with behavioral problems.

Speaker 2:          01:47:14       So I was just like, the fuck is going on. And finally, slowly, all too slowly I realized, okay, wait, is this because I just told you I'm leaving? And he's like, yes. And I said, look, largely just to calm him down as long as I live in Los Angeles, I will help you do your homework, but you have to do it the second I get here, deal. And he said deal. So that turns into an eight year relationship where it became way more than helping him with his homework. I started taking him to movies and trying to show them just a different side of life. And um, took him on the saint called Troy camp. So we got to see the mountains for the first time and just all like really, really getting involved in his life. And then when his, it finally came out that his stepmother or his adoptive mother was beating him from what I heard, she was chasing him down the street with a baseball bat and I just like, I literally couldn't believe that was real.

Speaker 2:          01:48:09       And so they took them away immediately and I was the first phone call and his lawyer called me and said he has asked that you be the ward of the court or the Guardian to help them through the court system. And so I helped them do that and help them get into foster care. And, and I'm just looking at him going, I know where this ends up, like I know where this ends up and it isn't good. And so that was the seed, right? I didn't think that I'm going to dedicate my life to helping people like this wasn't that, but it planted a seed and it really fucked with me. And I stayed involved with him in foster care for a couple of years. But then they just moved them so far away that it was. I was broke at the time. It just was too far away.

Speaker 2:          01:48:48       So. But that stayed with me and then when I started, um, at quest and we were helping all these kids are working with all these kids and I saw how extraordinary they weren't, which by the way drug dealers, some of them are amazing entrepreneurs. And so it became this notion of my, it's unreal, dude. I'll tell you some stories sometimes. Sure. Absolutely fucking crazy. And I thought, Jesus, you're a better entrepreneur than I am. Like they're telling me how they watch like the cop cars and when they change shifts and how they know that they're being identified by their cars. And so they changed cars all the time as crazy. And so I'm like, Jesus, it gave me this concept that I called mining for astronauts and I'm like in here, in here, somewhere in here being the ghetto are some of the most amazing minds I've ever come across.

Speaker 2:          01:49:34       And these guys could be anything. It can be fucking astronauts, right? Like whatever they wanted, but they don't believe they can. And when I would interview them it was nuts. So imagine you're interviewing. And I came up with just like a fast weighted where I didn't have to think I could ask the same questions and one of the questions was a magic genie shows up. It's going to grant you one wish and one which only you can't wish for. More wishes. You can't cure cancer. Bring anybody from back in the desk. I'd be something for yourself. What do you wish for universally to a person? They all said a job. Okay, that makes sense. You think that's what I want to hear. So you're trying to get a job so you can tell him you want a job. Then when we get past that bullshit, and I tell you, obviously that's not true.

Speaker 2:          01:50:08       Like what do you really want? Like what's the job? And to get you money. Okay. Do you want money or is it something else? No, it's money. Awesome man. It's a magic genie can ask for whatever you want. What do you want? You know what answer? Every single one of them gave me $1,000,000. You can buy a fucking house for a million dollars. K, it was so crazy. It's a magic genie, Joe, like you can ask for a trillion dollars, but their frame of reference is so small. One guy, this was like the one exception said he wanted an airport. I found that so weird, so I had to push on that one. I was like, why an airport? He said, because business guys come through the airport, and I was like, okay, what good does that do you? And he said, because then they can teach me about business.

Speaker 2:          01:50:49       Nothing about that for a second. How fucking many steps removed are you from what you actually want? But that's like they. They don't have you say, I'm a systematic thinker, right? So I had to learn that. That's not where I started. So I spent thankfully one of the things I'm most grateful for in my life. I have to learn everything the hard way, but because I learned things the hard way, then I can show other people what I did, where I fell down and how hopefully they can avoid some of the mistakes. Now, most people ignore me. I'm all aware of that, but their desire to teach people that this is what's interesting. You're not just internalizing this, this is not just yourself. Correct. And I, look, I'm wired for compassion. I really enjoy other people succeeding. Um, the, my favorite example of that is when I was five, so my sister would have been eight and a half.

Speaker 2:          01:51:35       I pretended not to see some Easter eggs so that she would win the Easter egg hunt because she cared about winning and I didn't. So that's just a natural inclination that I have, that I've fed into that I've chosen to take pride in. Um, and because of that, and look, it would be a way cooler story if I said I met this kid rashawn and it changed my life forever and I knew I had to dedicate myself to helping people. It didn't. I met Rashawn and then spent almost a decade chasing money. Right? That's the truth. So, but in that process, like that way that I felt in those moments where I had hoped that he would do something when I met the kids, that we're working on the production line. And I could see, fuck I am. One of them literally came to me is absolutely hysterical.

Speaker 2:          01:52:14       He's in tears and he, um, he was like, you're like my fa and stopped himself and I thought obviously he was about to say you like my father, but that felt weird for him. So he stopped and said, do you like my older brother? And he was like, I've just never had anybody that actually cared about me. So now mix that with the fact that I'm only interested in scale and maybe I would be. Does that mean doing touching 10 people and like having 10 people show up at my funeral and just be like, this motherfucker changed my life. And because of him like my 18 and all that, like they're going to have a better life. That just doesn't do it for me. And I'm being honest. Maybe maybe I am a worse person because of this. I honestly don't care. It's just true to who I am.

Speaker 2:          01:52:53       So scale is interesting. Having. I would much rather touch a million people and none of them know who I am and know that a million people's lives are better off than touched 10 and they credited. Ultimately, it's just way more interesting to me at scale. Now. I also believe that a five o one c, three nonprofit is like the worst way in the world to do something. If you're trying to do good, finding a way to do it through commerce where it's a self sustaining economic engine. That's interesting because the thing that like this is so weird to me. If you have a nonprofit, you have to go beg, literally beg money from people that have a for profit company that have figured out how to make money. They probably have a little bit of guilt so they want to give money to you. It is the weirdest dynamic ever.

Speaker 2:          01:53:36       Rather than just building a company that at its core is trying to do something good and awesome that you can be proud of. I'm fucking pr. If I crash and burn, I'll still be proud of what I was trying to accomplish. I believe in. It makes me feel good to want to do amazing shit for people. I actually believe that this is the way that you give somebody a belief system that is antagonistic to acquiring a new belief system because to do it at scale, they can't want it. Right? The people, the people that want to change their physique, do they eat right? They exercise and they get results and the people that don't and there are people that I love very much in my life and I'm going to lose them too early because they don't want to eat better. So the only solution I could think of was there was no option.

Speaker 2:          01:54:19       Everything is healthy and delicious, so all the things that you want to eat, you can. And so that was the mission at certainly while I was there. That was the mission of quest. We're going to find one of those. It was like 26 categories that we thought got people into trouble and we're going to make a healthy version of each and every one of those motherfuckers, and that was the mission so that there would literally be nowhere for people to go to eat badly because they could just pursue their most base instincts of just gluttonous, give me carbs, sugar, salt, I want to all fat and that they'd be eating a healthy version, but it felt and tasted just like that. So our first marketing message was stop compromising. So it. That's a long way of saying it's all about leveraging people's behavior against them to get them to make the right changes. And I believe that the way that we're going to do this, we live in a unique time where I can go and fucking microphones like this and I can explain to people how to build a mindset. I do this literally. I put out probably six or seven hours worth of content every fucking week. Well, I'm just telling me, yeah, 100 percent. Really the day you're ready to come on my show. Be Raw, which people have been begging for for ever. What's your show impact theory.

Speaker 2:          01:55:26       What does that. So impact theory is me bringing on people like you that have had just unbelievable success and finding out what are the things that you did to get there. So my interview style is, I'll know more about you than your own mother. You'll show up, you'll get a little unnerved because how the fuck did I figure all this stuff out? But then we can have a really cool interview because where ever you want to go, I'm going to be able to go. I'm not a journalist. I want you to shine. Even if you have literally inspired me. By the way I told you a little bit about why when we first started talking. Um, I, you're the only person that makes me sweat from diversity cakes. I fucked. That's like my thing is an interviewer, dude. Like I can go, I can interview anybody.

Speaker 2:          01:56:02       Doesn't matter. But then I saw your fucking show and I realized I can't interview a porn star. Um, I probably would suck with Hannibal buress. Somebody who's just fucking funny. It needs somebody to go back and forth with and I realized, but fucking Joe can do dominic d'agostino like on one day and then immediately turn around and do like porn joke anyway, so would love to bring on people like you come on because what it all started back at quest, I have this 25 point bullet belief system that I wanted everyone in the company to understand. I used to be an employee. I had an employee's mentality and here are the 25 things I had to do to my mind to become an entrepreneur and generate wealth in my life and feel like I was in control of my life. Nobody else control my destiny, but me, here are the 25 things. I had this unending fear that people are going to memorize the fucking bullet points and they wouldn't live them. So I wanted to create a show where they. Because it's hardest to impact those closest to you don't know if you've experienced that. I certainly have. So would say so. Yeah. So those that are closest to you, why is it hardest?

Speaker 2:          01:57:10       I think it's because there's too much familiarity. My mom looks impact. Do you mean in a way like inspired them? Yeah, right. But not even through your own success. You don't think that it inspires me. Like my mom is finally starting to say things like, tell me a little bit more about whatever, but uh, for a little bit. But is that impacting her? She just curious? Not yet. She's asking it in the way that like, Hey, I'm actually interested in making that change, but I'll just speak for myself in my life for whatever inadequacy that I have. It's been very hard for me to impact those closest to me. So what I wanted to do at quest was bringing in people that were wildly successful and I want unprompted. I wanted the audience to see. You're going to hear them say the same thing as I say, even though we don't know each other and time after time after time they heard people going through.

Speaker 2:          01:58:02       These people have never seen the 25 bullet points, but they would go through like, I mean maybe it was like six or seven of them. It's not going to be exactly the same, but they would touch on so many. It was fucking freaky and so that really started to play into, okay, we're now moving into a different era where you can step forward and I think transparency and authenticity are a big fucking deal in, in companies today. I think that Gen z is going to demand it and I think any company that hides Gen, Gen z, Gen z, a z generation Z. Yeah. Have you not heard that? No Man. Welcome. You're going to hear it everywhere now. So is that the new lending that the kids are saying? New Kids coming up? Generation z? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:58:43       Oh, if you type in Gen z, you get like a bazillion sure results. So Gen z ears are known for like they, they say that they're the altruistic generation so these people are not comfortable with big business and I think that they're going to demand a level of transparency into the people that are running the company and the people that get that. Elan Musk, Richard Branson, people that aren't afraid to like really step out front. Then people just resonate with that. And so that is why I do all this. That's why I'm stepping out front. That's why I want people to know who I am and what I'm doing. I need to build a community if we're going to pull off this mission impossible, uh, building the studio, that's all gotta happen. So, um, that's why I create all this content. That's why I bring people on that have inspired me and my goal is just to set them up.

Speaker 2:          01:59:30       So I want everyone to walk away from my show going like off camera, behind the scenes. Like that was the best interview I've ever done. So, um, yeah, that's, that's like my mission. I just want people to see it from all these different angles here. All these different people say it. And quite frankly selfishly, I want to learn. And so one, the biggest, the thing that probably impacted my life the most was when I stopped building my ego around being smart and I started building my ego around being a learner and being super humble and sitting at people's feet and just wanting to listen and learn. And then immediately put what I learned into action. So the show is also wildly selfish for me and the staff because we get to meet incredible people that have just super empowering wisdom. And so I believe that the dual track of the social content was just on the nose, right?

Speaker 2:          02:00:17       You would come on the show and you would just tell us like how you did it. You would talk about like how you got into stand up comedy. I got into stand up comedy because I was a fucking funny guy when everybody else was nervous. Right? But then like it actually has to become a craft and you got to do it over and over and over and talking about that grind and how you get good over time and people are going to trip the fuck out and just like go, whoa, maybe that's exactly what I need to do. Which is a message I think a lot of people need right now, which is, it's a long grind. So it's stuff like that. But that's impacted.

Speaker 1:          02:00:43       Tom. I gotta wrap this up, but thank you very much man. I appreciate it. And good luck. It's a very ambitious project and uh, I'm certainly going to be watching. Awesome, man. Thanks for me for stars quest. I really love your bars. You guys are awesome. Thank you. All right folks. See you. See you on Friday.

Speaker 4:          02:00:58       Bye.
