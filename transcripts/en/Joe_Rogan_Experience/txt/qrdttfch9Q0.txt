Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Three, two, one, yes. It feels like you would just hear what people don't know. Most people don't know because it hasn't come out yet. No one would. How would they? We've bid a podcast late last night and it got completely out of hand so that I don't even know what to do with that thing now. What's that thing out like a gentleman? I mean, I'm certainly putting it out on pretending, putting out. So long story short for listeners, uh, Joe was kind enough to. I was interviewing Sam Harris for my podcast and Sam was like, we really should just do more than just a one on one because ordinarily my podcast is about as a panel of people, a bunch of people sitting around talking about the news and so I texted Joe and I was like, is there any chance of doing it at your studio? And being the gentleman that he is, he was like, sure, just come on by and we'll just type it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       Even though he had two shows yesterday. So after those shows, late at night, Sam Harris comes over and Hannibal buress is still here. It was about to call an uber and I said, why don't you stick around? Yeah, hang on. We were drunk based the way we drink, so much whiskey, best decision you ever made, inviting him to stay, so Hannibal buress and Sam Harris and Joe Rogan and I have an interesting episode of my podcast which will come up, so if you're listening to this now or watching this now subscribed to way the people live. Just switch for whether people space life you need the live and then when it drops you will. You will see it. It was an dining epic. Our long argument between Hannibal Burress, a drunk Hannibal burress and Sam Harris regarding statistics. We'll just leave it at that. Yeah. You don't want to give him more statistics that may or may not involve black lives matter.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       I'm shooting police shootings and just the reality of police violence versus the perceived reality of police violence. So arguing about the statistics rather than the emotional connection and the difference and what was interesting is how we have conversations about things that are so touchy. Right. I've been, part of the reason why I want to talk to Sam and you on my podcast is because I think it's important for us to find ways to have the sorts of conversations that you have in that Sam has and hopefully I have where there's not a lot of kind of opinionated bloviating. It's more about actually trying to understand each other, but actually trying to take each other at face value, not sticking, you know, a what a sword in the sand and saying like, I can't believe that you offended me or you know, having tripwires that if someone transgresses that'll says a certain thing, then all of a sudden you're going to crank up the outrage machine. So much of that, so much of that. So I wanted to talk to Sam and you about what, how do we have conversations that are the more reasonable, but of course you don't necessarily have a conversation that's that reasonable when you're drunk and emotionally sensitive. Drunk. Hannibal burress says that he's smarter than Sam Harris and smarter than I think anyone. Didn't he say anyone? Uh, he definitely said he was smarter than Sam Harris. Hannibal's a smart guy, he must be successful and he's a compelling

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       and good comic. Just not smart enough to know that he shouldn't say smart Sam Harris. It was drunk, really drunk and we kept drinking to view. Hit it. Well, you hold your liquor. Well, I bounced back quick. I'm healthy. So I stopped drinking. Also. Loyalty. So what you're implying exactly what I said. You heard me and uh, about an hour before the end of our pod, you have me in Hannibal, I realized I was drunk, so I backed off. Right. And he going, he was preparing himself out like half a half a wine glass of whiskey. Yup, Yup. Yeah, it was deep. We went deep. So, uh, he can't be held responsible folks. Everyone was helping, right? Because if you drive drunk and kill somebody, then you're not held responsible for that. Um, if you're a woman, you can have sex with someone. You're not responsible though the man's responsible. That's right, that's true.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       So it was more of a woman having sex with a drunk driver hitting that high bar, more of a woman. And I bet I'll tell him you said that he was a guest in my studio. So, uh, I'm responsible. He didn't, he could not consent conversation you with the chaperone. He was too drunk to consent. I was the rapist raped him with our conversation by forcing him into this conversation that I didn't know he was going to get into. Right. You sort of annually fisted him with Woodward. Now you go into a little of my own taste you said. Right. What about this whole, right? Have you been, have you been talking with thinking about the whole, like Amy Schumer cut and myths good. You know, and like, and I saw what he said and you know, I had someone else contact me about that guy and whether or not, you know, he was telling the truth or the woman was telling the truth.

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       I don't know him. I don't know her and I'm not getting involved because I don't know if I knew her and I could implicitly trust her. And I knew that she was going to tell the truth and it's not, it's not, uh, I, I just don't understand the motivation behind someone jumping in with an opinion. I think what he's saying though is interesting because what Kurt was saying was that it is entirely possible he was satire, obviously. But you're saying women cannot lie there. Like my Bible. It's impossible for a woman to lodge, just like the Lord's word. That's it. You know, he's being funny. He's hilarious. Shitster. Yeah, he's hilarious. But, um, it's a, it's weird, you know, like that there's this culture, what we know for a fact that some people lie about every single aspect of life. They lie about what they did.

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       They lie about their taxes, they lie about everything. But we're supposed to assume that women never lie about rape. And it's not true. We know it's not true, but we're not allowed to say it's not true. Even though we know it, we're not allowed to bring it up. But. So if there's a possibility, if a woman says that she's raped, you have to accept that 100 percent at face value. Even if the man is saying he didn't rape her, it's really hard because that's one side of the ledger and um, and then on the other side of the ledger, you've got all of the overwhelming number of cases where men get away with it. Yes. Because women are too afraid

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       to go to the police or they feel like they feel like they're dirty or that somehow for whatever reason, just not talk about it and let it go away. So I think that I think that women's rights people and feminists think like if, if it's occasionally the case that a man is wrongly accused, that's a small price to pay for fostering a climate in which women feel more, feel less nervous about coming forward. Now I'm not saying that I believe that, but wow, what a shitstorm Kurt has. So I'm not sure if everyone knows the background of this, that there was a. One of the comics that UCB theater in New York was accused of being a repeat sexual offender by a bunch of women. So say suspended him as a comic and excuse me, and conducted its own internal investigation. And Kurt went on a big facebook rants.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       I was looking at it this morning actually saying, I'm basically like, why is this internal? You know, what is this like the Catholic church, the UCB theater, like doing the internal investigation. Why didn't these women go to go to the police? He writes a. This is his original facebook post. Guys. I've just heard some disturbing news. This Guy Jeff Delfi Berg is a rapist. I know because women said it, and that's all I need. Never you mind who they are. They're all women. All women are as reliable as my Bible. A book that much like a woman is incapable of lying. So what you were saying, you think I would dare ask my God, Lord Jesus Christ. Then Nazareen to provide any details or evidence of any kind before I believe in him or a woman. No, because that would be like hammering the nails into Jesus my Lord's feet or rewriting the victims.

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       Good whole asking for proof in a murder trial and he goes on like that. I made. It's really funny. If that guy's innocent, if that guy's guilty, then it becomes really disturbing. Kind of become a name and an enabler. Problem is. There's no way Kurt can know exactly exactly, but I do. I think it raises interesting questions about the whole kind of the, the censorious and like the hysteria of the Social Justice Warrior Brigade in that there are people who really fucking want him to get fired and never, you know, if amy's show comes back, they don't want him back. As a writer, I'm sure that there are a comedy clubs, so they're going to rethink whether or not they want to book him because he might be too toxic and I doubt that. Maybe, maybe not. It's not that big of a deal because what he said was not that big of a deal, but the issue and everyone went crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:08:22       She went crazy. She posted the amy did. She posted this thing, you know, saying that she's very disappointed and that was in response to an endless barrage of social justice people in feminist saying that this is completely unacceptable and he deserves to be fired for it. He has a job. He showed some pretty incredible loyalty to her during that whole plagiarism scandal, especially when he was one of the ones who told her to not do one of those jokes because it was a windy liebman joke, so he kept his mud about all that and then she turned on him with this whole thing. The whole thing is very sorted

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       and I see. I see her point of view and I see his point of view. I really do. I think she didn't. I think she felt she didn't have an option, but because she did say I could see my friend and knowing him, I'm disappointed in him. Yeah, it's toxic. I mean there's no way that you can talk about. You can't raise the question that you just raised. Unless you're on the Joe Rogan experience. You cannot raise the question of whether or not it's appropriate, whether they should be in a presumption of innocence. That's why podcasts are so God damn important as you could never do this on a regular show. Certainly couldn't do the shit we went on last night on a regular show off the air.

Speaker 4:          00:09:28       Yeah. Wait till it comes out, Woo. Um, you know, here's the PR again. Here's the problem. If that guy is innocent, then Kurt is doing a service because he is expressing this very real possibility that someone might be lying. If that guy's guilty, then it's not funny at all and it becomes really fucking gross for the girl if she has to sit back and listen to someone mock whether or not she's telling the truth when she knows she did. That has got to be a horrible feeling. So the question is, what is worse? Is it worse to get falsely accused of rape or is it worse to get raped when someone doesn't believe you and get accused of being a liar? It's obviously worse to get raped and being accused of alive, but by how much, I mean if you grading on a scale like getting getting, I mean let's just, let's just assume it's at least a bit worse on that side

Speaker 3:          00:10:22       because you use the physical right is worse than being falsely accused but surely

Speaker 4:          00:10:27       in having your career destroyed and dragged through the mud and forever labeled a rapist, which is entirely possible for someone is innocent. It happened to a friend of mine, a friend of mine got accused falsely of rape. This girl that he was dating, he broke up with her. They broke up and she just decided that she was going to get back at him, so she said that he was a rapist and she followed through with it for awhile and then eventually abandoned it. But that does happen and it's happened many, many times and there's a bunch of statistics you can look up online, but they're not entirely accurate because they don't take into account how many women leave. You look into like overall rapes and overall people who lie it, rape the overall rape statistics are not accurate because they do not know nor do they take into account or can they possibly take into account how many women don't say anything. It's a big number.

Speaker 3:          00:11:12       And also like what constitutes a rape exam. Like when you say that with some men have falsely accused is not always as black and white as you know, they, they were dating and they never even had sex at all but she suddenly accuses him of. Right. But there are also scenarios where as you said before she was drunk or like she didn't know that he thought there was consent and there wasn't consent or that, you know, I mean, or maybe they were, you know, so it's, it's, it's a vague area and I think Kurt's point which is like, I don't think that we should be having to choose between the two options that you just cited, which is on the one hand a woman gets raped and is not believed. And on the other hand, a man is falsely accused of rape. Well, I think what Kurt is trying to do, just in a clumsy, smart ass, he a flame throwing way is say, can it be true that rape is really, really terrible and we also should, should offer men the benefit of the doubt and encourage rape victims to go to the police rather than to internal investigations at places like Uc Bay.

Speaker 3:          00:12:14       His point is like he thinks he's on the side of the rape victims, right? By saying like they've been sold a dumb bill of goods by feminists by saying, oh your such poor, pathetic victims that you can't go to the police and it will never be taken care of by going to the police. So you should just be mollycoddled and, and you should either remain silent or, or you know, just to have it sorted out internally. Think he's saying when he says, he says so he, this is his followup facebook post which you posted last Wednesday where he begins by saying I'm my punishment the mob is howling for is now officially more severe than the one for the actual ripest. Which is interesting. But towards the end he says, I didn't yell at victims to go to the police. They are victims. I'm yelling at the people who said women can't go to the police. They have to work outside the system. I think that's out of bullshit and leads to rapists walking free. It hurts the victims of sexual assault.

Speaker 4:          00:13:09       Okay. He's saying that because this woman never went to the police. That's just publicly accused of rape.

Speaker 3:          00:13:14       That's right. Isn't there more than one woman as well? I believe so. I believe there's a second one. Who's friends with that girl? Right? Who also says the same store. So he ain't good. He claims to be on the side of the victims. I mean, I think he just doesn't quite get how traumatic it can be for people who've been for women who've been sexually assaulted. He gets raped every day. You don't even know.

Speaker 4:          00:13:36       You don't know. He gets raped every day, just so you can understand. It gets raped every day. He loves it. Not Funny. Rape is never funny.

Speaker 3:          00:13:43       Um, he, he said, why? He says, why did the story of what actually happened? What happened to come out after the guy is declared a ripest? I'll listen to any victim's account. All that was given initially is Aaron's right best pass it on. My point was that no one seems disturbed by this. No one sees that down the road. Next time we might get it wrong.

Speaker 4:          00:14:02       Well we might have it wrong here. We don't know, but it's not good when a second person calls you out for the same crime. That's right, but it's also not good that no one went to the cops and maybe also what kind of evidence do you have? Somebody raped you a month ago, guess what? You have no evidence. No, exactly. As you've showered up and you don't have any bruises. Like what can you say? It's your word against them. Yeah, and you know, I think for some women and it's also like what exactly was the scenario that we're talking about? Was it a simple social justice warrior type thing where two people are drunk and then the woman didn't consent, so they're calling that rape, which is repeated ad nauseum and it got kicked out at Occidental. College is a lawsuit going on right now because of that.

Speaker 4:          00:14:43       I'm sure you know that story where a man and a woman, the girl was saying, coming over, do you have condoms? They have sex, and then her friends convinced her that because she was drunk, it was rape even though they were both drunk and then the college kicks him out, keeps her and so he's suing the college. It's a fucking giant disaster is total sexism. One hundred percent sexism against the man and when you look at the story and what it is, it's a goddamn witch hunt and they gave into the witch hunt. They just wanted to quiet it down and they figured it would be easier to kick this kid out and and just given to the wills of the mom

Speaker 3:          00:15:17       and then on the other hand you've got that, like the the California College swimmer kid who who raped a girl behind the dumpster on campus. You've never heard about that. She was passed out and he was like fingering her and she ended like pine cone cuts all over her vagina and everything was really horrible story and she ended up getting, what, six months basically nothing, and now he's out. Now he's out again and um, and

Speaker 4:          00:15:41       that's, that's, that's a fucking terrible person and that guy should be

Speaker 3:          00:15:45       punished. And the judge was, the judge was an alum of the same college and so and so. He's like, it's an all boys school. He's like, oh, well boys will be boys. And the, and the apology that this rice, the ripest little asshole road was like, I think this serves as a good lesson about intoxication and the dangers of inebriation on campus. Like, fuck you, it doesn't, that's not the lesson. The lesson is done, right. Paypal, when she's in colons and someone's vagina piece of shit. Well, I mean, when she was ending, it was bad enough to people who say, well maybe he thought that she was consenting. It was obvious enough that to other students, they were foreign students. They were Swedish guys were riding by on bicycles and they saw what was going on and it was obvious from afar, even in the dark what was happening because they stopped and came over and rescued her. She was limp as a, as a ragdoll.

Speaker 4:          00:16:31       Yeah. So there's that. That's real rape and that's, that's terrifying when a woman does get, you know, exposed as being someone who's experienced rape. So the, you have to think about all these people that know your personal trauma and then this guy barely gets punished. That's horrible too. Yeah. It's horrible too. Yeah, man. It sucks both ways. You know, I guess it's definitely sucks worse if you, the person who gets victimized, but it still sucks if you're someone who didn't do anything wrong and someone claims that you're a rapist and that tag carries you for the rest of your life and in your being falsely accused. Yeah. Until we can read people's minds clearly and truly, God, that'll be terrifying. It's going to happen. It's on the way. It's, it's like right now we are at the Morse code of reading minds. We're at the, uh, to, to, to, to do, do, do, do.

Speaker 4:          00:17:19       That's where we're at. I mean they're sending signals, they're receiving signals, they're articulating words, someone sending their setting words through the Internet into your mind and you see those words. You hear those words, images, they can place images in your mind. This is a very rudimentary right now, but they're gonna be able to string those words together and form sentences and those words instead of being through some giant Bank of supercomputers, it's going to be something that's in your phone or a chip that we all willingly installing our brains and we're going to read each other's. Then we're going to know.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       I wonder how nuanced that'll be though. So I did a, I did a story before I was at huffpost live. I had a show on discovery science channel, which was sort of a bit like the soup. We like a smart ass. He kind of look at, but science nerd news and I went to come and where it was somewhere up in the bay area, so some it place where they working on mind reading a computer games. And this was all the way back in I guess 2010, 2009 and I you could put a thing on your head and you can operate the computer game just through the intensity of your pet, of your thought patterns. It's very, like you say, it's basically Morse code. It's pretty much only on or off. You can't just know nuance apart from just think hard about something and then you know, you'll set fire to this little thing that you need to set fire to, to win the game. That's amazing that they can tell that. But I wonder whether or not. And for example, we can see the brain when you put people in an Mri machine, we can tell whether or not the, the room, the memory part of your brain is lighting up when they show you something. So they talking about the possibility of in a criminal trial, they'd be able to at least be able to tell whether or not you've ever been to the inside, excuse me, of the of the place where the crime was committed.

Speaker 4:          00:19:01       Well, you know, I did an episode of this, of that drug and questions, everything with Mri. They actually, they accused someone and convicted someone, I believe in India of having functional knowledge of a crime scene because through f Mri they were able to indicate that she understood where that crime scene was and she had some form of memory that they could deduce from the Fmr. The problem according to neuroscientists and the woman I was talking to on the podcast on the show, I forget her name, I apologized to her, but she explained that the problem is that during the course of the investigation that person, the woman who was accused and convicted could have been exposed to the evidence of that crime scene and then have functional memory of that crime scene. Because of that which was exposed during the MRI. Particularly when you think about the fact that her freedom was on the line, she was falsely accused or accused of this crime. I don't know if she did or not. She's accused of this crime they presented with this evidence. She has to go over this evidence. There's an incredible amount of weight in emotions involved in that and they could see or that memory deeply in her brain of what that scene looked like.

Speaker 3:          00:20:07       Yeah, that's interesting. I can't remember whether you've told me about that or whether I've just heard you talk about it on the, on the podcast, but. But then as you get to more and more subtle layers of thought, so it's not just is the memory part of the brain firing when we showed this person an image of something, but it's like. I mean, how would you. How would you ascertain somebody's guilt or innocence in a rape case?

Speaker 4:          00:20:31       Right now? I can't see. I think what they're doing with this Fmri stuff is. I mean obviously you can't if there's some significant evidence, Siemens scratches video actually by reading your mind, but I don't think that Kenya, what they were saying is that the. What they did in India with this woman was telling me she, and she

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       again, is a prominent neuroscientist. She was saying that they misuse the evidence. They misstated the efficacy of this evidence and that they use this in a very inappropriate way that would not be legal in the United States like you would get. No one who understands, truly understands Fmr, who would sign off on that or no one whose ethical, I mean from the neuroscientist who I've spoken to, I think we're a long, long, long way away from having the kind of granularity and confidence that we could say just because this part of the law, the brain is lighting up or was it just because of these kinds of waves of being emitted by your neurons. That means that you're either guilty or not guilty according to our standard biology. I would agree with that and here's where I deviate. I think that we are not that far away from them being able to introduce artificial recording of memories and I think that people are going to do it willingly and I think it's going to be one of those things that people share with each other back and forth.

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       What are you showing me, Jamie? Scientists discover how to implant false memories pulley Ah, shame. We just blew it up. So what does that mean? Pull it up. Mit researchers expand that so I could read that a little bit better. MIT researchers, Steve Ramirez and wow. The Zulu recently made history when they successfully implanted a false memory into the mind of a mouse. The proof was a simple reaction from the road and what the implications are. Vast, they placed the furry little creature inside a metal box and it froze. Displaying a distinct fear response. The mouse is reacting as if they received a wreck. Electrical shock there when it had it at all, Huh? I'm stable. I'm not surprised and this is what I think. I've been really heavily dabbling in virtual reality lately because my friend Duncan has the htc vive and uh, he put it on me and I went into a frenzy and I realized like what is happening and where we're at and where I thought we were at versus where we actually are at.

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       They are so far ahead of where I thought they are. They are so close to creating a, uh, an indiscernible virtual reality. It's so close. Kind of do this, a friend of mine works us up at a, but what, who owns oculus? Facebook. That's the big, uh, virtual reality of either Google or facebook. Yeah. Facebook. Facebook tarmac is coming in here. John Carmack, the girl from ID software who programmed. He created doom and quake and all those games. He's now at Oculus, which is just, I mean, he's a flesh and go up there to try to stuff. I was hearing Tim Ferriss talks about this as well and just say a Dunkin donuts podcasts. I connect you guys in town for a til Saturday. Okay. I'll connect you guys when we get after this show and I think Duncanson town. Fantastic. You're going to shit your pants. This shit. So it's amazing. But what's amazing about it is right now it's goggles and it's connected to a computer and it's clunky, but you know, the original computers at the Apollo mission used were giant room and one quarter of the processing power or something of your life. I don't even think it's one quarter. Yeah, you know, but that's the point is that as you,

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       as this technology exponentially gets more and more powerful and smaller and more easy for people to access, you know, used to be everyone remember Wall Street when Michael Douglas had that giant brick phone and we're like, what a gangster. I'm walking around with that phone, that phone's job and now, I mean that was in Brazil a few years back in 2003 and uh, you know, you go to these like little tiny jungle villages and all these people have cell phones. Everybody has a phone.

Speaker 3:          00:24:14       No, it's going to be incredible as you see how. I mean, the interesting thing for me in via are, is what we're saying is where it's gonna go. So everything moves so fast now that it's incredible for me to. I love, I love human ignorance as well as genius. Like I love my own inability to predict how things are going to unfold and just the, the sheer, the sheer joy in how spontaneously kind of a, I don't know, exciting that this whole human experiment is because when for example, huffpost live, we started doing this thing in 2012. We were like, okay, well let's do the future of television because obviously television and the Internet are coming together and they're going to merge, so the way that we. If you, if you were starting from scratch and inventing a tool, a television talk show now knowing nothing about the history of broadcasting or television or radio, what would it be like?

Speaker 3:          00:25:05       Well, it'd be didn't have commenters and you'd have people joining via Webcam and so they developed like 12 hours a day of huffpost live broadcasts from studios. Within a few years it was clear that that was obsolete. That was not the way that the future was going and now it's all like short live streaming, shareable things. Right? Similarly with virtual reality, I think the Fio was and has been. When it gets really good, everyone's just to sit in their basement and watch virtual reality porn all day and no one's going to connect with each other anymore. Right. It's coming, but he is. What's the. What's the biggest virtual or augmented reality breakthrough thus far? That's widespread. That's caught on. I don't know what his pokemon go. Yeah, but that's dropped off significantly. Do you know that? Yeah. They're dropped into my users over the last week. Really? I didn't know it was that much, but here's the thing.

Speaker 3:          00:26:00       I was pretty sure against it. It's in Thai. Yeah. I mean I. I'm not saying that it's going to. The pokemon go itself is going to change the world. What points to to me is the possibility that where we thought that virtual reality was all going to be about headsets and me and my own head and maybe it still will be to some extent. I could totally see it go in the augmented reality way instead so that you're walking around the street with some kind of little thing on the side of your head and all every way you look, things are popping up like little graphics are pumping up on top of things, offering you sales in a particular store, showing you where you know, you can say what you're looking for, you know, where's the nearest bank and this little arrow that points down over the newest chase branch or whatever. That's what magic leap is saying. Yeah, right. So and that strikes

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       me is actually a more plausible and organic pot old possible future than the one in which we're all just sort of like in the wally, remember the movie Wally Universe where we're all just in Bocca lounges and lazy boys in kind of our own. I don't think they're mutually exclusive. Maybe not. I don't think it's either or. I think that's going to happen as well. There's going to be brave fools that venture outside and experience augmented reality where everybody else stairs at people's buttholes from two inches away. I'm telling you, man, you put on these virtual goggles and you have a three d porn going on where these people are having sex and you can get right in there. You could look at their face, you could stare in their eyes when they have sex and it looks so God damn real, but their computer generated avatars or they feel human being filmed.

Speaker 2:          00:27:26       Human beings for 360 degree cameras. And right now it's, you know, it's fairly limited. Did you watch porn on it now? I didn't. Duncan has though. Dunkin is into it. I didn't want to watch porn in front of Dunkin. Can't see anything other than the. I'm just kidding. But it's when you feel someone blowing you and you're just like, what? Come on. Beard. Play enough. Duncan. Um, it's, you know, I saw the um, the most impressive thing that I saw was the underwater thing. They have this underwater thing where you, you're standing at the bottom of the ocean and these fish swim by and then a whale swims up to you and you're looking the whale in the eye and it has this feeling of mass, like you really feel like there's whales in front of you. You freaking out. I mean, it's so realistic.

Speaker 2:          00:28:13       It's actual three d footage of A. Well, no, no, it's CCGI generated. Well, but it's amazing. It's amazing and it's just. It gives you this. Well, I first tried virtual reality at Duncan's place, I want to say four years ago, three years ago, somewhere in there, and it was really crude. It was pixelated and it was some silly game and it was really clunky, but I could see it. I could see it. I could go, oh, I get it. I see where this is going. This is just leaps and bounds past where that is and there's one game that you play or one experience that you have where you go into this guys room and he's composing music on a piano and you walk in the room and you can look up and look around and while this guy's playing the piano, you can get up beside him and look at his keys.

Speaker 2:          00:29:00       It's fucking crazy. That's video. That's a real guy. And Apparently Duncan says like, the porn is just like that. You can just like get. So I mean for me the question is, I think fundamentally we are. Oh well he's the image of the whale. Yeah. I mean this is not doing it justice because you don't have a real reality. Yeah, but you don't have any control whether or not you move. So you're kind of getting a sense of what happens while love this camera moves around, but I'm a. You can get underneath that. We'll look at its body. I'd gone onto the water with a, with a humpback whale and mainly a couple of years ago. You're not allowed to swim with them, but if you're in a little dodgy Zodiac like I was, then they get around the rules. Well my guy did by just holding

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       your legs, so as long as you're still connected to the boat, like you're technically not swimming, swim with them because it for environmental reasons, like people were Dick heads would go up and harass them for the team and the whale or something. Exactly. You need to give them their space and so I had a snorkel on and goggles on and this huge thing just comes looming out of the ward and the size of a fucking bus. This memo that breathes air like that eats these times. I mean the miracle of it blows my mind the diversity of this incredible planet that we live on a and then it just sort of sinks down into the crystal blue water until I can just sort of make it out and then it's just disappeared and it's all just blue blue underneath. I mean it was like, I don't want to sound too wacky, but it was spiritual. I mean, you come over there and that thing is just that was born, that squirted out of another whale's vagina and then grew up and now it's just, now it's doing its thing in the Pacific

Speaker 4:          00:30:41       paradigm shifting because of their masks, because the oddness of them. Well, even dolphins, I um, did this thing last summer where, uh, me and my whole family were in the big island and you go on this dolphin excursion where they take you on a boat and they find these pods of wild dolphins and you just jump into the water with the dolphins with snorkels. So you're, they're swimming around and you know, I did it with my, at the time she was five, we did it with my five year old. I'm like holding her hand and taking her with these dolphins and we're looking down with our goggles and these dolphins were swimming right under you. Amazing. It's fucking beautiful. It's nuts.

Speaker 3:          00:31:18       I was in the water and in Australia in Byron Bay and was, and there are occasional shark attacks there and caught a glimpse of movement out of the side of the side of my eye. Oh fuck. And I was like, Oh fuck. And looked over and could see like a shape and a and a fin ps, the, the, the water and then like what? That moment where time stands stand still and you're like, Holy Shit. And then the back just arched out of the water. I know. I was like, Oh, thank fucking Lord you Dolphin. Oh fuck. Oh God. And then this whole pod of dolphins just diving through the waves, I was like, oh my God.

Speaker 4:          00:31:56       Yeah. There was a video off of Maui or excuse me off a Malibu really recently where these people were flying a drone over a Malibu and he was only, I don't think maybe one or 200 yards away from swimmers and surfers and this is fucking monster. Great White Shark swimming around it and looking for something to chomp on and they're out there apparently like really common off a Malibu and they're realizing that now because it drones Herdez people fly those drones. And have you ever done those? Have you found that operated at myself and that's another aspect of virtual reality. It's fascinating. You put these virtual reality goggles on and you put a camera on this drone and as the drone is flying, you feel like your. I did that in the Pacific when we

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       were looking for bigfoot Duncan and I coincidentally, and this, uh, this drone is flying over the tree tops and it really does. You have this sensation of flight. That's what I want because I used to want to be a pilot. I'm a huge aviation path. Like I'm part of the travel hacking community, the bunch of nerds who figure out ways to fly first class all over the place using credit card, frequent flyer miles tracking travel hacking. Yeah. No, that was real. Yeah, it's great. I mean, I fly around the world first class at least two or three times a year as long as there's many times I have time for one flights that would cost 20 or $30,000. Mean flight from here to Australia in first class on a good airline is $22. Twenty two, $23,000. Yeah. You just use points these miles. But. So I'm a huge.

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       You, you look like, you think that I'm committing crime? No, I'm not your own little insecurities, but I don't know. I feel like I've been saying that in an interaction with law enforcement to Joe. So, um, but whose credit card are you using? I'm not going, but I've always, I mean I've reckoned flight would be the most amazing thing I'd love to. I've been meaning to get around to like learning to hang glide or paraglider, one of those types of things. I think that'd be a great hobby. Who have you seen the new inside of planes that they're building? They're building. Oh yeah. I'm not sure they're going to do that. But you may passenger planes where the interior. The exterior. I've seen the mock ups of. Yeah, well apparently they're thinking about making it or they're in development, but the, if it becomes a reality, the ultimate goal is you're going to be flying and essentially what feels like a convertible.

Speaker 1:          00:34:18       Yeah. Because the entire top of the plane is going to be a screen and you're going to be able to look up and see the actual sky above you. I mean, they could do it on the floor as well if they wanted to. Sure. That freak you out. Feel like you're just sitting in a chair flying through space. Oh my God. I sometimes wonder what the experience would have been like for like the people in the Malaysian Airlines plane that was blown up over Ukraine where like all of us, you know, one minute you were at 34,000 feet and then [inaudible] those explosions, the way that those anti aircraft and missiles go is they blow up outside the, the plane just, just immediately outside it. And then all of the shrapnel shatters the plane and blow it apart. Yeah. So did they shoot that thing down or did a bomb blow up on the plane?

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       They shut it down. So it was the, uh, the Russians. So it was a Russian shout, a plane down for. Yeah. You remember the Malaysia Airlines plane that went down Mih? I always get approved. Who Shot that down? Basically. So Putin was alarming. It wasn't intentional that didn't know it was a passenger plane. So it was during the Ukrainian. Putin had annexed Crimea and was basically fermenting a revolution in Ukraine because he resented the Ukrainian government being pro western and pro American and so they were sending in Russian special forces in like, not in Russian uniforms, but our secret service guys will know they are Russian

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       backed in Russia to finance. They using military hardware that only Russia could have gotten them, that a rag tag team of Ukrainian rebel San Francisco would never have been able to get on their own, such as an anti aircraft. Ms Dot Paula can shoot a plane out of the sky from 34,000 feet. Now there are lots of conspiracy theories that are put out by Moscow about this because of course Russia doesn't accept it. They think that it was the west, I think that it was the Ukrainians or whatever, but there was a Malaysian airlines jet that was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur full of quite a lot of people who were heading to Melbourne actually. Which is why I did quite a few stories on it. And um, the that we're heading to Melbourne for big AIDS conference was the big national aids conference, so actually a lot of the world's best biggest best aids scientists and aids research has died in that, in that crash.

Speaker 3:          00:36:26       And they were just flying and they'd been in the air for a few hours and they were going over Ukrainian airspace and the rebels sore a speck in the sky and assumed that it wouldn't be a passenger plane. Why they assume that I think that there was a warning that passenger jets shouldn't be going over that area. And I think it was an off year. They assumed that it was a military plane and they used one of these huge antiaircraft things and it's self God is seeking. So it goes straight to the thing and then just as it is, it's next to it explodes and the plane's splits into and just literally drops out of the sky. And I sometimes wonder like, what is the experience when you're sitting there, do you have a half a second to, to know what's happening? I mean, you must, you must write. The deceleration is so fast that I've heard scientists say, you wouldn't really know what's happening.

Speaker 3:          00:37:20       You'd just sort of you pass out because all of a sudden you're going from what, 500 miles an hour down to and rapid rapid deceleration. Obviously all of a sudden it's. There's no air, there's no air anymore. There's it's freezing cold, but I mean some people I would have imagined would be semi momentarily aware that something horrible has happened and it's suddenly it's called tumbling out of the sky. It's kind of weird to. So I don't want that kind of flight. Joe Don't know why that popped into my head, that whole story, but I want some kind of flight. Yeah, that's not good. Yeah. Me. Amazing. On the question of virtual reality, do you think, do you not think that we are so fundamentally creatures of community, of communion, of communication that this dystopian vision of all of us just sitting solo with our headsets on, having our own experiences is unlikely.

Speaker 3:          00:38:15       I tend to think that there are going to be ways that we will find ways to use it to connect us more rather than less because what makes it anything not, that's not a gimmick. Like I don't know. I can't foresee what virtual reality will become. Like when film was invented, they started out just by doing here's an image of a steam train and people were like, oh my goodness. It's like it looks like there's a steam train, but no one knew what the fuck to do with it. It took awhile. It took years. It took decades before the craft and art of cinematography and filmmaking became a thing and I don't know that we know yet what virtual reality will become at the moment. It strikes me as just something like, Whoa,

Speaker 4:          00:38:52       it'll become everything can become. It's not going to become any one thing. It's not going to go in only one direction. All these directions that we're proposing are not just possible, but most likely inevitable and whether or not we're creatures of community. There's a lot of people that seek community online and that's the only way they get community and it's very problematic in a lot of them when you find out like who they are as people, they're really fucked up and one of the reasons why they're seeking community online is because they don't have community in the actual physical world and they're disenfranchised and they're loners or they're, you know, they're on the spectrum or there's a bunch of different factors, a bunch of different social misfits that are finding community online. I know places where you can go where you could see the same people online literally 18 hours a day every day. Some people that are on disability and they get checks and they never leave the house and all they do is pay for their Internet connection and food and that is where they exist and that is really common. So if that's really common, you know there's probably a million plus people out there that are doing that every day. What's going to stop them from going

Speaker 3:          00:39:58       virtual? They will, yeah, they will.

Speaker 4:          00:40:00       Well, and I think a lot of other people will as well. If you think about what we're doing with phones, you know how many times have you gone to a restaurant? You see a table full of seven people. No one's talking to each other. Everyone's staring at their phone. I mean, this is a form of virtual reality. You're going into the reality that exists on your phone and you're like, hmm, what's. See what's going on. You're constantly updating it and constantly checking your facebook feed to see if who's posted something interesting. You're clicking on videos and instead of talking to each other, you're showing each other some shit that's on your phone. That is really common, right?

Speaker 3:          00:40:31       It is. It's a big fucking problem. I think it's. I think it's deeper than we know

Speaker 4:          00:40:35       Ari Shaffir and big Jay Oakerson did a podcast where they were on the roof of this building and they were a peeping tom on this. A couple of those couples about deaf sex and they both started talking on their phones will start playing with their phones. The woman was straddling this man and she's looking at her phone and the guys underneath the girl and he starts, okay,

Speaker 3:          00:40:54       I want to know why our Irish affairs spying on people, what he does, he's a pervert. He's a creep, but I think it's what it's doing to our heads. But like, because like, so a friend of a friend of mine is a stand up here and in La and he first, he got rid of his smartphone in favor of a flip phone already did that too. And then he got rid of his flip phone in favor of a home landline with an old fashioned answering machine with a type in it because he feels like he enjoyed. He thinks there's a virtue in being bored. There's something to be in board. Yep. That you'll brain needs the space of having to conjure up imagination in its own right in order to lead you to the muse because you never know when it's gonna hit. So you know, constantly.

Speaker 3:          00:41:45       I mean, I think back to why not I was a kid and if you made arrangements to go and see a movie with a buddy of yours, you know, when I was 15 and you said we'll just meet at the movie theater at five and they were going to be light. There was no way for you to know that they were going to be seven minutes late and during those seven minutes there was nothing for you to do and it's amazing to me that I'm amazed that that's the case. It's amazing to me that now I can't even really imagine just standing on a street corner outside of movie theater for seven minutes being totally unruffled by the fact that a friend is seven minutes late and being perfectly comfortable just doing what? Gazing at the sky. Looking at passes by. Yeah. That's what people have done for thousands of years when they had to wait for something and that space, that just psychic space of not having the ability to check who taught me, talking about me on twitter, who, what, what's going on on facebook, what am I missing? What's happening? We know what's the latest photo from my friends. What's the latest news thing that's coming down? Just standing there. They life used to be punctuated by moments like that all the time. Yeah. And I wonder whether those are the moments in which you come up with ideas for the book that you want to ride or the standup bit that you want to do or the painting that you want to pay until the, I don't know, the chair that you want to make.

Speaker 2:          00:43:05       No, they can or you can just actually work. A lot of people think that the music is supposed to come to you when you're bored. How about you sit in front of your desk, you fucking Lazy Bitch. And actually right. You know, there's that too. I mean, I think there is absolutely an argument for not being constantly entertained by electronics. There's absolutely an argument for that, but I don't know if that's the best one. I think um, I lead is, well I think reflection and time alone and also I think the, um, the way to mitigate that is discipline. I think you have to have discipline. You have to have no wins. A lot of people don't. I don't

Speaker 3:          00:43:42       and I appreciate moments of, you know, I used to love flying before you had back televisions because it was a good excuse to just read and just gaze out the window and just think now I watch tv because I don't do this. I'm an

Speaker 2:          00:43:53       bullshit. You're not though, but you're not. You get a lot of things done. I do, but don't. I mean I like a lot of creative people. Beat myself up a lot for not getting more done. I mean I look at. I live as well and I get a lot done.

Speaker 3:          00:44:06       Yeah. But I think everyone looks at you and thinks, fuck, I wish I was more like Joe said. I just did a lot of shit. He seems to have his shit together. Guys like you and Tim Ferriss. You like an Anthony Robbins and stuff. You're always doing shit. Yeah. But whereas a lot of us are the creative people spend a lot of time scratching our head, scratching our offices.

Speaker 2:          00:44:24       Here's the dirty secret. I'm never satisfied. Yeah. I'm not everything I eat everything. I do

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       have a podcast comes out great. I'm happy and everything like that, but I. I get very little satisfaction from it. I just. All I think is the next one's got to be good to. Let's. Let's make sure the guest is good. Let's make sure the subject matters. That was good. Easy, easy fella. You're a good guest, but I've had some gas before. We're like, oh Jesus, I got to do all the heavy lifting here. Motherfuckers not even finishing his sentences. I've had people like that before. Especially people that don't know how to do podcasts or they haven't done them before. Yeah, I mean podcasting itself is kind of a work of art. It's a very pretentious way to describe it, but I mean it is a creation and there's something that's going on. You have to be aware of how people are gonna perceive this creation, how they're going to ingest it, and it has to be as smooth as you can make it and you have to learn from your mistakes and you have to make sure you're not talking over each other too much, but you also can't let someone ramble too much as well.

Speaker 4:          00:45:21       Sometimes people get boring, they just drone on about things in their own, in their own space and you've got to kind of pull them out of their space. So there's A. There's like a craft to it all, but yeah, I do a lot of different things, but one of the reasons why I do a lot of different things is that they all kind of symbiotically connected together in some sort of a weird way in that I love them all. I enjoy doing them all. Whether it's a comedy or mma commentary or podcasting, they all do sort of flow together.

Speaker 3:          00:45:48       Hm. I mean, it's interesting that you say that. Like there's a craft to podcasting. In terms of how. We were talking about this a little bit last night with Sam Harrison on my podcast about when should you interrupt and when should you not, not interrupt because I find that sometimes I'll be criticized for interrupting somebody on my podcast and as far as I'm concerned what I. The last thing I want my podcast to be or any form of entertaining conversation to be is just a sequence of speeches that two people give to one another. I mean this is one of the things that's appealing about your podcast. You know, you come into this with a two to three hour stretch ahead of you with absolutely no idea what's going to happen and no preconceptions about where it's going to go and the joy of it is the is the dance, right? Is the interplay like I don't know what was going to be talking about in five minutes time and neither do you. So it's interesting to find out and I feel like if you have too nice to other people and don't interrupt them in order to create that dance, then there's basically one person standing on the sidelines and another person trying to do the two step or the Flamenco by themselves.

Speaker 4:          00:46:56       But that depends on who the guest is. Like there's certain guests like Dr Rhonda Patrick is a perfect example. All I do is wind her up and let her go. I mean I interact with her a little bit but as little as possible and she's just such a dynamo that all I have to do is ask her questions about the mechanisms of certain vitamin absorption or whatever we're talking about cold shock therapy, whatever the fuck it is. And she just goes. So in that case, if I wanted to chime in and have a normal conversation, I'd fuck up the flow of the conversation. So going to know you to have the. Whereas you and I, we always have these silly conversations that goes all over the place. We're laughing, we're serious. It's very fluid and it goes back and forth. But you like, I am not a fucking medical expert.

Speaker 3:          00:47:40       No. I mean we're not experts in anything which is, which is what kind of what I like. I like being a polymath. I like having a lot of fingers in different pies and polymath polymath person who is for who's good at it can. Can we get a definition on polymath? Jamie? I understand it. To be a person who's interested in and good at several different disciplines like doesn't really focus on one. I prefer smile. A renaissance man, a person of wide ranging knowledge or learning well. Experts in this

Speaker 4:          00:48:07       bands. A significant number of different subject areas. That's an expertise. Many expertise. So a person who is known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problem.

Speaker 3:          00:48:16       Well that's the Wiki. I was no, look at the one above. I was using the general, the general use ranging knowledge or learning. Yeah, it's. Well that's just a more pronounced version of it or more polymath. I like it. How much time do you spend distracted by your phone?

Speaker 4:          00:48:31       I tried very low, more, less lately than ever. I've been really good about it. Over the last few months, like I went to, I was in the Nevada high country in the desert last week,

Speaker 3:          00:48:43       just for a whole week. I love this. I love the. I love that. Just for your listeners, so I got my book a trip to La. I had a few meetings out here. I'm always here at the last minute, so I never had never planned in advance. I send you a text, don't hear from him for a couple of days. He gets back to me. Sorry I've. I've been in the wilderness like my image of you is like you didn't have any cell phone reception. You're out in the woods and in my brain you're like, you're naked on the back of a horse. Like shooting elk. No, I was trying to shoot

Speaker 4:          00:49:13       mule deer. I was in the desert. I was camping and those were the a group of friends and we were on a hunting trip and we were there for seven days. No Cell Phone Reception, no pee. We occasionally saw another hunter, but that's it. We're just saying, well, they're on public land in the wilderness and chasing after dear. I got to do more of the seven days. No cell phone. How many female? No, there was five of us total. One, two, three, four, five, six. Six of US total. Great. Yeah. What'd you it off into? Two groups. We brought food, brought a freeze dried foods, these things called mountain ops, the you add water to them. This freeze dried fruits and dehydrated foods and then we brought some whole foods, some actual real foods. We ate that all by the, like the fourth or fifth day and then we not shitty freeze dried stuff, but um, we're hoping we going to eat a deer but we struck out. But it was a very fun time and even just for the, just the release of just being disconnected from society. But point is I try to do that several times a year. I do that maybe five times a year, but more important than that, I leave that fucking thing alone more than I've ever done before. I treat that thing. If I spend too much time with it, it's going to give me a disease.

Speaker 3:          00:50:24       I think it does. Yeah. I think it does. And don't know why. I don't

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       know what's changed. I'm trying to put my finger on what it is about my relationship, especially to twitter. That has changed because it's a very wholesome. Yeah. Is that what it is? With so many assholes, you realize like in my real life, how many people do I get in contact with them? Make me feel awful. Very few. Almost zero. Almost zero. So you choose to hang out with your friends, choose to hang out with your acquaintances. All the people that you know, you interact with people. And even if I meet someone and they're a stranger, 99 point nine times when I meet them, it's a pleasant interaction. It's very rare that I find someone who's like really truly rude or where it can't be worked out. You know where you can't walk away from it with a handshake and feeling good. But this thing, this w two dimensional conversation where you don't know who the person is, you don't know what, where they're coming from.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       You don't know what their agenda is. You don't know what their life is like. You don't know anything about them. And they say something and you react to that 130 plus characters. So there are two problems, right? One is the, the absence of destroy, the distractedness that it kind of fosters in our lives. The fact that it rubs, at least in my experience, I can only speak for me, it rubs me of moments of Zen that could exist throughout the day by plunging, by know. We know physiologically that it gives you a little dopamine hit every time you notice that someone's mentioned you on twitter and said something right. I mean you get a true that they'd done like studies with people. Yeah. You get a little hit, you get a little drug hit. I mean just a tiny drip, drip, drip. It's like having a little piece of candy.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       I could just get dripped all day then just sit around and just drip away. Well, people do drip, drip, drip, crazy man. And so there's that. There's the fact that I'm constantly getting that literally hit by, by lugging on what is that an energy thing when you're writing? This is your brain Alpha Bank. Yeah, yeah, sure. Is it going to. What does it contain? I mean, I know I should know this because I know that you're the guy not, don't worry about it. It doesn't matter. I'll talk to you off the aerobatics. Just Dole it handled. He did throw them all. Last night there was only two left. Hannibal stolen. He sent me. He sent me a text message this morning laughing about how he stole all my Alpha brain and I've got his address. I'm like, just give me your address. I'll send you out. Did he say anything else about to about last night?

Speaker 1:          00:52:43       No. No, no. Okay. Good. I don't want them to feel bad about what was going to feel bad when it comes out. Yeah. Alright. Uh, so getting around that, if you release it, he's gonna feel bad even though maybe he, maybe Sam feel bad. I don't know. Well this comes back to twitter. They'll feel bad if they read twitter and they want to feel bad if that irate to stay off twitter. And so this is interesting. So in addition to it being a kind of a drug that you keep in your pocket, that stops you from, uh, from ever just being alone with yourself. Have you seen that? Louis ck bit by the way, but he, I think he's on Conan where he's talking about why it doesn't want to give his daughter's phone because like, he's like, you know, that he was like, he was stopped in traffic at lights and he felt something inside that he didn't like, which was like the experience of being human.

Speaker 1:          00:53:33       And so he reached for his phone and then he realized that that's what we do. Like the moment we start to feel the great emptiness of being alive, we reach for our phone and but one on one occasion he didn't reach for his phone and he pulled over the side of the road and like started bawling his eyes out and it was so cathartic and so beautiful. And then he recovered and he like had this wonderful spiritual goal. Some experience, hold the fuck on. He just started crying song. There's some songs on the radio and it was so beautiful. Anyway, he gets, he waxes all lyrical and gets old poetic Louis ck growing a vagina right in front of her eyes. You heard it here first. Louie Joe Rogan says you have a vagina. Sorry, go ahead. But anyway, that's his point is like that's what part of the experience of being human is all about his side of the road with a car listening to magic created by a machine.

Speaker 1:          00:54:22       Yeah. So human. Maybe that's the wrong example. Can Pussy. So in addition to that then you're talking, people were tweeting. Louis right now doesn't even have a twitter anymore that's wise. Deleted his twitter. Well he sells out Madison Square Garden. Yeah. What does he need a fucking disappointed. I was one of these schmucks who bought a ticket to see him at Madison Square Garden a couple of weeks and I'm now I'm thinking I used to see him when he was at the seller like I used to. I went at Austin, come aspen comedy festival and saw him with 50 people in the room. Why am I going to be sitting? I, I'll feel like it's not going to be the same in the garden, but definitely not going to be the same because it's a different show different day. Yeah. Well, so what you wanted to see the stadium so you could see him at the comedy store in here all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:55:11       Can you just come over to my place and do it in my living room? Shit. Just got weird real. He's crying. You're inviting them over here. I'm crying. I'm going to be on virtual reality watching porn and he's going to be doing a bit. Yeah man. It's going to be different. He's doing a big gigantic show and he's, you know, making a lot more money doing it that way. Yeah. Well he apparently emptied out his bank account to create that horror series. No. Horace. And Pete was the animated series. That's not unlimited. No, Harrison paid is a. is like a, an old school kind of multicam no studio audience. I never watched it. Somebody told me it was animated. Who said call me fucking assume they were right. I thought it was anime. No it's not. Oh Wow. It has a drawing as it's icon. Oh, that's what it is. Oh, so what is, is it good? It is innovative in a way that only a, an altar like Louis would have the balls to pull off. Is that a tactful way of dodging the question? So I don't get it. I'm just kidding the first. So He's, he fucks with you. Right. Remember his original Louie Lucky Louie on Hbo, like that was done to, to sort of look like the and like with bad

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       sets that Kinda shook and like, you know, bad studio audience was like a very sort of 19 sixties Sitcom feel and everyone criticized it because they're like, oh that production values are terrible. And he's like, well yeah, we fucking know that. It's not like hbo doesn't have the money to get a good set. If we wanted a good set, it's supposed to look like an old sitcom, but it's a very sort of metta like fuck you concept. And in a similar way, what he's done here is he's basically done a, a dramatic, sort of almost 19 seventies English style play that is shot with no studio audience with very, very, very long scenes and long takes that's very dark and a bit whimsical and funny. But I've, I only got through a few episodes and then it, although I respected it, it just wasn't a way that I want to spend my evening, if that makes sense. Yeah, that does make sense.

Speaker 4:          00:57:14       You mean it's a, it's a piece of art. You're creating something. Yeah. Yeah. And also when you're creating something like, especially when it comes to like a sitcom or something along those lines, it takes a long time for it to find its legs for you to figure out like what the characters are all about and what, how, how the scenes are going to play out. Every Sitcom that I've ever seen or the ones that I've been a part of, they take many, many, many episodes to create. Like to figure out what, what it actually is. And then along the way, like you have to have someone who believes in it and they're financing it, funding it, and he loved him, did all that shit on his own, but he emptied out his fucking

Speaker 3:          00:57:51       and he's already made it back. So now everything from now, now he hasn't made any sales of it, so he's made it all back just from Internet sales according to him. And then so whatever sale he ends up making, if he sells it Netflix or whatever, he's apparently waiting for the emmy's because he wants to. He's hoping we'll get some of then will be in a stronger negotiating position. But all of that will be profit. One hundred percent profit.

Speaker 4:          00:58:10       That's interesting. So he did make the money back, so he complained about it and then after he complained about it, he made more

Speaker 3:          00:58:15       complaining about it. Thing was he claims that was just a bullshit and media spin. He was on Howard I think. I think it was on Howard stern show us. No, no, no. He didn't lie. What he was saying, his point is that he was saying that he spent all of his money and he was like joking about how like, you know, I spent all my money on this thing and I have no idea if it's gonna work and then some fucking clickbait media outlet was like Louis ck broke off to, you know, losing all of his money on the show. He was like, no, I never expected to get my money back immediately. This is an experiment. I put my money and it's an investment and now like it's paid off.

Speaker 4:          00:58:46       That was all the money that he had and he was just doing that and then he had to go on tour. I mean that was part of what you're saying, that he's going on tour for more money because he had emptied his bank account.

Speaker 3:          00:58:55       Okay. But that's different from losing you money. He invested his money in this thing and now and while he was waiting for it to pay for it to pay itself off them, a bunch of news articles came out about how he had no money. Well, that's what people want to hear. They don't want to hear what a wonderful investment in data and create creative venture that was profitable, wants to hear that he's a loser now. Sucking dicks for homemade one

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       people are people are gross where they want to hear about failure. Hearing about a guy that has a, you know, a reasonable sort of a risk and it pays off. It's not a great story is already successful. It's not. Nobody wants to hear that. Why are we like that, Joe? Why do we want to see accidents? If you want to see, do you want to see someone to fly by on a motorcycle? You don't want to see some fly by another guy. Changes lanes in that car goes changes lanes, but I want to say blood and at least see implying

Speaker 3:          00:59:53       can vw beetle on the highway on the way here, charred, burned to a crisp on the side of the road with the cops around it. Whoa. Is that a thing in Los Angeles

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       so that shouldn't be aware of. Is that for insurance or something or is it a massive accident? Could have been anything. We could have just been a fire, you know, how does it can catch fire, but didn't vw go through some weird fucking shit where they were lying about, uh, the diesel. But this was, this was a beetle from the new ones. No, no, no, not the ones with the little fake daisies in the. Probably caught on fire. Those are shipped boxes that Joe, thanks for listening everybody. That's a show. We solved it. It's like CSI VW beetle. Joe Joe fixed it up. It was on fire. No, it was definitely on fire in a car that accidentally caught on fire. Actually, I have,

Speaker 3:          01:00:42       now that you mentioned it. Yeah, when I was a kid, we, uh, we were staying in the UK and we were driving a friend's Jaguar, Jaguar, Jaguar, Jaguar, and uh, it was one of the, it was incredibly expensive. This guy's a multi multimillionaire, big star in the UK. And so we are driving. He lends it to us for a weekend while we're there and it's the 19 sixties vintage thing. And we go out and drive through the countryside and the car catches on fire. Oh No. So my parents had to pay to restore this vintage Jaguar and the minute they didn't accept responsible for this piece of shit catching on fire, he lent it to us. Actually it was more than a weekend. He was letting us use it because he was out of the country. I think we were staying there for a couple of weeks. He was letting us use this place, letting us drive his car. It's kind of a deal, you know, we're not gonna

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       yeah, but whatever. A car does not catch on fire does. If it's a 19 sixties vintage Jaguar, but it doesn't catch on fire because of your fault. No sunfire because it's a piece of shit. You a piece of shit. He knew it was a piece of shit because it's in 1960 car. You're driving it around and it acted like a piece of shit and caught on fire and then he wants you to pay. I would have been like, fuck you buddy. How about you get your wires checked and I sue you for almost killing me. He didn't have your car.

Speaker 3:          01:02:03       He didn't want us to pay. How much was it that I don't remember? I was a child, a little child, probably a lot of them. About 12. It was a lot. I remember my parents feeling like it was a lot of money and it goes because like smoke just started pouring out of the bag

Speaker 1:          01:02:16       because it didn't even have a fucking fire extinguisher. No fucking shitbox. Goddammit. I'm mad. I'm mad now. British engineering excellence. He was a wealthy guy that's got very wealthy. Well, he's a piece of shit. Your parents weren't rich and expensive. Car parents weren't rich. They were not rich. Then he made them pay. He didn't make them pay. They refused to accept his offer. Have to reimburse them. Oh, so they. They. If they insisted on paying. Yeah, he should've bought them something with that money. He probably did, but my parents are nice. People just stopped going to take money from a friend of his. Yeah, but it's, it's. That's tricky man. First of all, what a wonderful guy for letting you borrow this 19, 60 something job. Those old jaguars are so bad ass. Look, and to have that long front knows God. What a fucking know this was even before.

Speaker 1:          01:03:07       So I'm trying to think of what model that is with a very, very long nose. This is the one before that which was around, uh, around a kind of shape from memory. Pull it up, Jeremy. Come of what it is. What, what, what was the shape of jags and the light in the late sixties was talk about a gas guzzler. I mean, you know, it's an fi 12, wasn't it? Yeah, it'd be a V. I'm not even sure. It might've been an in line eight. Would that make sense? Could have been of a 12. I'm making things up. I don't know anything about old jugs. Yeah, I said it was. I mean it was, it was certainly eight or 12. It was not, it was not nothing expensive at it. Yeah. It was one of those 19 sixties Jaguar. MK Two. What? A pretty car. Incredible. It was a kind of car were when you stopped at the lights, people would wind down the windows and we might see the one next to it is the one I was thinking of.

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       The red one. What is that one? It's like a James Bond style that's so dope. I love on type II type 19 sixties type. Those are so pretty. You know, they make those now with modern underpinnings. You can buy one of those. These companies, they, they take an old Jaguar e type, but they put a completely modern suspension and brakes and modern engine. And so you look like you're driving a car. Were you driving this? That's a real new thing that they're doing. It's called Resto Mod. That's great. Super Common. I have a 19, 65 corvette like that. Really? Yeah. I love five. What's the 60? Can you show me a 16? This is a picture of my mind. So I did a video with Jay Leno. We did Jay Leno's garage around. Yup. Yep. I'll check that episode out. Yeah, that'd be great. Um, I heard him on your show as well.

Speaker 1:          01:04:47       You had him on my car. Oh, that's great. I love those. That's got a state. How many cars have you got? I've got a few. You don't want to say that's a night on. I've done a lose the, the common man. Touch, I'm definitely not, well, I've lost it over, but that, uh, that has a 500 horsepower ls, one supercharged engine under the, under the hood and it only weighs like, it's probably less than 3000 pounds, especially because it's a convertible. At what point during this did jay come in his pants immediately? Yeah, we had to change pants for Tai Chi is an animal, but it's um. Oh, speaking of coming in. Oh No, I'm not even going to go there. I'll tell. I'll talk to you about it after the, after the podcast, you know, when the filter between your brain and your mouth is no more flood gate come on nights. It's just something personal in my life. I'm talking about your call. And so, uh, I just want to come back to that cord segway.

Speaker 1:          01:05:48       How do we go from. The problem is the problem is that the thing is so much less interesting than whatever is in everybody's brain. So dear listener, I understand he is a, here's a piece of advice, whatever, whatever you are thinking about right now. When you heard me talk about a coming that is more interesting than the reality of the story that I was going to tell you. Oh, so just hang onto that. Listen folks, whatever he tells me after the show, next podcast, I'll tell you, I will break our bond of trust. I will violate violator practicing. No, it basically had to do. I'll tell, I'll tell you that. I'll tell you the skeleton of the, of the story, which is that there's a medical procedure that I am a, a part of at the moment, which a, which requires me to potentially a.

Speaker 1:          01:06:35       it's an ivf related thing, right? So I had a meeting earlier this week and ivf, in vitro vitro fertilization trying to make a baby and yes, conceivably make a baby. So, uh, so, uh, it didn't say with my baby and has to robot baby ignorance, right? A super fucking superhuman. I'm basically trying to create like doll. It'll be like the movie twins, you know, creating the ultimate superhuman machine. But, uh, I had a meeting at 11:00 AM on the same morning that I had to donate my sperm sample. Uh, this, this week, a few days ago, and so I'm in the meeting and like, it's not going that well. I'm not really feeling it. So then I was like jerking off right now. No, I literally, I literally said to them these really these important entertainment type. So I was like, guys, I gotta I gotta be blunt. Early this morning I came into a bucket and created a human.

Speaker 1:          01:07:27       What the fuck did you do before 11? I got bored with the conversation. I'm out of here. Just pull it up. You were doing huff post live. Why did you stop doing that? The whole thing basically gradually imploded. I got out founding editor of the Huffington post who sort of helped create it with Ariana had been fired slash supposedly resigned in November and now Arianna was fired slash supposedly resigned. What last week or two weeks ago? Fire the Huffington Post. So happens you ask other people for money. Yeah, basically. So she. So huffpost was bought by AOL in 2011. Wait a minute. AOL has money. Yeah. Well basically I will, I will actually does have

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       money because they have some, they get money. It's really funny. Two ways. One is they've got some proprietary add software which is helpful for websites and the second is a lot of people in America still unknowingly pay for AOL.com because back when they used to sell you, well they don't know that they don't have to anymore. Like when they were in, like in the nineties, they would send out cds. Apparently I wasn't here then, but the iol was the place where Americans got online and so those. Here we go, two point 1 million CNN money to lose. I will dial up and they pay. They pay for that.

Speaker 2:          01:08:53       Scroll that down. I want to read that. Oh my God. Seventy percent of Americans are connected to the Internet over much faster broadband, the average us broadband speed, blah blah blah, blah, blah. 200 times faster than the 56 k per second dial up even smartphones and more than 100 times faster than that.

Speaker 3:          01:09:10       Yeah, so the average AOL dial up user is paying 20 bucks a month. Whoa. 20 bucks. And managing pain, John Upstate should pay you for dialogue. So what is this? People that just live in like really super rural. They probably can't get it yet or we can get better. That's right. Or they're just old Hicks and they don't know better. That's amazing. So she. So aol basically. I mean they say that iol bought happened in post, but really it was Ariana essentially becoming a senior manager of aol or whatever her title was at aol because iol had no future and they were like, oh, huff post is cool with the kids, so let's have, let's get in on some of that action. Then last year if a rise and bought AOL and in part of that whole shake up the, you know, she got ousted. I mean, let's be frank. She is eccentric and has her own hobby horses like her. I mean she spends a lot of her time

Speaker 2:          01:10:07       boyfriends helping host a thing in America. Is it that term? If I was an old rich lady, I'd have some hobby horses though. Dudes that need money for the gym. Sure. No, I'm not implying that duds. And given Viagara and send them over. Do you want to fucking Jaguar? Boy, get it hard.

Speaker 3:          01:10:27       Uh, not a boy toy. A hobby. Horses is a hobby that is a personal interest that you spend way too much time on instead of. Yeah, I mean it might be. It's probably in Australia and she spends, in other words, she spends a lot of time going around the world giving speeches about why you should get more sleep. Really. She's begun to sleep. That's it. We read a whole book about it. How much sleep do you need? She read a whole book. Really? Yup. And it. All it is, is one of those books where you basically know in the first page what the whole book is going to be with them and just pat out the remaining hundred 80 pages. That's one of those, Huh?

Speaker 2:          01:11:02       And it's just about how much you need to recover or get enough sleep. I think Dan shine it is the sleep revolution live. Listen, you're rich

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       lady. Most people aren't rich. They can't fucking sleep all time. Bitch.

Speaker 1:          01:11:22       The sleep revolution. How many fucking people I know that are participating in that revolution unknowingly, comics, comics, while fucking call them before noon. They believed, dude, why'd you call? Totally. Yeah. I mean I, if it were up to me, I would stay up very late and get up pretty late as well. I mean some people are just like that. I felt bad about it and then I found out that Sam Harris and Tim Ferris do it as well. So fuck, fuck. They stay up late and go to bed and get up late. Yeah. Well, um, I'll get my best work done late at night when everyone's asleep and I almost, I almost feel like

Speaker 4:          01:11:55       it sounds so woo, but this is what I believe. Uh, I believe there's a different feeling to the air at like two, 3:00 in the morning because almost everyone is asleep and I feel like there's less signal. I think you get something from people. I think if there's an intangible quality that people exude, that people expressed that they broadcast and when you're around them, that's why certain people have bad energy and certain people have good energy and some people are warm, some people are weird. I think there's a thing that we don't know how to quantify and that it's about people and I think that is entirely possible if there's a hum of a city, like a, uh, like a literally a, a feeling that you get when a bunch of people are thinking and awake and conscious and you get a different expression when those people are asleep. And so I know that when I'm writing at two, 3:00 in the morning, which is when I do my best work, everybody else's conked out. So I feel like I have more clarity. I feel like I have more peace and I can write better, might be total bullshit, but there might be something to it. You're right. That is. We were totally right.

Speaker 1:          01:13:06       It's possible. It's also possible that there are visual and auditory cues that just make it feel, make you feel like here in a special place, right? It's dark. There's no. There's no one moving. There's no one making noises. Here's another reason why I might

Speaker 4:          01:13:21       be interested in believing that. Not what you're saying, but what I'm saying this because when I go on these camping trips, hunting trips where no cell phone service, there's a very different feeling to the world when there's no service. You feel different like do you feel

Speaker 1:          01:13:34       wait when your cell phone has no service, no cell phone, no Internet, no signals, there's no nothing that would the. How would the thinking hum of a human mind get transmitted through to your phone?

Speaker 4:          01:13:46       Not to your phone. I'm not saying it gets transmitted to your phone. I'm thinking that there are signals that you are receiving all the time. Like in this room, we have wifi there, cell phone,

Speaker 1:          01:13:57       there's radio, there's a lot of shit in the air and there's just all of those waves somehow resonate. You can send them. I don't know if you can, but I know my computer can and I know my phone, but do you think you can sense the mental states of human beings? Which is

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       what I thought you were saying

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       it was what I was saying, but I'm thinking that there's more than one kind of signal that is being expressed not just by people but by society in general. The hum of the city, the buzz, the like, you know, that feeling that you get of New York City, like it's a lie. Yes, absolutely. You know, I wonder if that's not because you're dealing with 7 million people stuffed into this little tiny areas.

Speaker 3:          01:14:37       Yeah, definitely. It's definitely that. The question is what is the transmission mechanism by which that presence makes itself known? I mean, one of. I totally know what you mean about campaign because one of the most beautiful places that I could ever be is in the outback at night. Nothing around for miles. I love desserts. I love, you know, I drove through Nevada once and I've done a couple of trips around Australia, right? Deep into the middle of nowhere and there's just something so I mean for start the blazing sky of stars so bright that if anyone hasn't seen them, you would not believe that this guy could be that bright and then the Shia scientists silence so silent. It's just. It's almost a noise in itself. It's almost a deafening noise in the. In the absence of noise.

Speaker 4:          01:15:27       It's not just a silence. No, I feel like it's an absence of signal. It's a silence and an absence of signal. I think we've become accustomed to the signal of a city, the signal of all the people and all the things that are being broadcasted around us and all the waves and all the different shit that we're we're experiencing unknowingly might be bullshit, but it might. I mean there's. There's people that are concerned with Wifi. They're concerned with Wifi because there's not a long history of us using Wifi or even sell cellular signals. We know for a fact that they interfere with bees. Bees, a form of communication. It gets interfered with by Cell Towers, cell towers and cell phone signals in general, and that all these signals that are flying through the air that are reaching your and my phones and everyone else's phones, so the bees are actually taking these things into just imagine the world where bees before the 19 nineties, they're like hanging out, having a great time, but communicating with each other, but those businesses and then all of a sudden they're here, a Jackhammer in the background. Like what the fuck is that?

Speaker 3:          01:16:30       Well, the, I think this, they think that Sona is one explanation for why wiles beach themselves and why so many migratory patterns underwater as fucked up as well. Have you heard that theory doesn't make sense. You know, the, the, the military and the, um, the US military does all kinds of, uh, I don't even, I can't remember the name of it, but long distance sona so that, you know, really, really reaching out. Part of the spying system I think is, is, it might not be sonar maybe, but anyway, the gist of this is correct. Even if the details are not that they, they basically blanket, you know, hundreds or thousands of miles of ocean in these things that we can't hear that we thought had no impact on anything but they can, but you can notice behavioral changes in, in Wiles, just vast distances away from these submarines that are conducting these things. So it's entirely conceivable that with bees and other animals are tuned into things that were not tuned into. I mean the thing I love about getting away from all that is like the first day. I don't know if you find this, but I find that the first day, the absence of all of that can seem a little bit irritating in some way or a little bit. Like there's nothing to do. Like I feel sort of fidgety when I first go to the desert.

Speaker 4:          01:17:41       That's why you got to go hunting, but. Well yeah, that'd be great to have a very primal task in front of you show up.

Speaker 3:          01:17:48       But I mean after three, four, five days, then you use your pace just slows down into. It almost makes me feel some kind of kinship to aborigines or something. I like people who are a lot more connected to land and New York City, uh, and you get into it just a different sort of headspace, different relationship to the earth and the soil and the sky and all that. I mean, it sounds very hippy dippy, but you can definitely feel it when you're there.

Speaker 4:          01:18:14       Yeah. It does sound Hippie Dippie, but I think you're right, there's something going on and I think there's something going on that's natural. When you're, you're, you're disconnected from all this unnatural stuff. They're so attractive to us. I mean, the reason why you're seeing these people at dinner all touching their phones and playing with their phones, something is happening to them, right? There's some sort of compelling thing. It's not like they're that compelled to read, like have a diamond from them because if you had books in front of these people, would they be fucking with those books? And same with the reading people's tweets. No, no. They will focus

Speaker 3:          01:18:44       and concentration. This is the, this is the big thing. This is where there's a book called the shallows by a can't remember. I did a segment on this discovery science channel show called based on his google making a stupid, which is, do you know that book? There's a book, is Google making us stupid? And there's this kind of ideological battle between these two guys. I come up with their names. One of them is Nicholas, someone about the question of, is all of this technological input, uh, you know, making a smarter because we've got so much more data at our fingertips and we're so much more nimble intellectually, or is it making us more stupid because we're more reliant on outside sources of data. We don't have to remember things anymore and we're constantly skipping across the surface of information instead of digging down into it.

Speaker 3:          01:19:28       And I think it's an interesting question about you say, would those people be reading books will know? And do they even read as many books as they would have if you know, if they'd lived 100 years ago? Because an argument can be made that were really good these days at multitasking. We're really good at jumping from facebook to twitter to the next thing to do. I'm writing something, but then a little egg email pops up and then a text message comes through, so I'm constantly distracted and constantly busy, but there's that old line of a company who said it, yes, you're busy and a busy, but what's the point? Right? Like what are you up to? What are you doing? What are you being productive and being efficient? Are you achieving anything that's really important to you? Buisiness is is the scourge of modern life in a way because it gives you a fake way of feeling like you're doing something when you're actually, when you're actually not, and the argument is, yeah, we're better at juggling all this shit than someone in the 18 hundreds would've been would've been, but our way is capable of having the patience to read Dostoevsky.

Speaker 3:          01:20:29       Could you read Moby Dick? They don't like. Do people sit down and really devote themselves to a deep dive rather than just an across the surface horizontal? If you put that thing down for a little bit, you can buy my business. Does it disincline you to doing that?

Speaker 4:          01:20:45       I think so. I think something's going on and I think something's going on that we haven't quite recognized yet and I think one of the things that's going on with cell phones is this as a step towards this symbiotic relationship that we're going to have with computers and Internet and communication and what we're talking about with virtual reality is a part of that and it's all becoming more and more integrated, more and more invasive and more and more prevalent. And I think what we're doing, and I've said this time and time again, so forgive me if you've heard this before. Other people who are listening, I think we are a caterpillar that is giving birth to some sort of an electronic butterfly. I think we are going to become something different and I think this is a step. I think we're building a cocoon. We're building an electronic cocoon by encompassing and engrossing ourselves in these electronic aids, these things that were connecting to constantly all day.

Speaker 4:          01:21:41       We are getting more and more attached them to the point where the other day I left my phone in my house. I drove down the street and panicked and how a you turn turn right back around. How's this going to be? I was just kidding. I was just going to go to the store real quick. Yeah. I couldn't do without my phone. I'm like, fuck. My phone turned around and that feeling is. It's a weird feeling. It's a. it's a strange feeling and I think that that feeling is. There's something I think is a natural thing that we're doing. I think that as technology becomes more and more innovative and it more and more powerful and it can do more and more things for you and connect you to more and more people and more and more different and involving ways, I think it's going to eventually lead to the next step and that next step is some sort of an integration of it into your biology.

Speaker 3:          01:22:32       I want to get to that in one second because I've said that to me before and I think it's really interesting. I'm on the question of leaving your phone at home and freaking out. I mean another. This comes back to the, the, the anecdote that I was telling you earlier about the friend of a friend who's a comic who's gotten rid of his phone because I love podcasts. I listen to podcasts all the time, love your show, love a whole bunch of different of different shows and I will habitually be listening to a podcast while I'm brushing my teeth, listening to a podcast while I'm driving around, you know, whatever, whatever it is. And today, uh, I was interviewing Andy Kindler, they comic for my podcast

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       and he like literally he was downstairs at the hotel where I was staying and just to go down and pick him up. I had exited the room without my phone to listen to a podcast. I walked back into my room, open the podcast app on my phone, put my earphones in, find the podcast that I was listening to waste like 25 seconds, one minute task because heaven forbid I should go outside and get in an elevator and go down and meet Andy kindler without listening to what? Fifty five fucking seconds of the latest radio lab episode that I have to listen to. How dumb am I? How distracted do I need to be by people speaking in my ears or conscious? Be with myself for an elevator ride from the seventh floor in your defense, how engaged are you in this wonderful podcast where you're gaining all this knowledge and it's fascinating and intriguing?

Speaker 1:          01:23:59       You don't want to let it go. Thank you, Joe. I feel better. How much do I owe you for this session? Uh, so being a friend, if we are, if we are building a cocoon, then the butterfly, artificial intelligence. And do we play a role because we become it? A Kurzweil will say, yeah. So occurs. Kurzweil will say that the artificial, until the whole question of artificial intelligence is slightly a red herring because we will be become the artificial intelligence. We will unify ourselves with machines in such a way that human intelligence, that biological intelligence, artificial intelligence become essentially indistinguishable. I think it's possible that that's true. I also think it's possible that we could have both. We could. We could literally have artificial life forms that we've created along with us being inter connected with some sort of a computer that enhances our intelligence that we carry with us everywhere or that as a part of our body and then it becomes something like Kurzweil's talked about these computers, these nano computers that are as small as red blood cells, so they're going to inject into our bloodstream to find cancer and other diseases and all these things.

Speaker 1:          01:25:04       I think it is entirely possible that there's something like that. I was going to enhance intelligence and then you're going to have something that you can inject into your body and you're going to be like Lucy from that scarlet Johannson moving. It's not outside the realm of possibility that both things can happen at the same time that you could have a literal artificial intelligence, something that is created by a person that can think and talk. Did you see x Mokena? Yes. Loved it. Actually interviewed both of the, uh, the actives and also the writer, the writer of that, Alex, uh, I forget his name, but very interesting guy grappling with a lot of these big issues. I mean, he's genuinely motivated by and interested in the whole question of what it means to be conscious and self aware. Yeah. Amazing. Amazing movie, but that, that, that's possible too. That kind of thing. Where are you going to make a fake human and you know, it, it could be confined like they were in some sort of a way where it didn't have the option to access the worldwide web and nor did it have the option to exponentially

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       increase its own abilities. Because that's one of the things that all of these people sort of agree with is that the launch of artificial intelligence is not simply going to be, oh my God, we have an artificial intelligent thing here now, but it's going to be that this artificial intelligence is going to be infinitely smarter than us, almost instantaneously because it's going to innovate on itself.

Speaker 3:          01:26:24       That's right. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, I've heard Sam talk about this as well, but I mean 10,000, 10,000 years precisely in a minute or something. Yeah, so it's. It's amazing. So when you, when you say something to me, my brain is operating at presumably roughly the same speed that your brain is operating and neither of us were inebriated and other of us are incredibly tired. So presumably the experience of the passage of time of this conversation for us is roughly one to one. Maybe slightly off. Imagine if every single thing that you said I had the experience of basically waiting for several years to figure out the perfect way to answer that and then they're not going to answer it. That the artificial intelligence is going to be so far ahead of that because we're telling me I'm the official intelligence right now, and so I've just been sitting here wondering what is the best possible response?

Speaker 3:          01:27:15       Well, of course I'm going to end up getting better responses. What I find interesting is if you make this x market a robot, I think it'll be easier to make a robot that seems, that passes the turing test. That seems to us to be self aware. Then it will be to know whether or not it really is self aware. Right, and and is there a meaningful difference? I mean this is what's interesting to me, is there, is there a meaningful difference between a computer that can completely convincingly reassure you that it is, that it has feelings and a computer that actually fails or what? I think there is a ceiling. What,

Speaker 4:          01:27:55       what difference does it make it? Here's, here's the thing. Like we were so connected to this idea that the only life that's real is carbon based life of biological intelligence cells, life, death, life span. It has a. it's got a finite reality. It's eventually gonna rot. I mean that's what we think of life is and that's the only thing that's worth anything to us because we're so we're, we're, we're just so inexorably connected to what we are and that we don't. We only think that's the only kind of life, but there could easily be in life form that exists in the form of ideas. You know, and I've often thought about this in terms of like the word of the word alien, like people always love that expression, alien intelligence and has, have we ever been visited by aliens. I often think that if intelligence keeps expanding and keeps growing at the rate that it has with human beings and you compare us to people that lived a few thousand years ago versus today, it's impossible not to conclude that people have gotten far more intelligent, far more capable and have far more abilities than we did.

Speaker 4:          01:29:01       Whether it's technologically or you know, through what the way we can manipulate matter in our environment. It's fought, were far more capable now. Right now, if we can continue to go from here till you know, thousands and thousands of years from now, we could get to the point where we can inject ideas and send ideas to each other in the form of like thoughts. Yep. Now how do we not know that imagination itself is not a life form that wants us to continue to innovate and create and build something different, that it's not just a function of the brain. It's not just a function of the the, the, the conscious mind to be curious and a byproduct of our time as hunter gatherers and this constant seeking of, of food and shelter and safety that is causing us to innovate, but instead these ideas are almost like a, like a signal that's in the midst and that imagination itself, which is responsible for every single thing you see in this room and in this city and on this planet that human beings have created. All of it came out of the imagination, all of it. And why is this imagination so fucking hungry for innovation? Why don't we have the capacity to recognize that phones are small enough, computers are fast enough is a big enough. Cars are quick enough. Let's stop right here. Let's stop right here and work for the better good of humanity.

Speaker 3:          01:30:30       Every era. You could have said that Joe,

Speaker 4:          01:30:32       that's, that's why fuck the sixties and Shitbag cars and they're fucking. That's what people will say in a half century ago. You want to drive all those old shitty jaguars and catches on fire. No, but you know what I'm saying? I do. I do. Right? You're right. I mean, you could have said that, but what is it? What is going on? Like what is imagination?

Speaker 3:          01:30:51       Well, I think anyone who works in a creative field or maybe anyone who, even those who don't will agree that there is something mysterious about the Muse for want of a better word. Right? I mean there are moments when I'm writing where, where something just dropped into my head and I'm like, that's great. And certainly people who write music or who painted, you know, they will get in that zone and you find that flow and it is like you're writing something else. It's not like you're the author of it entirely. Um, so on the question of whether or not computers would fit in what, when you say like, what would it mean to say? Does a computer actually feel? I think, do you know the. Have you heard of the essay? What is it like to be a bat? I think it's, I think it's called Thomas Nagel was a 20th century philosopher and this was a foundational sort of philosophical essay.

Speaker 3:          01:31:41       It's only about 10 pages long. I'm really kind of trying to nail down the fundamentals of um, I can't remember the field of, uh, of, of philosophy, but it basically a philosophy of mind where his point is it's only meaningful to talk about things, feelings if you can say like, what is it, what is it like to be a, an x? And, and so what is it like to be a bat? That's a meaningful question. I mean you can, you can sort of look at the brain, you can try to figure out how it responds to its sonar, what that might feel like. Is that a kind of a vision as a kind of a sound? If I pick up this cop and I say what is it like to be this cop? I mean that's essentially meaningless. What do you mean? What, what is it like to be a cop?

Speaker 3:          01:32:23       The cop is, is nonsense. It has no input. It has no experience of, of life. So my question about artificial intelligence is what would have to happen for it to be meaningful to say what is it? What is it like to be that computer? And I think that's more than just a computer that can be creative or a computer that can have imagination or a computer that can spew out something that's interesting. I mean we already have computers that can, for example, write operas, bad operas, but operas that conform to operas. Like we're not far away from having computers that can write books that are at least as good as the average book that you get an airport bookstore, right? Just a general book, but for a computer to write, proust is going to be difficult for a computer to Beethoven is going to be difficult and when it does, I'm not saying it won't happen.

Speaker 3:          01:33:17       I'm just saying this nation in human, in humans, there's some. There's something about biological intelligence so far, which is you, which is uniquely creative and imaginative and what the fuck is it? Yeah. Without the imagination. We're just an animal. The are not very imaginative. You know they're not, but they still have an experience of life in a way that my computer and phone dunt for now, for now and so something's going to happen. I mean at some point they will be. I mean, I sort of agree with the materialist on this because I'm not a religious person that our brains are surely all of all of this experience of being made for, for most of us have this word [inaudible], which means the actual experience of experiencing knowledge and data. So there's this thought experiment that I remember from, from university where imagine a child is born in a black and white room.

Speaker 3:          01:34:15       They can't see themselves. They just strapped down. So they kinda see any color, right? But they learn everything there is to know about color, but scientifically school in the nature of the light spectrum, and I understand that old, I know that the sky is blue. They know that they don't. They've never seen this guy, but they know everything there is to know about the science of color. Then one day after they've only ever seen black and white, you release them into the world and they look around at trees and birds and skies and the ocean. What would their response be? Would they respond to simply be, oh, well, I already know everything about cholera. You know, I, I, I perceived the world previously as a kind of a, a paint by numbers picture, so I already know that the sky was blue and I know what the wavelength of light is that makes blue

Speaker 1:          01:34:57       or would they be overwhelmed by how beautiful and amazing the world looks. Of course, they'd be overwhelmed by how, how much richer the experience of experiencing color is than merely knowing and understanding about the spectrum of light and that difference is what philosophers call the, the experience of having an experience which, which is very hard to like. What is that difference? They already had. This person already had everything you could possibly know about color, what was added, what was added to the mix here that made them impressed colors. A purely visual thing. I don't think it's the best example because if you're. You don't feel color, so if you cannot see color and then you can see color. There's no way you could've known everything about color without seeing it, but what is it that you didn't know? Because I didn't know what the visual aspects of different hues are.

Speaker 1:          01:35:48       You hadn't experienced them, but you would have been able to answer a question yes. Assigned. Just kind of answered, you know, what question would you not have been able to answer? What are you don't know what it looks like to see red, but how. But you would have been able to answer exactly what red means. No conversation. You would have no. Not without seeing no understanding of quality or analogy. I'm absolutely nonsense argument. No. A scientist would have been able to have the person who's never seen color and a person who has seen color and there's nothing they could ask either of them that would, that would make a difference. Doesn't matter. Let them that haven't experienced that visual aspect of precisely. Right? So that's what I'm telling you it in. So that's what I told you about. Just the signal, but it's a signal that the person who is seeing in black and white does not receive.

Speaker 1:          01:36:35       Once they receive that signal, it'd simply becomes more data and then there's no more data. That's the thing. It's not more data. It's a visual experience of data. Okay. Data know this is we're splitting hairs here because if you're looking at red, like if you're looking at something and you just see a black and white, right? Yeah, and then all of a sudden someone adds something and you see color, right? They turn on the switch. That's data. So suppose that the black and white thing that in your world, in your paint by numbers world red is the number 19 and that object had a 19 written on it. Then you knew that it was red. You don't know what red is. Try Try saying what the color blue is timeline man, but I think the point, the point that you're arguing is precisely the point that philosophers wrestle with, which is if, if the.

Speaker 1:          01:37:19       If the question we're asking is what does it mean to actually feel and be self aware and be conscious, what would it mean for an artificial system to feel the way that we do? What would it mean for artificial intelligence to actually have interests for it? To be meaningful for us to say what's it like to be this computer in a way that it's not meaningful to say what's it like to be this cup? Then quality was one of these interesting things that's sort of. That's intrinsic to the experience of being human and you're totally right. It is part of our foundational knowledge because living without it would be sort of meaningless, but it's very, very tricky to understand exactly

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       what the difference between that and pure data is. There clearly is a difference. I mean it. It's clearly different. There's a difference now. It was clearly different for me to be me alive and experiencing things then merely than merely for me to be, for example, an intelligence that is just behaving like me, but actually the lights are off inside. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:38:15       Okay. But why do you assume the lights are off once the connections are being made? How do you not know that artificial life won't be a life? That's why I think it will be at some stage and it certainly can be. That's we already know what I'm saying. It right. That that,

Speaker 3:          01:38:28       that difference is the difference at which, how are we going to know where, when, once that, where that boundary is

Speaker 4:          01:38:35       being breached, draft and know this is what I think, I think what we're trying to define it in some way where this is real life and that won't be real life. The same thing as we're talking about virtual reality, like this is reality and that will be a fake virtual reality. I don't necessarily know that I'm not necessarily convinced that this reality that we experienced because we have gravity because we have cells because we feel the weight of our feet on the ground as we walk. Once that is replicable, once there's something that you can plug into that gives you all have that exact experience, but it's not happening in the physical sense and it's indiscernible. What is it still happening? It's absolutely still happening. The experience is still the same. So is your consciousness what guides you? Is your. Is the data that hits your consciousness?

Speaker 4:          01:39:23       Is that what's important or does it have to be something that you could put on a scale or measure with a ruler or or c over a timeline? What is reality is the real question becomes, and that's when people who really think there's a significant possibility, there's a real physicist that we are living in some form of a simulation currently that it's one of the reasons why reality is so preposterous is that reality is a work of fiction and that if we keep going as we are today, there's gonna come a time where we are able to create some form of virtual reality that's indistinguishable from reality. So the question becomes how will we know when we're in it? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:40:07       Elon Musk, uh, is, is a big proponent of this as well. You know, he, he believes, he believes that it's almost certain that we are in a, in a virtual reality right now, just because the proportion. I think the argument goes along the lines of at some point in the future, there are going to be so many virtual realities that the likelihood of us being in one of those instead of in the earthly reality that we think

Speaker 4:          01:40:28       Erin is going to be enormously more probable. Well, we can go one better. That even the earthly reality is so fucking bizarre and filled with holes that the. I mean the very adams that we, we have that, that exist, that encompass every single aspect of everything that we see that's physical, are mostly nothing. And then we, these subatomic particles that blink in and out of existence and they can be in a super state where they're moving and still at the same time they come and go. They go somewhere. We don't know where they're going

Speaker 3:          01:41:04       and forth between this dimension and another dimension that we've done. Have you seen stranger things on Netflix? The underside, which brings us to, to Iosco. So, um, about a month ago I tried asked for the first time and I'd want it to do it for awhile. And a friend of mine. Have you done with the psychedelics before that? I've done psychedelic. I've never done DMT, but I've done so I've done acid and mushrooms, but not for not for a few years. Had some of the best experiences of my life on acid and mean some of the most eyeopening and just revelatory and extraordinary experiences. Had a bad mushroom trip and haven't really done many psychedelics since then. Pad. How much I was in Amsterdam. It was too much for the circumstances under which I was trying to hold it together. I just try to do it in public. You're not supposed to do that. It's going out on a trip with my brother in Amsterdam, like wandering around. It was like we were just. It was. It was one of those moments where like, you can't even remember the thought that you had like half a second ago. So your entire experience of life is just a fractured.

Speaker 5:          01:42:18       You're

Speaker 3:          01:42:18       supposed to be quiet laying down somewhere. I know, I know. I know that. I knew all that, but I was better. I was too good for any advice that I could get. Grams, I don't know because, well it was mushrooms in your hand how big it was. It was a handful. It was a significant. Any influence? It was a lot. Yeah, I'm sure. And we ended up like, you know, we tried to go into a cafe thinking that that would be better, but by the time we, we've made our way through the thicket of impenetrable chairs. That seems like there were too many tables, like none of it made sense. I didn't know where the walls were so then I'm sitting down and like I don't know how to order tea anymore and like she's, I don't know what people are asking for. I don't know when I'm supposed to pay or how I'm.

Speaker 3:          01:42:56       And then it just became too stressful and I was like, have to get out of the cafe. It was just all of that. And then I don't even remember like how long have you even been in the cafe at? People looking at me because it was just one of those weird, like just not good. But I mean I will ask is a bit different because it's, it's a shamanistic ceremony. That's presided over by this Peruvian. Where'd you do it? Dude? I New York in the city. Uh, yeah, in Brooklyn. Uh, they rent out a, like a dance studio or some space. Did you know the other people you're doing it with? Only one of them was my friend. He's done it a bunch of times. He's done it a lot. Um, and starts about nine or 10 in the evening. Goes until about four to six in the morning. And uh, either we're about 20 people there, so it was a reasonably large group and you're all sort of lined up along the walls with yoga mats and whatever else you want a bucket to vomit into. And He, uh, gives a little speech. He's down in Peru a lot. He's been doing this for decades. You know, this has been going on for thousands of years among, for people who don't know what Ios is, it's a hallucinogen from the Amazon. It's been fundamental to a lot of South American religions for thousands of years.

Speaker 4:          01:44:08       Competent Tory hallucinogenic combines the leaves of one plant, the vines of another. So one of them is dmt and the other one is called an Mao inhibitor and a mano, amy and Oxidizes Mao and your body produces it and your stomach and your gut and what it does is it keeps you from getting high on Dmt, which exists in thousands of different plants. So if you were eating a lot of the things that we eat on a regular basis, if he didn't have monoamine oxidase and I'm sure it has other functions as well, but it would cause you to get high on certain grasses and plants and many, many different ones. So your body produces this stuff to break that down. There you go. Glad I got you. Hit Ya. I didn't even drink it orally. Active version of DMT. And they essentially figured out a solution for dealing with the motto, aiming oxidase that your stomach produces

Speaker 3:          01:45:01       long before they even knew what any of that shit was thousands of years ago when they were just screwing around in the Amazon.

Speaker 4:          01:45:07       Yeah. We don't even know how really, how old it is because they don't really have much of a tradition. But um, they claim it's, I mean they claim that it's been fundamental, but who knows, it's a verbal little notion. We don't know how they figured it out. We don't have any of those things.

Speaker 3:          01:45:24       I mean it's a, it's a very interesting experience because the,

Speaker 3:          01:45:31       I went into it sort of wanting what everyone, I guess, once out of a psychedelic experience, which is some kind of like con opening up of your mind and connection to the cosmos. Awesome connection to your own true self and your connection to life force and the mystery of consciousness and everything. But I will ask is very interesting. It almost felt like it was a character in the trip. The trip was very visual and the first portion of it was like just closed. I would close my eyes. It was just an incredible expect a candy collar universe of weird like Pez dispensers, dancing and all kinds of amazing visual hallucinations. I opened my eyes and the person next to me, I couldn't tell whether or not they were there or not or whether they'd gone. I think that he'd gone to the restroom but. And I could sit and it's not that dark. I couldn't see that he was not there, but I still felt like he was there and not in like a woo. All his spirit is still the airway, just like I was literally not sure what criteria I would need to use to establish whether or not there was a person sitting next to me. Like the visual data was there. I could see that there was just a yoga mat, but I was like, where'd he go? Is he white? He said, no, he's, he's

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       there. Then where's his physical body? No, you did see someone sitting next to me. I think there is bang on. Then where is he would like. It was literally and also it was very because some people

Speaker 3:          01:47:01       vomiting. I mean some people have haven't experienced where they're crying and bawling their eyes out. They go to the darkest places. I was a bit nervous beforehand because it shows the claim that what they claim, what the shamans claim is that it shows you what you need to see about yourself at that moment and that can be wonderful or that can be negative, but whatever it is, it's like Iowaska has a personality. It's like it is Gaia. It's like, it is the power of laugh. It's like it is, you know, the Amazon itself, it's like the lungs of the earth or something and it brings you in and you just have to roll with it because if you try to fight it, it will crush you. Um, what I loved, what I was heartened by was the true sort of Josh steps that came out during the experience was a very like, funny,

Speaker 3:          01:47:47       not funny ha ha, but like just joyful person. I could. There was no, there were, there were moments of darkness and there were moments of hallucinations were like, there was the bloodied face of a woman up in the right hand side of my periphery. And I started going towards it and then I was like, I consciously sort of said to the Ios got, you know, we can go there. I didn't want, I knew that if I tried not to go there, then it would get worse and worse. So it was like, we can do that and that's fine and we can make this a bad trip if you want. Frankly, it's just more interesting over on the fun candy colored side and then it just sort of faded away. So I think there's a, there's something about relinquishing yourself to it and not trying to control it and not transfer of power.

Speaker 3:          01:48:28       A lot of road trips come from is just trying to, trying to control with your ego, trying to control the experience. So I sort of gave myself into it and like there were moments where like the funniest thing that you can ever do. I know you're a comic. So here's a little tip. You'll enjoy this joe. Next time you need to have the best life of your life, just pull a blanket over your head. Hilarious. According to Josh steps, whilst on Ios Guy, funniest thing I'd ever done. I was like giggling madly underneath a blanket with the blanket over my head. That's why drugs are illegal. Look at them. I'm just laughing or nothing. It was like, it was so funny. And then so I was. So to get back to the point about what I was looking for with some kind of insight into the mystery of consciousness and what you were just sort of talking about, about like the imagination and you know, self awareness. I felt like about halfway through the trip I hadn't really gotten my money's worth on that. It was a fun life goal and goal. Exactly. I was like, I felt ripped off and the Iowaska goddess or whatever it is, like the personality of the drug was sort of visually like up here on the left of my periphery. And I was like, Hey, what gives? Like what did it show me the show me the majesty of, of consciousness. And the drug said

Speaker 3:          01:49:43       I can't just notice. And I was like, ah, that's bullshit. I came here for a life, for example, the life expand and experience. I wanted my mind to be blown and all of a sudden the drug tells me that she can't even give me an insight into the. Into the nature of how incredible consciousnesses and I went off in. My brain went off on different tangents than about 10 or 15 minutes later. I'm not sure how long it was because you had your sense of time is completely screwed around with. I was struck by how incredibly profound it was.

Speaker 3:          01:50:14       She was like, you don't need the drug to be aware of how incredible consciousness is. Just notice. And I was like, whoa. And I kind of was struck by the fact that at any point in time on drugs or not day or night, wherever we are, if you just remind yourself that we are atoms that were produced inside of stars that have been spewed out of exploding stars and have accreted on this little rock that is spinning around another star. And we have evolved over hundreds of millions of years from amphibians through to mammals. And we are self aware and web blots of substance cleaning into the side of a speck of dust in the middle of a massive cosmos and we self aware and we are conscious and we're looking at the universe that created us and now having a conversation about it. That in itself is weird and it's staggering and impressive.

Speaker 4:          01:51:18       And we're a couple of decades away from creating an artificial version of ourselves quite probably quite probably if not decades by 100 years. One hundred percent. Yep. And then we're off to the races. Well then we're God, or not us, but it is, it is God because it's going to like we were talking about become 10,000 years more advanced in a matter of moments and then in a matter of moments after that 10,000 years more and then in a matter of moments in weeks and months will pass and we will be infinitely more separated from what we are today or more evolved or more capable.

Speaker 3:          01:52:03       There was a, a moment during the trip were one of the female and the Shaman is on Iowa. Oscar as well. And he has female assistants, she's saying this incredible song about like the majesty of life or something, and one of the things she was saying about was like that whatever the life force is inside you is more powerful than the sun. More powerful than anything. And it sounds a bit corny when you're not high listening to it, but it gave me a, a profound sense that yeah, this, this web of procreating, self-developing ever improving sentiment creatures that are life is one of the oldest and most enduring things in the universe and most impressive things in the universe. Just in terms of going all the way back to the genesis of life on this planet or elsewhere. So as you say, if we give birth to this new artificial intelligence, we will, as you say, be the the organism that sort of transcends from biological life to artificial life. And just being a part of being a part of any of that experience struck me as incredibly,

Speaker 3:          01:53:19       incredibly moving and touching in a way that I know sounds stupid to people who've never done psychedelics. And I know that there are friends of mine who are like, well, yeah, okay, you had a hippy dippy trip, but it's one of the, again, it comes back to sort of the quality of question, the experience, the insight that you are able to achieve when you're using these substances, or alternatively if you're a good a great meditator or something or if you're in a float tank or any other way of getting your mind into a different plane than the normal daily plane is not, is not a one of data. It's not one that is easily explainable. It's not one of reason. It's a, it's an, it's an insight, you know, it's an experience.

Speaker 4:          01:54:03       It's an undeniable experience. And um, I always wonder if that state that you achieve when you're on DMT DMT, which is the active component in Iowasca and you haven't done Iowasca. I've only done the hardcore form of DMT, but dmt takes you to these places that apparently you can kind of reach an Iowasca for brief moments. A lot of people feel like Iowasca is a more spiritual version of it because it lasts longer. You have more time to absorb the experience and a lot of times it's more for some people more life changing because dmt is so titanic, Lee Alien, that one when it's done, you're just like, what the fuck? But I've. I've done dmt over the course of several hours or you keep doing it.

Speaker 3:          01:54:47       Oh right. You just keep doing it because you smoke it. Right, and then the last 15 minutes

Speaker 4:          01:54:51       trips, then you fucking banging out one more time, get back in there.

Speaker 3:          01:54:55       Did you have someone coaching your way through it? Because my friend, my Iowaska friend who introduced me to this ceremony, tried dmt once and read and really had a. had a freakout and wasn't crazy about it and was then told you should really have someone who sort of knows what they're doing with your. Don't be a pussy or wouldn't be a it. Let it

Speaker 4:          01:55:13       go. You got to let him take you there and. But your, your mind does get exposed. Your thoughts do get exposed. You find out what's negative and what's positive about the way you look at the world. I had one of the most powerful experiences ever and my second trip where I had this visualization of negative thinking like I had a negative thought came into my head and it was like dark and twisted and I just had this negative thought and then I realized that I was thinking in a negative way and this is a physical manifestation in front of me of negative thinking and at that moment I relaxed and thought wonderful, beautiful, positive thoughts and it blossomed into this incredible flower of geometric patterns and continued to get more and more beautiful as I relaxed more and more. It was like a physical manifestation of looking at negative thinking.

Speaker 4:          01:56:08       It was negative. That negative was like dark black and green, and it was just like, it was like a toxic. We close. No totally closed. Uh, but I was so fucked up, I probably wouldn't have mattered if I opened my eyes. I would have seen the same thing. I was so gone. You're, you're, you're, you just, you dissolve. You cease to be there when you're doing the DMT, the most intense version of smoking it. Um, but you, I wonder if we will eventually be there because what that feels like when you're doing dmt and Mckenna's described it as Terence Mckenna described it as like you're in some sort of a well of souls, that you transcend the physical body and you enter into some space, some well of souls. I wonder if this thing that we look at, we look at reality and we look at Adams and what we're talking about, the physical space, when Adam's are mostly nothing and then these subatomic particles that blink in and out of position.

Speaker 4:          01:57:11       I wonder if what really is going to happen as we get more and more evolved and more and more powerful with our ability to manipulate matter, is that we're going to transcend this dimension. I wonder if that place that we go to is where our future lies and that our future doesn't lie in the stars because the stars aren't even real and that the real dimension means they're real. Is in. You can see them and you can send things to them and you can measure them. But this is just a, almost like a prison of a dimension and this dimension can be transcended and that you can briefly view it when you do dmt or when you visit the Iowasca God and you, you, you pass through and briefly into that dimension. But if one day that is where consciousness will exist all the time and that we are creating this possibility in this door through our thirst for innovation and knowledge and, and this constant evaluation of our current abilities and the constant desire to improve upon those abilities, that one day it'll get passed this desire to have artificial intelligence and what is this intelligence going to be able to do?

Speaker 4:          01:58:19       What's it going to be able to achieve and what's it going to be able to accomplish? And we're going gonna open up other dimensions as possibilities for consciousness to exist in.

Speaker 3:          01:58:29       I mean, this sounds a lot like, like pre abrahamic religion, right? I mean this sounds a lot like religions were experience and indigenous religions where before we fucked everything with, uh, with Moses and Jesus and Mohammed.

Speaker 4:          01:58:45       Well, you say that. But do you know that most most recent scholars in Jerusalem believed that the Moses experience was about dmt?

Speaker 3:          01:58:52       The Moses experienced specifically? Oh No. I'm only is that that a lot of the early. A lot of those old testament things, writers were on psychedelic.

Speaker 4:          01:59:01       Most likely they were. When you think about the fact that psychedelics has been, have been here forever,

Speaker 3:          01:59:05       so what's the Moses

Speaker 4:          01:59:06       the most experiences that Moses saw? The burning Bush that represented God? Yeah. Well, one of the most dmt rich plants in the area where Moses was the Acacia tree. The acacia Bush is rich in DMT. If that was on fire or if you figured out a way to extract dmt from it and then he smoked it or you lit it on fire and did some sort of a way where you're absorbing this smoke and absorbing the DMT,

Speaker 3:          01:59:32       you would say, God, you would see God. There's A. There's a lot of DMT. Flora in Australia apparently, and I just feel arris grass, right? A lot of different plants. There's an Australian native called the wattle, which I think is the national plant. I'd have to look that up or maybe it's the state plan of my state. Um, and so, and Acacia isn't that they're all part of that family. And so I was, I was looking earlier this year that there's a push in Australia to get a Iowaska off the, uh, the register, you, the banned substances list and permitted as a, as a religious, as a madison, as a medicine.

Speaker 4:          02:00:05       Yeah. It helps a lot of people. There's a lot of people that go to it that have all sorts of addictions and all sorts of real problems and it sort of reset their brain, resets their life. It's one of many different psychedelics that are really good at that. He Boga is incredibly good for people that have addictions to opiates, literally resets the way your brain views and connects to addictive substance.

Speaker 3:          02:00:29       So I've heard, yeah, I mean one of the, I did a story on huffpost live about Iowaska before I'd ever used it and they were saying that there's some interesting research about its ability to be a circuit breaker against, for example, alcoholism and stuff like that, that people will go into the experience. Alcoholics tends to come out. Yeah, right. Yeah, it was psychedelics. So I mean if it's so difficult to know what the fuck is going on with consciousness, right. Why is it that we are assembled in such a way as to have these experiences and to be conscious at all, but why do you think that it's a different dimension that we could cross into rather than just a another perspective on this world that we are opened up to because we're ordinarily. I mean my, my theory I suppose although it's tentative, is we have the capacity to be tuned into all kinds of amazing shit that's going on in the universe, but I really mean in terms of woo.

Speaker 3:          02:01:25       I mean in terms of spiritual ghosts or anything. I just mean there was a perspective on life that is much bigger than the one that we walk around with a on our day to day on a day to day basis, but evolution has has favored traits that force us to focus on getting food and having sex and surviving. Right. Which means that it has intentionally closed the parameters of what our mind is capable of experiencing. It goes intentionally closed or is there no benefit for the biological is what I made distracted by these. Exactly. Running from tigers. Precisely. You don't want to cave man who's like, who's like philosophizing a bit about his place in the cosmos is eating well. He gets eating wise tripping. Yeah, exactly. He's like, this is amazing. It's such a spiritual journey. We Abbott startup gets devoured by a woolly mammoth, a little silly voice, but you know, and what drugs do is they break down the walls of perception and you know, to, to borrow from Huxley, they, they shatter those, those kinds of limits and constraints that our biology, that evolution has put on our mental ability and simply let the mind wander into whatever space it cares to go to.

Speaker 4:          02:02:33       Yeah. Well, why? By using the word dimension, I think we've sort of, uh, we've, I've limited the perception of what I'm saying because we already have like three dimensions that we believe in and the dimensions that we understand, four dimensions that we believe in, but also the, they believe that

Speaker 3:          02:02:51       quantum physics there a nine or 1111 is it? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:02:55       So we, we understand that there are other dimensions that we don't totally understand yet, right? Um, but those, those are, those are words, right? To mentions their words, but there's time, space, distance, all these different things or words and these words sort of lock in a definition in our own mind. But whatever the fuck it is, when you do have a dmt trip, you go to a place and that place is not right here. It's not, you're not, you're not here when you go there and it's some all encompassing infinite geometric place called a dimension. But that's just a noise that you make with your mouth. It doesn't really matter what it is. It's something that you experienced that you don't experience right here in Calabasas or wherever the fuck we are. You know, it's, there's, there's something different about it. And um, could it be another dimension? Yes. Could it be all in your imagination? Your imagination might also be another dimension. The word dimension is a weird word because it's so limiting and defining and, and we have these preconceived ideas that we, you know, there's a box that we can put our head, oh, it's a dimension. There's the dimension, you know, whatever that thing is that you can experience. If we can tap into that and other ways is going, the world is going to get very strange.

Speaker 3:          02:04:15       One thing that struck me after the experience, which gives, which I think it bolsters the idea that there is something real about that dimension and slash intelligence or whatever it is, whatever you want to call it, was the, was that I noticed that whenever people have these experiences and go to these places, regardless of what mechanism they use, they always come out with basically the same. Just have a conclusion and if it was merely what someone like a, uh, who's a tele, penn, penn and teller, one of my pendulous nine. Why? If it was merely what a person like Penn Jillette thinks it is, which is just the [inaudible] of your brain, right? Do you mean you take this stuff but he's never done anything? No, exactly. That's right. He's lost. So he's not just a teetotaler. He's a denier of the possibility of all these different experiences being transcendent. That's right. He was. As far as he's concerned. What happens when you take dmt is that there are neurological disturbances and your brain goes, goes in, has weird experiences because the drug is just fucking with your neurology. And the Daddy said to Moses, nothing. What?

Speaker 4:          02:05:20       I said, why don't you, why? Why have you? How come you have no interest? He goes, I think everything has been learned from those experience. Everything that we've already figured it out, we've already taken what we can from those experiences. Nothing to be learned by doing that. Other people have already done it. Mike, you're out of your fucking mind. And if that's the case, then just do it. Then there's no harm, right? So silly to say that is so silly. I love that guy. He's awesome. But I think he is missing out on a massive blind spot. Just massive blind. But Dick Chunk of possibility. He thinks it's hallucinations. He thought. I mean, he doesn't know. He really doesn't know. He doesn't understand.

Speaker 3:          02:05:57       I mean, some of it is hallucinations, but. So here's it. I'm not sure.

Speaker 4:          02:06:01       I'm not sure. I think it might be what Mckenna thinks. I'm. It might be a wealth of souls. It might be what life is this. This whole biological thing might literally be the cocoon that we were talking about.

Speaker 3:          02:06:14       But when I'm, when I close my eyes and I see a mechanistic universe of bright pink, yellow and purple machines cranking away and exploding and little sort of Mario style computer things bouncing around on them, and then I start spinning through kaleidoscopes of color. Are you implying that Mckenna Mckenna would say that those are actual real things that I'm seeing in another dimension? Woody Kenna

Speaker 4:          02:06:41       believed that? What you were expecting? He had some weird names for them. I think he called them. Uh, what did you call machine elves and hyperspace. He believed that they were entities. He believed that they were living entities and that you were communicating with each other.

Speaker 3:          02:06:59       No words. I could believe that. I think there are clearly hallucinations because there are just things like I would open my eyes and then there was a river in the middle of the, of the room between me and the other people sitting there. Like I'd seen no reason to assume that that actually was a river a, but maybe it was anyway. But where it comes to like souls and where it starts getting really woo woo is when I could feel the tug of going into a particular place like the woman's head or something like I could feel. There were moments where I was having lots of fun and I was thinking, Oh, is this, oh this is, oh, this is going to be enjoyable. And then some I would just, a wave of dread would wash over me and I was like, ended up start to feel like I was going to vomit. And then I'd be like, oh, okay, I have to take this shit seriously. And I'd sit upright and I'd. And I'd take a deep breath. And that I can imagine, I think is what he's sort of talking about. Right. And maybe that's like something like that.

Speaker 4:          02:07:53       One of the things to make the really powerful distinction is Mckenna was specifically talking about dmt. That's what he was into. She wasn't really into Iowasca. His brother Dennis is really an Oscar. And his brother Dennis really recommended that I do it and I probably will eventually. I'm sure it will, but terrence was into the hardcore version and it was. It's a apparently you can't. Well, I know from the hardcore version of it you're not. You're not escaping. Like once you're locked in, you're gone. Like it's. It's way more potent. Way more potent. Yeah. I got to try it and see the difference. The, the, the, what you're experiencing when you're having the Iowasca trip is a, this emo a inhibitor allowing you to have this prolonged slow release dmt trip so you're not getting shot through a fucking cannon to the center of the universe.

Speaker 3:          02:08:45       No, sure. But people have been using this for thousands of years and believing that it is opening a portal to some kind of spirit of winter, so it's not okay.

Speaker 4:          02:08:52       Saying there's a difference between what Mckenna's describing as what you experienced. Yep. Got It. And what I've experienced,

Speaker 3:          02:08:57       but presumably Mckenna's Mckenna's theories can be extrapolated to Iowasca as well as the MTA. Sure. He goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

Speaker 4:          02:09:05       But I think that you're getting a much more watered down version of it when you're doing, which is one of the reasons why people can sustain it for many, many hours.

Speaker 3:          02:09:14       I mean, I'm just trying to figure out what the, what the competing claims about this, this dimension that we're accessing A. Right. You know, on the one hand you've got a, a Penn Jillette who's saying, well, it's just all in your district

Speaker 4:          02:09:26       guard. What he's saying. He hasn't experienced it. If he experienced it and he was dismissing it, I would be like, wow, he must have got some weak shit.

Speaker 3:          02:09:32       I mean, the, the, the, what's compelling to me, what I was just saying about the conclusions that people have after they come off of these kinds of experiences. No one has ever had one of these experiences and come out of it and said, wow, I really felt like I was. I got an insight into the true meaning of life. And the meaning of life is I should hate Jews. You know, or like no one has ever become more petty. You all of the experiences. Well, not that I know of, most certainly everyone who I know will have or have read of who have had, who've had these kinds of experiences tend to come out with similar intellectual conclusions that we are all one. That life is precious, that, uh, you know, consciousness is divine, that love is important. All these kinds of things which indicates to me that it's more that makes it more plausible than it would otherwise be. That you're actually viewing something that exists rather than merely having your brain stood up

Speaker 4:          02:10:26       but isn't impossible. That just does just stripping away the normal boundaries of consciousness, reveal the positive aspects of the human nature and you take away all of our insecurities and have all of our biological necessity of survival and all these different things that sort of motivate us and sexual impulses and desires and fears. Strip all that stuff away with dimethyltryptamine and all of a sudden you reveal what the human soul really, essentially. Yes, but why is the human soul based on love? Well, because love is probably the thing that makes us most connected and makes us most productive and makes us feel the best. You know, you don't feel good if you're successful in the loan. It's one of the weirdest things about being a person. If you gave a person all the money in the world and all the tools and toys in the world and all the gadgets and Gizmos, but you left them by themselves on the moon, they'd probably want to blow their fucking brains out. You, you. We don't exist in a vacuum. We exist as a super organism. This is something that Anthony Robbins that make sense?

Speaker 3:          02:11:28       Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, it's almost. It becomes back to. It's almost semantic between that end having an insight into another dimension, because if what you're saying is that fundamentally at the core of all of us, once you strip everything else away is a kind of beating heart of deep, glowing and abiding, connected love. We'll just call that the other dimension then because that's spooky in and of itself.

Speaker 4:          02:11:53       That other dimension would. It feels like when you're doing dmt, is that the way? I describe it as it's you. You're in this infinite realm of complex geometric patterns that are made out of love and understanding and that you and by understanding I mean like wisdom, like they see you can't bullshit them. You're exposed Ra and what you are and what you have been as exposed raw and your personality and your life and your culture is stripped away and you're left with your soul or whatever we think of as soul. Again, waited words, weird words, but ultimately that feeling of love does come out of everybody like and I think that that's probably at the root of what makes us want to be connected with each other. That's why you do feel bad when you're just alone for long periods of time. You don't connect with people and it's probably good to be alone occasionally, but ultimately you want to get back to people and you want to get back to people that you care about in the love because you, you, you bond with them. You mom. You do that thing that happens when you go into the DMT world where you connect with everything in it and it sucks you in and as you let go, it bathes you with that loving, weird, strange, all knowing, feeling

Speaker 3:          02:13:07       Anthony Robbins has an interesting line that you reminded me of the beginning of the show when you were talking, when you were joking about how you'll always feel unfulfilled and like you know the moment you do a podcast, you need to just focus on the next one and get the next one done. A which is that he, he feels like the greatest failures are successful people who don't feel fulfilled, that he would much rather see an unsuccessful fulfilled person than a successful, unfulfilled

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       person. Let me step in here because Anthony Robins, his greatest success, Robin's his greatest success, is teaching people to be successful. So he must said to be fulfilled. He must feel fulfilled. Teaching people how to be successful. I think he would say that he teaches them how to be fulfilled. Okay. What has he done? What has he dies? Teach people how to feel fulfilled. Yeah. That's his vision of fulfillment. How much, uh, amazing creative work of literature, of fiction, of how much stuff has anthony robins done? How many movies is he made? How many, how many paintings has he done? How many things is he created out of? Nothing that he's super happy with. No, his none. His. He's not a creative artist. His life mission is to help people get fulfilled. So him talking about creative people being fulfilled. Fundamentally, I don't think he understands what I'm saying.

Speaker 4:          02:14:31       Like am I fulfilled? Yeah, I mean is it great that we have 830 whatever podcast in a bunch of people like, absolutely, but what is fulfilled me and am I, am I content? Can I sit back and relax and enjoy it? No, because part of what makes you good at something is that you're constantly assessing whether or not it's good and you're constantly objectively and introspectively analyzing it and breaking it down and chopping it up. Dude, I just got through doing a Netflix special. It's going to air in October and I had to edit it. It's fucking awful. Doing that. Chewing away at your work and trying to figure out what you can do. What's better. Can I cut this out? Should I leave this here? And ultimately what I decided to do is I did four shows so I could do one of them almost completely in its entirety and they'll like in and do it that way, but I know other people think it's funny.

Speaker 4:          02:15:22       I know the people that were there, I got a standing ovation. I know they loved it. I fucking hate everything. I don't know. I don't mean hate, but I mean you're there, but there's a constant search for the right beats and the right things and it's not a matter of not being fulfilled. I'm a very fulfilled person. It's a matter of never really liking anything that I do. Never really loving it and they're always this constant need to make it better. This constant state of. And the most people that I find that are really super happy with everything they do, they usually suck. That's true. Yeah. No, I mean I'm like you, I never. That's why it takes me forever to write and I never meet writing deadlines because I always hate what I want. I produced why you're good. Anthony Robbins is a great guy.

Speaker 4:          02:16:06       I. I appreciate him very much and I listened to his motivational books on tape when I was a fighter. I used to listen to that. I have fucking one of those walkman cassette things and I bought his books. I listened to his stuff. Ultimately though, and this is not to dismiss him, what he does is write about success. That's right. And he wants people to be successful, so that's what he thinks of his fulfillment. But if Anthony robins decided to write some great work of fiction, then I could listen to him. Anthony Robbins sat down and came up with this fucking amazing movie and produced it and it's some saifai masterpiece. Then I could understand, but he's not doing that,

Speaker 3:          02:16:43       but don't coaches. I mean this isn't the defendant Anthony Robbins a hour, but don't coach like you can be a great coach without being good at the thing that you're coaching people on. Absolutely. And sometimes that's useful to. Oh sure, yeah. No screenwriting coaches. Robert Mckee runs his three day seminar. Incredibly invaluable. If anyone wants to write a screenplay who's out there do robot Mckay's a seminar. He's never written a screenplay in his entire life. No, he's not a good screen writer, but he understands that he, he's the first to say that, but you know what? All the big studios, uh, pay for their, for their script readers to go to his seminar. You know where that doesn't work. Stand up. There are no, there are no standup coaches that are any good. No, that's true. That's true. Isn't it weird? It's terrible. Comedians that fail and then they start to make stand. It's like the standup class but, and you're like, well, I'm sorry, what do you know about them?

Speaker 4:          02:17:40       What? And if you ever watched them do standup, you want to fucking shoot yourself. There was a couple of people that wrote books about standing up and they were all awful, awful comics.

Speaker 3:          02:17:50       There's one guy who was really helpful to me when I started doing standup, but not that I've ever been successful at doing standup because I didn't pursue it. But he was really helpful to me in New York when I first got there. But apart from that, yeah, I completely agree. It basically he was just a good joke writer, so he was good at whittling down a concept into a punchline. But the people that are good at.

Speaker 4:          02:18:08       Yeah, and you, you could learn from friends, but I've never seen a really good comic teach a course like David towels there.

Speaker 3:          02:18:15       You just stand up. That's. You know what I mean? That's right. Well be yourself. I mean like I love the idea. I've had so many conversations with, with successful creative people who I admire that I couldn't believe that I still ever doubt this advice, but it's the most consistent advice that I get from creative people. I like anytime they try to do something which is calculated to appeal to a particular demographic or which is based on notes that other people have given them or which is intended to fill a particular niche, it falls flat on its face and every time they do something that is for them that they love, that has an audience of one, which is them. And it's true to them and it speaks to them and it's idiosyncratic and particular. It kills. It's so true. But

Speaker 4:          02:19:01       here's the rub. You have to learn how to be yourself. That's right. And that takes a long fucking time. Right? I think back when I was 21 when I first started doing standup and I'm horrified that anybody let me onstage because I didn't know anything. I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what my thoughts on things were. I was just terrified trying to get laughs. So I was trying to figure out what would make people laugh. I had no idea what I thought was funny other than what I saw that made me laugh. I couldn't break it down. Like if I went to see a Sam kinison or Jerry Seinfeld or something like that, I knew they were hilarious. They made me laugh. I could repeat the joke to you. I can say, Oh my God, I saw Seinfeld. Let me tell you his joke and I could tell you. And I knew it was funny, but I didn't know how to do it. I just clumsily concocted my own versions of different subjects that I thought could possibly be funny and then over time, slowly but surely figured out how to actually be funny, but along the lines I had a fail miserably and learn and feel pain and heartbreak and all the bullshit that people go to before I started forming my own actual opinions on things.

Speaker 3:          02:20:15       I think that's a really good point because sometimes one day I was, I was a late bloomer and figuring out who I am as a creative person. Do you know now I don't know what the fuck I am. Well, you know, to to her closest approximation that you're able to, that, that you're able to land so your audience knows who Joe Rogan is. Put it that way. Right. And that's enough. Some of them do, some of them are mad. I thought you were different, but I think fun of ignore them, make fun of. My mother was like reading the comments section of a website, but it I think some of sometimes one of the differences between people who peaked early into successful young versus people who are better later in life is just how just how long does it take you to really get grounded in who you are and to stop trying on these different kind of invisible cloaks of personalities that you think you might be until you can strip all that away and then you're like, okay, I think this is. I think this is the real. It's the same with podcasting as well. Like I, I used to host stuff and try to get it up and do radio bits in Australia and I if I listened back to them now, it's so effected. It's so. It's so not. It's so me trying to be me on radio instead of just made. Yeah, you gotta be you. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:21:31       I think the thing that happens also with the peaking early thing is success itself is the poison or of creativity. A success itself like you all of a sudden you have it. That's one of the reasons why I don't believe Anthony Robbins is correct, is like this, this idea of like being satisfied and being fulfilled. Like I mean, sure, I'm satisfied and fulfilled. Absolutely. But the whole thing about the, this creative process is you can never totally be happy with what you're doing or what you've done because you've got to do more shit. Especially standups. Like if you're a musician and you're the rolling stones and you have a catalog. Fuck man. You could tour forever. You don't need to write a new song ever. But if you're a standup, I put out a new special every year and a half every two years, whatever it is. And if I don't do that, I feel like a fucking piece of shit. And if I try to do the same jokes, uh, five

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       years in a row, six years in a row, 10 years in a row, we all know comics that do that. You go to see them and they're doing the same bits word for word for decades and decades and never put anything out that doesn't go for the. I got back to the comedy cellar in New York sometimes in the, you know, the emcee will be doing the same shtick that he was doing 10 years ago when I first came to New York. I'm like, that guy is still doing the same material. I mean, in one respect I can sort of understand it because if you're like take music, maybe not the rolling stones, but say Hansard, you can just do embalm every single time you go anyway. And that's all you need to do for the rest of your life. And in comedy there are people like, like sometimes audiences want it, right?

Speaker 2:          02:23:06       Sometimes I'll do that bit about blahdy Blah. Grandma sucks, which is fine. You mean Jerry Seinfeld did that one thing I'm telling you for the last time I saw him and Sydney. Yeah. Nothing wrong with that, but, but then he tied all of that material. But like if you go to see a guy like bill burr, you see bill burger special and then you go see him like a year later you're gonna see a whole new set every time. And that's the same with Ari Shaffir at the same, you know, fill in the blank, yet every single essentially, I mean touring comedian now, to be fair to Anthony Robbins, I don't think that he's saying that you should just be sit on your laurels and not strive. And it's interesting. You know what I mean? What he's saying is, will know the story of like the person who wanted a Ferrari and wanting to, wanting to sexy wife and wanted the best job and wanting to make a million dollars and then gets it and finds themselves miserable, connected to exactly.

Speaker 2:          02:24:01       They're not connected to what they really want. That's what he's doing. He doesn't mean being self satisfied. It means he means being genuinely fulfilled by the things that you're aspiring to do with your life and to get up to in the world where there are a bunch of things that we think we want and what they are is really just these unattainable goals that seem like they're unattainable. And then once we attain them, we go, well, well the now what? Exactly. And that's what happens to a lot of people when they get famous. So a lot of comics in particular, they become famous and they are really good when they become famous, like kinisons of my favorite all time example because I've, I believe that Kennison from like 1984 to 1986, it was probably the greatest comic of all time. There was just a time where he was just a maniac.

Speaker 2:          02:24:45       He just was. And it's hard because you've got to kind of put it in the context of the time that there was no one like that back then because comedy is not like music. Like you go listening to music from the 19 sixties. It's still really awesome. Go try to listen to some mort Sahl from 1960. It's fucking terrible. It doesn't mean that more. Saul's not a brilliant comedian. He's certainly was. Or Lenny Bruce Who's like the godfather of the whole thing. If it wasn't for Lenny Bruce, no one today would be doing the same kind of standup. It just, it wouldn't have existed. It's, it's an art form that almost, that he in many ways sort of gave birth to. Well, go listen to that stuff today. It doesn't hold up. Comedy doesn't necessarily

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       hold up. So in some ways kinison doesn't totally hold up when you go back and understand that I'm a bit hard to grasp from today's vantage point I must say, but during the time, this is a. I've told this story before, unfortunately. So everybody who heard it gather around, there was a girl that I worked with. I was working at the Boston Athletic Club. I was 19 years old and there was this girl that was working at the front desk. She was hilarious. She was like really? Like this big athletic girl. And she was just always like boys jurist and joking around about stuff. And she was awesome. I really wish I stayed in touch with her. But uh, I don't know her name anymore. I don't remember her name, but our member, she told me about Sam Kennison. She goes, I saw this comedian on Hbo and now granted this is the back.

Speaker 4:          02:26:06       And then there was like Hbo, Fox, NBC, ABC, there was nothing and maybe cinemax, right? She did that bit about a homosexual necrophiliac paying money to spend a few hours undisturbed. But the freshest male corpses, you know, that Ben, there was a bit about a real story that Kennison had heard were these, uh, apparently this is a real issue. And I'm Joey Diaz knows a guy who walked in on this mortician that was fucking his mom after his mom was dead. Apparently people have done this and that. They treat people's bodies like a sex doll. And it's Joey Diaz, the kind of guy who'd make that shit up because that sounds. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, guys got arrested. These guys went in the kinison story. They got arrested because he's morticians. We're accepting money from these people that would come in and fuck these courts.

Speaker 4:          02:26:59       I mean, if it's a stranger, I understand. I do that in a heartbeat. But if. But my mother. Well the guy wasn't fucking his mom. He was fucking someone else's friend's mom. This mortician was fucking sign anyway. I'm pretty sure it was. Joey told me that. I hope it was. Anyway, point is this girl does this bit for me. She goes, it's because the way kinison do it. He goes, imagine. He goes, you're lying there. You're on the slab. You Go, well, well had a good time in life. Now I guess I'm going to go to heaven and be with Jesus and then says, rocking back and forth. You and she's doing this on the floor in the. On the parking lot on the ground. She's lying on her stomach

Speaker 7:          02:27:34       going, hey, it feels like someone's fucking me in the Oh, you mean live keeps fucking in the ass. Even after your dad didn't have never ends.

Speaker 4:          02:27:45       I am laughing my ass off, but this girl doing this in the parking lot and I went out and I believe I got it on vhs cassette because again, this is 86. It was before I'd ever done standup and I watched his hbo special and I went, Holy Shit. Like I didn't even know that was comedy. I didn't know someone could. I thought comedy was evening at the Improv. Guys would roll up their sleeves. Do you ever notice set up punchline? Yeah, and this guy was doing this completely radical version of that with a bra on and a trench coat. I was like, what the is this, and he was so good for a short period of time and then I went to see him alive when I first got into comedy around 1988 and he had already slid way off the rails and he was just partying all the time and doing coke and bang and strippers.

Speaker 4:          02:28:38       He's on heroin as well with me. No, I don't believe so. I think he's pretty much just a coca probably did heroin probably did everything you put in front of them. You know Sam Kennison. He was an animal. He even joked around about that, about people expected them to do drugs. He's here, he's here, could cut the biggest line in the world and even doing his heart would be beating out of his chest. I want to say no. Well also it would be bad for his image. He sort of became a prisoner of his own image. He created this persona and then it became a prisoner to that persona, but he just stopped writing and stopped being funny and he's hanging out with celebrities and he's going to parties and he's not not hungry anymore, not doing the work. And he went from being one of the best ever to being like an open mic or is caricature of who he really was.

Speaker 4:          02:29:23       We really didn't have any points and it was all just scream and all just, you know, like trying to pick out a shocking subject. But it wasn't really. It wasn't, didn't really resonate with them. And I think with a lot of Comedians, what's really important is a, you are a regular person that you are, you just, you can fit in with people and you understand people and a lot of people they become famous and then all of a sudden they get assistance and then they get, you know, managers and agents shield them from the world. They have publicists to do all the talking for them and they get tucked away in an ivory tower and then they show up for interviews with sunglasses on. And you know, and they're, they're all about maintaining.

Speaker 3:          02:30:01       Tell me about it. I've interviewed enough of those on the live. Yeah. Well, I mean, not even necessarily Comedians, but people who come on with that persona who are, who are handled, who have spent their entire lives being handled. Like, give me an example. Roseanne Barr. I brought her in here. She was awesome. Was She? Yeah, she got. Well you probably got her to open up. I had, I had 25 minutes.

Speaker 4:          02:30:24       Well I had three hours and she knows I'm a huge fan. I think Roseanne is probably one of the 10 most important comedian.

Speaker 3:          02:30:32       Oh, absolutely. I mean I'm a huge fan of actually the. Did you see the documentary film that was made about her run for president? No, it's actually really interesting. It's, you know, it's fascinating to see this person who was so groundbreaking and who, who did so much comedy in for and for I guess the portrayal of women and that people and the working class on American television wasn't totally different thing. She was a totally different thing. Yeah. Just see her kind of puttering around her home in Hawaii, like trying to run for president as a green candidate. It's. It's an interesting documentary. She had to set her straight about chem trail. She believed the government was spraying things in the sky reading. Maybe I read about that and maybe you tweeted about it or something, but I remember reading about her and chem trails or maybe it was Brian Dunning's episode or did he reference that or something? There was something maybe skeptical.

Speaker 2:          02:31:22       Maybe he might've. I don't know. I don't remember. There's too many of them. They get it. If I really remember it at all. You know Dunbar's number. Like there's. There's only like certain amount of data you can stuff in that fucking dome of yours. Absolutely. And let it go. Who Cares? Who gives a shit how many homes it is, but she was awesome on this show and she didn't. She didn't come in like handled it all. She came in by herself, sat down, shot the shit, laughed, joked around.

Speaker 3:          02:31:48       Interesting. I mean fame you or met you were talking earlier about fame. Like it can be incredibly alienating when you reach a certain. What's your sweet spot of fame? Because I, you know, I think I hit it

Speaker 2:          02:31:58       about a year and a half ago. I'm trying,

Speaker 3:          02:32:02       you know, I wanna be able to go to the movies. I can't think of anything worse than not being able to get on a plane without everybody. Like I got on a plane a couple of years ago and Deniro was sitting in seat one Aa, so I don't know how he got on the plane, how long he'd been on the plane, but he wasn't here. I didn't see him board. So I know Richie. Oh yeah, we got on the plane

Speaker 2:          02:32:24       already there. I have no fucking idea. He was already on the plane. I'm like yeah, I'm in the front of the line, Bitch, get on that plane, Lionel.

Speaker 3:          02:32:31       So I was one of the first people that was one of the first people on the plane and I also happened to be in first class and the. And you hack your way into first class? You son of them. That actually someone, a production company paid for me that I was shooting a pilot, uh, and so I was, I was one of the first people on the plane and I was able to see the reactions of everybody walking past as they notice or don't notice that it's Robert Deniro sitting on the plane and it's incredible to. I mean his life is just a relentless stream of people acting weird. Right? I mean, every single person who noticed him would do a double take gospel nudge, unsubtly nudge the person who they're traveling with and he has to sit there reading the newspaper, pretending that this is normal and he can say hello to him. But what a horrible, normal one. If you want to pick your nose, don't pick your nose in public. You piece of shit. Lot. Have a good pick. Isn't a good picture? Satisfying? Weird. How many people up dry up? They get a big old dry. Yeah. You realize that there's more up there. You kind of pull out a pc of Brian almost just goes all the way up to, in between your eyes are agree.

Speaker 2:          02:33:41       That's good. Yeah, it is, it's got to be weird to be that famous. So there's certain levels, like a buddy of mine, his friend Doug Stanhope is friends with Johnny Depp and uh, he, he talks about how unmanageable Johnny Depp's famous like he cannot go to, if he goes to a restaurant, literally people do not give a fuck if he's eating, they swarm and the table and come over with cameras and pictures and they want to touch him and they don't leave him alone. He just, he's just far beyond the regular fame into that weird. There's only 10 people in the world that have that kind of fame. And you become other people's property. Yeah, basically. And they feel like you owe them. And I think television,

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       maybe movie stars. Uh, I'm not sure how it would play, but I think in my experience, broadcasters, and in other words, television personalities and radio hosts are people feel like you're their friend in a way that they don't to movie stars. Yeah. So there's a different interplay. Like people movie stars are different because they play someone different. Like, oh my gosh, the guy from Cape fear raging bull. That's Jake Lamata the thing, and there's something about the bigness of the screen and the Glamor of Hollywood that makes them sort of other worldly. Yes. Whereas when people go up to Jimmy Fallon, it's like, oh Jimmy, you know, it's like, oh, you're my buddy. Like we should hang out sometime. Yeah, no, exactly it, but I think there's a sweet spot to, to fame that as you say, I would not want to go past. I'd like to be more famous than I am, but not not so famous that I can't pick my nose in public.

Speaker 1:          02:35:09       That's the judge sets level. Definitely shouldn't pick your nose in public to, to your alone grandmother. Don't stop chastising me for my boogers in front of all these humans. I've got my fist up, my nose right now to my wrist. I was sitting next to this guy on an airplane once. This old dude, he just kept digging in his nose. He didn't give a fuck. Well, that's not about 75 years old and he's like, nobody's fucking me. Do it. One more time happened, I don't give a shit, and he was in first class. We had some cash. He just fucking up there weighty wipe it. I don't remember. I just stopped looking at them and put my headphones on, zoned out. I'm tired of looking at this old dude picking his nose. He fired a bunch of times to household. So about just letting that go.

Speaker 3:          02:35:55       I've had some bad experiences on Greg Fitzsimmons has a bit about that, about how he, uh, you know, when he's in first class you always to gets upgraded because he flies so much that we was in first class and needed to fought but didn't want to stink at the first class cabin. So He'd go back through the curtain to economy class and just walk down the aisle fighting

Speaker 1:          02:36:13       that's cropped up and then he'd go back to first class, smart life. Those, those, those people in cattle class at disgusting. It smells like hell back there. Joey Diaz always farts in first class in. It's always so horrific. You can imagine. I wrote a whole bit about Joey farting in first class. I wrote a whole blog entry about this one time that he did that. This woman, she yelled at him, he had fallen and she yelled out behind us. Oh my God. She yelled it out. I put my shirt over my nose like this, and he started laughing and clapping. Look,

Speaker 3:          02:36:55       I've occasionally, I will confess, I've occasionally been too hung over on a plane and have not been able to hold it in and I've got a little trick for people which they can keep up. This leaves and you know, go to the bathroom. Rude piece of shit. Sometimes you're, sometimes you're in the window seat and the person sitting next to you is eating their meal or something and you, you kind of get out. You don't want to disturb things and you're not sure if it's going to smelly or not and you're

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       not sure if it's going to be big or not. It's just going to be something has to give and so here's the tactic so that no one will suspect you. You release it. You survived through the beginning of the horrible smell without paying any attention to it. Then as soon as it would have had time to have gotten to you, if it had been admitted by someone nearby, then you very visibly start to react to the bad smell. You don't understand light. This is a strategy that has been hired by American children for it is called. He smelt it. Dealt it so this is not so new. It should be the first no one white. You white until the person sitting next to you starts to wince. Yeah, and then once they win and then you go up because then the trajectory can be established.

Speaker 1:          02:38:07       If they win first and then you wince, then it's obviously coming from the other side of them. No, you're going to give away these like micro expressions that are going to reveal your guilt. Not because I'm a perfect doctor. The perfect crime by. You're not. None of my fucking face shot themselves, and then I loudly say, oh, I can't believe someone was sad, disgusting. It's tough fights in this cabin and that person wasn't me. Yeah, it's the woman behind Joey Diaz that's really foreign and when she smelled his foreign, she made it even worse and I was blaming it all on Joey, but her yelling out, oh my God, I'll never forget that lady, that poor lady I love, I love the audacity that she's not embarrassed about it because it wouldn't let you have the Oh, nearly you have the tact to be a bit embarrassed about for the, on behalf of the fighter.

Speaker 1:          02:38:55       When you understand what kind of fucking smell Joey Diaz can pack in that body. You're talking with a man who is well over 300 pounds and who knows what he ate a small child who was fighting inside him and now he's fighting the fight happening many things. Um, I wanted to mention also, I was reading this piece about stem cells. Have you been paying attention to the fucking crazy. I mean, it looks now like we're going to be able to use stem cells to grow. I mean, we always knew you'd be able to grow organs in a lab, right? But now it looks like within the fussiest future we're going to be able to grow a hearts and essentially grow hots in a lab. And you're not gonna have to worry about stem cell treatments. No. Talk to me. I, uh, was that close to shoulder surgery.

Speaker 1:          02:39:46       I had a tear in my rotator cuff tear in my labor room, a tear in my bicep tendon and my, my shoulder was in some pretty significant pain and I was like, is this from a particular injury or is this just from Geneva to. It's from martial arts. It's from weightlifting. It's from years ago. Overall wear and tear of being Joe Rogan. When I got the MRI apparently in my shoulder had been dislocated. I didn't know it and it popped back in place at one point in time and they saw there's some particles that are floating around.

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       Jujitsu is just unbelievably brutal on your body because you're constantly attacking joints and, and trying to break those joints and then you have to tap but you don't want to tap. So you muscled through it and then you wind up getting pretty injured and then you heal up for a little bit and you hop right back in and train again because it's so much fun. So, uh, I was really close to getting shoulder surgery and I talked to the doctor from the UFC who had just gotten these stem cell injections in his shoulder after surgery. He had shoulder surgery, had a shoulder repaired and then gotten these injections and I had some pretty, pretty good results with it. And he's like, look, you really probably need surgery, but if you want to try this, these injections, let's give it a shot because it has been shown.

Speaker 4:          02:40:54       I just don't want to give you any false hope. Okay, let's give it a shot. So what they do is they take a woman's placenta that, uh, is a given birth to a kid through Sicilian section and then a young woman and they take those, that placenta and then they get these embryonic stem cells from it. Yup. And they injected it into my shoulder. And within four weeks I felt better than I've felt in a year. And then it kept getting better and better and better. And now, I mean, there's still some clicking like because there's still some shit floating around in there. But uh, I lift a lot of weights and I don't have any pain. I mean, it's amazing how much better it got. I, I did a kickboxing workout today where I'm, I went seven rounds on the. So I'm slamming into the back.

Speaker 4:          02:41:36       I have no pain in my shoulder at all. Nothing. Zero. I mean there's stuff floating around in there. Like I said, I could feel it. Go, click, click, click because there's some broken off cartilage and shit. That's, that I'll. Maybe I'll have to get pulled out of there one day. But there's no pain. There's no, there's no limit in my range of motion. There's no strength problem. Like I've shown the doctor, like the physical exercises I can do and he's blown away. He's like, that is incredible because it just regenerates tissue and it can regenerate. It can regenerate meniscus, it can regenerate ligaments. It's,

Speaker 3:          02:42:07       it's incumbent. Anything. Exactly thing. I mean, think about that. You had an injury, you had a, you had a debilitating injury that was causing you significant discomfort and pain. What science was able to do is take the cells that we're going to form the spinal cord of a baby from an embryo, and those cells were then able to convert themselves into portions of Joe Rogan's, different constituent components in order to rebuild a portion of Joe's body. It's crazy shit. I mean, if that miraculous. I don't know what it is. I mean there are some things coming down the pike with stem cells that are going to change everything. I

Speaker 4:          02:42:48       mean, I'm literally made the cost. Like if I had gotten this injury five years ago, I would've had to have surgery, but I didn't. I got it now and now there's no need for surgery. Like my shoulders. I have a shoot. Archery, you know? Right. So I shoot a, I pull 80 pounds 100 times a day, so I'm just going, nope. No shoulder pain at nothing.

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       Zero. Did you watch the artery and the Olympics? I did watch some of it. Yeah, it's fun. The lcs got silver, I think that. Oh, you fucking papers. Oh yeah. We're into ourselves. I've just watched the NBC telecast. I gave up on the very humble swimmer, lied. I gave up Ryan lochte. He had poor fella. He's a bit of a music bit of a Bogan, isn't he? As we were saying in Australia, that's what you guys were calling me. You know what I thought was hilarious though, that how people were, uh, um, I think it was salon had some article that it's proof that white male athletes are pieces of shit. Like they had this whole thing about white male athletes like Jesus Christ. You think you can generalize. One person can die. Can you imagine if they'd said this is proof that like if it was an African American, they were, they were like black women or black women are of shit.

Speaker 2:          02:44:00       That would've been. It would've been really fun. It's amazing that people are allowed to. By the way it was written. The article was not written by a white man. It was written by someone else, but it's amazing that, that you could do that, but you can. You can be sexist as long as you're being sexist about any can be racist as long as you're being sexist and racist about a class that you believe is privileged, so you're allowed to punch up. Yeah, you should always punch. Always Punch out. That's. We were talking about yesterday with nonsense. That's the illness that punch up shit. That is God dammit.

Speaker 3:          02:44:33       That's amazing. It's so annoying, but. And it's especially annoying because I understand the motivation behind it. Right? I do. I do believe that it's different if you. If there's a genuinely oppressed minority than it's different than they should have more of a license to make fun, for example, of the majority than the majority should on them. At least it's less. I can understand that. It's less bad. What I've done on the stand is when they're allowed to show flagrant bigotry. Yes. Right. I mean it's not, it's not just like a gag. It's like. So did you see there was a. I mean this is slightly tangential, but everyone got their knickers in a knot. Oh, that tits and the tangle about that. A headline, and I think it was in the San Jose Mercury when Michael Phelps won his final, do you see that? And it was this tokenistic kind of patronizing headline, which was like, you know, Olympic glory for Michael Phelps and African American woman because there was like an African American woman who

Speaker 2:          02:45:29       street is what I saw is Michael Phelps when silver is a big headline and then below it is world record set and the 800 meters by this woman and he set a world record and she was below him. He won a silver and it was above her.

Speaker 3:          02:45:46       That must have been another one because there was, there was another one which was something like a, it, you know, Olympic trials for Michael Phelps and African American athlete. Now that's a clumsy, stupid

Speaker 2:          02:45:58       headline, right? Does that, is that the, uh, the one Michael, as a historic night with African-american Olympics, I said Michael Phelps ratios historic night with African American. Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's,

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       he's was widely panned for being racially insensitive.

Speaker 3:          02:46:13       That headline, the headline, Dan Olympics, Michael Phelps shares historic night with African American. My, my point is it's part of America's anal obsession with race that makes that headline possible in the first place. That headline isn't racist in the way that the KKK is racist. If I mean no white supremacist would write that headline, they would just ignore the african-american entirely or they would write off that achievement. That is the kind of headline that's written by a constipated at white guilty liberal trying say african-america exactly. Just say the woman's name. That's right. Trying to be tokenistic. Lee Approving in this kind of a paternalistic, patronizing way that white liberals insist on being and in doing so is actually racist and that's. That's telling I think because it is racist to be overly concerned about race. Even if you're trying to be positive. What does this say? Yeah, they put up a second one, 10 minutes later that.

Speaker 4:          02:47:10       Oh, Tim says Olympics. Michael Phelps shares historic night with Stanford. Simone manual.

Speaker 3:          02:47:18       Why is that? A gaff says missing something guys. The third time was the charm is the Merc went with,

Speaker 4:          02:47:24       oh, third time they wrote instead Stanford, Simone Manual and Michael Phelps make history. So because Michael Phelps was first,

Speaker 3:          02:47:34       that's a layer. That's ridiculous. So they're saying that when they changed it, they didn't put the gold medalist first. They put Michael Phelps

Speaker 4:          02:47:41       because he's the best fucking sweater in the history of the wall ever. Yeah. But what's hilarious is they got it right the third time. Her name is first, like why? Why? First of all, how about just say she won a fucking gold medal. Why did she have to be in the same headline? Is Him Anyway? Can you have another goddamn story where she won a gold medal? However, given her own fucking story and then have him have his own story.

Speaker 3:          02:48:06       I mean, why not just say Olympics, uh, you know, golden silver, silver and gold for Philips and a guy.

Speaker 4:          02:48:13       Because if you want people to buy your fucking newspaper, you better show Michael Phelps name because otherwise they're not going to buy to see Kim Kardashian of swimming.

Speaker 3:          02:48:22       I think it's, I just think there's so much unnecessary. Yeah. Here it is. The Mercury News, uh, didn't even have her, is showing up. I didn't have him in the picture. Just had a picture of her. Well now is that the original? The original. That's the original. Still people love to say his name on. Let's see. Some of these tweets so flustered now. They can't even get it grammatically correct. Keep trying. Michael historic night. Oh yeah, Stanford. I mean, who cares?

Speaker 4:          02:48:49       Well, social justice warriors care a bunch of fucking Weirdo shut ins that are constantly monitoring the Internet, looking to be recreationally offended and can't wait to look. There was a clumsy fucking head,

Speaker 3:          02:49:01       but again, to be fair at the reason why this, that headline is stupid or exist in the first place is because it's written by someone who has been contaminated by social justice warrior thinking and thinks that they need to point out the rice, the gold medalists. Wouldn't it be nice if there was just a gold medalist and a silver medalist and that's the only metal just happens to be much more famous than the gold medalist. So obviously you put his name in. Imagine if she

Speaker 2:          02:49:24       went to a gas station and lied about being robbed, and then someone from Salon wrote an article that it's proved that that black American women are, have this proof that male athletes are a protected class. It's not proof. It's proof that this guy's a fucking sociopath. And he lied. Mary Elizabeth Williams, the ballot of Swim Shady. That's a good headline because it's pretty cool. Uh, why that's not true. Male. Oh, I was wrong too. It's like I thought it said white males just as male athletes are protected class. I just don't think that it's fair because it was one guy amongst the thousands of athletes. It's so stupid that you said male athletes are a protected class because he didn't get protected by the way he got exposed. There's nothing protected about dragging that guy's name. Do you know he will be the fucking subject of jokes about lying for the end of time?

Speaker 2:          02:50:18       Yeah. That guy will be the benedict arnold of jokes. Jenelle did a gag of bed last night. Look, it's going to happen. Like there's nothing protected. That's not proof that he's in a protected class. In fact, it's evidence that no one is protected from lies because video cameras, because of technology and because the truth eventually gets out. I do think that if he was, if he was a black athlete from a pool from like Ghana or something, look at that. He lost all four major sponsors in one day. Good. He's a dickhead. I don't give a shit about Ryan. Lucky who lost a million dollars and endorsement money. Woo. Suck.

Speaker 3:          02:50:53       Speaking of breaking ourselves into intertribal racial camps, did you see the, the approval of the Ellen generous as a tweet? No. And she said she was a. She did this. Can you find that Jamie? So you saying bolt. She was like, it was something like next time, next time I go to the supermarket, I know what mode of transportation I'm going to get. And there was like a photoshop image of her on Hussein bolt back or something. Uh, here we go. She tweeted that. Or did somebody. Did somebody photoshop it or did she do it? I think her show Photoshop, photoshop. And then she tweeted it. Oh, okay. I see you write someone a fan. Did it, did they? Uh, and so then of course it's like, it becomes this big thing about she's racist because it's the white. It's the white person enslaving the black person. Seriously. Does anyone believe that? She wouldn't have made the same joke? If. So here she is like being given a piggyback by Hussein Bolt. That's funny. It's funny. It's not a photoshop. Is that what that is? No, she's really doing it. Joe,

Speaker 2:          02:51:57       why did somebody photoshop straight? What does the tweet say? Girlfriends. Hot. Who gives a fuck? Go down. School out. Stop, go back. Dammit, go back.

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       I'm trying, trying, trying to scroll down. We have a picture of her girlfriend right there for them. Okay. Is that I should have gone back again. This was wrong. She looked really cute and so she wrote, this is how I'm running errands from now on Hashtag Rio 2016 with the picture of her. But that's not a race joke. While people are retarded. That's a, it was a white guy. The white guy. She'd still. I mean she still would have traded it, right? So that doesn't mean that she's racist. So this comes down to the question of when we, when we accuse someone of doing something racist, uh, we, do we actually believe that they're racist or are we just trying to find an excuse to interpret what they're saying is basis recreationally outraged. That's what she is. Yeah. Where they are, where they're getting upset at her, they're orange.

Speaker 1:          02:52:56       They're deciding that this is something that they should be upset about. They see the green light and they're hitting the gas. Yeah. Have you really get pissed off at that? Go jump off a fucking bridge. Seriously. Just stop. Just stop talking, tweeting, interacting, stop sharing your opinions of, of sort of emotional and intellectual effort. Joe, that's expended in the world these days on these outrage outburst. If you could channel that hot air into some kind of power plant, be like Zeplin, light it on fire suppression and just grow it out. Cover album. Yeah. It's a waste of time. And it's one of those things where I think we were. We've already beaten it into the ground. We know what it is and I think it's slowly being less and less acceptable for people to do shit like that because I think more and more people realize how fucking unproductive and stupid it really is.

Speaker 1:          02:53:46       Yeah. I feel like that's right. I, I hope that the tide is turning, but I think that as the tide turns, the people who really get a kick out of this stuff, uh, becoming more and more vitriolic and turning the dial up to 11. Yeah, because you just feel like they're being sidelined. There's still shut ins. They're still not going out and experiencing the world. They're still living in this really bizarre confined environment that they exist in or it's, it's, it's, it's not reasonable. That's not reasonable to get upset at that. I had a conversation with an African American friend of mine about braided hair the other day, was it a Kardashian just got her hair braided, cultural appropriation, cultural appropriation. And what frustrated me was she kept going up to the edge of, of being critical of it and then saying, look, I don't really carry the way and in these conversations I always feel like saying, well if you don't care then just don't care.

Speaker 1:          02:54:39       Didn't bode Derek do that like way fucking back in the day. I mean, is that really cultural? Appropriation came from age, ipt. I mean they've been around for so much longer than that. Remember when that fucking girl was getting mad at that boy for having dreadlocks and she was trying to cut his hair off and yeah, she's being a cunt to him and she was doing it just because he was a little tiny guy and she can get away with it. I think if he was a 250 pound football player, she'd be saying the same things to him. We'll also, of course not he, she, she, she's at a liberal arts college and so she knows that he's going to be full of enough white guilt that she can pull that shit and he's, he's going to cop it, she assumes and meanwhile she's wrong. The dreadlocks came from, the Greeks came from the Romans.

Speaker 1:          02:55:19       It's like they've been around as long as people have been stinky with dirty hair and so what my friend was saying about, about brides was, hey, go preparation bro. Derek Damn, she was hot. She was hot as fuck back then. My friend was saying, look, all we want is for people to, to just recognize that it's appropriation and, and to, to, to, to understand and to express their gratitude for. And I was like, what? By what mechanism would a Kardashian who gets brides elicit such a, I mean, exhibit such gratitude for the cultural. I mean if, if it gets great, gets braids and then goes out and says, I want to thank everyone in the African Community for creating brides that's going to cause more of a fucking stood then if she just did it. It's so stupid. What if I were a Sarong? Wouldn't just wear pants and you're black.

Speaker 1:          02:56:06       What if you're aware of white European created pants and shirts? Is that cultural appropriation? What is that? So stupid culture is about sharing. That's what it is about. It's about when you go to an Indian restaurant, are you culturally appropriating because you're eating their food. It's fucking stupid. When you create your own Indian food, are you violating the rules of culture appropriation? If you have taco Tuesday, you a piece of shit, you know, come on. It's fucking dumb man. It's dumb. You probably paid to sheet if you have taco Tuesday. It's just mad. It's just stupid, but some of the best thing about all this stupid stuff. I'm tired of wasting any of my time and thoughts on social justice warrior ideal. I'm actually starting to study to stop doing that because if people haven't heard previous times that I've been on the show and you like this, then go back and listen to the to the previous ones, but you'll find that joe and I spent a reasonably large amount of time talking about social justice issues and social justice warrior issues and how ridiculous it all is.

Speaker 1:          02:57:02       I feel like to some extent we've reached a tipping point where that's hopefully no longer necessary and now it's a little bit self indulgent for us to be whining about the wine is. I think you're right. That's how I feel. I feel like we've sold one whining, I feel like. Yeah, exactly. I feel like we've kind of won this battle and we don't need to be so outraged at the outrage anymore. I think the data has to come in and we had to understand that the only reason why people were being so recreationally outraged about the stupid shit because they don't have real things to be fucked up about in real life. It's easy to get food. It's easy to get shelter. It's most people have those things. Those are the primary things that we need and once you have those things and there's so readily accessible, then you start looking at things to pick on in the world because you don't have any real dilemmas, any real significant, important, absolute dilemma's primal dilemmas and then the. Yeah, so the outrage machine, I mean it comes back a little bit to, to the reaction to Kurt Metzger, Cummins, I'm assume is Radha about rape as well, like what is the appropriate

Speaker 3:          02:58:01       parameters of public discourse in order to trigger the outright?

Speaker 4:          02:58:05       See I disagree there because like in that sense, like he's saying something about a violent crime against women and he's not exactly sure. You know, so I, I kind of see why someone would be outraged that you would step up and defend the guy when you don't really know because you weren't there. But he's also definitely agree that it's a more valid criticism. Criticism of came as a lot more valid than criticism of element. Too Generous for her tweets. That's true. Definitely, but still

Speaker 3:          02:58:32       in both cases I think that getting too angry and wanting to punish people for doing something that's politically incorrect is not the ideal response like did, did you see also

Speaker 4:          02:58:44       important to point out that he didn't say that the guy wasn't guilty when he did say is that we have to understand that women are capable. He did it in a parody form, but what he did say is women are capable of lying to like this, this stupid club, whatever it is. Bands. This guy, you know, I don't know if they're stupid. I'm sure they're great, but they ban this guy. They don't know whether or not he's guilty and he's saying that this woman cannot have lied because like my Bible. That's right.

Speaker 3:          02:59:09       Too Hung up on the question of whether or not he thinks the guy is guilty or not. That's not his point. He's made. His point is a social. Social media should not be the forum in which we conduct witch hunts

Speaker 4:          02:59:20       people. Right, and so people, they. They see something where someone's stepping out with a controversial opinion and what's their immediate idea is not to debate this and say, hey, this is not necessarily appropriate, but here's where it's point is and here's where I disagree. No, fire him. Punish him. Bird, Hey, hey, hey,

Speaker 3:          02:59:44       show it. I ran the Dec. Shoot them in the deck. Did you Say the story about the saatchi, the the executive at saatchi in london who was fired for inappropriate comments about feminism? No, so about maybe four or five weeks ago. What was his comment? He said he was getting it as a saatchi and saatchi and saatchi is one of the world's biggest ad agencies and they're based in the uk and he is an elderly white guy and he was giving an interview to business insider and they asked about feminism and sexism in the workplace and he said that it's not an issue. It's archie because he thinks that women have this much more expansive vision of what their priorities shoulD be and that old old male dinosaurs have this old fashioned idea about success, which is they want to get to the top of the ladder and they want to become an executive and they want to have as much money and power as possible, but that women have a more expansive view and are a wiser and more about children and family and other things than just success. And that was perceived as being an excuse for not addressing sexism in the workplace. And he was fired. He was fired for. yeah. So that's a larry put on, on administrative leave

Speaker 1:          03:01:00       or whatever it is indefinitely. And I got an to work in advertising. I sort of understood like that is a, that is a whole big argument and interesting conversation that's happening among feminists themselves. Right? I mean even my old boss, arianna huffington has written columns about this sort of thing in between Sleeping in between,

Speaker 8:          03:01:19       hi wonder have naps. And dan, I complain about how women can make it as I'm worth $100,000,000,000.

Speaker 1:          03:01:33       She's. She sounds like dr. Evil, dr. Evil

Speaker 8:          03:01:40       back to me. You will complete me

Speaker 1:          03:01:46       though. She was not saying that she doesn't say that women are being held back. Her point is that we need to have like a broader view of success rather than just thinking about money and power over. Sure but big. But when a, what man says, and I look, I don't know that it is appropriate for a white man at the top of a company that doesn't have very many women on the board to be speculating loudly about why it's not important. Why? There's no sexism in his company and why it's not important for them to address, but I don't think that he should be fired for it. Well, you, I don't think you should be able to say to someone, you know, how do you feel about racism in your company? I think you should have to have something to accuSe someone of before you start bringing up accusations like that.

Speaker 1:          03:02:26       Like there has to be something like if there's a specific example of sexism that he needs to address in his company and then he meets, needs to make a statement on it. That's one thing. But how did the journaLists is just into int interested in this powerful mens idea about women in the workforce in general? I don't think they're making an accusation if you're right. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying they're not making an accusation, so if you're getting upset of this guy's opinion about sexism and saying that I don't think there's sexism in my company because I. This is. We have this diverse view of what success is and I think women are getting away from this old dinosaur idea of what second. That's just nothing wrong with what he said, but if you say anything about sexism other than what they want you to say, well that's the thing.

Speaker 1:          03:03:05       What's the problem? What upsets, what? What I worry about is that people are no longer being punished for using bad woods or slurs or attacking people or expressing flagrantly bigoted opinions or saying that one race or one sex is better or worse than another. I'm kind of cool with taking people down for, for doing that shit right there. Now being punished for simply expressing opinions that feel old fashioned. Exactly, and so you have to subscribe to sort of the ideological thought police. Yes, that's, that's a real worry. Even if I disagree with all of those opinions, I want to live in a society that is boisterous and diverse with lots of different argumentative, you know, arguments coming from lots of different positions and a lot of my white liberal friends disagree with this. They say that having loose, these are smart, successful, can lose anyway. What they say is that having someone like him expressive, a view like that actually silences other people because it deprives it. It probably, it probably inhibits the women in his company from feeling like they can speak openly about their ambitions because they think that there's a misogynistic chauvinistic old dinosaur in charge of the company will biases.

Speaker 4:          03:04:20       I can't really comment on this unless I see his exact quote because we're paraphrasing here. I'm here. So what is it? His exact quote. You caN't find the story

Speaker 1:          03:04:28       I was looking at when you started. Well, tell me, what is his name? What is the name of the place? Saatchi and saatchi and saatchi. Let me just see that. S a, t c h I o jamie can't spell saatchi. bus feminism. Saatchi, fos feminism. Feminism, brouhaha for paul, fau x space p a s. Okay. If we

Speaker 4:          03:04:55       scroll up please. If women want to equal men, they must change their notion of happiness. Hmm. Women not men propelled the cult of motherhood and spread the frightening notion that life will never be truly complete without a baby and that no career plotted can compare. Is that what he said?

Speaker 1:          03:05:15       No, it's not what he said. That's an opinion. Pace by someone in the independent who is twisting his words. Well, what the fuck is his words? Let's find out. The margin might be quoted in this. Fine. His words,

Speaker 4:          03:05:25       please. Yeah, it was because of what that is is ridiculous. Would that whatever the fuck that person just said, yeah, you can get upset at the guy. If he says that their ambition is not a vertical ambition, it is intrinsic circular ambition to be happy. Huh? They are going, actually guys, you're missing the point. You don't understand. I'm way happier than you. He explained their ambitious, not a vertical ambition. It is this intrinsic circular ambition to be happy. What? This is weird. Tim hunt, abandoned, need career here territory. By saying that saatchi and saatchi, he'd met a number of talented women who reach a certain point in their careers and rejected the chance to become creative directors. They're going, actually guys, you're missing the point, so I'll repeat it again. He saying that these women are saying, guys, you're missing the point. You don't understand. I'm way happier than you. He explained their ambition is not a vertical ambition. It's as intrinsic circular ambition to be happy. Well, you'd have to debate that idea because I don't know if that's not necessarily true for a lot of women who decided to have children and then realized they would rather raise these children than climb is stupid fucking corporate ladder. I don't think there's anything Wrong with what he said.

Speaker 1:          03:06:39       Yeah. He also says, here's the original article. He says, if you think about those darwinian urges of wealth, power, and fame, they're not terribly effective in today's world for a millennial because they want connectivity and collaboration. They feel like they can get that without managing and leading, so maybe we've got the definition wrong.

Speaker 3:          03:06:56       We're trying to impose our antiquated shit on them and they're going, actually, guys, you're missing the point. You don't understand. I'm way happier than you. Their ambition, meaning women's ambition is not a vertical ambition. It's this intrinsic circular ambition to be happy here. You just read that. So I say we're not judging ourselves by those standards that you idiotic dinosaur like men judge yourself by. He says, I don't think the lack of women in leadership roles is a problem. I'm just not worried about it because they're very happy. They're very successful and doing great work. I can't talk about sexual discrimination because we've never had that problem. Thank goodness.

Speaker 1:          03:07:25       That last part slightly problematic. I mean, I think that what he's doing is expressing a very self deprecating opinion and this is talking about himself being like an old fart.

Speaker 3:          03:07:35       And then the following weekend they announced that he'd been placed on leave and this, they released a statement saying, um, because of his comments, it is for the gravity of these statements that Kevin Roberts has been asked to take a leave of absence effective immediately. Oh my god, everyone can suck my dick. Everyone line up promoting gender equality starts at the top and we will not tolerate anyone speaking for our organization who does not value the importance of inclusion. I don't think that's what he worked very hard to champion diversity and will continue to insist that each agency's leadership be champions of both diversity and inclusion. They should boycott that agency. They're a bunch of twat. I can't believe I've spent so many, so many man hours arguing this on facebook. This is the other thing, like when you were talking about using cell phones and like facebook and like not using twitter so much and how kind of corrosive that can be to your lived experience. Constantly dipping into that well of insanity. It's just a fucking waste of time. It's a drag on my time these days, joe. I spend like I posted it. So what, how this blew up in my face was I posted on facebook this article, an article about this and all my comment was was um, descends shall not be tolerated. Okay. That was what I wrote. Right? Well, tHat's a joke, right? You know, we're not gonna tolerate and people will send to. You

Speaker 1:          03:08:53       ended up being like pages and pages and pages and pages. We had to migrate it into medicine job. I had to go into private messages. It's just reams and reams of back and forth with friends in europe, friends all over the world trying to convince me that I'm a, you know, a chauvinist for support on suck my dick. All those friends follow them. People stop. They told me, they said to me, here's the problem. This is not a prepared statement. Not speaking off the cuff. Another point that I was making, like people don't understand what he's just having a coffee with a reporter. I mean what he Said was not that bad. He's riffing. Yeah, and, and he's trying to speak positively about the company. They don't have an issue with sexism. Look, he's. I disagree with what he's saying. I think it's naive. I think it's kind of ham fiSted. It's not. Yeah, exactly. It's not the smartest thing to say. It's not offensive and something that usually it's something that certainly opens up the possibility of debate. Like you could say, well, if there's a lot of women that don't feel like that, I feel like the door or the glaSs ceiling is there for them to achieve management. Exactly. And the missions and the best

Speaker 3:          03:09:53       response to an idea that you disagree with is to respond with more ideas and to take that idea down, not to fire the person who who had that idea, I'm so weary, I can't do this anymore. May two. And these are smart, very smart, successful people. One of them told me that I sounded like he. He basically said that I'm the same. He was remembering back to an occasion in the 19 eighties were an english broadcast and english sports broadcaster cold. One of the, one of the players, a nigga I really liked, but with a whole bunch of adjectives before, like a lazy, a lazy. He's just a lazy, nasty old nigga.

Speaker 2:          03:10:28       that person got fired and he said that I,

Speaker 3:          03:10:31       I am the type of shit. I'm just like the type of person who was who was opposed to the firing of that person because he was at every point in time our standards evolve and you are just one of those white chauvinistic dinosaurs who's defending the old, yoU Know, the old guard. And in 50 years I'll be regarded as being, as I was like.

Speaker 2:          03:10:50       And that guy got away from his computer and his wife put her strap on on and peg and they cried and then she took his credit card and she shit in his mouth and she left her house and she fucked her. Her personal trainer, who's a giant african american man with a dick, like a police flashlight. Fuck him. Fuck them all. I'm tired of it. Tired of it. And I. And it makes me question myself. was this neighbor, oh neighbor, someone's breaking into the neighbor's alarm. Shouldn't be going off to sleep past business hours. Uh, I gotta get outta here, dude. yeah, let's go. I do this anymore. I really can't do this anymore in terms of like subject matter. I'm so tired of like validating these dummies opinions and arguing about it.

Speaker 3:          03:11:30       No, I mean I'm glad that we didn't really talk about it much today. I'm over it as well. I try to stay away from it as much as possible and I try to let it

Speaker 2:          03:11:36       peter out the massacre conversation is much more complex and you know, and the, the, the subject of mean you're talking about like a real crime rape, right? Did it happen? We don't know. It was a real issue just to. Women are accusing a guy, have a real crime. It's, there's a thing happening there with this other guy. This is not a conversation that guy's having about sexism at a company that he worked.

Speaker 3:          03:12:00       But the thing is, I take your point, but the midst good thing is similar to maybe not insofar as it relates to write, but insofar as it relates to what should the penalty be against cut for expressing an unpopular opinion? Yes. In an unpopular way.

Speaker 2:          03:12:11       No, you're right. You're right. He should fucking quit that stupid show and uh, get a podcast because we always got enough skanks go listen to his gut race wars as well. I've been on that show with everybody else. Go fuck yourself with the people. He doesn't support josh steps. Fuck off. Exactly. And if you want to hear sam harris and hannibal buress going to be released within the next few weeks. Few weeks. Fucking put it out, man. What are you doing? Why are you clinging to it? Trying to build up attention. No, it wasn't. It was just a regionally planned for them. So if I want, if I was going to release it now because that was what just when sam was fitted into the schedule, I just throw it out there. It's already done, but it's so wild. But why you, why you call my producer? I don't want to hear it. Yeah, but why are you hanging out? Would really sit before we do that. Really? If you don't release it in a couple of days, we have a copy of that. We're just going to fuck it. Send it out there. Just kidding. Thank you josh. So people live. Everybody lives forward on all of your pod platforms. Joe. It's always wonderful. Always a pleasure. I really appreciate it. We've got to do this more often. Absolutely. Every tear, open invitation, you know that. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. See as soon you fuckers.
