Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Three, two. Hello Carl. Hello, Joe Rogan. Good to see you again buddy. Good to see you too. Is like Deja Vu. It was, I think it was eight months ago or so. Then I was on the podcast wasn't and it flew like that. Yeah, it does fly like that. Yeah. That's kind of scary. A little too quick. Yeah. I just turned 30 and 40 before you know it. Well, I was going to say 30 was the first one where I ever really stopped like 30 minutes before I turned 30. I actually took a moment and I was like, okay, you're 29. Enjoy your last 30 minutes of being 29 and when I hit 30 it was the first little inkling of. I guess this is kind of what a midlife crisis feels like because I have a three in front now and I'm not really not comfortable with that because I feel like I'm still a fucking 19 year old, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       Well it's a weird thing to be obsessed with your, your. It's an inevitable progression. Like to be obsessed with youth. Yeah. I love being in my twenties. Well, why would you love something that's going to go away real quick? Yeah, it's going to get old. It's nothing you can do about it. Just stay healthy. Yeah, and people who fight it, it's always easy to tell that when they go get plastic surgery and stuff. If you. If you do like one plastic surgery, sometimes somebody could get away with it, but if you do multiple, all everybody knows almost immediately. You ever watched that show? Botched. I didn't know. I just started getting into it. I accidentally watched it. I turned the TV on and it was just on like when I turned the TV on and I was like, what in the fuck? And this lady was getting her nose repaired because it had collapsed because she had gotten so many plastic surgeries on her nose that are sinus had caved in so they had to take a chunk of her rib proper knows, but then then the, the tissue inside was dying.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       One of those guys wants to come on. They found out we were talking about it. So he wants to, I don't know how many times can you talk about plastic surgery, Dr. patient. Not Patient fucked up, but what's the doctor going to try to do pitch your audience on getting to know the opposite? I think he's probably against the repair guy. Oh, so what shows about repairing people that fucked up and you know, it looks so primitive to when you see how they do it, like the way that they do. I noticed this about wisdom teeth when I got my wisdom teeth pulled out, they literally just go in there like you would expect for like a car repair and they're just like, all right, time to rip it out. And you see them like leaning on him pulling it and you're like, oh I thought this was more advanced than this, but it's really not step on your cheek. And I actually went under for my wisdom teeth because I've heard. I know I'm such a bitch, but I, I thought so. I guess I got the Michael Jackson stuff, the propofol. I think it was, I was, it was a nice. It's weird because you just, they tell you to like count back down from 100 and 199 and I remember stop.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       Oh my God, that's so terrible. That's knee surgery. What is going on here? What stock? Whatever the fuck they put in as Neiman and he's trying to get it out. Oh my Jesus. Oh cool.

Speaker 1:          00:03:17       So yeah, the moral of the story is we actually don't know what we're doing as human beings and we're still obviously very primitive. Even the advanced stuff is super primitive. That's what that shows. Well, I don't know, maybe that guy just fucked up. I don't, I don't think I've ever seen that before. But isn't it for everything? Like even with those jobs, don't they do the same thing? Like Oh, we're going to chisel down the nose so they have to take like a fricking sander or something and just do it. Yeah. I had my deviated septum fixed and then they have to pack it. They pack it full of stuff and so you're all clogged up and they took big chunks of the bone out of the inside because what do they call it? Turbinates or something like that. I had a bunch of scar tissue calcification here.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       Sees when someone has cauliflower ears. Yes. Yeah. Fighters. Usually you get that in your nose too if your nose has been broken a bunch of times because what? What? That cauliflower ear is his blood under the surface of the skin calcifies and it becomes essentially a rock. Have you touched someone's California in? It's literally like there's a rock in there. It's really kind of crazy. Will you get that inside your nose to when your nose had been broken a bunch of times and it bleeds in the inside the tissue and then it turns into this really hard thing that blocks all your sinuses, so if you put a hole in it, what happens? It's a rock. It's a rock. Okay. It's calcium rock. Have you ever seen those videos of like cysts when they drain the cysts? Do you ever see that lady's a instagram page Dr?

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       Pimp? No, because I don't want to throw up. You need to go to Dr Pepper. He's going to do it. Isn't he doing it? She's great. She's hilarious too. She. She like. She loves it. She thinks and fun. I bet you get to a zillion views to. Oh my God, she's got more instagram followers than me, I think. Wow. How many? She got point nine while she doesn't have as many as me, but she is. She has a lot. Did you ever have bad acne at any point in your life? I had some pretty decent acne when I was in high school or get a good one. How about that one? It. Yeah, that one. When you had your cursor on try that one. That one looks like they're going to open that sucker up. Don't nothing. Nothing. Let's keep going. Still going. That ain't shit. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       I will say that it's a nightmare once. Let's find some other ones. Jamie. The Look of that is disgusting, but I think it's universally agreed upon that the feel of getting a big pimple and popping it properly. It feels amazing. Look at this. Some sort of a cyst. Someone's head. Oh, can you stop it? Yeah. He's got a bulging system. Looks like a fucking eyeball dude. Oh, it's like a marble. Oh my God. I'm never good again. Elite again. You'll fine. Oh, I just want to eat any cysts. Yeah. That's like the side of someone's head weight and it didn't even actually like totally pop out either. While those things are stuck, I mean that's part of your skin's protein tissue. I used to have pretty bad acne when I was younger and I had accutane. They gave me accutane and that stuff worked. I mean they say that there's a small chance that like I guess in maybe one percent or point, oh, one percent of cases.

Speaker 1:          00:06:21       Some people got depression and so they said there's a risk of suicide with this, but I never. It never affected me in that way at all. And it really just zonked your sebaceous glands and your just good. Like it just, it's almost a cure. Yeah. My friend Andrew Santina had it for the same reason, but he said he got the side effect is there. He did, yeah. On one hand it was amazing because the skin cleared up and the other hand he's never felt so bad and it's alive. Wow. Yeah, but you don't know what to do because you feel bad if you have acne, feel bad if you take the medication, but the medication will knock out all the acne. Well, I also take, I don't take accutane anymore, but I actually take finasteride for hair and they say trump takes that to. And then there were some doctors, I don't know how credible this is, where there were some doctors who were like, that stuff is not that great in terms of mental health.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       No, that's Propecia, propecia and the same thing, same thing in inhibits dihydrotestosterone, which does cause depression and some people I think are, are he said that his depression was linked to when he started taking propecia. I take it. I don't, I've never. It's never affected me that way. It decreases your testosterone though. Kills Your boners. Well, mine are all right there. All right. How would they be if you didn't take it? I guess double or triple. You tell me. I don't know, but the thing is I wouldn't look good. I feel like you really pull off a bald head very nicely. Whereas I'd look like a leukemia patient. Do you think so? I do get a decent sized head dude. I mean, come on. I wouldn't look good, but look at me. First of all, I would have to go to the gym way more than I do now and I'd have to get tattoos everywhere to look.

Speaker 1:          00:07:55       Yeah, if you want to look like a bad ass with a bald head, of course you do. There's this guy, there's this wrestler for Wwe, I forget his name, but he had really long greasy hair, like the typical wrestler hair. And then he recently decided to shave his head and he pulled it off nicely. It looks way better with a bald head. He had, um, he, he's just one of those guys where you looked gross with the really long hair that was greasy. But when you got, when you went bald, okay, now you look normal. That Greasy Harrison new thing. It's like the John Wick hair greasiness in the hair. Yeah. When remember when Keanu reeves was John Wick, it was always greasy. I don't remember that. No, it's a good movie to listen to or watch rather when you're on the treadmill. This is doing a cardio challenge, a good one tag. Greasy. But it seems like Gel people make fun of me because Gel they say uh, so like 19 nineties and I'm still wearing it. Creature of habit. It's just chill. It's available. People will make fun of you for everything. That's true. Yeah. Give them a chance, dude. I did a powder on my face the other day because I was under these lights and I did feel silly as I put it on.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       It's a little weird. Like, why can't I just be shining? Yeah. What's going on? People terrified of sweat. Yeah. The problem to me was pasty and shiny, so super white and shiny and it just looked gross. It looks like I'm unhealthy. So of you were like a bronze bronze. That's slightly better but still kinda gross. So you were saying that you got into it? Well you asked Chris Christie something. Oh yeah. Political, political or what is political as Jamie was saying, it's like comicon for political dorks. Exactly. That's exactly correct. Yeah, and it's weird because what they do, Joe, is they invite like, um, like establishment media figures and some politicians, but then they also invite new media figures like me and our worlds do not mix. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, many of them, I don't even think many of them knew who I was. Meanwhile, when you actually go to the people who were there, you know, it was all the new media people who are getting the most attention, right?

Speaker 3:          00:09:53       Where you have guys like Bill Kristol walking around who was in the Bush administration and people are like, who? Who are you? So it's a very weird thing going on there. Well, Kudos to them for recognizing that new media has such a place and it's just media. I mean at this point I think that this whole concept of new media versus obese, it's just media, but there's independent, uncensored untethered media, which is why one more popular. Yeah, of course. Yeah, exactly. Tribe watching one of those ABC nightline or one of those fucking political shows, terror and then try watching something on youtube where people get to be free with their language and free with their expression, not beholden to any executives are producers and yeah, so they get it but they don't get it, get it. Because when I went to the Chris Christie thing, they had it in this giant room and about 25 percent of the room was full and then for one of my debates that I did a few panels but one debate, they put me in like the smallest room and we had all the seats full and people standing up and packing the room so they get it but they don't get it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:58       Get it to, to them, the new media people are kind of like an afterthought. Like okay, we'll have them because you know, they should be here, but they don't. They don't realize that the draw is not Chris Christie. The draws, the new media people. Well Chris Christie and that's not just me, but I just wanted to clear up under anymore. He's not. I mean like who is he? Why would they think that he could fill a place because he's been on tv a lot, but I want to be clear. I'm not even just saying, oh, leftwing new media, which obviously is what I would be, but even the Ben Shapiro types, of course he has a big audience when he comes. He's got a giant. Yes, exactly, but it's so. It's all the new media people who are popular and the rest of them are not. Did you go to some sort of a concert while you were there? Oh No, this is. But they gave you. This is how you got in the building without them giving you a hard time to keep it forever. No, I just haven't. I didn't think about snipping it off yet, but now I'm wishing I did because we were talking about it. There's some dorks that go to coachella and they keep the fucking thing. Yeah. Yeah. No, this is. This is coming off soon. I'll tell you. Not Scared to

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       take that big ass knife. I'll cut off a finger by accident if I use that thing. It'd be fun. Just so everybody knows, this is what I'm talking about. Jamie just gave you a pair of scissors if you want those. Oh yeah, I'll do that. So anyway, don't take it off under pressure me if you want to keep it on. I'm not a bracelet guy in the first place. So that's a weird thing to be a bracelet guy. Like a lot of beads, like you're really trying hard to be spiritual. Here we go and that's not me or ice. If you want a diamond it up. Like if you're a rapper and you and a lot of ice on your wrist. I did use to wear earrings. I did use to do that. And I see in your face that you want to mock me at this moment I had earrings.

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       Oh you did? You probably had the old nineties hoop earrings. I had a hoop and a diamond stud, but it wasn't even a diamond. It was a cubic Zirconia. Yeah. And has it ever happened in the history of the world that you know, a, a woman has walked up to a man and said to a man, you know, I wasn't attracted to you, but then I saw your earring probably happened in the eighties. Somebody probably said something like that in the eighties. Just just because you're so bold, you've got a hole in your ear. Took a chance. Yeah. I guess that had a counter culture vibe to it. You hearing little cutie man, you had a baby face know the other things just to earpiece. That's a hook. That's the thing that goes back to hold it in place. So you only had it on one ear.

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       On the left hand side, it didn't go like full rockstar with a double hoops. Axl Rose Word on the street is that if you only do the right ear, you're supposed to be a signal that you're gay. That was the word at one point in time. But is that true or is that just people talking? Shit. Oh, I don't know. I had it on my left ear because that's what I had heard. I remember that too, like don't you, if you could do both and that's not considered gay, but if you did the right ear alone, that was considered good, but if you did both, either a pirate or you're in a band.

Speaker 1:          00:13:52       I did have both at one point and it's funny because when people see old pictures of me, they say I either look like the Jersey, like a jersey shore wannabe or like a backstreet boys wanted me because I looked because I had the earrings in and I had the hair totally spiked and yeah, that was the style at the time. While you're also running a risk because you've got like a little bit of facial hair. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have a very masculine. No a beard, but you've got something going on. You're definitely a man or a woman undergoing hormone replacement therapy. You got that Chaz Bono type thing. It's um, this is called a lazy man's beard because I can't even even really grow a beard. So it's just this is what it is when I get lazy. You got a little something going on though?

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       Yeah, I guess so. Maybe it's the finasteride just had the mustache itself. That would be kind of creepy. No mustaches. I'm going on a jihad against mustache because I think for whatever reason they look more ridiculous than full facial hair. I don't know why. Some people like, like Sam Elliott, the actor. I don't know who that is. I know. I know Tom Selleck. I've seen roadhouse, but which guy is it enrolled? Everybody knows who. It's not the main character of Patrick swayze. Oh my. Yeah, but he's got the. He's got the mustache. What a man. But the GRANDPA vibe going on, but he didn't always go to roadhouse. Go to look at that. Sam Elliott and. Yeah, but he's a great voice. Nobody's blowing him because he has a mustache. Easy blow his fucking game area. So look, get that. Come on. I mean the one. Love it with the hair right now there.

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       Are there that semen roadhouse? Yeah, but that's a full beard. That's more of a full beard. That's true. And that looks better on him. I don't know that. Oh, come on now. I don't think a go to that one right there. I don't think a goatee looks as ridiculous as a mustache alone. Some guys can pull it off, you know? It's a bold choice, but he can't look. You can't look overly artsy with it. You know what I mean? You can't or you can't. No, you can't. If you're, if it looks like you're tied to your goatee as a matter of your identity, then it's a problem. But if it's just a dude who seems like he's rocking a goatee, he just decided one day to rock a goatee, then it's all right. You know what kind of died out the soul patch, the soul patch.

Speaker 1:          00:16:04       Yeah. I haven't seen one of those in forever. You know, that kind of went away. Did you ever have any facial hair or. No, just beard beards. I grew it way out at one point in time because, uh, there's a guy named Evan Tanner who was an mma fighter that was known for having a big, thick, crazy beard. He was a really interesting guy and he really nice guy too. And he died in. He went on sort of a walkabout and decided to go in death valley and camp out and um, he ran out of water. I couldn't find his water and dying from heat and a lot of us were pretty broken up about it. So a bunch of people online decided to grow out our beards for a certain amount of months. That's me with a full beard. Wow. So you get a almost. You could get a cave man. Beard going if you wanted to. Yeah, I get a full beard. Yeah. And that's me trimming around the cheeks because my shit creeps all the way up to my nostrils. Yeah. Yeah. I grew that out for a couple months. I forget how long we decided to grow.

Speaker 1:          00:17:05       What are you doing? Listen, that was when he wanted to play Robert Shapiro didn't need to do that for the Oj movie. I feel like it was okay. Maybe it's just, yeah, that this verifies every single, you know, whisper about John Travolta, tickle a Baltic or it is just a, it's right there for typically involves. Anyway, so the Chris Christie thing. Yeah. So I'm in Politiken. He's what? What was he doing exactly? There you are. Yeah. You want. You can play it if you want. Okay, please. Kyle questions. Chris Christie, anti marijuana. Watched

Speaker 4:          00:17:49       that clip like 40 times over.

Speaker 1:          00:17:53       You pause that for a second. I just wanna explain that to Joe. I don't know if you know what I'm referencing there, but during the Republican primary there was one debate where Chris Christie just totally destroyed Marco Rubio's chances of becoming president because he kept repeating himself over and over, giving the same talking points and Chris Christie pointed that out and then Mark Rubio did it again and Chris, Chris, he was like, there he goes again. There he goes again, and the room exploded. And it was that interaction where everybody where Rubio tanked in the polls and finished him off. So my strategy with Christie was, I'm going to start this off by giving them credit on something to disarm him, and then I'm gonna hit him with the real question for a sport

Speaker 4:          00:18:31       in regards to the opioid epidemic, you care deeply about that generation to, to study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, legal, recreational. Marijuana would help fight the opioid epidemic, so knowing that and knowing that 62 percent of Americans now favor, favor full legalization, why not supportive

Speaker 5:          00:18:59       play out, let it play

Speaker 4:          00:19:03       epidemiological studies from Harvard Medical School for Stanford to tell you the exact opposite. Okay. Pause right there.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       His giant problems with epidemiology studies and he should know that. Yeah, so my studies for sure, epidemic epidemiology studies that basically a questionnaires, you know, you don't, you don't take into account all sorts of other issues that these people do in their lives and also like when when you're dealing with those kinds of studies, a person could be doing marijuana but also be drinking a lot but also be doing other things. So if what the argument is that it's a gateway drug, the only way that argument works is if you somehow or another track someone and saw that marijuana made them change their opinion on doing other drugs because a lot of these people are just doing drugs and they do marijuana as well. Shouldn't say, well look, we've shown these through these epidemiology studies that marijuana is a gateway drug because they started smoking marijuana and then they went to do heroin.

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       They probably were going to do heroin anyway. Yeah, exactly. That's really what's going on. Sure. There's no fucking gateway drug. That whole idea has been dismissed. That's like saying water is a gateway drug to rape every rapist, drinks, water, you know? It really is the almost that stupid. So do you think that when there was a little bit of applause, because he answered me quickly, do you think that that beginning of the applause was for my question or for him? Him saying no and respond hundred percent for you because we were debating that. I wasn't sure. Now let's do it again. Play it again. It's really clear.

Speaker 4:          00:20:39       Why not?

Speaker 5:          00:20:46       I, I couldn't tell epidemiological

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       studies for both Harvard Medical Schools here in this effort, Stafford, that tell you the exact opposite and say that marijuana is still a gateway drug and that people who try marijuana between the ages of 14 and 18 are three times more likely three times more likely to try opioids or methamphetamines than people who don't, and I just don't believe that what we're in the midst of a drug addiction crisis that we need to legalize and other drugs.

Speaker 6:          00:21:16       Clearly he's got a food addiction. Food addiction is far more dangerous than marijuana. Marijuana on its own has killed. No one ever. Half a million people die every year from being a fat fuck. That's. That's the facts. Yeah. This guy is a part of a real death epidemic and if you were mean, you would bring that up. This motherfucker brings a fucking bank robber size bag of m and m's to a football game. He's ridiculous. He's ridiculous. Talking about marijuana and marijuana being a gateway drug. The whole idea of it is stupid like smoke marijuana or don't smoke marijuana, but the point is marijuana doesn't kill you. It's really that simple. Now, if you're saying that marijuana causes you to do all sorts of other things, you've got to have some direct pathway that shows that it changes your inhibitions. It changes the way you think about things.

Speaker 6:          00:22:12       That's never been done. If anything, what gets people to try drugs is when you tell them that marijuana is dangerous and then they smoke marijuana and go, this is Shane dangerous not doing to me. I feel great the next day. There's nothing wrong. All it does eat a pizza. You know, I got a giggle. I watched a bunch of cartoons. My friends. We had a great fucking time. That is the misinformation aspect of it is more dangerous than the idea that it's a kate. Some sort of a gateway. I agree with all of that. Now. I wanted to pounce when he said that, but you have to understand this was his town hall, so I knew that I was. First of all, I was going to be shoved to the side very quickly anyway because there was a whole big line behind me. It'd be wrong about people clapping.

Speaker 6:          00:22:54       They might have really clear, he said that was wrong. I'm sure some of the people in the room were there to see him and they agree with him because it was his town hall, but I wanted to pounce, but I knew I can't really go back and forth like it's a debate. So what I did is whenever I knew I could interject just a little bit, I pushed him on it. And you're gonna see that in a second. What is a weird background with like a bird? It's in 19 eighties. Backdrop that they put up, but what is it? What does it say? It's as political as it says. Polydoconol with a weird. A weird drawing is weird, right? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:23:30       But I wouldn't what we do alcohol, toothpaste back in the tube. And that's a big important article about marijuana because once you legalize this goes back to the two. You can't do it because we tried. It's called prohibition and it didn't work. She didn't stay legal in California because it's fine. Listen, I hit the states, have the right to do what they want to do on this, but. But what I would tell you is that broad legalization of marijuana, in my view, to alleviate or even minimize your current prices and in fact in some ways may add to it, and I will also say that I almost never agreed with the teacher's union in any state anywhere, but the Colorado Education Association has said this year that the single biggest challenge for their members to educate middle schoolers and high schoolers in Colorado legalized marijuana, that kids are coming with gummy bears and other types of edibles and their high school, their high, the good part of the time, and it's making it much more difficult for them to teach. That's the Colorado Education Association. You, I'm sure at this very moment, if they were watching, will be appalled to know that. I agree with that. I agree with them on that, but it. I respectfully disagree with your point of view. Thank you sir.

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       So he actually changed his position slightly because when he ran for president he said, not only am I against marijuana being illegal at a federal level, I wouldn't even let the individual states decide whether or not they want legal marijuana. So in other words, he would prosecute the states like Colorado and California that have legal marijuana using federal law. And right there he softened his position slightly and he said, well, leave it up to the states and let them decide. So anything that's because he knows he'll never be president. No, I think he still wants to be president. There's no fucking way I think he's going to run again. No, I don't know if he's going to run in 20 slash 20, but 20 slash 20 for some serious. First of all, the uh, the odds of that guy's going to make it eight more years with that fair point.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       Morbidly obese carcass. He's moving his hand around with does it need get a stapler? Didn't he get his stomach fucking suit? You know, somebody pointed that out. I didn't know that. I never saw those stories. I'm not denying that it's true, but I just never heard it. But if he did, it didn't work while I had a friend who ate through two of those. He, he, uh, when you're a d, that's what I'm saying anyway, about food. He's addicted to food that's like, this is unquestionably, he's an addict. Do you think anybody's said that to him in his life or an I look. Look how much thinner you go. Okay. Okay. And he did this. Oh, I guess he did this before the presidential race because he wanted to make it. But then he got fat again. Yeah. So he was wrote ton before. He was like a bag of water before and then you know, he, he trimmed himself down.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       Yeah. And it's funny because I don't think in any way he realizes the hypocrisy of having his own, um, you know, issue with food and he would argue, hey man, listen, I'm going to eat what I want it to freedom choice. But when comes to freedom for somebody to decide to tweak their consciousness slightly, all of a sudden he says, you shouldn't be allowed to do that. Well, that's where it's preposterous. The idea that you mean even with what he said about alcohol didn't make any sense. Like would you make alcohol illegal? What we try to read, it's called prohibition. Okay, but let's pretend that you had some sort of an ability to keep that from going sideways. Again, let's start from the beginning. Would you want alcohol to be legal or not? If you could wave your hand and and there would be no more problems that are alcohol associated.

Speaker 1:          00:27:15       Would you do that and make it illegal versus give a grown adult the possibility of deciding whether or not they want to drink or not drink? Yeah. He's not being consistent and his logic, that's the point is that he's willing to say I'm thinking about donuts, but he even. He even mentioned prohibition there, but that makes my point, not his point. Yes, because that's when the mafia got incredibly powerful because you pushed all the alcohol sales underground and they got all the power and the money is a result of it and that's when crime a shot through the roof. So if you want to decrease violent crime and the drug war. Yeah, I mean, look, we talked to people in Mexico and the United States and our hunger for illegal drugs is a reason why the cartel got so huge when we were kids. When I was in high school, there was no Mexican cartel.

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       Yeah. It was never discussed. It was not an issue. There was no discussion whatsoever about violence from Mexico. That is an incredibly recent thing. In fact, I did MTV spring break, I want to say it was back in 2002. I was hosting this spring break thing for MTV when fear factor was just on the air and it was like one of those publicity things that we did and there was no worries about going to Mexico. Mexico 10 was nothing. It was just like, hey, we're going to Mexico. Okay, cool. It's like, hey, we're going to go to new. Mexico was no different. Yeah. You know, and now it's like you're going to Mexico. What about the gangs? What about the violence would have put the cartel people would go to Tijuana all the time. And you would worry because it was seedy and crazy and you know, it was a lot of pickpockets and thieves, but it was never cartel violence.

Speaker 1:          00:29:01       Cartel violence is literally within the last 15 years or so, and our strategy had the opposite of the effect they wanted. So you get rid of El Chapo and you think, okay, if the decapitation strategy, we got rid of the top guy, now we're good. But what happened is you had his cartel became fractionalized and then you had people fighting who were top officials in his cartel and they both wanted to become the head guy. And so then there's a war between those guys and their gangs in the street. So it's the exact opposite of what they say they want, which is let's decrease the violence and make sure everything's running peacefully. And also an amazing fact that I just learned about a few weeks ago. There are 200,000 deaths that have happened as a result of the drug war. 200,000 that's crazier in America. Know the US and Mexico.

Speaker 1:          00:29:47       That seems low. You think that's low? I thought that was so high. I mean, I guess because it's been going on since Reagan, so one would think, okay, it's more Nixon. I'm sorry Nixon, not Reagan. Right, but that was like inside the United States, but it'd be like how do you classify like what was done because the drug war, you'd have to go with all the stuff that happened in Vietnam with heroin. I mean how many people were killed including via. I think this is just for theu , s and Mexico and I think it's tied to what we were just talking about, the cartel violence and then people get caught in the crossfire and they get their lives destroyed. It still seems low to me. Yeah. And it's over a trillion dollars has been wasted on this. I'd be interested in talking to someone who is an expert, get Chris Christie on, but who's a real expert on Mexico and what happened with the cartels, the rise.

Speaker 1:          00:30:37       The cartels because I'm sure there was always organized violence in organized crime, but like what happened where it exploded to the point where. I mean, I was just talking to a friend of mine who said he won't go to Mexico and I'm like, I've been in Mexico, man, Mexico is great. I was talking about a Punto Meta. You ever go to [inaudible] to me now it's beautiful. It's like near Puerto Vallarta. It's gorgeous. So beautiful. But we were. We were staying at a resort and A. I was with my family and they have these golf carts that you could drive around the resort on and we said, let's go to the town. Let's go see what that. There's a town right outside of the resort. Let's go see what it's like. You go out of the resort in a block. You hit a military station where there's men that are standing by on armored vehicles.

Speaker 1:          00:31:26       So I said to my wife, I said, do you know why they're there? They're there to guard the resort. I know that's what this is. And she's like, you really think so? I go, I know. So why are they standing here on top of this? They have these steel plates with machine guns. These guys have flak jackets on and they're standing there on top of these military vehicles standing there. I'm like, well, they're ready. They're on standby. This fucking thing is right outside the gates of the four C's. Yeah, there to make sure that they protect their tourism industry. Yeah, and that's all directly tied to the drug war will. The drug war has had a massive impact on Acapulco Aco. Poco used to be the place where everybody would go. They said the Vegas of Mexico and they were trying to rival Vegas and now that's where they say there's mega cartel violence.

Speaker 1:          00:32:14       They don't even call them cartels now, and I will say there are mega cartels. They're fighting for more power. Well then not only that, there's been some violence where they purposely killed people that were staying in resorts to sort of send a message like, oh my goodness. Yeah, and there's dead politicians to where they found these mass graves. Did you hear about that? Every now and then they'll stumble across a 200 person mass grave and then whoever's not being killed, they're usually being by the cartels. So some experts. I've said this is literally a narco state at this point and I'm curious what this new guy's going to do because there's new guys supposed to be anticorruption and hopefully, I don't know what his position is on the drug war, but I'd be surprised if his position was not, hey, let's find another way to do this because now world opinion has shifted.

Speaker 1:          00:32:57       I mean, in the US, 62 percent of the country says let's legalize marijuana. And that's honestly, I think people are thinking that without even realizing that there's a giant spike in crime because it's illegal. They don't even know. Yeah, I agree. And there are also killing journalists in Mexico. They're killing police. There's a lot of people that are dying in Mexico because the cartel violence, you know, we were talking about that Jamal could Shogi guy before the podcast started and how disturbing this whole thing is. And for folks who don't know what we're talking about, fill people in on. Okay, sure. So, uh, Jay Mollica Shogi is uh, a journalist who actually worked for the Washington Post and he went into the Saudi embassy in Turkey to get a marriage license in Istanbul to get a marriage license. So for him and his wife and he never got out, they killed him, dismembered him, used a bone saw, and then they even went as far as to cover it up or they had a body double go in and they gave him a fake beard and they had him wear his clothes and walk out.

Speaker 1:          00:34:00       Is there video of the body double? There is, there is. In fact, CNN had it. I know yesterday I was looking at the CNN video that had it. Um, so yeah, Saudi Arabia, now brazenly killing journalists. And I'll tell you what, you came up with a bunch of different versions of the story. Oh yeah. But why they did it. Here's the body. There you go, there's him and then the guy on the right with hair. Why would they have a guy with hair as a body double? Think about how much this had to be planned out to have a body double. Right, but why they give the body was bubble. If you're going to be a body, double shave your head dude. The other guy's bald. That's crazy. So they didn't even do a good job at faking their murder, but it's the worst fake ever. Yeah, because the guy's got a full head of hair. Yeah. It's not great. Not Terrible. How shoes onto. He had different shoes. Yeah, I mean that's, that's the worst body double. It's got dark hair and they're saying this is the guy. Look, he's fine walking around. No issues at the body. Double Knot. A hair double. I guess.

Speaker 1:          00:34:57       I mean if you're going to have a body double shave. The guy's fucking heads how you walked in those different shirt and everything. Oh, that's a body devil. So says hair color is different too. I mean, he's got dark hair. This guy's got gray here. The thing that's driving me nuts about this is so now at this is getting a lot of press attention and I'm happy it's getting a lot of press attention, of course, but the reason why it is is because he's part of the elite class in the sense that he's a journalist and now you have the people from the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN, they can relate and they go, oh my God, they're killing journalists. Now. This is crazy. Look at the precedent that this sets, but what people don't know is for the past two or three years, Saudi Arabia has been waging a literal genocide in Yemen and that's not an exaggeration, so they've blockaded the.

Speaker 1:          00:35:37       They're not allowing in medicine. There's a cholera epidemic happening there. Millions of people are sick. They have people dying of starvation because they're not allowing in food or humanitarian aid. They're bombing hospitals, they're bombing schools, they're bombing open air markets, so they're doing a literal genocide and that got very little coverage, but then with this journalist now finally starting to get some coverage, but I'm curious what happens moving forward in terms of how will the US respond to it, because as I'm sure you already know this, I mean they care more about that $110,000,000,000 weapons deal that they just had with the Saudis than they do about the lives of humanities or the lives of journalists. Yeah. The. The idea of him being really valuable. It's not. It's not just that he's a part of the elite. It's that there was a conspiracy to do so that they think came from upon high.

Speaker 1:          00:36:21       Yeah, and there was 15 people that they're saying, I flew in from Saudi Arabia and one of them was a forensics expert who knows how to cover up evidence, knows what evidence is, what's like a movie. It feels like a movie. The bone saw things that been confirmed. They know that well at a bone saw. I heard that now the nickname for him in Washington DC is a, what would they say? Bone saw a solomon, his name is Mohammed bin Salman. They're calling them bone saw Solomon or something like that. Yeah, dude, it is. The stuff that's going on is just scary to me and then there's also some interesting geopolitical stuff happening around this. The head of Turkey is now using this as an issue to try to snuggle up to the US because he's got ambitions where he wants to like recreate the Ottoman Empire and of course Muhammad Bin Solomon, he has ambitions where he wants to dominate the Middle East so you have at the same time this weird ego battle between [inaudible] and Mohammed bin Salman and they're all trying to suck up to the US to basically get it so that we can.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       We do favors for them and we allow them to expand and on top of that, the story's changed multiple times, right? It's a story of what, five times first they said nothing happened to them, to him. Then they said we walked out fight and now they're saying that he was killed by people who overstep their bounds. That's right. Yeah. They keep changing the story and there's also stories that the. The consulate has video and audio evidence of the murder. That's what Turkey saying? Yeah, but they don't want to release it because then people will know how they're spying on them when they visit the consulate. I guess, so I didn't see that, but I'll take your word for it. Yeah, that was. See if you can find that. That was one of the things that was brought up yesterday that they don't want to release this video and audio evidence because if they do, then other people will know how they're spying on them when they visit.

Speaker 1:          00:38:09       Yeah, I could see that. I mean they should immediately cut off the arms, deal with Saudi Arabia. No more weapons for a regime that's doing the stuff that they're doing and we already knew that they behead people in the public square for sorcery, sorcery. Do they really? Yes. Sourcery for witchcraft to see for drug smuggling that they behead people in the public square for those things. Well, the the drug smuggling, that's a real problem. But you don't want any sourcery sourcery man. Did you ever watch that movie Dr. Strange. Look, you can get out of strange love. I think I saw a strange. I've never seen marvel comics character that there was a movie in 2017. He's one of the avengers. You know who Dr. St Jude. I have A. There's another thing I'm waging. Jihad on are a comic book based movies and I'll tell you what, I'm going to get a lot of dislikes for that.

Speaker 1:          00:39:03       But. So you didn't like black pants? You know, I, I bought a panther. I did not, but I racist. You must be racist Bro. You got me. I didn't see what condo forever. Actually the last one I saw was Batman. Which the Christian Bale one and just the voice alone, the voice alone. I said, fuck this. You didn't like it. I couldn't stand it. I said, that's so fake. I have to go. But my brother in law made a good point. He was like, yeah, but he's playing Batman and that's even more fake than the voice. So why is it the voice that turns you off to it? But I don't know. I just have a weird thing with superheroes because we know what's going to happen. Oh, the superior swoops in and saves the day. Yay through. Yeah. I was going to live. Give me something interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       But the new avengers movie had a lot of twists and turns like the hall couldn't be the hulk even when he was getting angry. Spoiler spoiler, spoiler. It fucked up the movie. The fucked up the movie because the whole couldn't be the. Why the fuck do you have the hall? Because he can't be the. Oh wait, I'm lying. I saw the hole with Edward Norton. Was he the hulk? And one of the movies? He was the Hawk way back when I saw that one too. The Hawk. Now I call them Buffalo. Mark Buffalo. Yeah. Because why not? He's a real. He's an activist, but he's certainly very vocal. Yeah. I don't know much about him. I just know I call them buffalo. Why? Because why not? It's funny. I laugh at it. That's all the matters for you. That's all that matters. He's a, but he's that guy.

Speaker 1:          00:40:26       He's always tweeting about political stuff and social social issues. It seems like. Very progressive. Very Open minded or at least very active. Sure. Constantly talking about stuff. Yeah. Yeah. You're not buying it. I just don't know anything about Mark Rothko so I can add nothing of substance. I can't be the hulk and still be that guy. I don't know. It's one of my favorite superheroes. So he was the hope to buffalo. He's the new Hawk now. He's the new home. Yeah, he's been the hulk for the last few years. Don't you hate how Hollywood just recycles the same stuff over and over? Well, the crazy thing to me is spiderman, because it's been like 80 spiderman and whenever a guy gets famous, be inspired by band, he's like, hey, look a little more money. They go, fuck you. You're going to make a new spiderman. Yeah. But they go with the surefire things that they know will make money.

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       Yeah. And that's the superhero stuff. Well, you could definitely relaunched spiderman and the hulk till the cows come home. And I guess Batman too. But the Ben Affleck, Batman people like. Nah. See that's another one I would never watch. Not Ben Affleck. That's the fucking. That's the no redoing superman again. Now I'll think God thing. You know what? If I was a woman right now, be pissed. Where's the Goddamn cat woman movies? Huh? We're super woman. Why has there not been a catwoman or a super? Was the last time there was a cat one and really very long ass time ago, there'll be another one. Give it time. They need to. One hundred percent of women were getting discriminated against in the world of superhero movies is only wonder woman. And she sought his fucking half naked. Who played wonder woman? Gal Gadot. Oh, that's the Israelis something. Wasn't she in the IDF Israeli military?

Speaker 1:          00:42:04       I think she was. Yeah, she, uh, Marquez. Who was just here. Marcus Brown. He was, he was showing how she got busted. She was doing some campaign for Huawei phones and she tweeted it using an iphone. See that? I hate that man. I would only push a product that I really agree with and believe in. I have a friend who was doing Samsung commercials and the entire time he was using an iphone and he was like, if they catch me using an iphone, they'll fire me and I don't care if I'm using a fucking iphone. So he had his iphone and the Samsung phone, but he never used a samsung phone. All his friends, he would text everybody or that you would do. We'd do on the iphone. Why wouldn't they just hire somebody who loves Samsung and is popular because they could do that better yet.

Speaker 1:          00:42:53       They should just looks. It's not like Sam. This was a long time ago though. I want to say that, that this was probably six, five or six years ago and back then the phones were not as good. Like there was a big difference between the iphone and android phones. Now there's not really that much of a difference. They're both pretty fucking awesome. Yeah, and I think that they just hire someone who's got some fucking integrity and doesn't lock [inaudible] yeah. How about that? Yeah, I'm kind of married to iphone by default because I've been stuck with it since the iphone four and I'm just too lazy to like because I don't even know exactly which things transfer over. If I were to go to a totally new phone, you know what I mean? Like obviously nothing almost, but what about my number? Would they be able to do that with my number at least, or no?

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       No, no. Real. Even your number would be a giant issue because you're married to the right chat or I'm. I've messaged and that I messaged thing we were talking about in the last podcast that I bought a pixel and I tried to switch over to a pixel from an iphone and my text messages wouldn't go through it because everyone was texting me using an I message and it wasn't sending it to a pixel. It was sort of turn to text then send to you? Nope. Nope. So that it was just disastrous. Well, they're, they're basically making it incredibly difficult for you to switch. So I even called up apple and have them take out my email from their system because I know my email is attached, the imessage, so take this out for the system, kill my message, just kill the whole system. Still wouldn't work.

Speaker 1:          00:44:25       I had wound up going back to apple. You mother fuckers. I don't know how because I know you've spoken about it many times so you're kind of a techie in the sense that you always get like the new phones and stuff here for with that. No, one of the dumbest techies that's ever walked the face of the planet, but I was to say I don't know how to do with stuff. I'm into stuff. I like stuff, but I don't. It's like a guy who really likes cars but as zero idea how they work. That's prudy. That's me. Yeah. But you still go through the hassle of ordering it and. Yes. Yeah. That seems like a pain in the ass. I would use the same phone for 10 years if I could. Really? Yeah. It's just not something I think of. What do I use it for?

Speaker 1:          00:45:01       I use it to text people and every now and then call and that's it. I am fascinated by technology and I'm always interested in where it's going and what they've got going on next and now and what's the latest and the greatest augmented reality is fascinating. We were talking about that. That's really interesting because that's supposed to be the next big thing, right? The how we could see because the phone I have, it's a, not a new new iphone, but you could do augmented reality games on so I could look like they're building blocks in the middle of this table and play a game where, you know, whatever member. When pokemon was hot and people are driving down the street playing pokemon in their car, they were driving crashing into trees and shit. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that. I used when I was a kid, I loved pokemon.

Speaker 1:          00:45:45       Pokemon came and went so quick. The point where everyone was using pokemon for like months. Yeah. And then it stopped. You're talking about the new one that everyone's using. Yeah. I'm talking to back. When did we all a game boy? I used to play it as a kid and then if you go back, like I tried to turn it on maybe two years ago to just see what it's like. It is the shittiest most basic game ever. It's pretty wack. It's pretty wack in comparison in what it showed me when people really got into that pokemon game is that people have, people are very easily amused and it's easy to turn them onto some new latest trend in latest trend being. What did you have to do jeff, to go out and get things. What are the, when, when you had to walk to where there were pokemon who were going to fight you and then you would, I think fight them.

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       And then if you beat them, you have them in your collection, your video game, but not the newest one. Fight them would you use. So my understanding is you go into the APP and by the way, people can be made fun of me right now because I could be wrong. And you're walking around with the phone and you say, Oh, okay, down the corner, uh, and make a right. And that's where I see a pokemon and then you go down there and then, you know, you fight that pokemon and I guess make your stronger and catch that one I think is the way it works.

Speaker 1:          00:47:05       You sound like you're bored by that concept. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't. I, I did it like once or twice and then I was like, I guess it was also one of those things where people were losing weight because they were walking around a lot, so they were touting the positive benefits of it. Like look, people love walking for miles kind of cardio compared to the cardio you've been doing is like absolutely nothing. They're not like sprinting to get a pokemon. You're just. The Cardio I've been doing is totally unsustainable though. I've got five hours one day yesterday, five and a half hours and then another hour at night. Dude, isn't that going to like hurt your knees seemed good. Everything seemed pretty good right now. Everything's great. Wow. So everybody listening right now, you guys are lazy bitches because he ran for five hours. What did you do?

Speaker 1:          00:47:46       It's not smart. It's like A. I used to make fun of people that did ultra marathons and stuff like it's not, it's not unhealthy. Like I'm not doing myself a service by doing this. Like my body's like Jesus Christ. Dude. Like when I get home at night and I crashed, I crashed hard. Do you sleep better? Tired. I sleep like a brick and then I wake up. I'm like really? Already get up. And I'm like fuck, I got to get to the gym within 30 minutes because I have a podcast in three hours. I have to get a solid two and a half hours of cardio in. In the morning. Yeah. Solid two and a half hours. Eighty percent. You know, so I'm cranking. I mean it's hard and I'm listening to. I was listening to stuff to blow your mind when they were talking about a flying creatures are quite so quantile and terror attack titles and the origins of the quantal.

Speaker 1:          00:48:39       A myth in as tech Mexico. And you could watch like the full length movie of the titanic as your workout. I've watched a bunch of movies, like yesterday I watched two solid moves. I finally got to see, get out, never saw. Get out was great. It was. I really liked. That was a very, very good move. Those again, movie like, God, that girl is so evil. Spoiler alert. Second Annual Pokemon go fast draws over 21,000 attendees in Chicago. So there's over 180,000 people that played Chicago. Remember, do you remember when Hillary Clinton is still played it? Do you remember when Hillary Clinton said, all right everybody, I need you to poke a mon, go to the polls. And then everybody in the audience was like ditching. You never saw that. No. Now you're, you're, you're a progressive but you're not necessarily a democrat. Well, I mean, you're not necessarily like in support of anyone who's not a loyal Democrat.

Speaker 1:          00:49:42       So I describe myself as populous left. That's how I would describe myself. Populist means, you know, I support the policies that would help ordinary people. Um, and I vote based on the issues. And so if there's a politician that's for the policies I'm for, that's what I'm going to support and that's what I'm going to argue for. Um, so I'm very, very critical of what we call corporate Democrats, which are Democrats that represent Wall Street and represent big Pharma and, uh, the military industrial complex and for profit health insurance companies. And I'm super critical of the Republicans also. So, you know, that's why I co founded a group called Justice Democrats. And the whole idea was to basically do a populace, left takeover, the Democratic Party where you get rid of the corporatists in the party and you have people who will represent the working class. And uh, we've been pretty successful so far.

Speaker 1:          00:50:32       They're still 26 justice Democrats were in the running and they can get elected. And there were, here's an amazing fact. There were four politicians in the House of Representatives that didn't take any corporate PAC money. There's about to be 41. And that'll happen because of Justice Democrats. Our evolution, which is Bernie Sanders Group, uh, the d triple c, which is another left wing organization. And basically what's happening is a people on the left who actually care about the substantive issues are standing up and saying, we're not going to take it anymore. And we're tired of being lied to by politicians and we want people who are going to actually represent us and represent working people. You know, that's a, I love that. And I love that approach and there's so much partisan politics and there's so many people that are just married to the idea of being connected to the Democrats that they're willing to overlook some really heinous faults.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       Any old blue just won't do as Nina Turner says that, and I love that phrase, great phrase because it's so just hacky and partisan to be like, no, I'm on your team, so are you going to vote for me here? Let me do some platitudes and some cliches about how we're stronger together and we're going to break down the barriers. And you know, it's like, well, I don't overtly hate minorities, so vote for me. It's like, oh, what a low bar. Give people something to vote for. That's a great point. I felt a lot of that during the Hillary Clinton campaign. Everybody was like anything but trump. So we're going to vote for her. But boy, if, let's just be honest, if you had a viable like Tulsi. That's right. Tulsa Gabbert, great candidates. You had Tulsi Gabbert and she was running for president and she's also a woman and she's also left wing, but she cares about the issues.

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       She cares about the issues. And she's Ernest. Yes. Like when you talked to her, you can tell she just isn't. I mean she's careful with her words because she's intelligent, not because she's deceptive. Yeah. And I would vote for her in a fucking heartbeat. There you go. I was just, we just messaging each other. She was messaging me about my netflix special and I said, run for president. I want you to run for president. I mean, that would be wonderful. I'm slightly fucking wind man. I think she can, but I think she could win. I'm slightly butthurt about Tulsi because when I was on your podcast last time, I plugged her in talking about how awesome she is. In fact, I think I'm the one who originally showed you who she was. Right. Did you know before? Maybe in that podcast many people. So you had heard about.

Speaker 1:          00:52:56       Well anyway, she comes on the show are definitely one of them. She comes on the show and talks about. Yeah, new media is a awesome and there's a lot of great people out there. She goes, Jimmy Dore, and then there's a pause and then you move onto the next topic. And I'm like, God dammit, Tulsi, I've plugged you, plug me Bro. I know I'm being incredibly petty and I don't even really mean what I'm saying because I would still support her as a sanitation 100 percent. So I mean it bro. This is some salt and it's headed your way to also show. Remember now? No, but she's great. She's great. The issues and um, yeah, she's a genuine person. That's what, that's what I got out of her, like what I got from talking to her. She's a genuine person and man, I mean maybe it's because she's from Hawaii and it's just a different place.

Speaker 1:          00:53:38       It's like, it's almost like a state that's a small town. I mean that's. Hawaii is very small. Yeah. I mean there's a million people in Honolulu, but you get outside of Honolulu, there's only a hundred thousand on the big island. I don't know how many Maui has, but I think it's only got a couple of hundred thousand. I've never been to Hawaii before, but it fucking great. It looks like a paradise. I mean the best is alumni. If you want to go somewhere and just chill ax, there's a four seasons and Lanai. The entire island has 3000 people living. Oh Wow. It's great. And you get real island. Hawaiians. Sure. They're not like if you go to Maui, they're wonderful people. They're great, but they've been groomed. You know what I'm saying? People have taught them how to talk like regular white people. Whereas in my alumni they're just fucking chilled out man.

Speaker 1:          00:54:30       And they just, they have that way of talking, you know, they talk and you know. But pigeon is no, it's a real interesting sort of A. I guess it's like a dialect of English he would call it, but they have really cool expressions. Like some of the, they say a lot of things it will choke like a, like if you talk about like what guy was explaining to me how many deer there were in this one place it goes, oh, it was a choke dear there was choked dear. So it's Kinda like a broken English with different words sprinkled. It's interesting. Use different words for different things. You'd have to be around them all the time, but there's also like a, just a way of talking. It's very, very interesting. That's kind of like, I think it's called pad wall. Maybe it's called. I think it's a people who are Jamaican who speak in English, but it's very broken English and probably real similar.

Speaker 1:          00:55:21       Yeah. Yeah. And they love to say bumble clot. What does that mean? Blood clot? I think mccullough. I think that's what it means, right? Blood clot. I know they also say blood clot. They say blood clot a lot. I think so, yeah. That should come up very rarely. I mean, unless you're a doctor, I guess it's a way of saying stuff, you know, something's terrible, but it means motherfucker. Oh mother bag. That's what bumper caught means. Not even close. The widest God is everyone in this room. I guess the technical needs, blood clot, blood clot. It's a medical term basically talking about sutures. Yeah. That's funny. Yeah, but that flight to Hawaii must be. It's not bad. It's five hours from here. It's five. I'm coming from New York. Do you fly here? You hang out for a couple days and you fly there. Interject again. Top definition on urban dictionary says it's a cloth rag to wipe ones anal region. Oh, that was my second guess would be the Bumblebee Bumba cloth. So bumble clot was some asshole who's wiping his ass. He's a cloth. Like you'd constantly

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       a douchebag cloth wipes, but as a, as a word to replace like fuck or the asshole or something like swipe right. It's awesome. I love that. I'll be blast waves. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't heard that one. Oh Wow. Last time I'm here to ask white. I haven't heard that in a long time. That's like Beavis and butthead. David, you're such a butt wipes anyway. You're white. Yes, very much so. That's clear. People can see that when you look at the potential candidates for 2020. Yup. Um, who, uh, on the left stands out is Gavin newsome. He just, he comes across as a little too politician. He and smarmy. That's how he striking me to you. You don't let them know. I mean, I'm sure if I had a conversation with him and we spoke about the issues, I would agree with him on most of the positions, but I don't know if he really believes it in means it because he's a politician.

Speaker 3:          00:57:19       Politician. Yes. There are politicians who I talk to you when I know that they mean it. Tulsi Gabbard will be one of those. Rocana would be another one of those. We spoke about him on the show as time I was here. Um, obviously Bernie Sanders is another one of those, you know, there's a really interesting politician and coming out of West Virginia. Now, I don't know if you heard about this guy. His name is Richard Odetta and he's running against a Republican named Carol Miller. Get this. He's running in West Virginia is super deep red, like big time Republican. Almost the most republican tide probably with Mississippi is the most conservative area in the country. So this district, trump won by 49 points. There's this Democrat Richard Odetta running. He's up in a poll against a Republican by five points. So. So you're probably thinking, how the hell in a, you know, a district like that.

Speaker 3:          00:58:05       Can a Democrat be leading? And the answer is very simple. He's populist and he's fighting for working people and he's run these amazing ads where he literally gave out his phone number and one of the eds and said, listen, if you're a constituent of mine and you have an issue, call me and I'll tell you what. If a lobbyist tries to come into my office, I'm going to kick him out. I don't want you in my office. I don't care about lobbyists, I care about the people. And he's running on all substantive issues. He's taking no corporate PAC money. He's for Medicare for all. So this is a guy who, you know, and by the way, he's a veteran in Iraq and Afghanistan and he's. Yes. And he did vote for trump, and now he's one of trump's harshest critics. And he said, listen man, I thought trump was going to be potentially good for working people, but it just turns out he wasn't good for working people.

Speaker 3:          00:58:47       So for example, trump ran as an anti outsourcing president. He was against Nafta and tpp and all that stuff. In trump's first year as president, there were 93,000 jobs that were outsourced. That's even worse than Obama. Obama had 87,000 jobs outsourced. So when you go through his record with a fine tooth comb, even like the unemployment rate being low, that's totally misleading because wages are falling. So if wages are falling and you can't just brag about your economy being wonderful and his tax bill, 83 percent of the benefits of the tax bill went to the top one percent. Would you say the wages are falling? How much they followed by A. They're not keeping up with the pace of inflation. So it's probably about one percent. So

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       the point is trump ran as a populist, but ultimately he was a fake populous. And he's not really helping to work in class. That's why his tax bill was, you know, he gutted the estate tax for example. That's not something that doesn't. That affects point. Oh, one percent of the population. So Richard, Oh, Jetta is this guy who voted for trump and he says, hey, I regretted, I think trump is wrong. And basically what he's saying is I'm the real populist candidate and he's a really inspiring candidates. Kind of amazing to see a plus 49 Republican district now potentially go democratic. And by the way, he's living proof of the point that I've been making since day one. If you have Democrats who are running and they actually care about the issues, I'm on a flight for working people. That's how you win. You know, the, the real problem is these labels in the first place, right?

Speaker 1:          01:00:05       Like Republican versus Democrat, like, yeah, the idea that we only have two different distinct parties that are viable options in 2018, just so fucking stupid to me. VR system. I don't like our system. I don't. I like parliamentary systems better. I wish we had the. When you said that the wages don't keep up with inflation and so they're down by about one percent, but how much is unemployment up on employment is down to three point odd percent and that is good. I'm not saying that's not good, but you just have to remember that that's not a very good economic indicator because think about it. This is an argument that was presented. I remember back when I was in college and a professor was challenging also on this notion about unemployment and he said, you do know we can create an economy that has zero percent unemployment.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       Right? And all of us in the flashlight. First of all, we didn't know that. Second of all, how do you do that? And he goes, slavery, everybody can be working, but that doesn't mean everybody's being paid or being paid. Yeah. So when to use unemployment as like your top economic indicator, it's just a shitty indicator. It's just not the best thing you can use. Right. Because even if people were working, it doesn't mean they're doing what they want to do, doesn't mean they're being paid a fair wage. Dude. Half of workers in America make $30,000 a year or less is true. That's true. If Jamie wants to fact check me on that, I'm more than happy to be fact checked. That's dark. Half of workers in America makes $30,000 a year or less now, but what about trump's always citing unemployment rates for African Americans or minorities that are lower than they've ever been before?

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       That could be true, but what do you think causes something like that? Is that something that's a trend that was established during the Obama administration that's slowly but surely moving into the position it's in now and he just caught that wave or is it directly a result of the decisions that he's made while he's in office? Well, it does have a lot to do with his tax bill because corporations are getting a tremendous amount of money in corporate profits are through the roof, so they're hiring. Right? That's the link to that. But again, we come full circle back to the wages conversation and remember this is all. It's temporary because look at what's happening to the deficit. For example, now I'm not a like a deficit hawk where I think it's such a gigantic issue, but the Republicans typically run as deficit hawks

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       and when you look at the deficit, it's gone up by 51 percent of all American workers make less than $30,000 a year. A lot of similar numbers, but it's all right around that wire. So the deficit is skyrocketing and that's something that's going to temporarily help, uh, those numbers that you were citing before those, during the Obama administration, what was that article? That's still the case? Two Thousand 15? No, I'm sure it is. I'm finding all sorts of stuff. This one's serious says that half of jobs in America pay less than $18 an hour. Can trump help? This is from August of last year since it's fall, right around. How's the car, Joe? It's a house. A car. It is a house car? Yeah. What was trump supposed to do and what did he not do? Like what, what was he claiming to do before he went into office?

Speaker 3:          01:03:03       So first of all, he said everything at the same time. So I could give any answer to that question because I'm curious to just pick on trump because I was one of the loudest screaming about how Hillary Clinton was the exact same thing. She's a politician who throughout her career she was on every side of every issue and trump, it was kind of the same thing. But the thing is trump actually got away with it because I think the way he acts as a politician, he acts like he has no filter and he's just a straight shooter sitting next to you at the bar. But the problem is like Rand Paul pointed out in the debate, he said, Donald Trump is a straight shooter without the truth. Like he's like pretending to be a straight shooter. So it depends on what issue you're asking you about. I can tell you what trump said, you just have to give me the specific issue you want to know.

Speaker 3:          01:03:48       Like foreign policy. You won't talk about that for a little bit. Sure. So on foreign policy, you know, half the time Donald Trump said, and there's so many tweets of him saying this before he was president, before he ran that we need to get out of Iraq and Afghanistan. It's always the time. It's so stupid. Why are we the, we need to rebuild our own country and you know, those are tweets where I read that and I go, I totally agree with that. Donald trump 100 percent. But then the other half the time when he was on the campaign trail, he spoke about how, um, you know, we need to bomb isis to smithereens and we need to wipe them out. And those things are kind of contradictory. Either you bring your troops home and you, you know, didn't think he would be able to fix everything really quickly. Wasn't that one of his premises? Typical trump bloviating like, I'm going to be tremendous. I'm going to be amazing. It's gonna be the best job you've ever seen over. It's not a bad impression, but you're going to change the tone. Well, it's because I'm not doing the full hand. You're doing good movement. The movement skill I have is the movement. Joseph Rogan. I call you Joseph.

Speaker 3:          01:04:46       What did you think personally when you saw Kanye with that? Insane? He's going to ask you about that to bipolar rant. Yeah. I feel kind of bad for him. I do and I'm not and I want to be clear. I'm really not saying that as a partisan thing because even if Bernie Sanders was president and Kanye West was in the office saying the exact same stuff, I'd still be like, Whoa, what is going on here? Yeah. Yeah. Did you burn him up the same way too? Because I remember when he left those black lives matter chick that cost him, but just stepped aside. That really did cost him. You think so? Yes. Yeah. People

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       do. You can't do. You can't just take the microphone away from someone you know. So here's an interesting question. Do you think this helped Donald Trump at all with black voters having cognac do that, but how much? A good number really? You think so too? Yeah, I do. I don't know. I don't know because I feel like there's A. Kanye West has been disinvited from a lot of cookouts now as a result of what he did with trump. Jamie's on black twitter. Jamie says not at all. From what I read, it did not in black twitter response has been very negative, so it was Kinda is really almost in a sense, blowing his own reputation on this, I guess. I don't think so. You don't think so? No. I think everyone who's a fan of Kanye West, who seen him blow up on Jimmy Kimmel and blow up on all these different people that have criticized him.

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       He's. He's obviously got mental health issues. When he went on that rant, I think it was in San Jose. Is that a concert? He said I didn't vote, but if I did vote, he was voted on trump and everybody went and then he wound up going into a mental hospital after that. Oh Wow. Checked into a mental hospital and then canceled his tour. Remember that? I do remember that. That was because he couldn't handle the criticism. That's part of it and also part of it he's legitimately mentally ill. I mean, look, he didn't marry that lady and be a part of that family because he's thinking straight. He's got some problems. There's something wrong with them. You know, he's a genius in terms of music. He's, he's, he's fantastic at creating beats and songs and hooks. He knows what the fuck he's doing there, but he, he's got a problem and you hear it when he rants, when he's ranting and when he's talking about Ford making dope cars.

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       We don't use the word dope because we only use words like magnificent, admitted, positive words like he's, he's making. He's listening to himself and jerking off to the noises that are coming out of his own mouth. I love. I loved when you said to the reporter when the report or pushed back and I'm a little bit, he's like, you just asked me a question. No, you can't do that because is like tasting a fine wine. It's complex. Yeah, exactly. I thought that was pretty funny. My read on him, he's he, I think part of what he's doing is that he's a contrarian and when you are in a place like Hollywood and you're there all the time, you're always surrounded by people who are anti trump. I think there's something about just this knee jerk reactionary feeling of like, like, no, I'm not with you guys.

Speaker 1:          01:07:41       I'm different and I'm special as a result of being different, so I'm a contrarian and I'm going to disagree with you. And then I also think there's narcissism in the sense that he looks at trump and he really sees himself in trump and that everybody laughed at trump when he said, I'm going to run for president. I'm going to win. And if you remember a few years ago, Kanye West said, I'm going to run for president. And everybody was laughing at it wasn't even a few years ago. It was recently. Yeah, he. And uh, what the fuck's on guys named Piers Morgan, right? Right. Right into it on twitter. Who said you're talking to your future president? That's what Kanye said. Oh my God. Or maybe it was Harvey Levin. He said it to you're talking to a future president actually disliked piers Morgan more than I dislike Kanye West. Kanye on that one. I think Connie's ill.

Speaker 1:          01:08:28       Oh really? Do. And I know he's been medicated. Yeah. Remember when he was all Chubby. When he's on his medication, you got fat and apparently he got off his medication and there are a lot of people, by the way, who would hear the point you made and b would be really angry at the fact that you think that he's mentally ill even though I think that's. I've seen it. I've seen it all my twitter, I've seen it on my twitter. People saying, oh, it's just a cheap partisan hacky point. No, it's not because he's admitted Lee mentally ill. I mean he did say that and the thing he said, I was diagnosed bipolar. Institutionalized. Yeah. He spent time in a mental hospital for being mentally ill and when you listen to him brand, this is just my opinion. That is not the ravings of someone who's carefully considering the implications of each word they're saying and thinking about how to express themselves in a way that's going to portray some sort of a clear, cohesive message is not. He's not what he's doing. What he's doing is jerking off. He's just jerking off with his mouth. I'm not kidding. It's just, it's just like, let me get it out. Is the fine wine, you know, we gotta we gotta make the dopest cars. Why can't fly back the dopest cause, you know. Did you hear what he said in that same thing? Um, the reason why we got to help Larry Hoover is because in a different universe there are alternate universes. I am him.

Speaker 1:          01:09:47       I don't think that's correct. Lyrics, song lyrics to a song. Was it something he says that when he's off his Lexapro? Yeah. Oh No, you ain't seen nothing crazier than this Nigga. When he off his Lexapro. Remember that time in Mexico? Remember the law that last time, the episode asking me why the hell are texting code four times just to say, don't text me. Whoa. Told you four times. Don't text me, Whoa, and we Finna lose all self control, but you ain't Finna raising your voice at me. Especially when we end the Giuseppe to modern day socrates, various man. It's silly, but I love that, that nothing crazier than when he's off his lexapro. Oh my God. Yeah. I do kind of feel bad even though this is such a, you know, like a side show type thing because I feel it. I mean the state of the country so weird that beach simply because of his celebrity and the fact that the mainstream media doesn't know how to keep their eye on the ball.

Speaker 1:          01:10:47       You never know who can become president. It could be somebody like Kanye. You're underestimating trump. Not The guy who said he could win, but you knew you would. And I did too. I mean, I set it on my last Netflix special and one before my last one. I don't think Kanye West has a goddamn snowball's chance in hell of being. Okay, I see what you're saying. I don't think anybody that's famous can be president. I think what trump did was map some master manipulating skills combined with some super human energy that most likely came from diet pills. What I think is his ability to campaign, his ability to maintain his energy and keep ranting and raving and fucking phenomenal. He, Hillary couldn't keep up with that. She, she, she literally didn't campaign places because she didn't have the energy. That's what I was breaking down. No, he trump went directly to the rust belt and railed against Nafta and the trade deals that destroyed their lives and Hillary Clinton.

Speaker 1:          01:11:43       I mean Bill Clinton is the one who didn't have to. Yeah, and she didn't campaign and a lot of those states because her campaign genuinely thought like, oh, we got those. Those are democratic lockups, and then guess what? Trump ended up winning because of 70,000 votes in the rust belt. So it directly. Because of that. That's why I get so angry when there are some people on the left who like only focus on the. Some of trump's supporters who are racist and all they want to do is talk about how bad of people they are. It's like, okay, you could shame people all day long. That's not going to get them to vote for you, but I agree you don't. You don't need the David Duke's to vote for you. That's fine, but you know who you do need the two times Obama voter, who then flipped to trump who was in the rust belt, who had his fricking job outsourced.

Speaker 1:          01:12:24       That's who you need and that's what the Democrats abandoned the. The problem with saying that all trump voters are racist too is you're. You're creating these very clear sides and it's a way to whitewash or loss. It's a way to say, listen, we don't have to change in any way because it's just because these people are bad people, so don't blame us. There's nothing we did wrong. Blame then. Whereas if you really were interested in winning and getting power and implementing your agenda, you want to. If you want to reach whoever you can reach. Now again, I'm not saying you tried to get David Duke or Richard Spencer on your side because some people are too far gone, but 70 percent of the country is not too far gone. No. So you should have went to the rust belt and you know, tried to get the two times Obama voter who then flipped to trump and they didn't do that.

Speaker 1:          01:13:09       Well, I think there's also, there was some real benefit in someone like Bernie Sanders, just like a thing. There's some real benefit in someone like Obama socially. Whereas when you saw a guy who was came from a single mom who was a black guy who winds up being the president of United States, you just go, wow, maybe we're better than. I thought. We were like, maybe we don't have all these prejudices. Maybe there's less of us than people try to claim. And I think a guy like Bernie Sanders could have been a real full oil. It could have been a real. He could have been a guy that if you looked at what trump stood for, trump stood for the outsider who understands the game because he hired those people, he paid those people, he bribed those people, and now I'm going to clean up the swamp. Yes, drain the swamp.

Speaker 1:          01:13:56       And on the other side you've got this deeply flawed woman who's deleted 30,000 emails who's beholden to all the Iraq war, the Iraq war. But how about the Patriot Act? Warren was spying on all Americans, which she supported every time there was a major issue where it was really a test of character and ideology was wrong. Well, and then when you go into her, her thoughts on gay marriage, she didn't believe in gay marriage. So 2013. Yep. Which is like, that is one of the least progressive things you could ever say. Like you didn't believe it until 2013. Yeah. Like what? Why not like you think it should be between a man and a woman. Like what does that even mean? It means you're trying to pander to what you think is the majority sentiment in the religious country. Yes, you're going. Exactly. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders is the fundamentally the opposite of Hillary Clinton.

Speaker 1:          01:14:44       Didn't agree or disagree with him for the past 30, 40 years. He's had the same ideology saying the same stuff. Yes, very, very progressive and maybe he's totally wrong about some of his socialist ideas. Maybe it would bankrupt the country. Maybe some of his. I don't think it would. I don't think it would have been. Maybe it would. Maybe it would be catastrophic to our economy to have this guy. Maybe it would be bad. Maybe it would be the opposite of what we're dealing with right now with in terms of the progression of unemployment, where unemployment is at an all time high and that or all time low rather, where when you're looking at people that are doing well in this country because of some of the things that trump's implemented, whether it's people that are getting lower wage jobs than they would like to have or whatever it is.

Speaker 1:          01:15:33       When you look at the numbers, maybe those numbers would go in the other way. So, but my point is what he represents though is someone who's not corrupt. What he represents as someone who's not beholden to banks, but he represents someone who doesn't care about money. It's not as thing. It's never been his thing. His thing has been social justice, whether it's right or wrong, at least it would represent something entirely different. Whereas with Clinton represented was corruption with a different taste to it. So what I would say, I agree with a lot of what you just said there in terms of Bernie, I. I personally wouldn't use the term social justice for him because that has social justice warriors now. Yeah. It's a thing on the internet and you know everybody. It's basically what I think of when I hear Social Justice Warrior is over sensitive college kid with pink hair who's trying to diy platform conservative speakers now.

Speaker 1:          01:16:23       Right? But that's unfortunate that it's become that. Well, I mean, listen, let's, let's take the way social justice, let's say progressive ideology. Okay. Say that. But what Bernie Sanders actually represents in my mind, and based on his record, is what he wants to do is make this country like every other developed country on the planet that's already kicking our ass in so many relevant areas. So there's this common argument, which is nothing but a straw man argument that comes from the far right where they say Bernie Sanders and his ideology, he wants to make the United States like Venezuela or like Cuba or sometimes even say like the old Soviet Union. Well, no, if you actually go issue for issue pretty clearly what he's asking for is a Swedish or Norwegian type system which is similar to the u, except the major difference is they have universal healthcare. Some of these places have universal education.

Speaker 1:          01:17:15       So, and uh, you know, middle class wages are higher. So what he's asking for is a better mixed economy. It's called social democracy. He's asking for a social democratic type system. It is not post capitalist. It's not saying let's totally scrapped the system and let's all, you know, act like wear whatever Hugo Chavez or Che Guevara, what he's, what he's asking for is actually, I would call it moderate in an international sense because he looked at the rest of the developed world and he goes, man, these guys are kicking our ass on healthcare education their ass and what, what parts of the developed world. So, uh, when you look at healthcare for example, there's a study that came out from the Commonwealth Fund which found that the United States ranks 11th out of 11 when it comes to developed countries in healthcare. So we have worse health outcomes and it's more expensive and we don't even cover everybody.

Speaker 1:          01:18:00       We have 29 million people who are uninsured. So when you go there, there are single payer systems and their systems beat us in every measurable health outcomes based on what you have. Someone who goes to the doctor. Worse outcome in terms of what happens once you've been checked in or you would have to look at the methodology of the study. I don't know the answer to that off the top of my head. That's a big issue is because we have a giant problem obviously with our diet, you know, and. Sure I'm not. I wouldn't deny that for a second. How much have. I wonder how much of it is based on that. When you're dealing with worse health outcomes, like how much of that health, how many of those health problems are based on people's personal choices rather than the healthcare system that they're operating under.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       So that is definitely a serious problem and one that needs conversation and needs fixing. What I'm referring to is stuff that's more like we have 29 million people who are uninsured in this country. We have anywhere from 32 to 45,000 people that die every year in this country because they don't have access to basic healthcare. We pay a per capita, we pay double what other developed countries pay and again they cover everybody. We don't cover everybody, so it's very. We're failing in every measurable way. Even if you control for factors like your accurately pointing out. Yeah. I wonder what's going on too. In terms of like, but we have a very high number of really fantastic doctors. Well, see, I know people. That's how I'm gonna. Address that in a sense. Please go. Okay. So, um, if you're a Saudi prince, you do want to come to the United States for healthcare because if you're in the top point, oh one percent, you are going to get the best care here.

Speaker 1:          01:19:33       It's just a brain surgeon or just as a pediatric surgeon for the average person, right? You're going to want to be in Canada or Sweden or Norway or Australia or any of those places. This is the argument for socialized medicine versus privatized medicine that privatized medicine incentivizes someone to excel. Someone to be that guy that, hey, this guy worked on Lebron James. Oh, we've got to go see him. So you know, he's the best. That's a decent point. And my counter to that is, and I know Bernie Sanders is as well because I've seen his bill and he advocates for a particular type of, for all system. You don't need to ban supplemental private insurance. In fact, I would totally disagree with any bill that says we're now banning private insurance because you can do a single payer system where you say, we're going to have public funding of public institutions, or you could do a single payer system like the French do or the Canadian do, where they were.

Speaker 1:          01:20:29       The Canadians do, where you have public funding of private entities, so what you're talking about is, you know, hey, how are we going to. If there's no competition, how are we going to get the best doctors and things of that nature, and my reaction to that is I'm just talking about the baseline public funding of private institutions and still allow people if they want to pay extra and go to a specialist, they could do that. I'm not necessarily even saying that. What I'm saying is that the system of having an incentive for being excellent. Sure. Having a financial incentive that causes people to excel. Yes, I would agree with that in certain fields, not in other fields. Well, I think it's certainly exist in the medical field and in surgery, in in many different medical practices. You find fantastic practitioners here in the United States because they get paid substantially for it.

Speaker 1:          01:21:19       I would argue that the profit motive, specifically in the realm of health care has had the opposite effect and has made it so that we have a disastrous system now. If we talk about. I agree with you as well. I agree with that as well, but I think that when you're saying that they kick her ass and all these other areas, like if you say, I have Canadian friends that come over here to get operated on and I have and they have American friends who go to Canada to get healthcare, but it's cheaper. That's why they're not going to be right, but they're not going how they get Canada if you. So if you were to go to Canada and you were to get sick, you just go to the hospital that they don't charge you. Even if you're an American citizen, if you're a citizen.

Speaker 1:          01:21:56       In fact, trump was saying back, he was on like David Letterman show years before he became president and he was talking about how awesome the Scottish healthcare system is because his buddy went over there and he broke his arm when he was there and he went to a hospital in Scotland and on his way out, he's like, how much do I owe you? And they said nothing. Get Out. So if you're a guy in New Jersey and you fly to Montreal because you're sick, they'll just take care of you. Yeah. You don't have to be a Canadian citizen. No, it's pretty amazing. Don't tell people things just fucked up because certain things, listen, certain things in a civilized society should be off the table. It's just a matter of what are those things. It's not like everybody agrees with some level of government. Everybody agrees, okay, we should probably have, you know, paved roads and police like that's a given.

Speaker 1:          01:22:42       So it's just a matter of let's prioritize here. What are the things that we're going to take off the table and fun with our tax money and every other developed country has decided, well, healthcare is one of those things. Let's not be silly. Yeah, we've talked about that many times in this podcast that socialism is absolutely apparent in many aspects of our society, especially firefighters, police officers. I mean paying for the street is paying the roads like we all agree that our money should be pooled to take care of these very specific issues, but then when it comes to some issues, we get angry and we pretend socialism doesn't exist at all in this country. Yeah, I think medicine is one of them, but my problem with that is that medicine is one of the most important things that a human being could ever have the in and if you get healthcare, healthcare can allow you to stay alive.

Speaker 1:          01:23:30       Like if you don't stay alive, you can't contribute to the society. You're, you're, you're dying from something that they could cure. If you had the money to cure it. Well this is a giant problem in society. If we don't address sick and ill people and injured people, that's true because then we're not caring for each other. Absolutely, and a medical bills is one of the top causes of bankruptcy in the United States. Can only imagine medical bankruptcy is just don't exist in the rest of the modern world. It's not a thing here. It's a gigantic thing and a huge issue. It's weird what we've done and you know another thing that's weird, it's what we've done with one of two countries that allows pharmaceutical drug companies to advertise on the air, not just fucking insane congress, and by the way, this is why they have like a 15 or 20 percent approval rating.

Speaker 1:          01:24:12       They've repeatedly slapped down provisions that would give us cheaper, but pharmaceutical drugs because they're allowing the pharmaceutical drug companies to price gouge us. Why? Because they're all bought by big Pharma. Yeah, that's. That's a giant issue, right? What lobbyists? Getting them out, special interest groups, getting their influence out, getting that kind of money and influence out of pocket there. There's a way to do it. Twenty eighth amendment money out of politics. You could do a system that's called clean elections, which is basically public financing of elections where instead of instead of running and only having a bigger megaphone, if you sell out more to billionaires, a, you run and you actually have a battle of ideas and competing philosophies, and then whoever has the best ideas ends up winning. So let's pretend let's go devil's advocate shirts. Pretend you're arguing against that. What if you were some lobbyists for the pharmaceutical drug company and you were trying to make a.

Speaker 1:          01:25:05       I'll tell you what they said. Well, I'll tell you exactly what they say, please. It's free speech is free speech to take a $20,000 and give it to the Super Pac that's trying to get this politician elected because you're telling me I can't do that. Then you're telling me that which means you're saying I don't have the free speech to be able to say I support a private pharmaceutical system. That's what they say. They've literally argued that in court. That's hilarious. Yeah, and then the counterargument to that is at many other people have pointed this out. I'm not the first, but if money equals speech, prostitution should be legal and murder for hire should be legal because I'm not actually hiring somebody to murder somebody. I'm just saying with speech because money is speech that I'm okay with hitmen.

Speaker 1:          01:25:46       Yeah. Well, you know, the real issue as well would be that you're not talking about pharmaceutical companies making no money. There's still massive amounts of people that are on medication. They would still make a lot of fucking money that just wouldn't make as much money and how much money are they making? And that's where it gets obscene when you see the actual numbers of pharmaceutical drug companies rake in, in this country in terms of what it takes to develop a drug versus what the profit margin is. It's fucking insane. And the hurdles to get a drug, any drug. And there is an issue that they're dealing with right now with stem cells. And stem cells have the approval of that, right? Yes. Because they're, they're treating them like they are a drug. And the conspiracy theory is that pharmaceutical drug companies do not want the approval of stem cells for therapy.

Speaker 1:          01:26:38       Uh, was there, whether it's a, you know, umbilical, all these different types of stem cells because the success rate is fantastic and they think that it could potentially cut down a profit margins. There are certainly an incentive problem there. I mean just the same incentive against marijuana. Marijuana sales would cut down on the sales of pharmaceutical drugs. Yeah, absolutely. And another really gross, a part of the system is that a lot of these drugs are actually created in our universities by researchers and scientists. And then what happens is the, for profit private Pharma companies swoop in, they buy up the rights to it for very cheap and then they price gouge and sell it back to the American people for a huge profit when it was the taxpayers who funded the research in the first place. So it's a way where they screw you twice, you have to pay for the creation of it and the research of it. And then they get the rights to it and then they sell it back to you again and Jack up the price. And then it's even worse than that because there's this guy, Alex is our, who's the head of the head of health and human services now trump appointed him. This guy worked for Eli. Lilly was a price Gouger, jacked up the prices massively now as the head of health and human services, you know what he's in charge of lowering drug prices.

Speaker 1:          01:27:53       So this is super transparent, is hilarious. Well, at the end of the brilliance of trump, honestly, the brilliance of trump is that he goes out there and he says like he's populist and his antiestablishment. But if you go issue for issue on his policies, he is massively pro establishment. I mean the consumer financial protection bureau is the perfect example of this. He picked a predatory payday lender to lead the consumer financial protection bureau. That bureau returned 11 or $12,000,000,000 to defrauded Americans when big financial institution screwed them. And now he's like, yeah, let's make that worse. Let's handcuff that agency and put a predatory payday lender in charge of it. So it's all. It's comical. Yeah. It's comical like people wouldn't believe this to. I follow this stuff on a daily basis. I lose my damn mind when I read this stuff, but think about your ability to follow this stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:28:38       You have so much access to information, you have so much time on your hands and this is a main focal point, whereas the average person is not going to get this data and I don't blame them. I'm not blaming. I'm. I would never own a shame. Don't blame them. They don't have. There's no. There's no bandwidth because no way it's coming in. Yeah. What you just said. I mean, how many people know what you just said? Not many, but that's my job. My job is to come out here and to say these things and everybody can check out youtube.com, so secular talk, shameless plug. I know a and Patrion.com. So secular talking to other shameless plug. I know, but this is my job. My job is to come out here and tell people what I read and what I follow and bottom line is guys, and I don't want to come across as partisan in any way.

Speaker 1:          01:29:16       Yes. I like Bernie Sanders. Yes, I don't like Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, but my whole thing is I want a system that is based on common sense and it's rational and it's logical and it helps people. Now Bernie's not going to run. I think he might think so. I think he might. I haven't heard a word about him. Well, he has been making some moves behind the scenes. Anytime you see a solid station person representing him, try to get ahold of us. Oh really? Yeah. They faked us out. There was a Bernie 20 slash 20 dot. Oh my. The other sending the email, so if you want to get to him, talk to me. I don't know him, but I know people who do know him. I want to talk to him about his posture. Fix so many things about the way people perceive him. We can move his head from the center of his chest and put it in a normal place.

Speaker 1:          01:30:01       Well, you know, the funny thing about trump is posture. This is how a person's supposed to be. They're not supposed to have been slashing two men. No, you've been normal. Have Bernie's head is down here. It's in the wrong spot. Those trends, as you know, look at them. Look where his head is. Look at up. See if you find a picture of him right there. His head is way lower than it's supposed to be. Your head's supposed to be up here. See where my shoulders there. Look at that picture of burning. Now Watch me. I'm going to do the same. This is my. This is. See, where are my neck is sore my shoulders. Look at that. It looks like he's doing a little dance there. Joseph doing with Jackie Mason. I call you a joke. So when I'm trump or Bernie, that's what I do.

Speaker 1:          01:30:45       You're not supposed to have your head so far down on your chest right there. That's a perfect example. Has terrible posture. You know I've said this about trump. Everybody laughs at his orange face and is dyed blonde hair, but I actually think that that does make him look younger. The orange face in the blonde hair, it probably does. He gives him some sort of life because if he didn't have, let's say, let's say he didn't do the comb over, he didn't die the hair, he didn't have the orange face. People would be like, oh, that's like a really senile old grandpa who was ranting. There's been people who've done photoshops and what he would look like without hair and with white, with white skin will. Did you see that thing when he was getting on Air Force One and it was like he was a demon dude.

Speaker 1:          01:31:27       Oh my. But even there, he's got some. He's got and he's got the orange in his face, but see, I would respect him if his hair looked like that. When I see him with his hair all fucking swirled around. I'm like, what are you doing? I'm going to defend trump now, joe. That's what I'm going to do. A lot of makeup. Just got a lot of makeup. Dude. I'm stunned at the dedication he has to the comb over because this is probably like an hour long project every day and he does it every day. He's probably watching Fox and friends and tweeting. As somebody who's doing. Is there, do you think someone does it for them? Is try to find the video of him walking up the ramp to Air Force One. Whereas hair, it looks like a demon. Yeah, the skin suit on where it's like it just pops off. He's pretending to be a human.

Speaker 1:          01:32:14       He's rotting from the inside and he's just barely keeping it together because that's one, but it's the image that there's a direct behind angle. That's the angle because you see how there's just a giant bald spot back there. He does a really good job of covering it. He does. It's just so crazy. It's so much worse. If you got trump hair gift, it might come up that way. Go with. That's it right there, Jamie. Here it is. That's crazy. Now you could hear the horror movie noise as that happens. Like the weird thing is like look how. Where's the hair coming from on the sides? Like how is there so much hair on the side? It's a work of our jail. Like watch it goes up the stairs and wait for it. Oh, there it is. A wing that wing. Has he not know that that wing is flopping around the amount of baldness in the back of his head. It's like he's growing hair only on the side of his head. Very strange. Usually when people lose their hair, that back portion still grows hair at the very back and his didn't streaming. I mean it looks demon. Demon. So.

Speaker 1:          01:33:20       So here he go. Step by step on how to do a trump haircut. It looks like some fucking English. Okay. I could've been. I could've been swayed into thinking going on there. Yeah. But I actually do think that this, it does ultimately make them look younger. Helps. I do. Yeah, I do. With that picture of him balled up there. Scroll up there, Jamie. That picture right there on that same row. The bottom rail. The one next to it. Yeah. Look at that. That's what he would look like. Yeah, I looked fine there. You think that looks fine? Yes. I think he thinks he's not 70, but I think he looks like a pudgy uncle. Fester then our chance. He looks like a fucking man. It doesn't give a shit about his hair. One of the things is a problem with him is it's not very manly to spend that much time combing and spraying.

Speaker 1:          01:34:06       That's true. Especially for a billionaire in his seventies. It's one thing if you're like 20 and you're panicking like, holy shit, I'm going ball before my time. No, you're fucking 70 and you're worth what? Twenty dollars, billion dollars or something. Probably way more now. Yeah. He's profited massively from being inside the White House. There was some sort of. Oh, we can talk about that because. So you know, everybody focuses in mainstream media on the Muller investigation and his ties to Russia and stuff like that. I think everybody's missing the bigger story because the bigger stories that there are two different emoluments cases which are proceeding against trump and for those of you who don't know what that is in the constitution, there's the emoluments clause, which basically says that a president of the United States cannot take money from foreign governments because there's a conflict of interest problem. If you take. If I take money from whatever name the place, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Israel, you name it, if I do well, then

Speaker 3:          01:34:57       of course you're going to be incentivized to do policy in favor of those countries and not necessarily what's best for the American people. And there are two court cases against trump that have proceeded in federal court on this. So while everybody's screaming about the Mueller investigation, they're missing the even bigger corruption scandal. I mean we were talking about Saudi Arabia earlier, the Saudi state of trump's hotel and paid 250,000 or $300,000 and they didn't even fricking stay there. So why did they do that? They did that because they're trying to make it so that when they give him a call and say, hey man, what about the $100,000,000,000 weapons deal trumps like, of course, because he's got more money in his bank account as a result of the Saudis. Similar thing happened with Israel on the way in. I'm jared cushner and some other people in the trump administration spoke to a Israeli officials about how Obama and Kerry on their way out the door, we're going to say, hey, Israel stopped with the illegal settlements.

Speaker 3:          01:35:49       It was just a little slap on the wrist. It was more symbolic than anything else, but Israel was calling the trump administration and saying, we want you to try to kill this thing, and of course jared Kushner has taken millions of dollars from Israeli banks and he has investments over there, so there's. You can't have a president of either party taking money from foreign governments because then they're going to do those governments bidding. That's a huge problem and I don't see anybody talking about that. All I see them talking about is Mahler and Oh my God, Russia, Russia, Russia, and it's been the only guy that's ever been president. That really has been a substantial business to this extent for sure, or at least that I know of. To be clear up. Maybe there's a way before I knew. Yeah, yeah. It's, it's dark because everyone knows that this is an issue.

Speaker 3:          01:36:34       I mean, everyone knows, you know, and that was one of the issues about Russia is that he was trying to put hotels in Moscow. He did that with rush aided that with Taiwan. It's everywhere. He pissed off China early on because, and this was maybe not as big of a deal, but he took a phone call from the head of Taiwan and China does not want Taiwan recognized as its own thing. And so that caused a huge diplomatic crisis because then China was like, what are you doing? You can't, don't talk to them as if they're their own independent thing and come to find out he was working on a deal to put a hotel in Taiwan. Yeah. Well, what is the deal with China? Taiwan versus China? It, I don't know the detailed history that I just know that China considers Taiwan. There's and Taiwan says, no, we are our own thing.

Speaker 3:          01:37:16       Right. But that's one of those issues where when Husana we on there because um, I mean, I don't know enough about it to give you my, to give you an opinion on it, but it seems to me like China saying I want that to be ours and them saying, no, that seems like a big deal. Like it seems like you should even endless. Listen, I'm the type of person who says let's try to work it out in the US at however we can. But if it really came to the point where, I don't know, Texas was like, seriously, no, we're leaving now because of reasons x, Y and Z. Should we have the right to tell them? No. I don't know. Well, it was Taiwan was a part of China. Yeah, I think so. Up until. I don't know, Dude. I don't know. I try to. Whatever. I don't know, something.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       I try to be totally up front about it. I appreciate that. That part of that story. I remember thinking that this was, you know, people were saying this is unprecedented for the president of United States to talked to Taiwan when really China's got a giant issue with this. This could cause huge international problems. There was a big crisis behind the scenes. I didn't get it though. Well I didn't. They was. It was only a story for a day or two, so I didn't know too many details of it. Have you been following at all the Ted Cruz versus Beta O'rourke race? No. Would you say Ted Cruz should be voted out simply because he's Ted Cruz because that's where I'm at with Ted Cruz. Well, he's just a fool. He's just, he's so smarmy. Call them smarmy Ted Cruz. Well, one of my favorite parts of the election was a. There was a guy with sunglasses on and he was at some sort of campaign rally Ted Cruz, and he was like, it's over.

Speaker 1:          01:38:47       Quit. You're done. Oh, this was during the presidential primary, sir. What? What? What is the issue that you have with me, sir? And he's like, it's over. You're a loser. And it's like the guy who was a trump guy, I was like wearing sunglasses. Like the whole thing was just. I was like, you don't know how to handle trolls. Like, look at you now. He can't because he's such a fake gun. Show fake. Did you ever see trump manhandle him in the debate when he tried to bring up New York values? I don't remember that. Okay. It. Is it cool if we watch that because you're going to have a favorite ted Cruz things though was the excerpts of his commercial when he was setting up those commercials and he had all the outtakes. Mom, my mom prays for me for hours. She's like speaking the Fox business gop debate Ted Cruz and Donald trump discussed New York values. Work values on. Say it again. Play it, play it again from the beginning. Most people know exactly what New York values

Speaker 3:          01:39:42       I am from New York. You're from New York City. You might not,

Speaker 7:          01:39:46       but I promise you in South Carolina, listen, there are many, many

Speaker 3:          01:39:54       wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York, but everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro abortion are pro gay marriage focus around money and the media and, and I guess I can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I'm just saying

Speaker 8:          01:40:22       conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F Buckley and others. Just so you understand this place. It's got great people. It's kind of loving people, wonderful people. When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York to 110 story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down and we saw more death and even the smell of death. Nobody understood it and it was with us for months. The smell the air and we rebuild downtown Manhattan and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world love New York and love New Yorkers and I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that,

Speaker 1:          01:41:17       that could have been handled better. You didn't like trump's response and was sloppy. Just sucks, but he's just shitting on a whole state because he's a partisan hack prick. I understand that the way he handled it wasn't. But I got to admit it was a good response. That ted such a cunt. When I'm watching trump stand there. I'm like, I hope you get some. Yeah. Because he's so fake. Everything is so preplanned. And the video you were talking about is probably an even better example where he's, you know, pretending like he's sitting there with his kids. Like, all right. Caden did eat your Broccoli. Well, Bill Buckley's from England though. Um, I guess he lived in Manhattan afterwards. I don't know. Did you ever see the Gore Vidal William F Buckley debates those? Uh, was it called the best of enemies? What was it called? I thought it was on firing line his show.

Speaker 1:          01:41:59       Maybe I could. No, no, no. There's a documentary about. I didn't see that with a thing. It's called the best of enemies, but it's a about the 19 sixties debates between buckling. Is that best of enemies? It's great. You should watch. I will check that out. I'm like, I mean, he pissed off Buckley to the point where Buckley called him a faggot and said, uh, yeah. He goes, Oh, I forget what the way he said it. He goes, I'll punch you and you'll stay plastered or some fucking shit. Sock it to the left. Yeah. I forget the term that he used. You know, Garba Dow lived in Ravello. He lived in Italy and you know, he lived in la or Hollywood out of place in Ravello, you know, and he, you know, I was up there. I was, I was put it took a picture from instagram.

Speaker 1:          01:42:49       This word, Gore Vidal used to bank dudes, right? Folks respect. I mean, I'm a big fan of guava dog. He's a brilliant, brilliant guy. But I liked him. He got under William F Buckley's skin so bad that Buckley fell apart during the rebates. Oh, you fucking screamed at him. He's red in the face. That's interesting because he was calling him a Nazi. Gore Vidal was calling me a Nazi. Yeah, I saw 'em on Youtube. They have William f Buckley versus Noam Chomsky and you've got the thing that he said back in the sixties. Oh, 68 is fascinating to watch that because if you're really nerdy and wonky and you love politics, go watch William F dot Buckley versus Noam Chomsky because it is. I love it. When I was a kid, I used to watch it and be like, Oh man, this is amazing. He, he calls the words you queer. No, it was more than that, so I was trying to find the quote. Yeah, you could find the video. He said he would punch him. Who is this on Netflix day plastered or something like that. He said more than the word queer. Is this on Netflix? Yes. Yes it is. After you got to tell me the name may not be on Netflix. It's definitely on itunes.

Speaker 1:          01:44:00       Yeah. Maybe you call them a queer, but whatever it was, he called him a homosexual slur and then he threatened to knock him out. He threatened to sock him or whatever the fuck he thought, but it was the red in the face and the fucking eyeballs twitching and really was the end for William f Buckley and it was during an official like debate that they were having. It was during the series of debates at ABC put on. They put on a series of debates and Gore Vidal was doing better and then William f Buckley was kind of a cunt in Gore. Vidal was mocking him. He very pompous polymath Buckley was gross. It's just weirdly grow, but it showed how he fell apart from that statement on. That was kind of the end of people taking them completely seriously. People now look back at him through rose colored glasses and they act like, oh my God, he's such a brilliant intellectual.

Speaker 1:          01:44:47       Well, sort of like what they do with Reagan. Reagan was an embarrassment. Yeah, because they used to. Well, didn't he? Late in his time in office, weren't there questions about whether or not he had dementia? Oh, 100 percent. We'll. Do you remember during the Iran Contra debates or the Iran contra trials where they asked him, did you sell arms to Iran? He's like, I don't remember. It kept saying, I don't remember. That could have been a tactic to try to get out of it, right? Oh, he was. He was losing it if he didn't hear it as, oh, this is even older than the Chompsky one.

Speaker 9:          01:45:17       All right. Here in the United States, I happen to believe that the United States policy is wrong in Vietnam and the Viet Cong are correct and wanting to organize it in their own way. Politically happens to be pretty much the western Europe and other parts of the world. If it was a novelty in Chicago that is too bad, but I assume that the point of the American democracy got up a minute and the answer is that they will. They will well treated by people who was precise them and I'm for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers. Crypto Nazi I can think of is yourself failing that I listened to you gentlemen his pornography and stop making any illusions of infantry in the last war.

Speaker 1:          01:46:25       That started as a debate on Vietnam and then by the end they were. Now that's even seems like a big deal back then. It was probably like, oh my goodness. I was probably on every a nightly news show you queer, I'll suck you in their face and you'll stay plastered like that's almost like a rapper dis suck you when you face in your steep plessy. Right? Little bit, yeah, a little

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       bit, but the documentary is fantastic. It looks good. We should definitely go check that out. It's really good to give me the name when it's get out of here. It's the best of enemies. It's really good because it just shows you like the. The time that they lived in it was just a different world and that ABC was so. I mean, they were able to have this on national television and have debates on policies and on, on politics between to recognize intellectuals, one on the right, one on the left, and this is something that they did on national television. It was a big success.

Speaker 3:          01:47:23       You know, for the longest time I was, I was very anti debate and still to an extent today I feel like I'm anti debate, but the reason I am is because I feel like it's a wwe of intellectual pursuits where it's more of a show and it's more about sophistry and it's more about being quick on your feet. Then who has the right arguments and I don't think that's good. But then the other argument is, and now I'm, I'm warming up to this argument, is that it's such a better way to get people to watch and listen. Because when, when you get really wonky and just have conversations with people, many people just kind of tune out to that because it doesn't keep their attention. But what will keep their attention is a zinger. So if you know how to deliver zingers in into debate and you can get more people to watch and agree with you, then it's almost almost like a necessary evil to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:48:05       So I decided for the political thing. I said, okay, you know what I will debate and I'll debate mostly because my audience wants me to debate. I think my audience likes it. They Tucker Carlson. No, no, no. Jake. You were debated, Tucker Carlson, who you, you're going to divide was going to debate and culture and culture pulled out. Okay. And then she had the nerve to go on, good morning la and say, you know, these liberals, they chickened out of debating me. So she just blatantly lied. She backed out of the debate with me and then she goes on TV and says no. And then she says her though, isn't that what she, she's a troll, but here's the reasoning. Here's her reasoning. It was so smug and so elitist. She's like, oh, how many best sellers does he have? Bitch, I don't write books.

Speaker 3:          01:48:47       I don't write books, but I guarantee you write books like the book. I guarantee you I had way more listeners, secular talk listeners there. Then she had an culture fans and let me tell you something, even I have people who are very conservative in my own family and when they heard I was debating in culture, you know what? Every single one of them said, get that bitch. I don't like her. And these are people who agree way more with her than they do with me. Well, she's not really a Republican. She's a troll and she's a heck yeah, I don't, I don't think she even believes what she's saying. You know, in one of the reasons why I say that is because the way Bill Maher treats or he laughs and jokes around with it's true. Sure. He's like, there's a wink and a nod with her.

Speaker 3:          01:49:26       Exactly. It's a hustle. I think she's an entertainer. I think that's true. And I remember back during the Bush years, nobody was more in favor of the Iraq war and thought it was the greatest thing ever and would, you know, make fun of people who are against it. And then when trump rose up through the republican ranks and he was bashing the Iraq war, which by the way, I loved it when he did that. All the sudden she went on, she hopped on the trump train. When all the other candidates on the stage, we're not bashing the Iraq war. So she flipped on this major issue that defined five years of her so-called intellectual life. It's not real. It can't be real, real. She doesn't remember when she was talking about invading Canada. It's something about Canada's Canada not supporting us. We'll fucking invade them over Iraq. It was like it was something along those lines.

Speaker 3:          01:50:10       Vaguely remember what you're talking about. Something like this pitch out of her fucking mind when she said, we need to invade a one of these Muslim countries and just forcibly converted everybody there. That was one of the things she said. I remember that. It's a real man. These are the fact that she's still gets considered for debates. It's pretty stunning. I know she's. She's just disingenuous. So it would've been. I would've been screaming at, you know, a wall basically. But the person I knew would have, it would have been wonderful seeing everybody says that the corral that lady into taking the stage with you, it'd be fantastic. Can Run circles around her. I ended up debating Scottie Nell Hughes, who was big on TV during the 2016 election and she was a trump backer and now she's on our. And actually she ended up being very reasonable.

Speaker 3:          01:50:52       I'd say we actually ended up agreeing on maybe 65 percent of the issues and we had some pr, some strong disagreements, but mostly agreeing and I think it was a very fruitful conversation. But I don't know if the audience liked it as much as they would've liked me bashing culture said, oh, the audience probably would've liked it more. But it's nice when those kinds of conversations where people do agree on a lot of issues, even regardless of what side they're supposedly on do take place because it makes people. It gives people hope and the idea of reasonable discourse. So then you would have absolutely loved. I was on a panel with Charlie Kirk, have turning point USA and he's, you know, close with candice son. He's 12 years old. He's young. He's not really, he's probably, he's my dean. No, no, no. You're thinking of a different person.

Speaker 3:          01:51:32       He's a little kid. You're joking. I see. As fairly in your face. I'm very, I'm a very literal dude. So sometimes stuff goes right over my head, but we were on hand as they sold girl scout cookies together that I would actually believe her. They did. Um, so I was on a panel called, how are we going to get along? Charlie Kirk was one of the panelists now going into it, I thought, I'm not going to agree with this dude on absolutely anything. But when we got in there, what I did is I tried to frame issues from what his ideology is. So he says he's a conservative. So I said, okay, that means typically you believe in smaller government. So I said, okay, here's some areas where I believe in smaller government, I think we need to stop the warrantless NSA spying or we're collecting everybody's information without their approval.

Speaker 3:          01:52:16       And without a warrant, um, I think that we need to stop the drug war. I think we need to, uh, you know, and our invasions of other countries because that takes a big government and billions of dollars to do these invasions and rebuild countries and things of that nature. And I even said on the death penalty, um, we should probably stop that because about six percent of the time we get the wrong people and probably shouldn't be the case. And on virtually every one of these issues. Charlie Kirk agreed with me. He even agreed with me on the issue of Saudi Arabia where, you know, I said it, they

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       said something like, oh, we like law and order and the law and order president is Donald Trump. I said, if you really like law and order, you'd be against the trump administration arming $110,000,000,000 worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia. And Charlie Kirk, to his credit goes, no, I, I agree with that. Now the other guy on the panel was an absolute pack. He's a Milo Wannabe. I don't know his actual, I don't even know his name, but he, it was clear he was doing an act and he's a daily wire, third stringer, like he's Ben Shapiro's thing, but he's a low level guy and his, I swear, I swear to you joe, he was talking about how I'm very pro life and I need you to know that I'm very pro life and this is something I support. My response to him was, well, I'm glad to know that you're against the death penalty and immediately without skipping a beat, he goes, I'm for the death penalty and the audience laughs and I go, well, if you're going to walk right into my trap every time, it's going to be very easy debate now, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          01:53:38       What's going on with Milo? When was the last I, I should be asking you that. I didn't even know the dude. I haven't heard a peep out of him. And no, he, uh, I think his whole thing imploded because there was an article that came out and they have like correspondence between him and literal, like actual. All right. People were, they were just kind of doing puff pieces for them. That was my understanding of it and he kind of disappeared after that and temporarily he was, he was with Alex Jones. You did a few shows with Alex Jones. I was the last I saw of puff pieces like, yeah, like trying to make it seem like they aren't what they actually are. Like he was partying with Richard Spencer and they were singing together and it was weird. Yeah, he's a weird character.

Speaker 1:          01:54:15       He's a, he's definitely a weird character but I actually enjoyed talking with him off the air and I felt like there's a lot of what he is. That's the tricks. Sure. And you know, it's hard to tell. It's hard to tell because it's hard to tell like how much of how much of what you think is theatrical is them being theatrical when the aunt, they're on air and how much is theatrical when they're talking to you and trying to be endearing off here? Yeah. It is hard to tell, but sometimes you can see it when there are people who kind of get involved in this political space is awesome and really all they want to do is just become famous and it's like, that shouldn't be the point. You should really get in on this political thing because you actually are really interested in politics.

Speaker 1:          01:55:02       I mean, that's really what it comes down to. Wood. That's you. Yeah, because I'm a nerd. That's why I didn't expect my thing to ever get the. Honestly, when I first started, I really thought maybe in my wildest dreams I'll get to 100,000 subscribers on youtube and as I talked to you right now, we're almost about to cross 600,000. So I never expected any of this. I never expected any of this. And the fact that it happened. Um, I'm just grateful for it. While you're an intelligent guy with very reasonable points, so you deserve all the credit that you've gotten, but you are also honest like you, these are your actual opinions and this is your actual perspective. The real problem with someone like Ann Coulter or someone like many of these other people that I see out there that we don't have to name

Speaker 6:          01:55:44       is that they're hustlers. They found an end. There's an in for a certain type of conservative person. There's an end for a certain type of democratic persons and in for. I mean I. There's pro women, people that don't give a fuck about women. They're bullshit artist. Absolutely. Absolutely. We're supposed feminists when they're just narcissists. There's a lot of that out there. There's men's rights activists. They really only care about finding this way into a group of people where if you have their support, there's just a large conglomeration of them and you can sort of take them in as your fans. Do you feel. Do you feel like that died down a little bit? The men's rights activist thing? Yeah. I feel like there were maybe three years ago it was very big and then now it's kind of it about it. That shit from them, right.

Speaker 6:          01:56:29       Then they would ship, you know, having them be upset at me. I don't give a fuck, but my bit was that every men's rights activists I ever met, I just want to grab and go, dude, we got them all. Shut the fuck up. We run everything. Almost everything. The whole idea is that. Not that I don't think men should have rights, but it's just we've got them. Yeah, and that my thing in the bit was what if women start to pay attention to the things men actually did when they started going, hey, we just realized you guys caused all the war, every single war ever, and it's like if you met women caused all the war would be like, well we got to kill these fucking crazy bitches. The want to do is go to war. This was in your most recent special, right? Yeah. That's great.

Speaker 6:          01:57:11       And it was thought out there was some of them were upset at me, but like that's a pretty bulletproof argument. Like the only men's rights. Our argument that's legitimate is divorce laws. Sure, I agree with that. And we're in, we're in when it comes to alimony and when it comes to child support and when it comes to child custody. Yeah, totally agree with that. There are men Nigga fucked over and I know guys that have gotten fucked over in that regard and you know what courts tend to side towards the mother and even if the most deceptive and if the mother is, you know, they'll say something like he beats the kids or I think he might've done something sexual to the kids. There's women have done horrible things like that and they've done that to get more money or they've gotten done that to get custody of.

Speaker 6:          01:57:57       They'd done that just for spite. But this is just. This is a matter of the courts being designed to work the situation system being designed to protect kids and protect the mother who needs to get money to be able to take care of the children because there's a lot of fucking shitty deadbeat dads. Now, if there were no dead beat dads, if men always paid child support, then this would be far less of an issue. The issue is the reason why women can exploit it is because so many men were pieces of shit. Sure. It. It created this need for some sort of some sort of law that set some something that's set to protect children and to protect women with. With that get custody. Yeah, and now it looks like the. With the divorce issue and everything, the pendulum swung a little too far in the other direction and there's this default setting which is actually not too good for the guy.

Speaker 6:          01:58:49       The guy you're talking about too, because I saw that podcast a long time ago. I think it was one of the people you work with on news radio or something that's just one of them. That's just one of them. I know many people that have been fucked over by by divorce. Then you know, and look, I have a good friend of mine who I've talked about them on the podcast before. He has been divorced for 14 years. He has been married to a new woman for 12 years. He still pays alimony. Not only does he still pay alimony, he pays alimony to tone of more than a hundred thousand dollars a year to a woman that he doesn't have sex with. So he can't retire. He cannot retire. This woman has a boyfriend. She lives in his house, old house, my friend's old house. She owns the house.

Speaker 6:          01:59:31       They don't have any children. This is the idea that he fucked her so hard. She can't work again. Like she's not 80 years old man. I mean she's now in her fifties. That's almost like indentured servitude. It's fucking insane to give me $100,000 a year. He's giving. Well, it's tapered down to like, I think it's now at $150,000 a year, but at one point he was paying a quarter million dollars a year and he's paid or that for 12 fucking or 14 fucking years now. Fourteen years. He's been married to a woman for 12. He has a family. He has a family and asked to send money to this lady. He doesn't talk to anymore. Like she can't move on with their life and if he doesn't, he gets locked up. If he doesn't, he goes to jail. Yeah, I mean this is. And he's trying to go to court and she fights it and she lives with her boyfriend and when they send people over to check the boyfriend puts his stuff in a fucking u haul, drives around the block weights and then comes back.

Speaker 6:          02:00:24       So what if, let's say, let's say he loses his job and he can't find another job for whatever reason. He's lucky. He just always the money no matter what. And there's no like you can't go back in front of a court and they can read, uh, you know, take it down or whatever. That's a good question. I mean that you'd have to go to court and a judge would have to agree, but he's a successful man. That's part of the problem is he's not going to be a loser. He's an ambitious guy, does really well. He works very hard. He works 10, 12 hours every day and he has for ever. And He's good. He's smart. He's good at his job. And because of this, he has to pay this woman that he doesn't fuck anymore forever. That's crazy, man. It's a nightmare. It's a nightmare.

Speaker 6:          02:01:04       But here's the thing. It's like she's not, she's not like, she's not in a hospital bed. It's not like she can't work. It's like she's, she's totally capable of making a living and she now has probably four or five plastic surgery. She is the person we were talking about earlier. I don't even know me. Maybe she went, she fits the route. Maybe she went the opposite. I don't know. But the idea that my friend has to pay her and every now and then you know, we'll, we'll, we'll talk about it. I'm like, you still have to pay her. And she'll just go, oh my goodness. He's fucking. I mean, got a family.

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       He's got a wife and he has children with this new woman and he's happy and he still has to pay. What does that $2,000 a week, 2000 plus a just an absolute nightmare areas. So here's a check for $2,000. Lady. I don't even know anymore. So speed. I guess this is somewhat related to what we're talking about here, but what did you make of the cabinet thing? Um, this is my, I mean, I've, I've spent a lot of time over the last week paying attention to it. Oh really? This happened to a little longer. You just caught up on it, you're saying for awhile it was like, this guy is gross. This is gross. I don't want. When the main thing was happening, we just weren't paying attention to it, but over the last week of paid a lot of attention to it and here's my take on it.

Speaker 1:          02:02:27       Um, one of, one of the things that got me was um, well, one of the things that got me is it seems like most of his, most of his life and his young life, that guy was fucked up. He was drinking a lot. Did you see, read the yearbook? Did you see the year? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And all the stuff about like on the calendar, like he had his calendar and then when things were scheduled, beers were scheduled. Very bizarre. That's very busy. And he was so like frat boy, Douchey, like all this stuff he said was very cliquey. Yeah. And he also lied. Oh, endlessly. Yeah. Dashawn. That alone is all I need to know. He said, he said goofing is farting and goofing of course means fucking. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody knows that that's nonsense. So He's a liar. So, and then he perjured himself and saying that he didn't know.

Speaker 1:          02:03:23       And by the way, the Democrats didn't even mention perjury. They just, they just kinda laid down. They just kinda laid down. My whole thing was, I think it was a gross spectacle. And I, I, I honestly, I thought that even the hearings happening, I felt like it was a little bit of a clown show because it's like, here we are the most powerful organization in the most powerful body. This government, United States government where we're having this hearing and we're talking about drinking. That happened in the 19 eighties. It just struck me as so silly. But at the same time, the thing that you know, I was screaming about, and I might may have literally been the only person in the country screaming about this stuff. I actually went through cavenaugh as a judicial record with a fine tooth comb and I disagree with him on basically every decision he's ever made.

Speaker 1:          02:04:04       And that's not an exaggeration. He's for warrantless NSA spying. He rules with corporations 87 percent of the time. He said that all of Obamacare is unconstitutional. He ruled that the EPA can not regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Uh, he even goes as far as to say Donald Trump might be able to pardon himself. So. And that's, I mean, that's like, that was one of the reasons why they think that Donald Trump was getting him in the first place. But that's the thing. But that's also part of the Patriot Act. Yes. Yes. That's like the end of modern civilization type shit because you can't have somebody above rule of law that's like a dictator for. That's craziness. So the thing that drove me crazy, Joe, is that here you have

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       on all those important issues. Did you hear a single democratic politician bring that up in the conversations, but it wasn't at all about the accusations. It was all about the act. I'm not saying you can't bring up the accusations at all. I think you can bring it up, especially because some of them seem to have decent amount of evidence on their side and seemed very measured and reasonable in their comments so you can bring it up, but it just annoyed me that there wasn't like a two pronged strategy and trying to defeat it because the Democrats suck. Joe. They suck because it just to suck. They suck in the end. They don't think there's any pressure to not bring up those issues? No. Well, maybe. I guess maybe a little bit, but Chuck Schumer, for example, cut a deal with Donald Trump just recently and he let them approve like, I forget the exact number. You guys can fact check me on this. Six or 10 different. A Jew of trump's judges, he cut a deal to approve them so the Democrats can go back home and campaign for the upcoming election, but it's like, hey, douche bag. The reason why you guys are struggling in elections is because you don't stand for anything, so those people, why don't you to fight on those judges because you're not supposed to agree with those judges because that's the Goddamn opposition party.

Speaker 6:          02:05:41       Yeah. Yeah. I don't understand why they wouldn't bring up all those issues that you talked about before. Here's 15. See I even formations of 15 trump judges. Look.

Speaker 3:          02:05:53       Yeah, and see this is my problem with them is that you could give them an issue like take legalizing marijuana that in exchange dems facing reelection can go home to campaign. How ridiculous. And this is what the Democrats do, Joe, is that like we were talking earlier about marijuana. Sixty two percent of the country now wants legal marijuana. The only democratic politicians talking about it is Bernie Sanders and maybe a handful of others. And if they ran on these issues, and I can name a thousand others, like raising the minimum wage, uh, ending the wars. If they run those issues, they'd win, but they just don't do it.

Speaker 6:          02:06:24       Yeah. Well, I agree with you. The cavanaughs take on all those issues are pretty fucking vile. Yeah, but it did. All those things disturb me. What disturbed me most about what they were talking about in terms of his youth wasn't that he did bad things in his youth. It's that he's lying about them now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If he said, look, when I was 17 years old, I was stupid, like many 17 year olds and I drank, but I never raped anybody. Did stupid things and maybe I acted insensitively and maybe I said some things that I shouldn't have said because I was a fool. I am not a fool anymore. And now I'm a judge and now I think it would make a great supreme court justice if he could say that, but he didn't. He got angry and like same like I've watched the video of him saying,

Speaker 3:          02:07:10       I'd like beer. You like it. He's asking a senator, do you like it? Do you like it? I like it. Like, what does that fucking mean? You're talking about you as a teenager when it's illegal to drink you stupid. Fuck. And he also did a little slight of hand there and said, oh, most of the seniors at the time could legally drink. Yeah. Why'd you say most of the seniors? We're not talking about. Most of the seniors were talking about you. He wasn't legally allowed to drink at the time, but you're right, you're exactly. The problem

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       was the lies. He could've just said exactly what you laid out there, but he didn't do it. Which again speaks to his credibility and it's kind of funny that the one woman, if he did do that to her, the one woman who turns out to be a professor, it's hugely progressive, super liberal university who it's almost predominantly women. Like if you looked at how many women are professors at the university and how many women's. I think it's something like 79 percent of the women are 70. Nine percent of the students are women at the university. And in some large number of the professors are women as well. Yeah. Well, well at least one of the allegations were bullshit against him. You know who it was, right. Michael have a naughty. That anti-trump grifter who just wants to get his fucking name in the media, he, he represented some woman and there's thousand holes in her story, but this asshole, because he wants to get his name in the spotlight, he, he adds on to the other accusations and some of the other exhibitions do have merit any.

Speaker 1:          02:08:34       He blows up the whole thing, so now the Republicans can turn around and go, look what we got here. Bullshit example. So it's all bullshit. I think he did it. Now Sharpton. That guy is a scumbag. And by the way, he was just a political one where I was and he's listened. He came out of nowhere. He came out of nowhere and now he's talking about running for president. Who the fuck are you? I saw someone say that they think you'd be great. Yeah. Well they say, whoever said, that's a fucking idiot. It was bill Maher. Well, Bill Maher, can I, you know, I used to like him, but he's gotten progressively worse and worse. No Pun intended, on using the word progressive. I think it was him on Sam Harris, his show. I'm thinking about it now. I think it was him talking about his. His argument was, oh, because I want a Democrat with balls and have an naughty.

Speaker 1:          02:09:19       Has Balls. Yeah, but the problem is he's a piece of Shit grifter I'm talking about. He was gonna make a presidential run. Apparently on extra. They just posted this and why is the fucking mainstream media allowing this guy? They're letting. They're giving them free airtime, Joe. Well, this is the problem with the media. Why aren't you giving serious people free air time? Why aren't you giving fucking economists or professors who are experts in social policy give people who know something, some airtime. This guy's obviously a grifter. Well, they're giving him free air time because people are going to pay attention to the idea that he's going to run for president because he was representing stormy Daniels and stormy Daniels. Fuck the president and this whole big fucking clown car circus event is. It's something that people tune into. It's basically an episode of keeping up with the Kardashians, the presidential issue, and imagine that's your guy. Like, Hey, who are you? Oh, I got famous because I represented stormy Daniels, like, oh, what a fucking genius. You are. Good Gal. And she, uh, she, she fucked a guy and she wants some money. The fact that that's like stormy Daniels has been in the news more than the genocide in Yemen, which our weapons are being used to carry it out with. I saw a fucked up meme. It's, it's stormy Daniels is now going back

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       to porn because trump makes America work again. That's actually true by the way. She's good. She's going to strip clubs and stuff. Well, I know she's been going to a strip club. She got arrested. That was fucked up. She got, there were these police officers who were super pro trump and they went to one or a strip club events and they just arrested her piece that she did something that was upstairs bullshit. And I'm no stormy Daniels Fan, but you don't use that. So that was a political arrest. It was just a fucked up thing. The whole thing is so gross. You know what? I went down in the rabbit hole on recently. Mgk versus m and M. Have you seen this? What was mgk and. Okay. I was in the exact same boat as you like three weeks ago. Okay. Jamie's all excited about black twitter now.

Speaker 3:          02:11:17       Okay. So, so m and M, everybody knows legendary rapper, one of the best rappers of all time broadly considered that. Um, he did an album where I guess he mentioned mgk because mgk who's another rapper years ago had tweeted something about his gun caching gun Kelly. Oh, what are you mgk in me, Bro? I thought was mgk. I don't know, I'm not trying to be cool. I thought that his fucking name was. I did see that. Yeah. So, uh, did you see the rap videos where they went back into a terrible. Both of them. Both sides killed them. So I got sucked into a vortex where I was watching all the commentary on it. No, it was, but I, I was fascinated by people's take us takes on it. When people were saying, Oh man, murdered him. And I listened to it, I was like, this is terrible.

Speaker 3:          02:11:56       Well, with Tara was killed, shot terrible, or was wrapped. Devil terrible. They both suck. Rose. He's not a rap guy, so this doesn't. I do like and I'm only marginally a guys like Redo. Okay. Yes I do. I listen to a lot of reps that just felt like it was just. I actually liked the mgk song though. Like the beat. Okay. It was a good beat. Congratulations. But he like ruined his career as a result of this. No, that's what I look at. The light that this like on Youtube, it's like fucking 50 percent dislike. Why do you pay attention to that? I, that's why I told you I got sucked into a vortex of it. You can't pay attention to that. That's not representative of whether or not the guy has a career. I bet it boosted his plot. I mean that was the argument people said maybe he did it because even though he's this photo is sort of what ended it.

Speaker 3:          02:12:40       He posted this thing like I when sort of with this large crowd behind them, but he didn't tell them that he was opening his opening for fall out boy. And this is followup boys crowd. Yeah. He told them he took off his jacket. At the last second, so everyone turned around for a picture and then he got booted after this by the entire crowd. Did he know he got booed? There's a video of it. But did they actually, one of the bullying videos was fake. I do remember that. I don't know if it was this one, but I do know that he had a Hoodie on or something and he took it off before this picture. So they didn't know that you had that shirt on, which is the cover of m and m's album. And you're right, it was fallout boys crab, which is kind of a weird weasely move of this guy to do.

Speaker 3:          02:13:19       I'm sleeping. Joe's Joe doesn't care about the rap game. Wants to. Not that I don't care about the rap game. It's this fucking. These distracts are so lazy that he took the distracts, get me interested again. That's what it took to get me interested because I remember back when was fifty cent versus jd kiss and I fucking loved it. But when I was a kid, I fucking love that. The J dot Rapp was one of the best. Uh, I thought it was the best battle rap I've ever heard. Well, what about Jay z versus non? So that's a classic, that's a classic. And that did nothing but help both of them. Right? A kid help nas more than help. Jay Z dot I think. No, no, you think Jay z versus not has helped. Jay Z, black twitter. Look at it as an expert over there. He loves it.

Speaker 3:          02:14:02       He gets crazy. He'll come back and tell you who's dating, who they run the twitter and all the memes of oil comes from. They run twitter. One 25 percent of twitter memes and everything is coming out of black twitter. Twenty five percent. Did you do the math? It's a known fact, Bro. I'm like, Bro, I didn't pull it out of my ass. Okay. Um, speaking of social media, have you seen all these purges recently? There's a new round of it that just happened. No Way. A purge, 800 or 800 or more accounts were purged from facebook and twitter and they're all, almost all alternative media accounts. So some of the sites are snowflakes. Was One, I think on facebook there's another one called anti media that was purged there, an antiwar media thing, free thought project is another one. Take this and there was cop watch, police.

Speaker 3:          02:14:49       The police was called. So basically what they're saying is it's such a bullshit argument. They said, oh, the reason we pulled this is because it's inauthentic behavior. We're pulling these accounts because there's inauthentic behavior on those accounts. What does that mean? I don't know. That's the point. And they never clarified. So what I think it means is, hey, these are, you know, these are alternative media outlets and we want to get rid of them so we're just gonna get rid of them because facebook, I know met with the Israeli government and Israel told them, hey listen, if you're gonna be in our country, you're going to get rid of certain accounts and facebook when right along and said, sure, we'll do that with China, with Google. Right. But now I think they're doing that in the US now. I think there, yes. I think they're working in cahoots with the US government and so you have all these alternative media counselor, specifically antiwar.

Speaker 3:          02:15:34       What have you. Anticorruption some of these are okay and they're getting purged? No. The argument was inauthentic behavior. That was one of the reasons they cited as to why they got rid of this inauthentic behavior. Does that mean that they're talking about instances that they're misrepresenting? No, I think it means more like bots. That's how I interpreted it. It's like, oh, you know you're posting it and you're directing people to your own, you know stuff and everybody does that on facebook and twitter. Is it possible that that's what was going on? I don't know. I'm just asking is it possible they were using bots and perhaps directing them towards revenue creating sites or. My. My whole thing is why shouldn't that be allowed? Well, I'm not saying they shouldn't be allowed, but is it possible that they were using stories that were taking place in the news, distorting those stories to get people to click on things that would have links to ways that these people can make money, so instead of it being some sort of political

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       activism website that really was just a revenue generating bullshit site that was trying to drum up artificial outrage, is that possible? I think for some of them it's certainly possible, but certainly not. Certainly not for the free thought project. What is it free thought project? It's another one of these, I think they described themselves as like an antiestablishment or anti corruption, you know, thing where they cover all these stories related to government corruption, kind of like a wiki leaks type thing, except they don't do the Wiki leaks, does more of the original reporting stuff and they'll just cover it after the fact. And how many facebook deleted them? Facebook, I think I read it in, if, I think there was an article in the Guardian, Jamie, if you're interested in pulling it up, it's um, facebook and twitter purge 100 sites. So when you mix it was like, I think it was mostly on facebook, like 600 or so on facebook and the 200 or so on twitter that they did and a lot of them were like one of the accounts that over 3 million people who liked it.

Speaker 1:          02:17:24       Now, the free thought project, what has their response been to this? I don't know. I don't because I only saw the original article. I haven't seen anything after it, you know, this is a discussion that I was having with red the other day. We were talking here it is. First they came for Alex Jones. We told you you are next. We're, oh, we were next. We were. This is on their website, but they did cover it in the Guardian and some other outlets in case anybody's thinking that this is bs. Yeah. That's so good. It is a scary time because you see that this can impact, you know, really anybody who's not toeing the line, if you will, like a police, the police. Are we really gonna like, do we really think that they pulled that down? Not for the obvious reason, which is that you're sowing discord and the police don't like it as part of its purge.

Speaker 1:          02:18:09       Facebook has removed the pages of several police accountability watch dog critic groups, including Copblock, the free thought project and police the police. They've also apparently severely restricted. The activity for the photography is not a crime page. Huh? So you think they're getting pressure from law enforcement? I don't. I don't know, but I never usually believe in a smoke filled backroom conspiracies, but they're starting to get hard to avoid because there's so many of these things. When, um, scroll down please. Here's what we need. Look at this and how does this poem, and again says first they came for Alex Jones and info wars, but I wasn't race baiting, transfer spirits. He cultivated Clemson, murdered children, new town. Where are hoaxes and admitted in court that I'm just an entertainer who makes shit up, so I said nothing. Yeah, they're just trying to be flippant about how Alex Jones was pulled.

Speaker 1:          02:18:59       The problem was once you bought into the principle of Alex Jones being polled, well then what you're saying is people who are executives at these companies can willy nilly decide whoever they want to pull down. Now my answer to that has always been we should take twitter, facebook, these giant social media pages. They can still be private companies, but we should regulate them like their public utilities. You know? That's the argument that Ari and I were discussing, 100 percent. That's the only answer because you need to default to free speech. Now I'm not saying if somebody doxing

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       somebody or somebody directly threatening somebody and stuff like that, there should be a process set up where you can ameliorate that and do it quickly. But having said that, like people forget man, the Acl, you used to defend the KKK in course, or would already brought up. Yes, and they said, hey, in Skokie, they said, hey listen, we know we don't agree with these people. We think they're heinous. We think they're terrible. We think they're dead wrong, but they have a right to say what they're saying because once you get rid of it for them, what people don't realize though is that these things will always come back against people who are powerless and marginalized. It's not like when you censor, everybody gets together and we all go, okay, so it's just the Nazis, right? Yes. It's just the Nazis. No, first of all, who's running these? You know, these organizations, obviously they have their own opinions and their own vested interests and their own power dynamic issues and they're going to take down whoever threatens their power now is are all these organizations still up on youtube and twitter and Google? I don't know. To my knowledge, the only one that totally got pulled down everywhere I think was Alex Jones. He still has

Speaker 6:          02:20:24       website here. It says all but proving the case. This was a coordinated attack by the tech giant community. Shortly after the purge on facebook, twitter follows suit, wiping out our profiles on there as well. They gave absolutely no reason for the suspension. Said we had closed the freethought umbrella, had close to 6 million followers. Wow. Isn't that crazy? And they just decided overnight. What's crazy is I didn't even hear about. Well that's why I'm here. I appreciate you. I mean I had heard that it was 800 different pages, but the way I'd read it, and I unfortunately don't have a lot of time and I was flipping through something I'd read that it was a lot of um, anti-police pages.

Speaker 3:          02:21:07       Some of them were anti police, but I think a lot of them were not. A lot of them were antiestablishment anti corruption, like they've always had it out for wikileaks. For example, Wiki leaks as well. I mean, you've had mike pump hale, one of the top trump administration officials because it says they're like a nonstate terrorist actor. Think about that. That's nuts. That is because basically what they do is what discharging reporters should say, hey, here's what the bad guy, here's what the people in the government are doing and this is the stuff that they're keeping secret that they shouldn't keep secret, and our government goes, oh, that's terrorism.

Speaker 6:          02:21:38       Now, when twitter or one of these people, one of these organizations, bands, something like the free thought project, do they make any statements or they just remove them

Speaker 3:          02:21:48       all? I saw what was on the Guardian article and on the Guardian they said it was inauthentic behavior was the reason why they were pulling them and maybe one or two other things that I'm forgetting at the moment.

Speaker 6:          02:21:56       That is a fucking weird statement. I know. Authentic behavior. Yeah. Yeah. It's fucked up man, because they could just do it to anybody. That's the point and that's what's so scary. Well, that is what scary, right? Is that there are private companies and these people are allowed to post on them until they decide they're not allowed to post on them because they violate their terms of service, but when your terms of service with are that open ended inauthentic behavior, like what the fuck does that even mean? So

Speaker 1:          02:22:25       they just. They leave the terms of service purposefully vague so that they can get away with knocking off wherever they want to knock off. It's just weird that they all agreed that facebook agreed and twitter agreed. Like what would be the incentive of twitter to follow suit? Will it be the incentive smokey back room given to. If you had to speculate. Okay. What do you think would be given to them that would give them the incentive to want to pull a site that's kind of like Jack Dorsey guys seems pretty socially progressive. I think they are meeting just like what we said, we know they did this with Israel where they pulled down pro Palestinian human rights pages to allow facebook to function in their country. They said you have to do x, Y, and Z dot. I think that there are meetings with, I don't know exactly who it is, our intelligence agencies, law enforcement, FBI, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:23:12       Somebody like that. Maybe CEO's of various corporations where they say, hey man, listen, these people are problem. These people are problem. These people are a problem. Let's do the right thing here. I would like to hear a contrary argument. Well, I don't know. I would like to know immediately. I would like to know like what is the. What is the contrary argument? Is there anything that we're missing? If we want, we could try to find the guardian article and read what they said, what twitter said, what twitter and facebook says, see if you could find that, you know the Guardian article. It's not coming up and pulled it off the internet guardian. What did, what was the headline? Searched it and went on news and like there was no articles from the Guardian by the way, the only two. The only two things I found, the only two things I found it on rt and the Guardian and nothing else, which is why you didn't hear about it because mainstream media didn't talk about it because guess what?

Speaker 1:          02:24:01       These outlets, oftentimes our competition to mainstream media. What the fuck man that is. So the Alex Jones thing is really like a test run almost pretty much searching on their website, on the Guardian website, rethought project that's using google to do it and the top article is something about food in 2013. Well when we get off here, I'll do a search and we can see if we could find a statement. Yeah. But when we get unfair is not helping all those people. The newest right now they saw it. They saw the article from the free thought project and that says the same information. We just don't have the exact statement from twitter and facebook on it. That's the only thing. See if you can just google statement from twitter that wasn't involved. The free thought that wasn't in the article. They just threw it in the middle of the article.

Speaker 1:          02:24:49       It was like facebook and twitter purges accounts for, I don't know if it's an inauthentic behavior in the title, but it was an article somewhere, so you really think that there's some sort of smokey back room deals where they say, listen to you, you guys are making tons of money. We've got a bit of an issue here. Let's work through this. This is what we want removed. These people are causing us a bunch of problems. I don't know, but I, I do know they did that in Israel. I do know that they do that in all these countries where the government say, hey, in order to function here you have to do x, Y, and Z, so why wouldn't they do that in the US? That's what I would say to that. But what groups would want the free thought project or police the police removed?

Speaker 1:          02:25:28       Well, you gotta remember a lot of these. So the police accountability groups, I mean it's pretty easy law enforcement. What would want that removed? Right. But do you think law enforcement has the kind of pulled to go to twitter and not like the, you know, whatever. The Police Department in Toledo, but if the FBI maybe. Sure, or the CIA or whoever, major law enforcement, general law enforcement, the thing that people kept going to with Alex Jones was Sandy Hook, Sandy Hook. He said children didn't get the sale. You don't have to defend Alex Jones on the merits of that point because he's dead wrong. On that point, when you're descending is the principle of letting somebody speak. I understand. Yeah. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is there's no thing that they're going to on this, so it's like there's already been a precedent set. They could just remove people.

Speaker 1:          02:26:12       So they removed him. They got this here. It got sloppier. Yeah. Well it got more clandestine because there's no. There's no big smoking gun. There's no nothing. It's just all of a sudden the yanked. Yep. That's right. And again, no major mainstream media outlet in the US reported on it. Our is Russia today. Jamie's got exact article. Okay. There's this image of all media by facebook is pushing back just to beginning censorship in state. They may cite the Guardian article in this article. I was looking more about because I saw this article that came out, it's us pushing back today from today. This is from today. Today I saw a different article on the same. Scroll down and make that a little bigger please.

Speaker 7:          02:26:59       Hm.

Speaker 6:          02:27:00       So that. So people were starting to catch onto it. Scroll left so we can see. There you go. The latest appearance of an apparent censorship of political speech online us based tech giants this month shut down hundreds of user accounts, some belonged to wells to abis. Alternative media outlets with hundreds of thousands of followers, like the free thought project or anti-media senior fellow with German Marshall Fund leading think tank, advocating us global supremacy seems to have at least partially taking credit for this. It says in quotes, Russia, China, and other foreign states take advantage of our open political system, Jamie. Fly set. They can invent stories that got repeated and spread through different sites. So we are just starting to push back just this last week, facebook became began starting to take down sites. So this is just the beginning. Okay. So what they're saying is that these websites have been infiltrated by people from China and Russia. Is that what they're saying? But scroll back up again, please stop. It said China and other foreign states take advantage of our open political system. Russia, China.

Speaker 1:          02:28:11       So that is. That is somebody from the German Marshall Fund, a leading think tank, advocating us interest, saying that because we're so scared of Russia, Russian, Chinese, Russian and Chinese infiltration. That's why we got to pull down. So in other words, they're saying, hey, maybe these accounts like the free thought project are run by people who are trying to destroy America. So we have to pull them down. Exactly. And that's beyond a preposterous argument. This is what they're saying. They're saying they can invent stories. They get repeated in spread through different sites. So we're just starting to push back just this last week. Facebook again started take downsides to this. Just the beginning. So they're, they're blaming the influence of Russia and China and that they're saying that this is their excuse for taking down these pages because these pages are being compromised by foreign agents. It's the oldest trick in the book to say, Oh, these foreign entities or sowing discord in the United States, so therefore we're not going to allow this dialogue to happen. In fact, I remember they blamed Russia for black lives matter facebook pages during the 2016 election, but what's fucked up about this is there's not even any smoking gun. There's. There's no evidence. They just say it, right? They're not, but they're not even pointing to a specific example. Yeah, that's right. Any example where, yes, you're correct. Scroll down and see if there's anything in this that makes any sense.

Speaker 1:          02:29:28       According to the account, flying complained that any person with an email and set up an account on social media and potentially reach a wide audience, you're predicting a long global struggle to fix the situation. Jesus Christ. Oh, great. He started his career as the US political circles as an advisor to George W dot Bush administration is always trust those people. Also a foreign policy and national security consultant for this Senator Marco Rubio. These are the geniuses who should regulate the Internet, right? These guys who've been wrong about everything reliably. Well, this is the thing, if you could just say, oh, the Russians have influenced this, the Russians are a part of this, the Chinese, okay, pull it. It's hacky and it's partisan and it actually works for on the left and the right. Sometimes it works on Corporate Democrats and people who want to blame Hillary's election loss on the Russians and it works on you that played that. Let's hear him talk because you're a little bit of it. Can I go to the bathroom real quick? I'll be right back

Speaker 7:          02:30:33       here.

Speaker 2:          02:30:34       Principles values as one of our greatest strengths and therefore one of the best ways to weaken us. So I think that that's one of the key things to understand here is Putin's acting actually out of weakness and why

Speaker 1:          02:30:47       we jamie not come to understand or at least the consciousness in this country does not necessarily view Putin

Speaker 2:          02:30:54       aligned with other strong men figures. This has been a long running problem in American foreign policy. This is not just a problem that started with President Donald Trump. I served in the Bush administration. President George W dot Bush tried to form a relationship with Vladimir Putin to get certain things to advance us. National Security. President Obama tried the same thing with is reset of Russian, a US Russian relations. So it's not unusual that you have an administration that maybe doesn't necessarily view Russia as the threat that it is. Um, I think the politics of this, the public opinion right now, it's very interesting because you've actually seen a shift over the last several years. More Democrats now actually I think actually view Russia and Putin as a threat, uh, compared to where they were still here.

Speaker 6:          02:31:41       But boy, this gives you, it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth, is the idea that these people are just deciding to remove pages and there going on television giving these interviews, saying that it's because of Russia and Putin without any evidence. Oh, so maybe they didn't share the evidence. You've got to say something, man. I mean, if you want to be. If you believe in a free society and you believe in freedom of speech and freedom of expression and you censorship censor people are shit, Bro, what's going on here?

Speaker 3:          02:32:17       I'll fix it. I would only go with that. And maybe that, um, what happened? Nothing. So it's something that they don't have a fix for the, for the way that it's happening. So if you show the evidence, then you're, you're literally showing the criminals how to how to do this and it could just run more rampant and they got to plug more holes.

Speaker 6:          02:32:33       Well that would be the devil's advocate position, but in order to take people down, the thing is if they're doing it and no one's pushing back,

Speaker 6:          02:32:44       you're just going to be able to do it with anybody that disagrees with you or anybody that's going to be an impediment to your political campaign or anyone's getting the way of anything you're trying to push through. And then this is, this is a giant issue with people that have that kind of power that can influence facebook or twitter. And if that's the case, and look, we don't know, we haven't talked to Zuckerberg, we haven't talked to Jack Dorsey, we don't know who's, who's pulling strings or who's asking them to do things or what evidence they presented to them. But that's just very uncomfortable. It's very uncomfortable to see that guy talking and bringing up Russia and Putin because people bring them up. Like they're the man, you know, this is what's the brushing poot they're, they're, they're interfering with our democracy, interfering with our issues here in America and they, they want to ruin democracy and bring our country down from the inside.

Speaker 3:          02:33:31       Yeah. It was like, um, the Internet went through a phase of like just totally free and open wild wild west type thing and now it looks like they're trying to reel it back in. And it's like, that's the viewed as the public square. It's supposed to be the, these social media outlets which are so gigantic and so powerful that this is now the public square. So to be able to censor people in these, in these forums should be considered unconstitutional, coordinated, inauthentic behavior. Oh, you found it. You found articles spamming

Speaker 7:          02:34:02       hm,

Speaker 3:          02:34:03       but again, the like the websites that they actually pulled down, that totally destroys their argument. Even if you buy into the premise that these are, this is a good reason to pull somebody down. I mean some of the people, the pages

Speaker 6:          02:34:17       they pulled down were so well established and there are of course not inauthentic in any way. It's people who are running these pages that really deeply care about these issues and want to get this news out to people. Fuck, this is a good quote here. Drawing the line between real and inauthentic views is a difficult enterprise that could put everything from impartial political parody to genuine but outlandish views on the chopping block and find us. There are politicians in the US. This happened during the debate between Ted Cruz and Beta O'rourke all at the exact same time with the exact same hashtags. There were pro ted Cruz. Things tweeted out at once, so at that is their bots that they bought to help Ted Cruz win the election. That's election interference. That's inauthentic behavior and nobody's talking about pulling down those accounts. Look at what it says here in a statement posted online newsroom.

Speaker 6:          02:35:09       Facebook says it, purge those pages because they're owners were using fake accounts, sharing the same content between multiple pages and linking to add supported websites. It calls ad farms, so what that doesn't even is that even a controversial, but this is where it gets interesting it says, but what the social network calls spam the owners of these pages call standard procedures for operating on facebook. Yeah. That was like. I don't even think if the argument from facebook is correct that there really is a reason to pull them down and go. It says here, nearly all the page owners contact by the Guardian, say they use backup or fake accounts. Hmm. Along with their real ones, they do it in part to protect themselves from being targeted by political opponents and having their real accounts end up in facebook jail. Reverse press, a left leaning news site whose facebook page disappear yesterday, so this is on the left and the right.

Speaker 6:          02:36:05       They're censoring people because you got snowflakes on the right. There's another one right wing news that was pulled down. Stop scrolling. Please, but, but look at this, this is really interesting there w, so they're admitting to disingenuous behavior though they're using fake accounts to protect themselves were being targeted by political opponents. Well it's, but that's if that's the case, they are violating facebook policy. So I've seen this on twitter. I know people who have gotten their accounts banned on twitter but they create a new account and they stay on twitter and that's technically a violation of terms of service, but it also is something that I don't think is religious at all. Right. But there's a big difference between someone getting banned and then starting a fake, a second account. This is not that they're, they're using multiple accounts at the same time and some of them are fake.

Speaker 6:          02:36:51       Look, I'm not, I'm not justifying their being banned, but I am saying that they violated certain procedures and they did so in order to public publicize their ideas and they did it to try to make their ideas more, just more project them more have have more, more bandwidth. But according to facebook, should you not be allowed to have like three or four accounts where you tweet the same stuff or post the same stuff? Because it seems like you said though what facebook said, if you scroll back up to the beginning, scroll back up at the beginning please. That's part of the top. The top, the top, top. See what it says. A coordinated inauthentic behavior and spamming. So they were spamming and that does sound like coordinated inauthentic behavior. If they have a bunch of alternative fake sites and fake pages that they using to spread their stuff.

Speaker 6:          02:37:40       Look, I'm not saying that they should have been. This is, I think better would be to say, hey, you can't do that. You've got to remove these fake pages that are publicizing your ideas and just have your real authentic page. But what they're saying is that they're, they're leaking to add farms and that they use this to publicize their pages and that everybody does it. Everybody does it. You're not supposed to do it. So why wouldn't they pulled? So let's say the free thought project have three or four other things where they were posting the same stuff under a different name. Why would you not pull down to three or four other things and leave up to the free thought project? I think they're saying [inaudible] the free thought project violated their terms of service. You're not supposed to do that. So you don't want them to do that.

Speaker 6:          02:38:25       I don't know. See, here's the thing. Would they have pulled the free thought project down if they hadn't engaged in any of these forbidden behaviors? My opinion is I think yes, maybe that's what I think may be, but that is gross. You're not supposed to do that and I'm not saying that they should be pulled, they shouldn't be pulled, but maybe they thought this is what they have to do to get the word out and maybe facebook is like, hey, you fucks are spamming and you're. You're linking to these ad farms and these ad farms have been known to be influenced by Russia and China and all these other organizations. You're doing it just to promote your sites. But we're saying that we can't allow that kind of behavior. It just strikes me as very strange that when you have examples like the one I just gave were maturing the ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke debate.

Speaker 6:          02:39:15       They all tweeted the same thing at the same time. It was obviously paid for by some right wing think tank. You never hear the story of something like that. If it's benefiting us politician or something. Like when Mitt Romney bought like a million fake followers on twitter and the 2012 election, you never hear about like, okay, we targeted that. It's always like, oh, it just happens to be these independent alternative media outlets. They're spreading the information that the government doesn't want people to know. Well, it could be that these people are saying, hey look, everybody does this. We're going to do this. And they're saying we don't like them there. Oh, and look, we caught them doing something we. We don't allow. Yeah, let's sweep them. But that's possible. Is it possible that they wouldn't have been removed if they hadn't done this shit than not supposed to do?

Speaker 6:          02:39:58       It's possible, but I don't think it's likely. I don't know though because here's the thing, how look if it's only people who've engaged in these forbidden behaviors that get removed, then facebook has a very good argument, but if facebook is saying this, but then people were removed who are straight above board doing everything the right way, just have their own page posted information on their own page and they were never removed. But these are all political and alternative media which is interesting. So they were targeted. Yes. Alright. So they're targeted, but in the targeting them, they found a bunch of shit that you're not supposed to do and that's what got them removed.

Speaker 3:          02:40:34       I think that there is a good argument that facebook could make, which is very much a nuance troll terms of service argument, but I think it's more of a veneer or a facade than the real heart of why they did what they did. But again, that's just my opinion. I'm not stating that as a fact.

Speaker 6:          02:40:48       I agree with you. I mean, surely what they should have done, especially given the popularity of these sites, is warn them and say, Hey, you've got to stop doing this because if you don't, we are going to remove you. You were violating our terms of service. You are linking to add farms and you have posted from multiple fake accounts. Stopped doing that. Just use your one authentic account. We support free speech. That's what we both like, right? Yeah, sure. Yeah. I mean it could be also that they feel like the right wing sites do this. We have to do this too. This is how people do it in 2018 is how you really get the word out. That true.

Speaker 3:          02:41:24       Yeah. You know, I just, I've found it interesting that it was all alternative media and political accounts and or left. It was just the main thing that seemed to be the connecting tissue through it all was relatively antiestablishment. It's gross. It is gross, man. Have you been following what's happening with Iran at all? No, I have not. There's a little bit of ramping up of tensions now. So of course we pulled out of the Iran deal, the nuclear deal. Um, I don't think that was a good idea because according to the IAEA International Atomic Energy Agency, they verified that six different times. Iran was following that deal and trump pulled out of it. Anyway, that hurt are, you know, diplomatic talks, if you will. And then this story broke a few weeks ago, the International Criminal Court. So Iran sued theU , s and according to the International Criminal Court, they said, hey, we can't, we're not allowed to sanction them when they allow in humanitarian goods.

Speaker 3:          02:42:24       So our response to that was to say, fuck off International Criminal Court. We're not pulling out of the International Criminal Court. So talks about basically totally broken down. And now the fear is, um, that we could be on the road to war because we have neo-con John Bolton, who's in the trump administration, has always wanted a war with Iran. We have Mike Pompeo who also wants war with Iran. And um, it's just, it's not a good situation because we had a pretty solid deal there and now it's more likely Iran gets a new if they want it, um, and the tensions are ramping up and if they blocked it because Iran is economies imploding right now and if we block their oil exports, that's when you know that we're about to do some sort of regime change action over there.

Speaker 6:          02:43:05       Dude, I have to end this unfortunately. Do you have anything happy to say before we wrap this up? No, I don't. Listen, I'm sorry. I have 34, 10, a secular talk. Give out your youtube address again. Sure. It's youtube.com/secular talking on twitter on at Kyle Kalinsky Chi. We've got to do this more often all the time, man. When are you going to be back when you don't know, but next time I'm back. I'll definitely be on. Thanks Bro. Appreciate you man. Thanks man. Appreciate you too. Appreciate it. All right folks, we'll be back. See Ya.
