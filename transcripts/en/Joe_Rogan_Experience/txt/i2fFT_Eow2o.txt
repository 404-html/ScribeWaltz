Speaker 1:          00:00:00       They'd be really careful. We don't talk over each other because, um, you know, it's fucking, it's hard not to. There's six of us here. Yeah, Brian. All right. We're live. We're live. You fucking freaks. Ladies and gentleman, this is an unprecedented podcast. This is the first time we've ever done an after the fact podcast. Brendan Schaub and I know all the Goddamn results. I honey else, Brian knows one result. Yeah. Eddie knows none. Robyn. I know. He knows a mom. Yeah, the only one. So this is beautiful. So no one's going to cheat a, we're not gonna, we're not gonna fix, but a, we decided, we've got a bunch of people here. Jimmy Burke's here. Our friend Jimmy Burke from New York was in town for Brian's birthday party last night. Uh, Eddie Bravo was here. Of course, Brian counts here. Brendan Schaub, Robin Blacks and towns and Robin blacks here. So, uh, it's gonna be a lot of talking over each other folks.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       Okay. It's just deal with that. Just deal with that. We're going to watch the fights and uh, and again also if you are expecting any of us to like constantly watch the fights only and not, that's not going to happen either. So there's no rules. Okay. Whatever expectations you have released those or, or whatever, you know, one of these or worrisome. All right. Right now we're playing it. We're going to start it and we recorded it. So this is the first time we've, we've got a recording and we're going to watch the fights. I'm going to fast forward to when should I fast forward. I should fast forward the first fight, right? Yeah. Really sit down at anyways, let's watch the commercials. All that shit. I'm excited about this, but the problem is we can't really play it out loud where we can hear on podcasts.

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       I know, but that's what I'm saying. So we might as well just fast forward through all this nonsense. This pregame bulls. Yeah. It's kind of like porn. So there's some good fights in this fucking card. Um, is good fights in actuality and good fights on yes. Most of it all. And Cowboy Dude. Yeah. Dude. Damn man. Really does know the result. I love it. I love the just, man. I had to watch that fight. I just had been out of the loop. I want to hear, I can't wait for your breakdown. Robin black. So here we go. We're a fast forward through Jon Anik and is super metro-sexual toss that towel. Wow. Rock and purple ties. Maybe it's um, for in Omaj to Prince. So, uh, we'll, we'll fast forward on cancer. Yeah, why not, man? So the first fight is uh, Alex Caceres versus, um, what's homeboy's name that he fights?

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       He fights a dude from Alan Belcher's camp. He's a wild man. Read Night Jason. Nice Jason Nights. That's right. He's fucking good. Yeah, he's very good. And he's crazy and he's got to talk to, he talks mad shit inside the octagon to, he has his fight and he was screaming at this dude going, come on man. Take me down now. You want to take me down? You want to stay on with me, bitch? Yeah. He said, you don't want to take now bitch. I was like delirious. Hilarious. I came out on the broadcast. Yeah, yeah. Well I was laughing while it was happening because, uh, I was doing the commentary and while I was going down, not during this broadcast was another broadcast. This fight is with him and Alex Caceres. So this is a, uh, like a kind of a sleeper. A fight. Yeah. Cool. Fight. All right, here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:03:11       Boom. All right, so for the folks at home, what we'll do is when the first fight starts, right now they're showing the, um, a side by side comparisons, the heights and weights and jazz, a tale of the tape. And now Bruce buffer is doing a little introduction here. Why do they call it the tale of the tape? It's been that for 50 years bikes, somebody invented that. That was new ones. Well, you know what's weird man? How can they stop? They stop measuring legs. They measured legs for a little while and then they stop measuring legs. They were doing only weeks. Yeah, did it for filtering and box. And they measured late. We were always complaining like with John Jones, you're not fighting his arms. You're finding his arms and his fucking legs. And he's so tall. Wall gun give is Joe Silva who asked for leg reach I think.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       Yes. Yeah. Joe asked for a lot of shit. He's the, he's the reason why a Mickey galls hey Mickey, you're so fine. You're so fine. You're right. That's how it got on the uh, the broadcast because Dana White, it was like, fuck that. You can't play that song for Mickey Gallo when he fought cm punk, you know, you know Dana so particular he goes through all the walkout songs before cause he loves music. He shot one of my walkout songs down the night before the fight. What was the song? It was a, I forget in Brazil there's some cool song. I thought it was cool. It's like a dance song and I get a call in my, uh, my coach was like, Hey, it's Dana. Why might go shit, what's going on? I'm letting you know bonus earlier some cause I thought I was going to knock out Nogueira out and like just give it to me now.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       And he's like, hey, that walkout sounds not happening. Picks up the Nelson. I was like, wow, this is, what did you pick? A I m and m square dance. Oh, okay. All right. Alex, get Sarah's and Jason Knight for 57 50 64554504453 all right. Sync it up cause Sarah's the shelf on the left hand, right. Get inside leg. Bruce Leroy, you Harris is super underrated. Him mean you gotta. You gotta remember what Yaya Rodriguez did to Bj Penn and then think of him and [inaudible]. They essentially fought to basically might've been a draw. That's a style matchup, but don't you think way for me with Bruce Leroy. I like him. He's fun to watch. We still hot and Cole. Yeah, he's on. He's off. He's gone. He's off. Craig Jackson used Leroy for most of the sparring rounds for Bj. No Kid. He was his main spine guy and he was doing great or great with them.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       I actually thought Bj did very well in the first two minutes. The difference between what [inaudible] does and Alex does is Alex is strikes they the, they come and high volume, interesting angles. He's very creative, but they're not instantaneous and lethal. The ear can fuck you up with one shot and street kicker in MMA history. You know what? You got to send him, you got to see him against a worldclass moy targets. That's what you got to see. Cause right now we don't see him. No, no, no. I'm seeing greatest of all time and every now and then picks up

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       every now and then someone that's one of those comfortable kicks every now and then he'd lines multiple. Every fight jet leak kicks that he or his landing, nobody else's landing chippy kicks. He was doing that. J pen always fights from a boxing distance in a lot of ways. Who Styles Taylormade. He's an older guy. He hasn't fun. Two plus years before that, he got work by Frankie Edgar. So you're, you're talking about a Bj Penn has been seriously out of the loop for a long time and then he steps in there against this fucking Bandolero do throw in three 60 round cakes. I mean his style, like it was almost like everything was Taylor suited for Yahya Rodriguez for my fighters and recommending I'm talking, I told a couple of them they should start just doing a local Sunday taekwondo class once a week just to get the spins tap, you know, it works.

Speaker 2:          00:06:53       We know it's effective. Look, yeah, years proven it. Every end of the main fighter out there should be emulating Yahya. Yeah, I agree. I think the days of coming out, and of course I don't know anything about striking, but the days of coming out and just boxing and throwing a leg kick every now and then, I think that's, that's not going to work. You're not gonna. It's not gonna work against a guy like Jon Jones Gregor. You, you see these guys throwing all those Taekwondo Kung Fu kicks successfully. If you're an MMA fighter up there, you coming up, I think you should start taking taekwondo now. That's a new point, but I think if you watch glory, there's a good fight that I talked about recently because I got Joseph Valtellina on it. Used to be good judge. He's wicked, wicked kickboxing champion. Really good guy too. But anyway, he fought Raymond Daniels.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       He's one of the best at throwing those wild, crazy fun Leroy. It's like a god man. Me Means what? What I'm Raymond Daniels did inside the octagon or inside the glory ring. He threw a flying side, kick touch the dude and then spinning back, kicked him in the air in the face. Oh yeah. Yo Raymond Daniels is a wild motherfucker. But anyway, Matrix Valtellina so you would see him just doing the same kind of stuff that Yahya Rodriguez does. He would say, oh my God, if this guy gets in the UFC, he's gonna fuck everybody up. But Joseph optoline just chopped him down, shopped in Beshar t pressure, really strong physical guy, high guard, super tight defense, and just kept kicking the fuck out of his legs. And then he finally head taekwondo mix. No, I totally agree with you. But I'm saying is we need to see a year against a guy like a Niki hold skin or a guy like, uh, like a Joseph [inaudible] who's, they have that super powerful low kick fundamental game. And we don't have a lot of guys that are that strong at that inside the octagon. Yeah. I'm sorry. Joe would mutilate them. Val and he would just rip it now I MMA they kickbox shows way larger than I am. So it's not a good matchup. Technique wise though. And fundamentals thoughts. He's just on another level when it comes to this. Kickbox is leg. Yeah. Years. Yeah. I'm really talking to kickbox and we're only talking just

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       talking straight. Yeah, I get what you're saying. But he's seeing it. So when I get speech and speech, but in MMA with an IBM taken down, taken down, you know what I mean? So you could do wild shit and kickboxing because there's no threat of getting choked out. That's true. So I'm thinking, but those guys are way better too. They're way better at lake higher level. The reason these things in a real fight though, that that's what I was saying because he's doing it in a real site, so he's better taking it back. Oh, not enough time.

Speaker 3:          00:09:36       Oh, he's in great. He's got enough time now. He's pushing up on the Chin on the chin. He should dance Evernham right there. Oh, someone through a card in the arts. Corsets. Dicks. Yeah, so went through like a business card in the octagon. I squared Daddy. I think the reason you're seeing these kicks work is cause guys weren't training them. If everybody's training the same shit, you're supposed to do something different. Everybody in the gym, the Training Jab, cross, low kick, low kick, left hook. They're doing all the same stuff. If we all trained the same stuff at our training, partners train all the same stuff. We're not prepared for different stuff too. The thing is, yeah, you could do the other shit too. Yes, he's very good. He's very good at scrambling. I think he's a pro bono, but I think he's purple. Rambling wrestling would be an issue, but what I'm saying is his Moitai is good too.

Speaker 3:          00:10:21       Like he's got a real strong leg kick fundamentals. He throws good elbows. He throws wild shit now in that Bj Penn fight, if they got in like an instant rematch, like in another dimension, hopefully not. But yeah. What would be pulling guard might be, Oh yes, because we already saw shit. We took a glimpse. He couldn't take them down with straight rustling. Always try it. First option should be tried to take him, take him down with straight wrestling passes, guard, get on top mount, take us back. But if you can't take the guy down and he's beaten you up, stand, what else are you going to do? Bj, Bj, Bj got on him. There's an art to pulling guard. It's just like a take down but don't just sit on your butt. It's also a shoot deep enough to make him sprawl and come up with a lot of Paul Paul.

Speaker 3:          00:11:12       He shoots and then now you got something, but what you're describing is different. Again, it's what not the norm of what everybody's training and that's why it's a great idea. I call it the third option. In that case, pulling guard, especially BJ's a world champion black belt, he should have a guard. Crazy taps. Anybody off of his back. BJ would always sweep. God's always mountain, take the back trying to pull guard, sweep and get a shower. It's just interesting that he never tapped her on the numbers number. Nogueira versus Tim Silvia get swept them wanting to take him down. Couldn't take him down. Tim was, was fucking him up with that Long Jab. What are Nogueira do? He shot for a week as single and then pull guard and we'll have time. Yeah. Pull that off guard. Yeah. Miguel Suarez. Anyway, it was a trick he pulled and then he did it again.

Speaker 3:          00:12:06       Deep have sweet. Yep. Got On top and guillotine. Yup. Miguel Torres over and over with the Matrix. Johnson. Yeah. People think pulling guard, I mean is is uh, you bait. It's like admitting you lost the war. Eagles like committing suicide. But if it was committing suicide for real people, think pulling guard. You're going, you're going to get killed. Pulling guard. How come it's so hard to do. How come when Vinny Maga less sits on his ass? People, his opponent got know you stand up. Suicide. He's letting you get on town. Awesome stuff, man. No, it's on top. He broke that into two under hooks.

Speaker 3:          00:12:44       Hooks in. He go straight to the body line and it's such a look like, oh, the fence fucked them. Wow. I was fuck he couldn't arch and sink it in. That's a bad place to be. Sub Two punches to sub to punch us to sub to pile because it's a terrible position to be in. We got fucking body trying to squeezing down your Ab. This guy is a specialist on that body triangle and right here in the old days, this would be over already when they allowed pointed, pointed elbows to the back of the head dancer. Tap Acts. We've talked about this so many times, but I really do want to study on what kind of damaged it happens when you elbow someone in the back of the head and why is it illegal to have to look at the guys back in the battle. Caden, remember John Lewis it to somebody?

Speaker 3:          00:13:29       He landed like three. Does your taste strikers? They're the judo guy. Yeah. Remember that? I remember thinking, man, that's going to kill the rear naked choke. No one needs a rear naked choke. Someone's post in it's old heavy hips. Yeah. You don't need a rear naked choke. Can you do elbow or no, just open hand in. You're in the same target is how are you going to stop someone from that by following through with that elbow. I know. I know guys are finishing on the chin, on the chin. You can't do with just a straight cable over the chin. If you sink it in deep. Great defense by doing good like he is. He's in the worst case scenario and he's fighting and now he's got the law. Don't you think that the hair, like when it comes to gay teens and things like that, it's going to offer you just a touch more friction and it's going to make it harder to get out of stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:14:27       Texture, harder to get into. Yes. That too, right? It's hair I get in the way of sunchokes. I bet it would. Doris. Right. By the way, speaking of the hidden in the back of the head, W I used to go somebody who got hit in the back of the head and lost their taste buds. He got hit once you can go deaf. He could never taste together, going to get hit with, with a punch to the back of the head and he, cause he's never taste again. Eddie after. Uh, so someone's body triangle in and they take the other leg and extend. You get the other foot underneath his leg. Who's in a scenario? I got the body lock here and this, this other foot extending his foot. The I'll show you right here. Look over this foot. I've got the body triangle. This foot here.

Speaker 3:          00:15:11       I've got behind this right here. She hit him. What's the bottom line of your, yeah, that one. The white foot. You'll see right there. Why is he hooking that in there? Just sounded a control. Oh he's just got them. It's a matter of time. That was too hard to keep the level control leg. This not under the knee extended legs. You got the one leg that's controlling and then that that instep is locked under. Say if you got her on the right side, you have the other one you use as a butterfly and you control the leg and if you elevate his leg, it makes it way more difficult for him to do one more step. One more step he has to address. Yeah. It's, it's also like it takes away his mobility, right? Yeah. Cause uh, you want to get body triangle in. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:15:59       You want to have it on. You want to have your opponent on his side and you want the cinched park to be on top. So he wants, he wants it on the other side. So That Butterfly Hook keeps your angle like we're going to keep you right here on the good side for me. Keeps you where you want to be in right there. You see that? Yeah. Yeah. Please do on the wrong side here. But he doesn't care. He's just, he's dealing with it cause it, it puts a lot of pressure on your ankle. It's not a good position to be. I wonder if you could look, Eddie, can you loosen up your ankle so that that doesn't bother you? Some people it doesn't. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. After you do it for a while, you stretch your, it doesn't matter. You want the cinch to be on top.

Speaker 3:          00:16:37       But if it's on bottom, sometimes you switch it. But he's like, I'm just going to leave it there. It doesn't really matter. There's trains out of belters camp that's, yeah, I think he's about this. This is thing that, um, that ballerinas do where they shove their foot into like this like big rubber strap and you know, your foot normally wants to sit like this is big rubber strap. We'll bend it down so that your foot is parallel with your shin bone. It's amazing what the human body would react and respond to and adapt to. Its an amazing, but if you could get that going on then the fucking body triangle, it wouldn't bother you at all. Somebody use that defense. Why are we watching a geico commercial fuck all that. So powerful. Now the people at hallmark. Yeah, we want to tell him how to sync it up on the next one. So we're fast forwarding Jason night. Let's see what he has to says. They can fast forward. Yeah. He's not afraid to say some shit. Jamie. We have somebody down here anyway. I think it's always fresh. Guys. Don't call someone out. Oh, whoever they want to give me. I know you dedicate this fight to oh Brian stayed with it. Is Tim Tebow. His Dad just passed. Oh he did.

Speaker 3:          00:17:51       Thank you so much. His birthday's tomorrow and I know. Thank you so much man. Just died last year. Five days ago. Short amount of time. Is there anybody out there that's NBC, Sir? Did you see that fight with him and he'd be asking for that. It was the craziest fights. Kennedy. Remember that night your boy Kelvin fucked up. That was us together. Do Ho choice. Cub Swanson having like one of the craziest fights of all time of all times. It's beautiful. Fucking slobber knocker nuts and who one cop? Yeah. Yeah. It was like a full on slobber knocker man. Some kid, best athlete in the building fence asked cheese chase best calf for him. [inaudible] he talking about my friend got him to animal birth. Funny Christian Mccaffrey at all. There were a part of us dies. They take all our women, the handsome guy, they stop.

Speaker 3:          00:19:09       That's why the athlete in college football running back, son, that's real. What's this deck as Macquarie Best? That's the best running back in college football. Flat fullback. God, no tailback no second Heisman breakdown on that next week on home and 43 I know and it cool. That's not cool. Come on, Trump's president and we got white fucking rabbit. Kill it. Impossible. I don't believe it's possible with all the new vitamins and kids since they were babies. His Dad was an NFL pro, so that's where he gets it. This Holly Holm Germain de Randamie fight is not an easy fight for Holly Holm. People don't realize this is a tough fight for that. Germain de Randamie is undefeated and Moitai. She's, she's got some preposterous fucking record and there's like 46 or something like that. Nunez already beat her. Yeah, in MMA, but it's a hobby. It's a kickboxer. The thing about it is like Holly's gonna Strike with her.

Speaker 3:          00:20:09       It's going to be great. It's a dangerous fight. Holly takes it down. Yeah, she matched mine. She has some good insight. Trotsky's big athletics. Well, going back, I'll do this one. You got three in her. Oh God. Damn. How are we going to sell it? She knows that. Isn't it crazy? The support so quick. No one stays. You weren't following along. She was in there. I never worked with shoes in there. Great. Great Person. Freaking freak. It's crazy how this fucking sport just chews people up. You think you're on top and then it's gone and it's over, but the casual fan doesn't care. That's why that paper you his cell because the casual fan goes, oh, that's the girl who worked Ronda Rousey. That's the argument for Mcgregor versus Floyd mates. Fucking happening. It's happening.

Speaker 2:          00:20:50       It's going to have to see. So Mcgregor, it held a press conference last night. Sold out arena. 5,000 tickets sold out the on the Mikey was a fuck the UFC. Fuck everything. He said, fuck boxing, boxing and he goes, the next fight, the next fight. Me Versus Floyd, he was four. You get it, fucking done. And then he goes, I'm going to do it with or without the UFC. And they told Dana that and he goes, good luck with that. Good luck getting that done without any dead. He believes in with the Ali Act, he can actually do it because it's a different sport. He has the money to hire the lawyers to try it. Well it's, it is an interesting argument because it's not MMA boxing. So if it's boxing it's not, he doesn't have a conscious, she should just promote it anyways and work together with Floyd and say well but it's not just with Floyd.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       It's with McGregor promotions now that he's got his own thing. That's the key to promote because they don't want it. They don't want to have a third middleman and Dana white cause you have Conor McGregor promotions for me with it and then the UFC and they don't want to give the US Senate is going to become what boxing is. It's going to become that because it's star driven like all things like music, hey to comedy, like everything. It's going to stay star driven and when it star driven like that, guys like Connor who are legitimate stars, they have the leverage and they're going to manipulate that leverage. They're going to utilize that leverage and we're going to see what happened. Especially right now, can just started. We've ever had I a reality star driven, but it is a reality. Why is it, why do you hate that? Because it's always been like that in boxing.

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       Well, right. I mean that's how they make the hundred million dollar paydays. He's a purist and real quick. Yeah, me too. But I would love to see Conor was Floyd. Rob, rob and I were talking about fights. This dude said he's never seen a fight. He doesn't lie. Every single fight. I've hated a lot of fun. You'll see Kimbo and Dada. Okay. That you got right to it quick. Right to the point. That may be some shitty fight, fight, fight and he was like, I liked it when guys are down on. My stunt guys kept each other out there. Gracie's last fight on Bella total cable and we were talking about it. I liked it too. This is what I liked about that all bullshit aside. How grace he fought a fucking killer. I mean that guy knocked out Joe Schilling twice. You've knocked him out and kickboxing and he knocked him out in MMA.

Speaker 2:          00:23:07       He's a fucking beast. He's a very dangerous striker. He's a very big guy and he's fucking scary. He's a blaster and how it and did nothing. No, no, no. He avoided getting knocked down. I'm not talking about college. I'm talking about your boy who's obese. Didn't new math because he was scared. He was scared to get strangled. And what were you scared of is what happened in the last minute of the last round when Alex did take him down past his garlic butter, fucking mounted him and had him in a bad spot. Haluk was going to fuck him up if that fight kept going, if that was in the first minute of the first round, how might or fuel to do it? If you hit the guy that was entertaining your batch,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       fuck, fuck, fuck. And you hated Kim overs data that was more entertaining than that. I didn't hate him. He was not a high level fight. I hated the fact that people were watching it on TV and both guys were severely unconditioned. There were severely out of shape like no, I didn't. His heartbeat stopped. The hit to true is that some of that is him, but uh, no. I, when I think about it, honestly I hated what the fight was about, but I love to fight the dynamic of what's happening between these two human beings in combat. I mean dot. On Kimbo. Yeah. Even that one, the dynamic between them is different than every other fight. In their case it was Mike because chosen Mike, Jamie, there's my student out until the talk was about, are you intrigued by the, by the Conor Mcgregor Floyd Mayweather. I said as if Conor McGregor could actually box with Floyd Mayweather.

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       Mcgregor cannot box with Floyd Mayweather, but Conor Mcgregor's what the only goal that he could have the workable idea as a backdoor hack. Something where being unwilling to make it a boxing match. He is fighting him with two hands. But boxing is not the definition of fighting with two hands. Find a hack, find it back to her. What would Tim Ferriss do if Tim, if you said, hey Tim Ferris, how, how'd he beat Floyd Mayweather with a guy who has never pushed him off the stand? You'd want someone else's idea and regurgitate. Yeah. Yeah. It's not that easy. No, it's not. But Mcgregor has found the disruptions. You, uh, Uber is a disruption or Airbnb is a disruption on the, on the, on the hotel business. Donald's trumps and disrupt using the Tim Ferriss example of good reason why it sucks. It's because Tim did that whole show for CNN where he did a bunch of different things and learn quickly.

Speaker 1:          00:25:36       And one of them we tried to do is Jujitsu. Yeah. Good luck with all that. Good luck. Don't work like that. You know, a guy who's been doing Jujitsu for 10 years can get drunk, stay up all night, show up drunk and still play with you like you're a baby. He's name's Jon Jones and Jon Jones. I Jon Jones, like, I don't even think he's really ranked in Jujitsu, all that. He could tap black belts because it's such a freak. But if John Jones wanted to, he could do whatever he wanted. Yeah. I mean, if they're the same size, it doesn't matter. You can eat four months is not going to get you there. But the, the, the thought that I have is you can't beat him in boxing. Right? But what if you, there's some other answer and the answer to that is, well, and the hundred years we've seen every answer, if you believe that, if Mcgregor believes that he's fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:26:20       Well, McQuaig rigor said that was really interesting. Yesterday in the press conference, he said, look, if it was a fight, it would be the easiest fight. Easy. He goes, fuck UFC. Fuck boxing. It's an actual fight. I'll fucking kill him. It's a joke. He's right. He's right. So we're going to limit it to hands and you playing a little game. Okay, let's do it. Yeah. And that's, that's interesting there because that plays to the ego. And he's the only guy that could ever say that to Floyd. No. Floyd's everyone faced Floyd's ever, never fasted guy. It says, listen, this is not even a fight. This is a boxing match. You want to fight, I will fuck you up any day of the week. Wake me up, wake me up and say you want to do it, I'll fucking kill you. Yeah. And that's true. There's also quite a bit bigger, quite in fast, and you have to be different.

Speaker 1:          00:27:00       If you go in and try to box him, you have to strike with him in some way that is different. What that answer is, I don't know. Angles and the May gloves. Well, people remember that Donna, my Donna, who is super unconventional, really wild and reckless. My Donald was 12 rounds twice with a home, you know? And so Floyd is not knocking guys dead. He's not like he's [inaudible] Golovkin in people or Cov 11 people. You know, it's a totally different kind of experience. What Ford does is minimize any offense and maximize his potential to put offense on you. And he's a genius at it. And if, if his output super low is cause, that's what he can get away with. And if his output is super high, it's because he's got you. Yup. You know what I mean? He's a genius. If Floyd Mayweather, genius boxing genius.

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       Yeah. That's why you can't beat them and less there's some answer that doesn't yet exist that condoms aren't, could go and then just do the trucial box and sit in front. And that's not people who think that it's crazy other here's the other fucking x factor and it's a real factor and it happens in every goddamn sport. Guys get old overnight and Floyd Mayweather is 30 what? 39 years old now. 39 years old at 40 by the time this fight happens, I mean some guys it takes longer. Some guys it's shorter. Bernard Hopkins managed to get deep into his forties and still be world class and he hasn't taken much punishment. That doesn't get hit. No, I'll only really been tagged by Mosley and my Donna. Those are guys are really tagged them. And then earlier in his career he got hit a few times. Yup. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       But mostly sat. He, he, you know, he sat them down, mostly wobbled and then one shot dominated. Yup. Yeah. He's, he's a genius. He really ingenious. And if it go as it goes on, if McGregor becomes predictive of, so say this happens and he becomes a predictable in any way, even the ways that he doesn't understand that flight will read and it just gets worse as the fight goes on. He'll get out. So somebody comes to you and says, this is happening. You're going to make $200 million for whatever crazy amount of money you're gonna make a, how do we do it? And the answer is you have to be very, very different. You have to move away from, from Floyd for sure. You have to move away from him and draw him in and you gotta be different almost every round. You've got to have a strategy that makes you unpredictable. And even then you have to hit somebody who's never hit. So what I'm saying it and boy tied dumps, I'm saying anything. He ties him up fucking leg.

Speaker 1:          00:29:17       Let's give them something to think about. Touching the ground rules. Definitely. If he could, you know, just one or two times. If they get in the clinch and there's some shit talking [inaudible] he just decides to dump them and you see Floyd's feet go flying up in the air. Why is a small man choice? What would you rather see them and it just a straight boxing match with boxing gloves or a boxing match with MMA glove would want to do a boxing class all day to make gloves or the big love. He would want the big lifts account events for default, which is very important because it's really hard to get because like it's a whole different game when you're getting around those little gloves. Pink Floyd to go damn. What the Middle Ground Dan's, his hands break a lot. Great Tire lifetime. You have developed your style around the size of the Mitt.

Speaker 1:          00:30:06       Yeah. You can't change your front gate. I can sit, hey Floyd, Connor's given up so goddamn much get thrown in the business. They given you any so weird though. Get an MMA best boxer. Everything about his experience and his sensitivity is around his whole lifetime being built with this exact thing. Sometimes he catches things in small little details and another factor is the speed of the incoming shots. It's going to be much faster when you're dealing with four ounce gold. There's guys in worldclass boxing, they're fast as fuck, right, but they'd be faster if they have four ounce gloves on it. It's just a fact. It's just a fact of physics and he, that speed almost might be indistinguishable to us, but to a fighter it might be the difference between getting hit by something and not getting hit by something and you would have to re gauge your distance meter.

Speaker 1:          00:30:55       Yeah. Different pitchers throwing different speed balls. Every hitter, this mother fucker and Ghana, no man. I've been calling his fights for awhile. When that guy walks into the cage, it sounds different. She is hand next to stands to the 56 dude. He makes me look a little tiny person and he can keep it in his pocket. He's huge, man. He's not small. No, no, no. He's a big dude and he's just solid as a rock man. He's, he's French. He's French. Oh, Nigeria. Yeah. And he's just a super athlete man. They think he's the next strike the next big thing. Well, you know, we've yet to see him against a really good wrestler. We've yet to, I wouldn't eat, I don't say anybody's next week thing until they go with Kane. You gotta go again. Healthy came pressure. Travis, you see what he did to Rothwell?

Speaker 1:          00:31:45       He just does. He gets his face and your chest and just when he gets past all your bullshit and then puts it to you with a pace that you just can't take. The real question with Kane is, can he still do that? He's had so many injuries. They pulled him off of his last fight because he's got stenosis, so it's fucking spinal column is shrinking and they have to open them up and say, no, no nerve steep pavers. JDS. Now that is what the next step of fighters, steep pace. Legit. That's real. I know. Who wins now, Steve Bay jds because ain't nothing. You'd like to see him fight again? Hosanna. Hosanna, quack, quack, quack, quack. I don't want to, I know hands please. One thing about me is I take my MMA. I would, I would have said the same thing. You like MMA? I do, Dude. It's like secret garden.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       I said, well, I'm a combat. I'm a combat. Well, I'm a sportsman as you guys know, and I like to get up close and personal and impose my will on another man in Gannon was feet looked different too. They like thicker. Like his heels. Is he six five giant, giant. When Randy Randy fought Brock Lesnar, he said that the distance was hard to gauge because this proportion was so weird. So you can't actually, he's got an enormous reach. And when your body shape is different like that, it tricks the eye. The way, when you look down the Strip in Vegas, you can't tell how close and far away those hotels are. Yeah. The God that looks way bigger than Mr Alaska who's good to 40 well, the thing about in Ghana, who is, he's a natural size to like, that's a big gentlemen. God is. That's just who he is.

Speaker 4:          00:33:25       He's a giant dude shop. You fuck guys this big. I thought you just said shop. Have you fucked us? He did. Answer is yes. Yes, yes. When? When? Necessary. Only to correct that. That's only when it rains. No Man. Our lost keys. Only 37 isn't that crazy? That's a lot of my, maybe years at tortoise though, but that's crazy because inboxes, but he's got a right there. He's, he's running at him and throwing punches too, but he comes in behind that double right hand all the time. You can see it coming now. Yeah. He looks scary. It's foot work. Yeah. He is very much improved. He wants to teach. Trying to draw him forward. Imagine him with, yeah. Your style kicking. Well, he's awesome. No, that's common. Spooky. Yikes. Protect them. There was had overhead. Our Lawsky with the overhand right. He had just twice the Debra cuts. What did him in, I think our last lives you read our laps gets overhead, right. As soon as that overhand right is there. This has done to tell him to stop with the lightening bolts in the hair. Do. Should we do it now? Should we do it online? How it is in France though. Weird shit and he's just dominating bitches.

Speaker 4:          00:34:37       So I watch it when we see the replay. Our he's overhand, right? Was the, was the towel. He called it too. He said he's going to knock them out on the first round. Is that a lot? Press Steven then? Well the last time is for Travis Brown. I mean you gotta think are lost. You just knocked out Travis Brown a couple of fights ago. He's lost his last three though. Now you can watch the right hand off of our loss. Keith, the overhand right there. Now you got them cause you know what it is. Boom right behind me. Look where it's head position. Head position is, he knew exactly what was coming and he lifted him off the ground with that upper core physician that is fucking view to fall. He planned, he knew it was coming with the overhand rights. Conor Mcgregor Shit actually Nate Diaz does that. The Diaz brothers to that slip, they use their right hand, the front hand. Once the front end, the Diaz brothers throw that hook from from south like that. It's almost like a check. Yeah. You draw a slide out. It's a head

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       position is key. And then he'd come back over top. Isn't that was by design so important that a referee know how hard a guy hits. Yeah. Because no one's complaining about that. Stop it. No. But in other fights, that would have been a stoppage where people were and what the fuck? You only took a couple shots, but he's down. Give him a chance to recover and not with the Datto you like. No, no, no. That's good. That's good. It's good. Yeah. Probably hear the impact. Oh yeah, for sure. See him fight like a Rothwell where that shot doesn't put them down. He just keeps coming through a little beard and like put square that one time and stuff. That's, that's the, maybe it does. We don't know because he's, he's beat up basically cans. Thank. Give him our Lawsky right. And just merge here now.

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       Well, you remember, do you remember when Ben Rothwell fought Arlovski and I lost you fucked him up. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that was our labs scheme when he was in his, well not even in his prime. He was a little slipped. That's the fiction. It was a little past his prime. Yeah. You know I lost keys. Prime was when he was in his twenties he went on a Rah Rah run in the UFC one fight away from a heavyweight title match. What, two years ago? Two years ago, but do you remember when he was young? I remember when he starts Paul Bunch off one punch. He's my favorite. He had a right hand that was like a piston dude and it's almost like now you can see the wear and tear on his shoulders when he's throwing punches, like he throws punches differently now. Back then everything was just laser beam straight.

Speaker 2:          00:36:57       Remember, remember when you went to wildcard and was just working with Freddie Roach and tall and just getting knocked the fuck out left? Well, not to Jackson, but he was doing well after a freight train with Freddie Roach who is doing really well against fader or, and then he just, he panicked. He was lighting him up. He was doing well and they did a flying knee and failed. I was like, what the fuck man? Best timing in the game with his right hand. Like it was just deceptive. How about Israel coming up in like two weeks, right on spike. Yeah. That's weird. I just feel bummed out that we never got to see fade or in the UFC. I still feel, feel, feel bummed out. There's up. There's an empty hole in my heart for that one is not at his best idea. It'd be cool to see him, you know, passion melded.

Speaker 2:          00:37:39       Dano fight that he had. Yes. Maldonado fucked him up. I watched that like this and it'll make you sick to your stomach. Should have got the you, Oh, you know the commission turned it. Yeah, they did. I think to a no contest and look that up Jamie. I might be batshit crazy. I think they switched it to only one side. He got a no contest. Russia was like, all right. Yeah, we fucked up. Wow. That's when you know you got jobbed Russia, Russia. They're like enough. Wow. This guy. But you know that when you heard school like our Lawsky did, they're like these young guys. You guys can just talk to each other. Put your headphones on. Brian Cowen, you're on the microphone is a podcast. We've talked about this before. You son of a bitch. Does he cough? What does he call me without here? Does does friends. Connie went out now man, I ain't even heard it. Zero English haunting. You hate American dollars. Cranky.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       Look. Yeah. Fatal Arts victory over time. This

Speaker 5:          00:38:41       girl,

Speaker 3:          00:38:43       he's trying.

Speaker 5:          00:38:44       Sorry.

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       Oh that's not bad at all. Good for him man.

Speaker 5:          00:38:49       You're giving me some Nice Alon Soufriere more former job and then I'm very happy to win the fight.

Speaker 3:          00:38:59       He's saying he wants big fights. I'm very [inaudible]. Me a former champ. I'm a believer in a mouth that was pure scale of this position coming off. Yeah, draw, draw back and where your head is in space. It's just the one and he'd take it off the shoulder did. He's terrifying. He is the most terrifying heading in a long time. Read that Shit coming from 20 miles away and the right hand combo is part of it. So it's a, it's designed to play wrestling, I guess. His wrestling's pretty BC. They say, you know, granted it's the French, but he trains with the Olympic wrestling team and he can't get his ass down. Well also the judo team, he's, they're bringing in all sorts of really high level. Yeah. The size of his hands. They're saying they're bringing in a bunch of different Olympic level athletes to work with this guy. I mean he's a real prospect, prospect. Prospect in a long time. Skeptical. Hippalands I'm not a believer after knocked him out. That was a skill when that was designed, play off and overhand. Right. Planned shot up and it's right there and look at him every shot. A shot. All right. Twitter. Prazole let's see.

Speaker 3:          00:40:12       I think people are crazy. Dad. One Point Pena was the favorite. It's like, dude, dude, the oddsmakers not, I don't know who the fuck mate. Those on for a while. Then the, the public was like, what the fuck? And we're going to get money on it. And then the favorite. Nothing against Pena, but you're looking at somebody with 400 fights. Check, check, got crazy fight. She's got haunted bus, kickboxing and boxing. Hundreds of fights. She's so hard. Dude just said, Jack goes so hard to turn down like a hard person. She's a hard woman. She's just rushing chick who loves guns. I mean her nickname is bullet. She has a contract to on her hip. She has a skill versus hard in this fight. Oh, you guys are already told me one. I haven't seen this fight. You're going to love this fight. This fight is going to be interested by two desks. Bermudez coming up. It's going to fight Korean Zombie, dude. No, no, no, no. Next weekend if I fucking pulled out and see what the fuck is going on. The fifth fight fight that got canceled for eating. Something's going on. But the good news is, is two weeks for the fight he might get a replacement,

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       so we'll see what they have to find someone. Maybe it's hard, man. Flyways it's not easy. It's not easy to find a good flyway goods. A different answer. Maybe there's some young dude who's just waiting bike, you know, waiting out there. I'm sure there is. If he get along as he can make the weight man, you know, like because New York isn't it? They don't fuck around with riots in New York. Yeah. If you fuck up with, uh, the, the weight in New York, like if you're over by a think it's eight pounds, they won't let you fight. That's fantastic. But, and one of the cards that is fair, I heard that it happened on one of the cards. It was kind. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's why they pulled him. Yeah. Yeah. Tim Kennedy. Yeah, that's right. And Goddamn, he erased everybody's anger about that. Everybody was so mad about that destroy. He's worried. He's one of the guys that had a taekwondo talk with and he goes, dude, he pulls out video of this training because I'm already doing this. He had like a session where he's spinning and just getting all that spins down. He's on it. Get them on that nutritionist son. I think I want any five [inaudible] five.

Speaker 2:          00:42:35       He's fighting veto any lots of good, funny to Woodley and just split decision and he was exhausted as my guy, Ron hit mass. Phenomenal. He was he, I think 17 sorry, but he was drained for that fight. You know, he, he'd cut a ton of weight for that fight. I don't like him at 70 I liked them at 85 you like your chance to become world champion? 85 I think he could do it. I think he just has to gain some muscle. Nine he's Lik you said, put on some mass or figure out a way to comfortably make one 70 and a much healthier way for, he's not draining himself. He can be champ. He can be champ at one 70 the road to one seventies easier. Oh look. Everybody gets tired, but he doesn't get tired. That dude is still pumping it out in the third round.

Speaker 2:          00:43:12       And when he was overwhelming Kennedy and the third, was it a second or third round? When both smashed them second. Right. Did you stop him in the second or the third? But it was just a second pace was out of control. His footwork is, but that's what I thought. The big factor. I thought there's two big factors in that fight. I thought one kit Tim is a big one, any five, and he's super strong. It's Jujitsu's real good. If he gets Kelvin down, he might be able to blanket him and beat him up. But when he started getting tired, I was like, he's going to have a real hard time with Kelvin's footwork cause Kelvin's footwork. He's nasty, he's real lie. He bounces around and he does a lot of faints. He's not predictable and he comes in behind that Long Right Jab, he fucks you up, man.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       He's a southpaw. Sneaky South Bach. He comes up with his right jab sometimes. Sometimes he comes in, he hooks you, he digs. The body has grapplings good. His Chin is made out of fucking granted. He's a killer. Can Be tough to be, have to. Super Cool. Just sweetheart of a guy after he made Kevin Swanson versus joy with him and he was just having the time of his life. He was not touched, but I've talked to him rough night for Tim puts in, made a big mistake. He went from one camp straight into the other camp and apparently he was very flat and they were saying that he was definitely overtrained like he just drove the chain. I just one foot in, one foot out to these guys, got

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       to these new, these new gen guys. They just understand the space between you better like they manipulate the space between you and we just saw it within Ghana, you know, he just has a better understanding of the space between you and his opponent and how to use as the stand and bang phase. That's shit's done. That Standard Bank phase is done. Yes. At a world class level, standing bangs done and everybody wants to be world class. When you see guys like Conor McGregor raising their fucking bar, the new ones coming up like the Eir Rodriguez, like the fucking Cody Garbrandt who can be next level and what are they doing? They're moving like a mother starts control moves. No Stan and bang. It's calculated. Exchange is calculated risk worldclass technique. Everybody's accelerated, everything is way higher and higher level and then they're at this new level and they're accelerating in their ability to improve from that level.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       So it's, it's like exponential and it's weird. And then young guys coming up, I commentated some fights between, I was telling Brendan and 18 year old named Tony Laramie and a 20 year old named Keith Lee, Kevin Liezel, a brother from Vegas, they were both all window and it was some high level shit, high level, the way that they played at distance of the way that they manipulated the, the timing. It was fucking crazy, uh, for Tko for a fight pass. But Canada is getting, nothing is accelerating faster than high level MMA right now. If you go back 20 years ago and look at a word is today, there's not a sport in the world. We see that much of a jump between 20 years ago and today new technology, it's moving like technology. It's evolving like exactly. The question is, when are we going to see a guy who kicks like yeah, year and also has Joe Schilling style, Moy Thai, and also can box like Cody, 10 years olds right now that are bull lowing your mind.

Speaker 1:          00:46:18       And that's why when you see a guy like yeah, year and you see this next level expression, you realize like, wow, the horizon is going to be bananas. We're going to see guys like, yeah, you're fighting another guy like guy here and we're just going to see chaos and the level of performance, just their abilities psychologically to fight. And that's growing exponentially. They're honors raising that individually by himself. Yeah. He's raising everyone's expectations for how someone performs under pressure. He steps in there against Josie Aldo and fucking sleeps in 13 seconds and a fight that he's been talking shit about for a year for a straight, solid year world tour talent. Everybody's gonna fuck him up. And he goes and starches him with one punch in exactly the way that you knew if he was going to do it drawing. And that was a punch you had seen him use and that strike he'd been using since England in England and Ireland before he ever, he was landing that in space drawing you forward. It's one of my favorite tweets ever that I tweeted him in like 2013 as I'm a big fan. I hope you get into the UFC one day. Boom. What fight in tweeted back was it that got you into a man? I watched a bunch of his fights from England, but it was a one fight where he slid back and Kayo

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       this dude with his perfectly placed lefthand. Yeah. And I was like, this kid's got some fucking timing. And the like for as a hobby describes the touch of death. Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:47:40       Yup. No, when you got that kind of power, you can see his body is built to deliver that power, but it's technique. It's clean. It's awesome

Speaker 2:          00:47:48       thought. You know, he's, he's very, uh, the way he's approaching the game is very thoughtful. He's thinking it through like getting down with Ido port and just concentrating on the ability to move your body better. Yup. Just all you know, across the board having that kind of dexterity,

Speaker 3:          00:48:05       thank better, better movement. Absolutely. No you haven't. You're sticking with that. I think it's all bullshit. It's definitely not. Definitely not bullshit. Bullshit. I don't think it's bullshit. I think it can help you, but you better have the foundation in the skills of common Gregor before you bring in a coach like that. You cut other shit out. Just talking about doing movement stuff. I think it's very important like gymnastic, gnostic, not you're all the way those Brazilians kicking at your head. That's real shit. I see it in break dancing, breakdancing as movement at the ultimate movement drills and I see it personally in Jujitsu. All those guys from the freak show, they all did you Jitsu and al got really good, really quick. So it, yeah, it does

Speaker 2:          00:48:49       for the uninitiated is Richie and Geo Martinez down in San Diego. They're bad motherfuckers who are badass break dancers who have turned into Jujitsu, black belts who are out there marketing people and they told me about it when these guys were white belts. He told me about it. He's like, dude, I've got these new guys are white belts and they're phenomenal. Like everybody knew it like right away that they have this very huge, very unusual ability. And you know what man, you got to give it up to the band, Hicks and Gracie cause he figured it out before anybody. You go back to those 1994 Hixon Gracie videos were, Hickson was in Santa Monica standing on a balanced bar, stretching his leg overhead in a full split. He was doing the rings. He was, he was walking on his hands. He was doing all those breathing exercises. He was down with Yoga and movement and dexterity and flexibility before anybody. By the way, this is my new favorite ball time commercial is fucking commercial. Back this up a little bit. This is Jamie gimme gimme some knowledge or give me some, uh, some volume.

Speaker 3:          00:49:45       There's north haven [inaudible] second. I lost the Kelly Clarkson. There's a tiny horse guy or get these ranchers. He's got red hair. Purple issue is you deserve this. This was kind of, commercials have gotten crazier and crazier because they have to cut through the buck. Buckaroos. It's a tiny little dude who's flamboyantly gay on a tiny little Wah Whitehorse.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       He's got that. That's probably the third one. That was the funny thing. Yeah. I got a gay as fuck buyer. It was awesome. Not how that's not true. Got a private prince guy. Yeah, you might be. You might be right. Yeah. It fucks small girl like tiny. You never know, but it's great. Great God damn commercial. Anyway, we'll fast forward to the shit and get to the cowboy fight. This fight is a fight that I felt coming into this fight and give it away. I'm not going to get, I'm not going to give anything away from saying coming into this fight. I think that a lot of people don't know how good Jorge Mas for dollars. So this is not a fight that that many people are cause he's scared, but no, no, no.

Speaker 2:          00:51:02       You can't do that, man. I want to give him shit away. Yeah. Real, super, super dangerous. So cowboy, a lot of people would think this fight wouldn't be as close as it's likely to be stopped. That cowboy at one 70 is so much better than cowboy 55 and he's one more example of just like we talking about with Calvin guys who don't cut weight and because of that they look healthier. They're like faster, like stronger. They just think of more durable to, they can, they can recover from stuff. But the trade off of course is at one 70 you know he's fighting. If you fight like Tyron Woodley, you fight, you know you're finding someone hits way fucking Harvey Lawler. Yeah. Way fucking harder than anybody. If 55 this guy is. So it's really getting these skilled max. He's relaxed instead of breakdown on him. And I put in some of his old backyard fights.

Speaker 2:          00:51:54       Yeah. But he used to have those backyard fights back in the old Kimbo days. Kimbo was in this corner for [inaudible] bad mother fucker. I can do that for a while. It's got some knee issues. So it's had some knee issues for a long time. Man, he's been hesitant usually and a lot of his fights, he always tends to always fucked up, man. His knees are always fucked up. He's trying to intimidate cowboy cause everybody thinks that if you intimidate cowboy to work in the Matt Brown fight. No. See everyone thinks that Matt Brown fight was like a cake walk. That was a bit, it's a bit of a flight. No, it was definitely not a cakewalk. Matt Brown and a cakewalk. No, no. I'm saying people think cowboy. I didn't think Kalbi look that great in that fight. I thought it was so real good. Fight is a fight he looks at at all, but he's fighting Matt fucking Brown.

Speaker 2:          00:52:41       Matt Brown is a Goddamn Barbarian. He's a bar band. He lost what? Five is less six. He's about Bam. Take account shots then number 12 guy cause he doesn't give a fuck. He wants to Denver. He just knocked on Matt Brown six weeks ago and he's like I want to fight in Denver. Denver's his hometown. He did take some punishment in that fight. He did. He definitely took some punishment and that Matt Brown fight, but this is what he loves to do man. He loves to just get back after it and he loves that story. He loves. He also, the more he fights, the more comfortable he is fighting. You know, like it more, it becomes natural. He went to a concert last night, the night before this steel Mexico to Mexico in like the middle of his campus and near the end. Yeah, let's do that. I don't know. He says it relaxes

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       him. I guess he did at one camp in it. He had a great performance. So he said that it relaxes. If your last week is just sweating a lot anyways, you can do it anywhere and he does have to make weight. He fights at one 75. I mean he walks around at one 75 one 76 he's not cutting anything. No, he looks great at something. He can be. We'll shape it up at all.

Speaker 2:          00:53:44       Yeah, I agree. Uh, people sinked up to this. Oh yeah. Four 40 74464405444 first round. Thank you. Thank you. Right? Yeah. This is a real interesting, Ooh, good stepping round kick to the body and they'll switch kicks of his and nasty. Yes. He's so good with it. And he's also good, like sneaking it up high out of nowhere, which is what he did with Matt Brown. He snuck that a switch kick off the left leg. That was a front leg round kick to the face. He knocked Matt Brown out with different, their rhythms are, I see it as conflicting rhythms. Well, Mosbey doll is much more boxing oriented in his, uh, his attack.

Speaker 1:          00:54:22       See, he's letting them know he's trying to play on that a little bit. You don't hear it. I have watched this fight. You don't hear it, but he's like, Ooh, Ooh. Like is making sounds. He's trying to give a cowboy novel experiences.

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       See, you can see is he is making some noise. That's interesting. I wonder if we would get pulled if we had the sound in the background. What would happen? Young Jamie Foxx. Jack. Yes. It's Fox with Jack mean. Oh, Fox Tel Fox. I'll come back. I'll do a couple shows. Yeah, that might do it. Just let me, let me talk some shit about one or two of them.

Speaker 1:          00:54:55       Oh, right hand and a left turn. It was so good. A mass mass, all wants to stay in there long enough to land the last punch and backed Donald up. And that's hard. He's super tough hospital. So tough to get Donald go back leg

Speaker 2:          00:55:10       thereby mosfet all is well. He comes in and clean with that jab and he also has a real nice high guard mosque. Ooh, he's, he's a crafty fire man. Really? Well-Schooled so smooth. Like I like that inside leg kick Donald throws me two dogs, one of the best leg kickers in the, in the sport for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       And Jorge has taken him. Dad's here. It's like the hands. Oh, not too worried about getting taken down. He's so tall. Like you fight scarring on his, but when he engages in another strike, like he probably has a, one of the most head kicks to him and he's laughing. Yeah. Oh for sure. He said he wants to be in there till the end balls leg though. Calvin eating that shit. Beautiful inside leg kick there. Yeah. Oh I love that. Little off time. Body fat. Oh, we went to the bottom of there to look at my dog eats it and comes back. That was the question, right? With the leg kicks. Well, how's he going to deal with it? We Sat, he would counter off them with punches and I, his counters off the kicks are slightly different to instead of sweeping the one side and they're now using the typical cat off that he'll go left hawk, but he also just takes it.

Speaker 1:          00:56:22       Yeah, he's so aggressive. Tough. Yeah. It was so, he's so like a, the fact that he keeps closing the distance in on cowboy people don't understand honestly walking down. Yeah. No, he's very good. Don't never have that breakout when I don't mean to interrupt you. You know what I'm saying? Like he's never had that huge staple. If you look at his lifestyle too, I mean, he really has had to concentrate and be much more dedicated over the last couple of years because before he used to play a lot of video games and fuck off and you know he was, yeah. It was like half of the fun of watching his downtown. I love that little food to come forward that yeah. Donald was to take time to got good takedown defense, man. That American top team is a fucking oh yeah. Little bit. Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:10       You could see he's backing up a little man, that Spinning Elbow, but the jab is just nice. That's switch kick off the left side. That Donald throws is so nice. Add, subtract. Jorge's hands are down and they're knocked down tonight. Man. He know he dead. Serious lot of respect. Just understands what it is. Completely on that right side because of that left high kick left hiking. Ooh, he's throwing overhand competitor. Arlovski's it's hidden. Yeah. Yeah. This is just expressed. It's not throwing. Honestly, when I look at her labs can move. I've got to go back to this. Ooh, Nice. I feel like our lab skis shoulders are calm. Yeah. Probably a lot of where I really tight. He's throwing punches like he's throwing him with his arms and jaw could only take so many punches. Right. There's that. Everyone's got a certain amount that they're going to take and that's his check who you tell him. Well, not only that dude, when guys take, oh, nice leg kick there. When guys take a lot of punishment, they're fucking motor skills start going, bro. Like they don't, they can't them up the same way. That's her right there. Oh, he got tagged there again. That runs about starting to get loose. Oh Geez. Gotcha. I always heard that. That hurt me. He got flat footed there. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:23       It's all push and push Paul or hey. Oh, strong kick. Take size on medicine. Yep. Oh, he's out there. He's out. That fights that, that fight. All right. Nope. Nope. Nope. End of the round and the round that's fucking out. When have you, Joe, what? Have you ever seen a rubber, whenever you ever seen a ref at the end of the round go like this? Yeah. Like gets out. He might a question himself. Mm. Yeah. It's better off to just fight now. Call. They should have it right there. She ended the fight right there. He looks out right there. Once that calls over, now it's up to the doctor and Greg's just going to do his job here. He hadn't, what Jackson is, was screaming at him, you're not going to lose in Denver. This is what I want for you head movement. What are you going to do? Move my head. You know, and that there, there was a big pep talk here, but honestly, you've got to wonder whether or not it's the right move to send a guy out. You don't know. I mean you're

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       hopeful. You want them to recover. You don't want them to lose by stoppage. Let's take a look at it here. Off the left to the boom and the right, the top of the left hand behind it. Let's, so he's in deep trouble here. He's out there, he's taking shots, his eyes rolled back. Watch this, left her steps in. Who kicked it? He knew the kick was coming cause he kicked the body. Boom, boom, boom man. What a combination. Sam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. He sweeps, he sweeps the kick away and it loads his left talk. Now do you feel that curb was stopping the fight and then the bell rang and then he said, let's just keep it going. That's the doc. I don't think he should be. It's on the dock. I think it's not. It shouldn't be on the corner so much or the fight of the fire's going to want to fight.

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       We can't do this hard. I smiled at him. I got you. What do you think the people would want? They want blood. They don't give a fuck if Kelly got over right there. A definitive that money on it. If you have money on Mazda, you want that shit. Fuck all those people though. Fuck those. Exactly. Think about the fighter. See Donald be a world champion. Wants him to take brain damage and it's what's right. You know what is, what is the right thing to do? So right now it's very hard to argue. That's the wrong thing to let them fight because he's moving around and his hands are up. No compromise. You have to protect the fact again, when I was fucking him up, man, oh my God. See Kelly jumped at garbage. Tough. Goddamn. He got fucked up there. He's inviting the kick, kicking him to try to get them to kick him to kick back.

Speaker 2:          01:00:54       Don't kick the knee. He is. Oh, nice kick. He's asking for Keck. Yeah. Did you see the way Donald's throwing those punches? Those are purely defensive. He's just trying to keep him off and then he goes for the cat home and tagged them again. That's the end. You feel shop so tough shots and that's it. Yeah, just stop. It's a bummer for cowboy, man. That's a fucking bummer. He goes, you know what happened? Did he just say, you know what would happen? Fuck you. Say you know what happened? You know what happened then when he said to him, yeah, he's a kid and they talked a lot of shit. And then when you mark the guy in his own town, it's like, yeah, what's up man? Fucking told you that talk. There's interesting, he's got those shells and the pink shirt. Yeah, the doctor and he swears degree. Easy. Easy on the hands. I know that guy. He's very, he's doctor. He's just shocked to see what he says here. Look at this. You know what happens? You know what happened? Hold on, give me some volume, Jamie. You it happened real dark. Fuck that. Lose it. Lose that with a little more gray is he beat Donald, talked to all that shit and then when that happens and the guy goes, I fucking told you. Everyone goes, oh, sore loser. It's a fight, man. He's cool, nasty.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       And he just backed up. He's like, I fucking told you that was going to happen. Maslow asked for this fight. He was, I will fuck him up in Denver. He can be to anybody. He literally can be. Then if he's on, if he brings his end game, he can cause this fight was made after cowboys glass win, right? Mostly they'll say, I'll fight him and then cowboy boots on Michael's. Let's do this dance in Denver. Sweets after fucking getting dropped by Matt Brown, you got to protect myself. Watch how he launched the lefthand right there below. It's tough for him. He loves it. I left high school and this is a stoppage. This is the end. Got very fast. He got a one. Most of it all is a monster. You gotta wonder it was the right call to let them come out for that second round.

Speaker 1:          01:02:59       Loaded hip. Yeah, right. There we go. Good action. I know why they let it go. I want to see more action. I as a coach though, Eddie, you shit. If that was Tony first names, you shouldn't be saying you're a coach in real life though. I want to see anyway. Mother Teresa, look at this for a second. You'll see was Tony or Kelvin you with it? No, no, no. Wait. Hurts. Stop this fight. Don't talk over and please I'm looking at it so it'll just, it's time. Cause they were showing up. I want to, I have a question. Why is he stopping him when he's hitting the body? Cause he was, because he has nothing. He saw the response when he touched the liver. You see his body just kind of shut down right there and her may, he's a human being. So He's feeling questioning his decision earlier anyway and if he sees the chance he's going to take it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:45       Yeah, he knew it was a bad place for cowboy right there. He was getting lit up and it's easier to say, and you can be a couch quarterback here. I think it's, he say, man, Donald shouldn't have fought this soon, but honestly, the Yoshi should not allow Donald to fight six weeks after suffering brain Trump. No commission should have cleared them. His coaches shouldn't allow. He wants to, and that's the cowboy way. Cowboy losing number 12 guy in the world. How we can be world fucking champion. Right? But you gotta you gotta he's a thoroughbred man. Treat them like that. Don't let them do this wild shit. It's a different game. Doing something that you would never see a guy like Floyd Mayweather do, for example, or Connor or Connor would never do that. Yeah. Fighting six weeks after a war. It's his life. I get that.

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       But also he's not making CanNor money. He's not making Floyd money either. You know what I'm saying? He can do that if he was world champion, right? Yeah. That's the argument. Right? He needs to be protected from himself. He's too tough for his own good. That's the case with a lot of warrior. I support these guys a choice to do what they want to do. I was like, if a doctor says you can't fight, then you don't fight a, if your family talks to you and gives you advice and you'll want to take it, you don't have to take it. You get to a free society we live in. You can eat as much sugar and fat as you want to eat. You can smoke as many cigarettes as you want to smoke. You can do as much heroin and cocaine until you at least until you have brain damage or you have brain trauma which can cause you to be impulsive and make decisions that maybe you're not as part of the game. That's what you signed up. What I'm saying is your team should try to protect you from yourself. They would have stopped that fight of Greg Jackson would have stopped it. Right there would have been,

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       you're talking to a former fighter, Donald that could have like fucked the relationship. I don't know. Maybe Donald, maybe Donald would have said, why the fuck did you stop that guy in my bed all night, all weekend? You never know. You never know. Stool. I think he was out on a stool. He looked like he was delirious. I think he got hit. If we go back to that first round at the end of that first round and he got hit fucking hard man. He's a sit down down go, what do you want to do? What do you want to do? Do you want to be known as the cowboy and you were in a bar 20 years from now or like that guy fought everyone all the time. That was awesome man. Or do you want to be known as a world fucking champions stopped doing this.

Speaker 2:          01:05:55       Hold on. You already said this but Eddie, I think that what you're saying is true, but I think what you're saying is true to what you're saying is true. His guys have come back from that, but what he's saying is guys don't come back from that. If they take the kind of beating that they took just six weeks ago and it's something that goes against kind of what Donald's been saying because Donald's been saying that he doesn't spar anymore and his camps. One of the reasons why it isn't spar anymore. It's because he took too much fucking punishment. He'd go into these fights already damaged Donald. He does drills now cause there's almost primarily drills and when he spars, he does it all. They do it like Thai style. They're just touching each other. So he's working on his timing. He knows how to fight already here.

Speaker 2:          01:06:28       He knows he's tough. There's no questions. So it's all just about getting your timing and your endurance down. So I think you're right. Like guys have come back from getting hit like that. Like Frankie Edgar against gray, her came back to stopping a lot. Yeah, it's happening as much time. But you're right. You're right. But I think he's right too because I think that that fight from six weeks ago that's, that was a war. It really was. He was in a war with a killer. People forget that. We know because we see the highlight him murking Matt Brown with a head kick that's like before. How's it took a little shy. He got dropped. He did get dropped. That's right. Good point. In the end, whether you're his coach or his best friend, you're his family member. You say what you feel and then he's going to decide.

Speaker 2:          01:07:08       See, I don't, I don't agree with that. Well, let's talk. His coaches should go. We listen. We know you want to fight til the death, but the logical thing is don't fight in Denver against the number 15 guy. Let's wait. Let's fight the number four guy and then you get a title shot. Let's do that. I agree with you. That would be the most intelligent thing to do, but it's a big fight coming up in Denver. If cowboy did get a fight against a guy who could, when he could beat and he did win in Denver, he would have been a hero, right? Oh, he's already a hero. I honestly think that he wanted to feel the goal. He wanted to feel it again at one 70 it's different. He's fighting number 14 one 70 cause he's new to one strike number five. It's crazy. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:07:46       70 in the world. He's pretty close to a title shot. I will say this though, the upside to being a UFC champion or a fight or the upside is the most amazing feeling of getting your hands right, knocking someone out in the octagon, payscale to know that it's, it's the, it's the upside that it's the greatest. I'm sure I've never fought, but I'm sure when those guys, when Chuck Liddell wins, it's like you're the king of the world in the UFC championship. That's the upside. You, you're going to have a feeling that no, very few people taste. It's like ultimately quick Chuck Odell throw his arms back. The ultimate look. The downside is there. Yeah, man, there's a lot of risky shit. That's why the sport is so big because it's so much risk for it will never grow. Everyone thinks that way. We're going to be the sport to grow.

Speaker 2:          01:08:35       It doesn't need it because guys like Conor McGregor who's going, I'm not taking that fight. You know what? I'm not doing that. You know what? I'm going to wait and do this. They got big with doing the UFC program and now he's beyond that and he's gone beyond that. But he's grown the sport. I think at this point, you know, in the beginning of the UFC we always had, uh, um, you know, be careful how you, uh, explain the fights and the rules and, and, and, and how everything was broken down. But now it doesn't matter. The UFC so big, we don't have to like, oh look, we want the sport to be huge. It's already huge. Right? It's on another level though. Crazy level, man that's on Fox. I mean, it's crazy. I kind of agree with Howard. The Conor McGregor is taking it to the next level and it's going to go one level above that.

Speaker 2:          01:09:19       I think it's going to continue to grow and it's not by taking stupid fights and just never become Wilson about being professional. And I think if you did look at it in a professional manner, I agree with Brendan, but I also agree with Eddie. We're both right, Brendan. Yeah, well there's no, there's no difference on your fighter because here's the thing, he kind of, Gregor took the fight with Nate Diaz on very fucking short notice. 11 days. It takes 11 days notice, five fights at 70 you know, it doesn't cut any weight at all when he's supposed to be fighting in 55 for the title takes a giant chance and winds up losing. Okay, so you're right and you're wrong. Like that's part of what made the legend of Conor McGregor that he's willing to do something so fucking crazy. But now he, now he's in this stratospheric position worries world while we're dads come up to me and my fucking kids school and they want to talk to me about that crazy Irish guy, Tim.

Speaker 2:          01:10:06       Yeah. Yeah. They don't, they don't, no one wants to talk to anyone anymore. They don't know who the fuck Francis and Gando is. They will, they will guarantee you Francis year, fuck yeah, I bought that tonight. The heavyweights are always the scariest. You know that that kind of scare market people. He keeps marketing people like that emerge people get the personality. Then he got some, he said Tyson, he's got character. Never been allowed to come out to Chicago. Then yes, I can name a few. I don't want to, I want to see him screaming in French. Stopped getting them to talk in English. I want you to grab his cock and like bring it out, scream and throw it in the camera. That is a super athlete. There was a rare, rare athlete with some serious fucking ability and end mindset. He's got a destroyers mindset that guys all the tools to be a world champion, but Kenny get by a guy like Cain saw was the right way. Keynes going to try to impress you. It's at least it used always female double

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       jab overhead. Right? Still it's the right idea. You know he's coming towards you instead of straight back and roll the shoulder out on an angle. You still need to catch him coming in the concept. You go back to Canaan fought Nogueira. There was no one like him at all for just feeling his body just can't fuck. Are we talking about? Yeah, he beat the fucking broke twice. Twice. Jd has never been the same. Never been the same. I've been saying well the amount of damage they took in those fights was catastrophic and you, you just, he had a pace that no one can fuck with. You couldn't keep up with it. He just would keep it on you over and over and over again, but his body just does not seem like it can handle that kind of that kind of that a lot of fights though, like even if it were to stop right now to me still the greatest UFC heavyweight of all.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       Yes, I agree but I feel like he could have been the greatest greatest of all time. One is right up there with him, his Fay door and you've got to give the nod to fade or based on most recent for like his own canes, most recent fights you look at like [inaudible] and you're like, man, you got to kind of, it's taught when you look at it on paper like fade or during his hay day was something special for doom, beat fade or though and that was like a legit fence. Not really the first guy to do his own coaches. We're already talking about his lack of preparation after the Brett Rogers fight. They said that he put a say in that, but we really didn't see no at Rogers in his own coach was saying that he went up and he uses old tricks but he didn't prepare correctly.

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       Is Brett Rogers? Nolan did. Yeah, but Dallas now fucking agent try. Fuck Dude. Brett. Brett Rogers got arrested is trying to fuck dude and he's homeless and then went to prison doing the same shit. So he got arrested after kind of touch and two guys and then they sent him to prison and then in jail he was accused of touching his ma. She knocks him out and then fucks him. I don't know him being your fucking cell man. God Damn it. Good time. He's the biggest guy I've ever seen in my life. I remember interviewing him with, and I'm not a tall man, but holding my hand straight up in the air to interview him when famous show haymaker. Right. Have you ever see the animated Gif where his head goes flying off? It has his head goes flying off and it's slams against the camera and creates this big bladder.

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       Him The internet is amazing. Fucking Huh? What'd you guys think of the Tito chail fight? It was a legit fight for sure. Anybody is saying that it was a work they looking at slow motion. They're saying that like Tito, like motion thing. If you speed it up to like real time and then the fight was going on, it's like this. He's trying to hand fight. Yeah, he's trying to, he's trying to figure out what to do, whether it could tuck his chin, whether he could move. And by the way, you got to recognize that Tito has had serious fucking neck surgery. He's got fused disks in his neck, so he gets out of sketchy. If someone's grabbing his neck, understand why, but it just, you know, it was a bigger, stronger guy who got ahold. There's the look of that. Oh, the

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       washes get it comes out. Yeah. He's the craziest animated Gif file. So sick. Right hand of all time. The timing, man. Dude, the fucking Internet is amazing. Actually. Look at the way you could probably do that back and calf foot comes off. See the ways back foot. It's actually a pitch. Mcgregor's left hand when it's done right is the same thing. It's not, it's not a turning punchy pivot and just wings. We rose countdown videos was like Kim in the mountains like with fucking big logs and shit. You remember when he, when he fought 'em what the fuck's his name? Tim. Sylvia. When you'd fucked up to him. Jesus Christ. Oh my God. It's Tim Silvia. Silvia was Tim Sylvia. That was me. Still fucking beat the wild wild west where everyone's doing everything. Tim Silvia's basically seven foot with a great jab and great deck gun offense.

Speaker 2:          01:15:14       People forget about Tim Silvia. They paid him six or $700,000 for that minute. Tim Silvia. Good. Yeah, it's good pain. Clobber knackered. But I think that like if you go back to the Tim Silvia, that Fault Rigo Rodriguez, Oh my God, it's my favorite. Tim Silvia. Tim still jacked all the steroids had giant killer CV. Can find that Jamie, pull up Tim Silvia versus Rico Rodriguez. And, uh, Tim, if you listen to me right now and you're mad at me now, I'm a fan. But you know you were on the shit so shut the fuck up. I know. I love you. I think he had been at it.

Speaker 2:          01:15:51       We're not breaking any news here. It's funny. He was so scary though when he was juiced up. He was so scared guy when he was watching stuff days. Those are the days of a different, it was a different world. The juice to it when he fought Nogueira. I don't think so. I think that we should watch that. I've been testing the testing got significant. Yeah. Little Lucy, not me. Not like now. Now you take a fucking caffeine, cast you back. Then after the fight they had a few randoms. They did occasionally back then. Like dude's got like Ausra got busted. Remember? Yeah. Officer got busted on a random dude's got busted on randoms. Very recommissioned with the commission would test you. Yeah. Well they started ramping it up right around the time that they decided that this testosterone replacement therapy, those arms, dude, he was so jacked.

Speaker 2:          01:16:40       See if you can find the video. Jamie was a fuck. Even his face, his muscular. Great. Back then. Holy Shit. Oh my God. It was jack. He still was jack. He was heavy duty steroids because they teased him about his body at the gym. Yeah. He said he wanted a six pack. He kept saying he was going to have a six pack. Kept telling me, I go, dude, you don't need a six pack. You're smashing. People don't. Facts are for everyone. You didn't need it. He was, but he was jack back down like he didn't have a bad boss. He did everything to get the fans that love. Remember he came out to, I forget what he

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       come out. He came out to all of the G. No, he came out to g walks and then you turn the Mike Mike. There'd be booing me like I'm doing it for the troops like doing and it came out of the American flag. He did. You check it off. People are going to love this and they still just didn't wear the Jersey and everything, but we can't beg for it. You can't bet. How did he look like a big bully I guess?

Speaker 2:          01:17:33       Hmm. Tim Silvia is entrance to Sylvia versus Vera Brandon Vera. That was back when Brandon vera was it

Speaker 4:          01:17:41       Marion Brown and on the mic after knocking out Frank Mir was like and be light heavyweight champion heavyweight champ pioneered that. Conor McGregor and then they signed a shit load. We got paid

Speaker 2:          01:17:50       well it took a long time before he got paid. They was out for a long time. But here's the other thing that happened. He stopped training with rob came in. That was a big factor in his early success is that he was training with one of the greatest kickboxers of all time. And Rob came in is so technical. I trained with rob for quite a bit when I was supposed to do that. Wesley snipes things I did all my striking with Rob Cayman and dude I was, I had an understanding of like how people set things up and systems and systems that they struck under him. But I had no idea that there was someone out there that have that kind of depth to their thought process behind striking cause all we would do four days a week was get together and talk strategy and technique and striking and he would explain things to me and then we would hit pads and then after we hit pads, like two days a week I'd spar with somebody mantle and dude rob came in is a bad motherfucker man. His techniques and his is like his strategy and mean that way he breaks things down. Mastermind. Oh he's, he's genius man. And it's, it makes you really truly appreciate like when you would watch his fights now you'll see like all the shit that he's setting up. We don't have to hold on on the table anymore. It's legal now.

Speaker 4:          01:18:54       That must've been awesome Joe. Being able to do that with, with rob came in and tell Joe who you want to do that. That's smart too. Yeah. I asked Matt, he's a bad mother. He's a bad motherfucker. He's, I think he's the best coach in the game. He has the best fighter in the game and I think he's got the big picture. He puts the whole thing together. He is the strength and conditioning coach. He's the everything coach. And because of that he can periodize everything properly. So you know, you're not sending your guy over to another guy, unsure of when he's tired of what he's doing on his schedule. He's, he schedules it all and Demetrius actually trains a little bit less than everybody else

Speaker 2:          01:19:32       rests more. That's very smart. Well, the thing about a guy like Matt humans, he's also got physical capabilities that mirror worldclass fighters. Like he can fight like really fighting. You Watch his fight with Pat Miletich way back in the day. He fucked up pat military. She was like one of the first super high level guys, like super early on. Hey Brian, you and the bathroom, are you in the kitchen rather buddy? Can you get me one of them? Cam butches one of them. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:19:56       well in Cam, Gucci Calm Booch can Bluetooth.

Speaker 2:          01:19:59       I'll go with one of those jammy. Um, yeah, he's

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       um, he's a wizard man and he's seen it all. You know, he was a judge back in the glory days of pride. He never fought in the UFC, but easily could. Thank you sir. Easily, easily caught. Yeah. I caught some of his fights ever and pancreas and stuff. I've broken him down from all fights and it was one of them where he was riding this guy's hip and just spent the whole fight back here. And at the time it was just so out of character and I broke it down and then I, I saw him and he's like, yeah, thanks for doing that. That was really nice. I'm like, cool. I said, how'd you do that? And he just matter of factly. It's like, well, I knew he didn't understand this particular kind of freestyle wrestling. So I just designed the entire thing about doing something he didn't understand, which was so natural to him.

Speaker 1:          01:20:48       Also, his dad trained with Bruce Lee or, or um, uh, Dan Inosanto. So Bruce Lee to Dan Inosanto to Matt's Dad. Like the lineage is still super legit, so smart. So I asked him if I could come and just stay in a cheap hotel nearby and come to shadow him for 10 or 12 days on my own for my own costs for vacation. I said I cleaned the gym and whatever I could do to help, and he said, yeah, I'm not opposed to it. Just circle back to him. He's gonna make you clean the gym. I offer it. I shouldn't offer the abroad. I'm going to start slow. Give me a couple of bucks. Oh, you don't need to. I'll thanks man. Well done. Let me give you a hundred y'all go social media on you. I'll put some Instagram posts. I'll do a breakdown every fucking day of all the stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:21:32       Videotape him. I want to do a piece on you. Yeah. I told them I would document it if he didn't mind, but I didn't. Don't need that. I want you to new inspiration said maybe February, maybe march, some mighty mouse is in camp. Yep. How often do you train in? Three times a week if you're doing them a matron, Jujitsu, powerlifting and strength and conditioning and strength and conditioning. I'm always trying to customize it with my coach Paul to Mimic what I'm seeing guys too. So you know, everybody was moving so I had to start to understand agility and direction change and stuff like that. So customized, strengthen conditioning for things that I'm trying to understand concepts and I'll do Jiu Jitsu once a week. I've got a kickboxing coach, Evan Boris, who is one of Henry's guys, Henry hoofs guys, he's up in Toronto, he's really good and he's a good friend so we can talk to go.

Speaker 1:          01:22:18       He left in Florida, I don't know where he's going to do and a lot of those athletes, which just went with them right away. He's the jam of that. He's, he's as good as it gets man. And you know, so it's, it's weird political shit when you put really smart, talented people all together. If they don't have the exact same vision, some weird shit to chemistry thing, you can't just throw it. It's like the pro bowl. He can't just hope all these guys get along. There's too many egos. Winkeljohn is so unusual. Those guys like Gel together so well k eightK is a good example to Mike Brown is so cool man. I kind of know one of the most humble guys in the game. He's like more celebrate talk that if you run a gym together like you gotta like, like Eddie, you and I could run a gym

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       together cause we know each other so well. We're, we've been such good friends for so long. We could run a gym together easy. You and I would have no problem. We might disagree about some shit, but we disagree about shit all the time. We never have a problem. You see one way I see another way. But we would talk about things. We could actually run a gym and I would, I don't think, I couldn't imagine we would have a problem at all. I couldn't, I couldn't foresee anything that we couldn't work out. Let's do an MMA show, the soccer field. I'm fucking Hallock and that other guy find on big soccer. Like I liked that fight, man. I don't give a fuck what anybody says and props down. No problem. Perhaps to how it, Gracie, I love the fact that you didn't just take a fight after a long time off.

Speaker 2:          01:23:52       You took a fight to pay your debts. You took a chance with Metamorris I, it's a big thing to take a chance. All the criticisms aside, which I'm sure he would agree, many of them are valid. That fucking guy took a fight. You'll pay his debts and he took a chance to start metamorris in the first place. It's not an easy thing to do, but to give Jujitsu, professional Jujitsu, a platform and a high profile platform and get guys like Eddie to fight guys like boiler, get all the guys and he got to fight. He put on some very, very good shows. Josh Barnett, he had some really good level, high level guys and I think it elevated the profile, Jujitsu and then to go in there with that. How do you say his name? Sasaki cocktail. Cocteau. It's [inaudible]. That guy is a bad motherfucker. He said dangerous, legitimate striker.

Speaker 2:          01:24:35       He's knocked out Joe Schilling twice. Not only just selling an item, he doesn't get hurt. He doesn't get hurt. He goes, three fucking room gets touchy as amazing. Tim. He mounts in him. He's dominating him in the last minute of the last round. I don't give a fuck what anybody says. That's what I like about Jujitsu. That's what I like about martial arts. When I see a fight like that, I like it. That fight was fucking terrible for me. I'm glad you guys, I think I don't have that on a football field though. Yeah. Yeah. We've got, again, it would be, there would be no fight. Where was, where'd the fight take place or where did the fight go to the ground? Like wait, did they clot? No, but they collide with the cage at all. I don't remember. I don't remember. I don't remember exactly when it was against the kids only take that cage away.

Speaker 2:          01:25:17       Action. It's a lot tougher for Haluk window catch. Lots of, for everybody's tougher for Cocteau to hit him to run. Yeah. You could move away and get zero action. That's okay. That was always an never in a cage to a combat sambo is. Oh. So it's proven that it actually does work and there's no obstruction when there's not a wall or a cage way better. There's no reason to go to the outside. But to this premium room, it doesn't have to be a football feed, like a basketball court is plenty of fucking room. I like what happened that, so the marsh, the combat will evolve around the playing surface, the rules, the everything. And having that cage made some beautiful martial arts though. Like the, all the combat against the cage, just beautiful. It is. But in a better, when there's no other thing there, there's no other factor is just

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       two fighters with their bodies to Splore. Yeah, you could eliminate, but it's a sport. When there's no cage, you get a lawyer of they fight factor. But you can live in a fact. It's still not just to fight cause there's no headbutts. No, I gouges know a lot of strikes, know, shot feedback of the head. No talking, no cage. Unified rules of MMA. I do. It would be this morning. So Nikki, I liked the way it is. I love the way it is. There's nothing wrong with it. Who loves the way it is more than I do. I love it. I do on the football field, I wanted an a a basketball court. See, we're making improvement. Went from football to basketball. Sleep better on a basketball court. The audience would have, they would have to look at the, at the screen the whole time. The audience here, if you're on the floor, you think you got the good seats on the door.

Speaker 3:          01:26:54       You got terrible seats. If you're on the 200 people on the floor, the good, the good seats are the risers on the floor. No Shit. But here's the thing. In a basketball court, there's no floor. So all that shit you see, that's floor. That would all be risers. Risers. Oh, do it would be perfect. Perfect. It'd be great. Let's do it. We can't get something. I'll talk to start it up. Set it up. Eddie and I are going to form an organization going to make everyone aware. Rash guards to mandatory. Love it. No, no, no. Greeson eliminates the greasing tap planet. MMA. People are greasing all the time. There's nobody checking. It's illegal, but there are no test for it. Plus it's a big problem. That dude's agree. Anytime. Some guy who fights at black belt in Jujitsu, of course he's going to Greece, he's going to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:27:39       No one backing that. Just oil in the bath. But you guys know tag check. There's no, no one's getting busted. Like they're not swabbing their backs. There's Vaseline all over your face, right? You know, uh, uh, sports always change rules and add things to increase the office. They never do. They never change shit to increase the defense for the entertainment value is, and you need fail. Does it? NBA does it. They are. They're trying to increase the offense. Baseball, they do it. They're doing a shot clock and more offense in fighting is more knockouts and more submissions. More the more submissions of org awesome submissions. People love them. The better for the sport when God guides of greasing up and there's no tests and the easy way to fix that, have them wear rash guards, have them aware of what, what, uh, Juliana Penny's wearing. No big deal.

Speaker 3:          01:28:30       It's not a problem where her rash guards all the time, you get out their titties out exactly exact, but that the kids have arms. Could they or should they be able to cover their arms and legs? Aoki. Tights, tights. That's an advantage though. What an advantage is more offense, dude. That's what we're talking about. Tweaking shit from where we go. Round one shift Chanko or precinct four 50 44534502451 the more grease, the less submissions. It's a, this is a really interesting fight here. Chef Chanko is one of the best fucking strikers in MMA, period. Any man, woman, whatever. She super solid and that check right hook that she kept nailing Holly Holm with excellent, excellent footwork. Superstrong Moy, Tai wants to, she's more decorated than Yolanda and Holly. Johann kickbox. Yeah, she beat you on a, she's a lot bigger. So, and now she's about to have her way out of here.

Speaker 3:          01:29:28       She's going across the face now. She's way more bulked up now than then. I believe they were the same weight when they, fuck. Wow. She's making good choices here against the fence. [inaudible] agrees that she's got to take her down, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You gotta take shift Chanko what if, what if she can't? She's got to get knocked down. Knocked over. Next we're going to see, we're going to see, because this is her whole strategy. Giuliana is tough as fuck. She's very strong but she's not a striker like in the, in the realm of Chep Cenk skilled discrepancies. Massive. Massive. She's going to be defensive to close the distance and then this is what she's going to concentrate on the body part. All part. That's awesome. She got taken out. I take downs and that was a great choice to go black belt. She's going to let that happen.

Speaker 3:          01:30:15       Why would she stop that judo black belt could have been just a ploy to get the fight to the ground. Cause cause a lot of people are saying opinion. The clinch is going to whoop her ass. I'm like, she's a judo black belt are inside trips and our hips are ridiculous. So another reason to pull guard. Yup. Yeah, for sure. She's also super physically strong. She had pain. Who's doing all the right stuff to chest fully like, but that's also the thing man pen. His whole deal is on the ground being on the ground and on the ground. She's super solid. But when you're dealing with a woman who's a judo black belt and a nasty kickboxer boy you got a weird room to move in. You got a tough fucking fire dude. It seems like the smart thing to do is don't waste all your energy. Just pull garden. That's a great idea. But he's smart thing to do too though. She's butt blasting or with knees to the body. I mean bad. If she could pull it off, you won't forget chef Genco. A lot of people think the Amanda Nunez fight. It was only three rounds. Who is five shift Chanko probably wins that fight. Hey, here's a pervert question. Has any girl ever gone down from a shot to the Twat? Girl will they show the replay is what you do to get kicked in the balls? They show it in slow motion.

Speaker 3:          01:31:25       Took it down again. She's got that great timing on the trip that Judah look at us. Cause the legs, the feet aren't even on the ground. Take down. Yeah. No, she just gets tripped. She's throwing knees and she's getting tripped and wants it on the ground and shift. Chanko hasn't been regarded once or even close to it. She's just crowding or, yeah, she'll smarter shift Janka yeah. Juliana could recover a half guard and if she's got half guard game or butterfly game or full guard came home and just got to recover. She's trying to get to slide and get some kind of guard Shannon across cause she could just stand up and back out. She's got to hold onto shift Chanko so he's got to hold onto don't fucking strong man. She's like a coil, like a steel coil and now she's got, she's got her in three quarter garden now, so she's good to strike the breasts.

Speaker 3:          01:32:18       I mean it should be, you can't strike a woman's not wearing genital protection at all. Right? Yeah. They haven't got a cup. No. What kind of chastity belt do that and they brought a cop, right? I don't think so. But you're saying right or do you know pretty sure they do. Jen, I don't know. Jamie, can you please look that up? I wouldn't look like they're wearing a cup will protect. That's what I'm saying. Like if you got hit with the need of the clearest, I'm sorry for calling a Twat earlier lady. So it's just doing it for comedic effect. Um, but if if you do get hit in your vagina with a knee strike or a kick, I've got to think that's going to be very painful. We haven't done is like we're a girl just buckled and level like some dudes do know like when Vandelay got kicked by Gilbert Ivl stop the fight kicked him right in the nut.

Speaker 3:          01:33:03       Got, can you punch the titties? Like could you just start elbow into the tit? I don't think you can. I think the breasts are off limit. You can. Has anyone done on those rules? Caldor that Joe, I heard you say before that if a grind shots were legal guys wouldn't be going down like this and I agree with you 100%. You would become a climatized to it. There's an entire martial arts developed so that you don't take oh shot here. Even if she pulls out, she has a chance. That's where chances, it's just style. Dance. She could swim and take her to spiderweb right here. Put that Shim. She's never putting the shit the, oh, he's got to get that deep hooker left hook isn't deep enough. She's got to lose it. What the [inaudible] she got taken down and Landon I can show and that was still good for all she had to do was recover piece by piece, inch by inch.

Speaker 3:          01:34:01       Look, she ended almost an arm bar. That's where she has, she needs to keep doing that. Get, she's not resisting the takedown. She's letting her take him. Maybe she wants to find on the ground. She's losing that. Ram had a chance. She would have definitely lost if she would have just stayed in standards. Do it with her. But here's my question. When men, uh, fight, they don't have them where any specific type of cup, right. They don't tell them you have to work in shorts checked at the front. You have to at least show your way regular. Those are bullshit. Those are stupid. Okay. It says, what does it say? Jail female and him wearing. Wow. Wow. I did not know that. Female mixed martial artists wear a chest protector. That's some bullshit. Where a chest protector shall, thou shall wear a chest protector during competition. Do they mean those, those

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       sports bra chest protector shall be subject to approval by the commission. So what kind of alerts or they can have a hard one. Is that what it is? Like we're going to chest protector these girls. Why do you just mean you got to cover, what state is this, Jamie? That's the UFC. UFC. Mm. So they're wearing so much to have some padding on your nipples or something. Hold on. She's trying to hope for it to go for that arm swing like a knee pad. But look how rugged chef co is. A brute dragger last attempt to that. Her core is so God damn strong. I mean she tried so hard to drag her down to the ground like that, but her's cores so strong or takedowns are so strong. It's one of the things I saw her first UFC bound. I was like, this girl is not just a kickboxer man.

Speaker 1:          01:35:43       She's so physically strong. When you were talking about movement, whether you train with a movement coach and you trained with a different kind of strength and conditioning or something, when you can connect the upper and lower through the core so powerfully and have all the, you know, your nervous system, be able to move everything together that way it just makes you better guaranteed balance. Man. No one's got balanced like judo players. They're so good at shift in their hips and and adjusting their balance. Those guys are so hard to take down the lifetime of that and girls rather obviously, but you know what? You get that from breakdancers get definitely gymnast even get that from like taekwondo people. Like a lot of people that are used to doing things on one leg, like throwing kicks and stuff on one leg. A lot of times those guys can adjust really well and take down attempts and movement.

Speaker 1:          01:36:27       Look at Man, do you guys find that taekwondo people play a better guard? They just have better sophistication with their feet and the legs more. No Room. So no, no. The guard play start out with the card players have a different kind of flexibility first of all because the most important flexibility isn't like full splits. The most important flexibility is growing flexibility. It's like knee to chest, foot to face, the ability to go double lotus to put your, your legs behind your head. That's so much more critical than what's what you use in taekwondo. So the dexterity is different. I definitely think strong legs plays a big factor. Like if you, if you're grappling with anybody who's got strong legs for any reason and then they developed a dexterity and figure out how to use them well extra slags. Yeah, I mean your legs carry your whole body around all day, man.

Speaker 1:          01:37:13       You know the difference between he's a grinder and break dancers is the gymnast or doing set routines and breakdancers improvise. So judge and that's why it's better for Jujitsu. I may size do come in, Jim has do come in and they got that, you know, crazy monkey body strength. But Jujitsu is about making lightening quick decisions and so quick that you can't actually make them yourself. You have to feel the body adapts body as your body is going to make the decisions based on how it was trained. That's it. If you're thinking about it, you're just, but Juliana, she does not give her up. That was beautiful, but she crushes are away

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       from the octagon to she's fucking tough as shit. Shit. She described herself, she said on the hardest woman in the MMA, the, you know when you said the MMA, I fucked it up. When you are one round Gail piece, after this one, when you're out scale, then you're winning with heart at. That's what we said. Going into this one, you got something. You're fighting somebody way more skilled and experienced than you in a lot of areas, but you have more heart and that's impressive when you can make that work. That's all. I don't know it. I'm telling you man should Chanko has some nasty Jujitsu playing chess Giuliana chef submission. She does. She does. She does. She played the whole risk of going old school, pickles, attention those guard man. She puts her head strong ass legs to those kickboxing legs, those legs, or they got some fucking horsepower behind a man who's expanding the work.

Speaker 3:          01:38:47       I mean here. Who's spending both of them? Both of them are. Both of them are shift Shankles. No joke man. No, but she's got a dish that ankle tattoo too late. She's gone for seven 1980s nineties I mean, I don't think she has the setups. Tap, tap painter based on what I see right here. Her Garden, she hurts her. She has she, she gets posture. She lets it go. She gets it. She lets it go. That tells me that posture is not that important to her and that's not, there's no way you could have a high level garden. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          01:39:25       Oh, that's good though. Oh, I have to break your shit off to Eddie, but I was like, this is going to be hilarious. What does that call when that happens? Wow. Ironic. How do you say that? You could ever be, but I just don't know. So far just it seemed like she wasn't really attacking. That's, that's what I based it on. But she just went for it. She just swung her hips and just fucking went for pain. You got a little cocky in there, you know? And she, she beats, she beats in India. I think she wanted me to throw rounds. So what happened in the first fight at noon as one at close to Susan Shift Chenko adapted and by round three she was in better shape by round.

Speaker 3:          01:40:17       She just snapped up here. Oh, you know about Nunez, man. She's just, she's a nasty, vicious striker, but you are just not going to be able to tee off like that on shift Genco. She's not going to be five rounds. She's not going to be there. She's not going to be there. She's going to be standing southpaw. First of all, she's going to be sliding off to the right. She's always going to threat. Slash she's gotta throw nasty leg pants. Chew your legs up. But you know, we know what one, ah, I used to commentate for pride. Let's write 10 Hanzo fought Sakharova. I'm commentating, I'm the color guy and soccer. Robert has a Kamora grip

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       on Hanzo and out. And my commentary was, well that's not gonna work. I mean it may be worth [inaudible] is Jim, but he gets it embraces art. It's a real story. It was worse than that because I was actually commentating the show telling you you might be looking at the best women's MMA fighter in the world, right? Yeah. [inaudible] Nunez has a mullet. Yup. Her cause her head, her cause her hand celebrate that tonight. It's her calls her, hey, any champion a mullet. But when you think about it, okay, you are one of the fucking world experts in something and even you can be fooled by watching that. So when people are saying they know what's going to happen or could make it picks, even the highest level of expertise in the world can be deceived by, by what you see. If that's a compliment, that's a compliment because it is.

Speaker 1:          01:41:55       You were right up until that moment and then you saw something that made you give her a bit a different perspective of it. This is what I've been trying to tell people about all martial arts. Like when you were looking at fade or whether we're looking at cane in the moment, you can have an idea of how good someone is. You couldn't have an idea of what's going to happen if their fight somebody else, but really you never know and really you never know how good they're going to like how good it's going to look until the whole thing's gone down. Perfect examples, Ronda Rousey, like if you look at Ronda Rousey, Rhonda, when she was dominating women was dominating women that, let's be honest, at that stage of women's MMA, it was flourishing. It was growing, but you had Gina Carano versus Cyborg and that was the highest expression of women's MMA before the UFC.

Speaker 1:          01:42:37       So you have strike force, strike force has some very good fights. Rhonda shines, Meesha shines and then boom during the UFC and the women are sort of not, you know, you get Betcha. [inaudible] you've got Alexis Davis, you're not getting, you're not getting this. This is some next level shit and this is what happens, man. Just like MMA from 97 2017 has exploded and become a totally different thing. This is the same way. Same with the women, but that doesn't mean that Matt Matt Hughes isn't one of the greatest fucking welterweight of all time. Even though Matt Hughes may be, doesn't stack up with today. You got a little time to time. He's an iPhone one and he's got an iPhone and that one was sick. Exactly. The fucking suck. And the mass phone call Zack change and people change and they change moment to moment to, and the truth, the word truth. You know, we describe things with opinions and using limited language and all of these things, but the truth is the moment, the truth, you know of all the cliches in fucking sports, the moment of truth is the fucking best one too. You go into a fight and they say, go, that is the moment of truth. It's fucking truth. Rise. Do cyborg

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       versus Rhonda. No can, I don't know Ron tracks over do that. First of all, I think contractually she could fight outside the UFC and I don't think she would fight outside the UFC and I definitely don't think she'd fight unhealthy that he's trying to see people's shit. She retired. You want to see people does the contract once you retire, right? No, I've retired. I'm retired in soon as I went, I want to fight someone else. Do you have c goes, cool. Here's your contract. They freeze it. Yep. Oh yeah, like Walt Disney. The, yes, that's true. Yup. Yeah. It's not that simple and I don't think she would do that anyway. No, nothing. I'm most likely terrible idea. Why not? Cause I think first of all, Cyborg is probably walking around north of one 99 I'm not exaggerating. She was doing dead lifts with three. She's mad at me by the way.

Speaker 2:          01:44:40       Who blocked me on Twitter? Cyborg. Cyborg. If you listen, I'm not, I'm not a hater. I'm not a hater, but I have to call him like I see him, good or bad. I tweeted a long time ago that I'd like to see the UFC open on one hour and 45 pound division. So cyborg could fight the people that are her way. Welcome Cyborg. But I was saying that a long time ago because this is even before all the controversy where me and Tony got in trouble for joking around about her. But this was, I was saying like, it's crazy to try and make this grow. Go to 35 she's not 35 pound fighter. She's just struggle to get the 45 letter fight at 45 and let's see what's up. But build it. They will come, they will. There will be continuing to take awhile. But that fucking moment she would, I stand right here in the middle some she got upset because they're saying no, you guys going to fight you and I'm going to win.

Speaker 2:          01:45:23       And then she, I met off that. Yeah. And one laugh that the other one, she looks like a bad guy from commando, but it was doing girl crazy. That's Russian dance, Russian twerking. There are hard people. She's rough. She's rough. It's a super athlete. But let's hear what she said. Yeah, we can back it up. Can we give us some volume so we get to hear that shit sac. That's bad ass. Awesome. But anyway, about the Cyborg thing, I got to tell the truth, which I hear your job. Oh, I got to tell the truth on both sides. And she failed to use a test. Not One but two, you know one of them was from a different drug and this one is for some diuretic. That's also used as a DHT inhibitor. This is not like this is public news. Yeah, that's not gossip. It'd be is fair. It's document. It is what it is. You know, I don't, she shouldn't have taken something that was bad and they would never been an issue. But let's go. Let's hear this first. I pay money to have her attack. Tony and Brian, here we go.

Speaker 6:          01:46:28       Juliana is a resident. Hello. How are you willing to deal? Is this, I love it. She is excellent. Ooh. You show up that discipline. You take your training camps. Were you surprised at how successful you were taking her down? Around one. I was working very hard. I was only on this fine. Thank you to Michael.

Speaker 1:          01:46:54       She, she waits for the knee.

Speaker 3:          01:46:59       Yeah. Oh Shit. And she is not the slightest. Oh yeah, I'll get that. Nice friendly smile.

Speaker 6:          01:47:14       A,

Speaker 3:          01:47:36       it is so hilarious. Broken English roast battle. It's a roast battle with broken English. Eddie Bravo was like, play that back. She can dance. Oh Dude. She's an athlete, man. She's so goddamn pouch. She talked to him was so bad. That's going to be a great fight. All of us moving ahead. We're moving forward. We're moving forward. We're moving forward. These are animal fighters. That's even better. That's even better when it happened. You're going to get to get that tape and you're going to chop it up. But what she said

Speaker 1:          01:48:19       so important because what she said there is that you're seeing to real world champion caliber mixed martial artists. They do everything Nunez. A black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu, choked out. Miesha Tate choked out. Sarah McMahon. When she's a beast. Dude, she's nasty or fucking power. Punching saw Longreach she gets after it. This is super dangerous. I would fuck that cheeseburger up right now. By the way. It looks good. Right? Right. If only, if only it was healthy. Mm, nice wine, Brian. We don't pry around. Brian knows his shit. He knows her shit when it comes to wine. He'll talk to Somalia about grape locations, Darren, right by where they grow them on the hill vocations. I will know whether that is a difference between a burgundy and a Pino. And actually it's kind of the same.

Speaker 3:          01:49:04       We were talking about cannabis. How about how

Speaker 1:          01:49:10       people talk about wine 50 years ago. Way Different than they talk about it and understand why now. And that's the same thing with fighting and what we see. Those women are so much better than women's fighting was one year ago. Parents a one. What's interesting subtleties and it's just, it took a while for them to get into the UFC and then it took a while to find their place. And then like when you see like someone like you wanna like when you want to what was super, super evident when you wanna Fuck Carlos bars that and when she fought Julianna Pena when she fought, uh, not uh, uh, Jessica went, you've got Jessica, Jessica Peninnah. No, I always mess it up. You fucked it up when she flat Jessica Pinay it was a murking, you know, it was nasty. She was smashing her and slicing her up with elbow is called nip tuck those job.

Speaker 1:          01:49:55       It was rough. It was rough. And when you see that you're like, okay well this didn't exist before. When you watch those kind of lightening fast combinations, that front front kick to the face she hits goes girls with I Pang, she's digs the hips in that Nasty Long Jab that she has just super high level striking. And I think when you, when you see that and you, you, you opened the door to that, it's like we were talking about before about your ear, you build it and they will come. All these other women are going to step in to that and they'll fill that void was done. Rise up to that level. He had the, the base level rises like the bay, Jamie chilled out TV average level goes up. Do you know that might still watch all, you know the fight was the lowest level to fight, but that's some news.

Speaker 1:          01:50:37       I thought it was TV. No, no, you can still the Nogueira if want to watch that. Hell yeah. Get that on a, is it on fight pass? I think it's on fight pass. See if you can find enough. Fipass Kimbo don't like represented, but anytime too. I was going to say athletes, I don't know if maybe you can put me on this one. Came up was Ken shamrock. That was a great fight. Yeah. New One 50 I mean when people watch it and got great listening, I couldn't wait for it to start. Did you enjoy the fights? Couldn't wait for it. Why don't you got to be young to fight? Oh, what am I senior to have? Like obstacles, like fucking garbage cans and shit. Things, laying around to GRANDPA's football field. No rules.

Speaker 1:          01:51:28       We leave pizza boxes laying all around the field, so do slip on them and shit. And they fight on grass wet grass like right after the sprinklers, the sprinklers kick on and the crowd roars cause that means it's all about the [inaudible]. And then you have dudes come out and they throw the pizza boxes down and they have guys coming to place the garbage cans. Garbage cans are filled with like fucking used cat food cans and Shit fucked up diapers. Like yeah, cause you got to plow into them. It's gotta be like old dudes fighting championships, super hot cheer. But all those, before they get started, they get drunk, they do the sit there and they drink. They seniors, everybody like you have to have at least four drinks before the fight starts. They pour 'em out, they stare at each other at the bar, they do these shots and then the doctor goes, okay, we're good. 75. And they push them out there. We can just do downtown La if you want. No, that's crap. But it's not helping the, uh, the thing about any of those changes you just made, they all change everything. Like change any one thing and everything changes. If we suddenly allow like kicks to the head of a down opponent four points, it's a whole different game. Every position you change. I think we were talking about it. I think there should be no rules of any kind. And, and I, and I got you biting everything and,

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       and I don't mean you're going to have this. Yep. This is a parallel universe in which we could do this. Where it isn't a sport. Nobody will watch this. Let me, let me get you, let me get to you right here. What if regenerative medicine, regenerative, regenerative medicine reaches a point where they can literally shoot stem cells right into your eyeballs, grow you a new eyeball, 100% guarantee. It's like, it's no different than you getting one stitch. You get a cut that needs one stitch. It's nothing, but they're just going to shoot you. You know that they do that now with third degree burns due to have horrible burns all over their arms. They spray him with stem cells in your skin grows back in like a matter of a few days. People who were scarred for life now have no visible scars whatsoever. No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 2:          01:53:35       It has to be fresh. It has to be fresh. But while you have all that damage, all of your body does spray stem cells all over your body and your body just grows tissue. It looks amazing. Fucking amazing. Spray it. No. Well, maybe. Maybe that might work. Oh, it's amazing. I mean, that's probably the future. But once they reach that point where a guy biting your nose off, does it really mean you lost your notes? Right? Then you take pictures. Hey, I'm at the gym with a fucking look up by nose cavity. It'd be doctor says, no three days. Go ahead and fire for three seconds. Yeah, so weird check. Look up there. Look up there. Look at this. See, before after fucking massive, was that a black person before light? After you turn white, but you're, you're healthy. No, it's sprays a victim's own stem cells onto the wounds and it regenerates tissue at a fucking ridiculously fast rate. It didn't say that. No, no, it does, man. Look, you could go into it, uh, online and see the studies that they've shown, but it's fucking amazing. Severe Burns and they're able to do this procedure. Yeah. 90 minutes and within weeks there are 100% healed. That's a ceremony. Results within days. Look at that. Stem cells regenerate the skin, leaving no scars. So now do we know this is legitimate? No, this is 100%. 100% sounds like a scam. It's to NASA. Anytime. Youtube and it's in the library.

Speaker 2:          01:55:04       The library. I just said that. Both. Both. Yeah. It's both Dewey decimal system. He looked it up. It's double pro with the last time you went to the library. Brendan, what does the library, he'd been reading the librarian in Vancouver. This way to not teach. Canadians had to read recently we did some research on you. We know your background was you were working for the other side. So now we imagine it's okay, we can bite. We can tear out whatever. Okay. If that's the case and you can rebuild tissue a hundred percent why not? So, and the reason it would be fascinating is because over time he'd never get, well actually if we can rebuild it, uh Oh my God. Every magician change the, I suppose the face biting 20 years, brainstorm a in the brain to your brain. They're working on that. They're working on regenerating traumatic brain injuries would if it gets to the drain kickboxing class, you know, you can't ever spar because of brain damage.

Speaker 2:          01:56:00       But every night you could go in and knock out 10 dude, you get knocked out three times. That's cool. It's not as cool anymore. Is it? Because the risk is, that will always be cool. Everyone was sitting trades. It's like the fucking killing brain cells. It's about shutting a dude off and dominated. It's about killing brain cells gives off this shouting I'm off and dominate IOM. No Eddie's right. If there's no consequences physically. Yeah, yeah. I mean then it's a totally different thing. No one's cowboy. That's not true. You're, you're not, you're not, it's not true because that's Jujitsu. Cause you do too. You're killing each other without killing each other. What'd you did too? You get a guy's back and you fucking put that choke on him. He taps. He's basically saying, you killed me. If we're in the wild, we were in the jungle, you would've killed me.

Speaker 2:          01:56:39       So you let them go. You slap hands. You start again. It's better. Like Jujitsu people I think have a better bond than at least the gyms that I've been around that a lot of people that boxing, spar and kickboxing sport because they hurt each other. Yeah. You have a weird relationship with each other. Like guys, I used to spar kickboxing with those weird relationship, which I know I was trying to hurt these guys. Me, they're breaking my nose and Shit I think has mentally too because it does hurt. It doesn't hurt. You know what I'm saying? Like when you're doing it enough, you get app out. One of you. One though. It hurts the ego, but physically, yeah, but it was like a chap from the heavyweight light. Turns off, man, every time you get wrecked, how many times you've been hitting the bag. You think about some time that some dude fucked you up in sparring, just rocked.

Speaker 2:          01:57:24       You Inspire. You get mad when you're hitting the bag like you, you want revenge. It's totally different. Yeah, the scores that got settled even subconsciously when they spa, oh he wants more one or the Indians out. We don't get Tequila out for us. Got It. That's actually a very valuable knife that was given to me by Justin Wren. How was he? Got It from some people in the Congo because we built wells for them. I was actually going to slap him if he poured me another drink. Oh, that's what that was about. Don't drink or I'll stab you with is the opposite. This move discipline. Hey, you know for black belts, we've been through this already. Speaking up being a few virtual reality, you went to fight. It doesn't really work. If you're a virtual reality, somebody cause you don't get hurt. What if they use taser technology in with it.

Speaker 2:          01:58:09       So as you got hit, you got taste. You know what man, you virtual reality doesn't work because it doesn't hurt. But God damn, it's good for drilling. I've only done it with boxing. I only did it once. It's kind of weird because like, you know like if you look at gloves, like if you're, you're looking at your gloves in front of you. Like if you think of, you have your hands like this, that's how the gloves will look. But it's not, the gloves are like this. So you hold your hands like this. So you're in front of the guy and you find yourself throwing punches like this because you want your, your wants your fist to look like an actual pipes. It's a little odd like that. Like they got to Polish that up. But other than that, when the guy hits you, you see a flash of light.

Speaker 2:          01:58:47       That's not enough. It's not enough. But it's interesting. But it's interesting, like a little bit of a Zap. Yeah. But it's far as like just developing your skills. It's feedback and really that's all you need is feedback and then you would figure out a way to get so good at the game and get your head movements. So on point, it's this virtual guy could never hit you and your skills would be super sharp. Then you could move into another stage of it so that you wouldn't have like there's one of the things that's a big problem with teaching people at a strike is the panic of getting hit. Like you can look great on pads, but then when you're actually sparring there's a panic of getting hit. So how do you get a person passed that panic? Well you got to get them to spa light and you've got to get them to trust people and develop their skills so that as the punch comes, you're not locking up.

Speaker 2:          01:59:32       Cause some fucking Francis and Ghana dude, his throne nuclear missiles at your dome. No, someone's just touching you and you get to learn to do it that way. You can do that virtually and you can't do with everything. It's not going to work with Jujitsu because it's too much moving and scrambling. And chunking down and you feel them. But what you don't, what you don't have is uh, you, you like, you don't, it's going to be difficult to like throw kicks, like kicks are going to be weird. Like maybe you could do that. We'd have to have something on your legs. Soldiers or military does where they try to mimic it through computers and then he, they tried to the exact t and put them in stressful situations and then when the bullets are real really firing a lot of them, it's when it's real, there's nothing that can do.

Speaker 2:          02:00:14       It helps for sure. It didn't hurt to play one of those games in Afghanistan where they gave us like rifles and you had noise and video. They mimic so stressful. You get so pumped, but it's still a video game. It's just not the navy seals delta. He's like even we do all that and then even when the real blows Flan, I'll look right in behind me and the guys just frozen because it's real. He knows the consequences problem. The big problem with the virtual reality boxing thing is you're actually not hitting anything like you need to practice. So my ideas is crazy. No wait, it's okay. I'm telling you that a man like a robot on some kind of thing that gets controlled like this and he moved, there's a row, you're actually boxing of robot chicken. You've got balloons, he's got actual balloons for fifth with powder on it.

Speaker 2:          02:00:57       Somebody else's contract, get a bunch of blue powder all over. You know what I mean? So you're boxing got balloons for hands. So you gotta like hit Shit. And you know, they did it was actually doing it like a real will be the wolverine played on the actor Wolverine. They did that movie off. What are these? Oh these are these for football kind of shit and chase after you knock a robot and they stole your idea. That's a good idea. But what I'm saying, yeah, but you know that thing that I got in my garage, Eddie, that rubber guy with the, you know, it's just a torso and you could combination box on them, have something like that with arms throw. Yeah, you give him a bone on the upper arm, you know, you give him some rigid, rigid rigidity, but then the lower arms for the forums down, you just have it as just a rough issue you could do with the robot.

Speaker 2:          02:01:50       Just the words it, it's just a robot and you just got to program it to go down and you can teach them this James to shoulder roll. If you can avoid the robot. It's not like a real fight, but damn, it's pretty damn close. You're avoiding these combos that are prone programmed in by nerds down the wing. Chung dummy with some rudimentary concept related to that. No, because it didn't move, but this lesson to start with now movement, you start with an object and then late, everybody moved telling you this virtual reality thing is, is really there's somebody, it doesn't matter because it's you're, you're moving and you're shadow boxing. There's a lot of shadow boxing. You're not hitting your thing, but you're visualizing this time you're visualizing, but something's in front of you. And when you hit it, it's head snaps back and you can move away from shots and dig to the bottom line is better.

Speaker 2:          02:02:41       But I liked that one. That one. Could you get your, you're buying the idea. The two of them are might together and that's going to happen. Get Elon Musk on it. Like mix mass on it. I have celebrities. Ilan calling about a fight. We call him Brian. I'll let you know. I must give you one. I'll give up. Yeah, call him back. He bought a Tesla. You get a, you get a phone call. One phone with the car. Yeah, I'm a celebrity. I'm fucking on TV. I saw that, uh, Mickey Garcia fight that you were telling me about it. Mike, your Mickey Mikey Garcia. He was telling me for an hour 36 and oh, it was a horrible knockout. How bad. I thought that guy died it, but it took two minutes to get them up. And Garcia. He took like a couple of years off because of um, promotional problems. They got problems in MMA and boxing that are real similar that way where they tied up with promoters and shift goes down.

Speaker 2:          02:03:28       But there's so many promoters in boxing. You got the Goossens, you got Bob Arum, you got, you know, fucking Floyd Mayweather productions, the money team to get out of Globe and has his own Canelo has his own, I'll have some promotions. They're starting to like branch out because he's worked with golden boy. But he does have his own promotion to the UFC. If I was at UFC and I just spent $4 billion to buy the UFC and all this shit starts going down, I'd be like, you mother fuckers, do you know how long it's gonna take to make back that $4 billion with you guys all holding a big ranch and off and start your own promotions. But, but that's why. That's why your salad now sell again. No. Why they salt? Yeah, those guys. Fuck yeah, they know what look the Renzo is his genius and long right time.

Speaker 2:          02:04:18       These guys are cause before when Lorenza was there, people felt like they know the motherfucking fucking Godfather. He was right there. He was the guy. He's whatever decision the Renzo wanted. I mean you've got frank right there too, but whatever decision the Renzo wanted, it was just done. No questions. Boom. So everyone felt loyal to that, you know, and like you don't want to fucking leave. You know what I mean? This is the Godfather. You know what I mean? Now it's like who owns the UFC? We didn't know one. You don't know those guys. Yeah, but here's the thing, man. It's far as the UFC got for in two to up to 2017 nobody anticipated up til 2005 even in 2005 nobody saw that coming. But then the first episode of the first ever ultimate fire EHRs, and then it becomes a huge superstar event with Stephan Bonner versus Forrest Griffin and the files, millions of people tune in, the world explodes. MMA becomes popular. And then here we are, 12 years later looking at it, nobody saw this. If they can keep going like that. See that's the thing. Painted exponential growth. You don't anticipate it. These guys like scurry and super bore. These guys like Yahya, Rodriguez, volunteers, all these Frances and got all these new superstructure, Conor Mcgregor, these new superstars emerging, this shit could be twice as big five years from now. It's like your positive attitude. Positive about this. I'm saying I love it.

Speaker 2:          02:05:45       No one's more bullish on MMA than me. I think it should be the biggest sport in the world. Yeah. I think it's the mom, the one that transcends boundaries. It transcends cultures and races. It makes sense. If a guy dunks a basketball in your face, at the end of the day, the only saving grace is a pitch. I will find you outside. No, fuck you up. But if you fuck somebody, I got some guy up and he goes, oh, I can still dunk a basketball on you. Nobody gives a shit. It's the end all be all of sports is the super aggro. Yes. It's almost not even as a girl. Yes. Not even super aggro. It's more impressive than anything. If someone wins some crazy us open tennis tournament and that's an amazing thing. If Conor McGregor knocks Floyd Mayweather the fuck out with a piston like left hand, it might not happen, but if it did, the world explodes too. But anyone can [inaudible] you can join us. Not In the NBA, not in the NFL. You can. It's married but it can fight in the UFC. Cm punk pumpkin. It's the Ross Forum. Brenton shops cheese. He gets Moody's morning. So Nigga, you don't have much more impressive in his I'll Lebron James Caan team. Absolutely. Come on. Does that more impressive? Oh my God. Destroying another man. That's the most impressive shit come food. Pure Mba [inaudible] up another dude, man.

Speaker 2:          02:07:23       I'm telling. I'm saying that what you did is the most the of shit and what you did not being in a team and be like, whoa. Not athletically. It's the ball in the hole. He's a moose. Makes me do it again. What

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       makes that bat? The ball goes in the hole being you're being a, what's the word and insider. Cerios Joe's hit the ball with the racket at a hundred miles an hour ago. We just got, we just got done looking at this field full of baseball players early going, he'll pull watches that stupid fucking game. And I enjoy watching baseball. Hitting a home run. It's the hardest thing to do. And professionals, you're a contrarian. It's not even close to the hardest thing to do. The hard knock knockout, Josie, all the with one punch, 13 seconds and after you talk shit about him for a year, the odds are higher hitting a baseball. Shut the fuck up Jimmy Burke. Imagine baseball fight companions. Imagine how bad that would pick that. Hey, I can pay to watch the Dodgers with the reds be awesome. Baseball fight companion. We have amazing cause we'd be drunk and high as fuck. And I'm like just be like a ceremonial thing. We don't actually watch the game. We just put it on. I can guarantee you there are baseball companions.

Speaker 3:          02:08:48       What do we need to do? It's a NASCAR fight companion or WWE. Nascar. Bet some serious money. I'm telling you guys, these all exist. They called him second screen experiences in every sport now is doing them every day after Joe fell has a second screen experience. They started doing this in the last year. All of them, the NFL has to sec, they call it a second screen experience. Mother fucker. Hold on. What's the whole website called like ramble on or something like to anybody can get on and make their own companion for India. They should call John Rules. That's like chat rooms or don't. I mean, uh, who else? Who else was do you never saw someone do it. You invented it. Here's what I did. Here's what I did. I'm the first guy for sure. That is the lead commentator for a gigantic organization, like a professional sports organization that also does a thing on the internet where they smoke weed and talk shit watching the same way. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:10:02       you're the only ones. If they can cuss, wouldn't that be cool? Joe could just because people have said that for years and now you're actually doing, but here's the crazy thing. He's faking companions. Get more downloads than any broadcast and views. Yes. They get as much downloads is a major Fox card on a major Fox UFC world championship card. That's how many downloads he seeks care we're, we're closing in this month on, we're probably, what are we at right now, Jamie? I checked before. We're going to get close to 85 million for the month. That's for Youtube? No, that's for iTunes. Just iTunes and then youtube is how much point? 2 million. Yeah. Can you ask yourself why they're watched so much? Not just keeps [inaudible] at a million views. A way more way more than what you got super drunk with Cameron Hanes tower seven. That's when it's like 5 million. What's it at?

Speaker 3:          02:11:10       600,000 no. Well what is it on the audio is the last firing cap. We did almost 6 million downloads a serious Eddie. Your recap, Eddie. That's after the fight. The recap, the 6 million downloads. He's got one word on iTunes. It's talking about youtube though. When the youtube is not as much. Youtube is only like, well, what percentage? How many views per episode? Percent. 20% of the nobody. How many views? Like what is merely average visa lately for that? That's it. Like 5 million for audio about weighing up to 1 million for you. Two videos like it depends on the show. 1 million when you and I are on with Alex Jones, which will buy, but by the way be episode nine 11 dude, I'm working so hard and make an episode nine 11 I'm doing so many goddamn episodes just like just so I can get to number nine 11 with Alex Jones.

Speaker 3:          02:11:58       That's Wednesday, right Wednesday. Alex Jones, how huge cascade and be home shit. And it's going to be episode nine 11 and that's what I'm going to keep my mouth shut. I'm going to keep going to ask you a fun. First of all, we're not doing it sober, so don't even try. It's going to get weird. Come on, let him, he's not going to be sober either. I just want to maybe ask a question or two but I'm going to, we're going to house shut. We're going have not gonna say anything like the Flintstones Jones. I love him. Love. Does he smell queen? Uh, neither can confirm nor deny.

Speaker 3:          02:12:32       Even if you don't, if you're in this room, you're smoking weed or whether you like it or not, you're taking a contact high of epic proportion. I walked in and smelled it right away. Alex Jones is going to, that Shell might break records. It's going to be interesting. Come on. Cause would be bigger than lands. Armstrong. Any what's your big bigger than Atlanta. So I'm showing what's one of your questions you wanna ask him. Don't say don't give it away cause it prepare for it. You gotta sneak it up on them. The weird thing about conspiracy horse that make, that are making a living off conspiracy theories is, is uh, there are so many conspiracy theories and a lot of guys are just like into one or two and they're experts or ninth or experts on JFK and they fucking know everything about this. It's so deep and so sophisticated and complicated.

Speaker 3:          02:13:16       The whole JFK thing, all the theories and all what could have happened and all that. It's so deep, dude, spend their whole life on that. So when they talk to dudes are, are, are, are still believing in CNN and they're trying to convert them, try to wake them up a little bit. What ends up happening is there, they've invested so much money in JFK that they can't, uh, they're not even looking at other ways. We're getting fucked because then they deny all that other shit. So when other people bring like other crazy conspiracy theories up, they got to say, that dude's a shill. He's tall. He's right about the JFK shit. Cause I know cause I studied that, but all this other shit he's talking about, that's got to be a shield. So it's good to know you, Eddie Lee Harvey Oswald Killed Jfk. Everybody, let me finish what I'm saying real quick. Everybody thinks not everybody, there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there that are experts in certain conspiracies that they think Alex Jones is a shill because he's not, what is that? A vacuum? Some crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:14:21       Anyways, the ground, let me send this, this road's creamy finishes. So there's guys out there, ouch. I'm going to be on the Goddamn show Wednesday. And there's a lot of conspiracy. There's that think he's a shill because they're not talking about the conspiracy theory that they spent all their time on. Like Alex Jones is like, I, you know what, there's, there's different levels of transparency as a generalist and a specialist in everything and a generalist, the specialists can go deeper in their one specialty. Then any generalist conspiracy theorists argue with each other more than with skeptics. It's incredible. Like the scene, everybody's pointing things. He's a shill. He's the show. Just cause they're not spending time or promoting your, like Alex Jones, he's, he's into certain conspiracy theories and it's, uh, it's like, you know, he's got his plan, his agenda to wake people up or whatever, whatever he thinks he's got his plan. And then this guy's had, has, this is how we do it. This guy walk, come, you're not talking about what they're doing and how come you're not talking about the Jews.

Speaker 3:          02:15:27       Conspiracy theories are accusing each other of being scheels all the time because they're not like Alex Jones has his own agenda. I don't know. That happens in every little sub culture though. Like in fighting, uh, you know, certain people, he's going to try to change the subject here to fighting. And I'm not going to let you know it was going to say that's exactly why you start to get news sources that are credible. So what happens is don't talk about credible sources. The economist, how many years can you look up? How many years old? The economy, it's over a hundred years old. And so the kind of narrow, well hold on, why does eight, why does it magazine stay there? Well, because what happens is if they start posting news, people will read it and say, that must be true. When it starts not being true, people will stop reading that newspaper or that magazine. This was bullshit. So that's why certain news organizations develop a reputation team 43 God, hold on. It's been, there you go.

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       So what happens is you can't fool people that long. Okay, Carol, while Eddie after a while and he called us. No, no, no Eddie, you've got to let them. Teddy. The economist is a very credible source. And if it wasn't, they would get found out not only by people like you, but also by other news. Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold the other news outlets. Heady. You let them talk and then I got a question for you about this. So there are, there are credible sources of news which you adhere to. I know you do. And the question becomes, what is the criteria by which you can trust a news source? A company that promotes news, that reports news. There has to be a vetting process. And what I'm saying is that you develop a reputation after a while because it's pretty easy to find out if you've been lying for a 140 years about every news story.

Speaker 4:          02:17:21       Yeah. So what happens is you start that you have to get your news from somewhere, right? You have to rely on it somewhere. So what they do is they get people who are investigative journalists. When you have, what if you had a news organization where you'd say is you'd say, I want three, four, maybe six different credible sources before I print this. I would imagine you'd be that way. Right? Right. Uh, uh, people who actually, yeah, so people who corroborate the same story and they have independent lines of either inquiry or investigation, whatever it might be. And that's kind of how, and that's why I invest in reading, not just the New York Times, but the economist, two sides of the political spectrum, NPR. And when I hear three publications like that, that a one that's independent, one that, that gets, it relies on like a public sourcing, not, not, uh, not private sourcing. After awhile they're all reporting the same news story. There's gotta be some truth to it. The CIA has infiltrated all mainstream media. You are being pumped. Okay. But hold on a second.

Speaker 4:          02:18:25       Here's a question. I'm not saying stop. Stop. What do you know about the economist? Um, I know that if it's mainstream media, it's, it's, if there anything for me, the mainstream media is controlled by the government. Okay. But you understand that anything that the mains, all the mainstream media all agrees on and anything that they're pushing, I am automatically seriously skeptical about it because our government has lied to us for Millennia. Changed thing may say, I understand you're saying it. I'm not trusting. I know, I understand what you're saying, but you really don't have any information to go on based on the, uh, when you, when you talk about this particular magazine, you don't know anything about, I'm not an expert in the economist, but I'm pretty sure, I guess I'm going, I'm pretty sure its own buy I understand. You have to understand is happening is happening. Having a prejudice, dismissive attitude without having actually examined

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       it is part of the whole problem we have with information. The first place. Right. You might be right, but you haven't examined it and you're already throwing it away. But before ever looking into it at all, it's a giant, it's a giant issue because there's people that are worth billions and billions of dollars. They're getting their financial information from somewhere. Where's it coming from? Are they sharing it with each other and then eating babies and fucking each other? Like what are they doing? Or are they getting it from a longstanding, credible source that all these different super rich people rely upon? And that's why it's critical. No, but Eddie, you don't know if it's untrue, but you're prejudging it and that's not healthy either. That's one of the reasons why a lot of these conspiracy theories fall apart is because there hasn't been any forethought into concoctions. Let me speak, just immediately step in and say, if it's mainstream, it's gotta be this, this is this.

Speaker 2:          02:20:19       When you have a, uh, let's just say a criminal who's been in jail, who's been in jail for uh, uh, credit card fraud. He's just a shit bag. Does one person, yeah, just one dude. One Dude. Just a shit bag. Criminal credit card, fraud, robbery. Go ahead. Are you going to believe these guys bad? This guy, but he's not a person that's not the government they began with the economist, you know, is not really connected to the government. I'm not an expert in the economist. I understand, but that assumption is negative. It's not smart to assume that you might be smart. You have to trust criminals, trust. But you're not talking about criminals. You're talking about a long standing magazine that's dedicated to explain the economy and very pragmatic terms. Mainstream media is criminal, but he made that decision. But there's nothing that could be criminal when you don't eat something that the state has a long history of credit fraud and robbery. Is there anything that can tell you that comparison, this piece, and the economist gets everything wrong. Look at this, but this is one of the reasons why is he criticized? But this is a [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:21:37       Put that in context please. Can I put that in? So Steve Forbes is a Republican and very, very right way. So what he, what he's all he's doing is he is budding Obama's point of view, right? And now let's, let's point out that Obama is not an economist and Obama probably got an honorary position as a journalist to post this thing. That's how it works. So the economist is not about, it's not economists that right. It is it. The economist says, hey, write a piece. And what they'll have is they'll have an op ed piece. They, they, they, so you can, yeah. So when you can write something, if your Obama, the economists will allow you to be sort of the, a featured, uh, opinion, what's the date on those? That's why they call it her. Not that this was November. So it's an opinion editorial, right? Is that right? Yeah, it's an bad, so when you eat it, it's criticized by people who disagree with the New York Times. The back of the newspaper

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       every, every, every day is an op Ed page, which is different. Various journalists, some right wing most left wing who give their point of view on the world and not so much like, uh, cause a lot of like Nicholas Christoff was in there working with women in Kenyan schools and stuff or, or the, or slate. Uh, I'm sorry, a forced prostitution. This is an investigative journalist not making any money by the way, but he's in there. And what he'll do is write an op Ed piece that will bring your awareness to the fact that for example in Cambodia there's a lot of sex for sale and it's really horrible et, et Cetera. So you know it's worth giving the New York Times. It's worth giving. The economist is worth getting MPR a fair shake. You might learn something cause to say that it's all lies. Eddie is a little extreme and also they wouldn't be in business if, because people don't like to be fooled and I don't think you can fool people all the time. Good. Full. Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:23:21       That's the way I see it. I mean I you've been had by the CIA operation mockingbird you've been had but wait a minute, you just, as your know, I don't blame you, you up. We're trying to get indoctrinated. What if you've been indoctrinated by Europe by the ideas that you're exposed to it because what I want you to guys, you're identical. You both put on dot. Yeah. You both been indoctrinated with ideas both that are separate. Both that are probably wrong because most of the information we get is not based in truth. Your own point. Not Most.

Speaker 4:          02:23:56       I didn't give you an idea what I just said was how I get my news, which is from several different sources. I'm with Ya. Who are, who are one who doesn't. One is not not run by a profit motive what like NPR, national public radio that relies on contributions from its listeners like me. So, okay. And then you've got the New York Times leftwing I disagree with a lot of it all the time. Then you've got, then you've got the economist, then you've got time magazine. All competing. By the way, we're all competing for the story. So to say that I am, I'm in, I had the same doctors. Well I'm sorry, your fundamental beliefs are based on what you've learned and been exposed to. Well, hold on and I will dilate on that because what I, what I'm exposed to varies. It's, I try to be as well rounded as I can.

Speaker 4:          02:24:42       And if that is being closed minded, I would like to hear what would be considered open mind. No, no, I just mean all of your beliefs. Many of which much more of yours that I believe with that Ed, he said, no offense Eddie, I love you. Um, are based on everything you've learned in your life, all the things you've been exposed to this and my emotion too. Emotion built you a beliefs. Astrology, let's just built you a belief system. Just as Edy's has add, he's everything. He's been exposed to everything that needs to learn to all the information. Not just the information you're talking about, but how you learn information, how you gather ideas. All of those have built you guys your own belief systems. And when you look at each other, you're just shocked at the other one. Can't see you're shocked at the other one.

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       Can't see your belief system, but he's just like you. He has one of his own that are structured and built upon every experience he's had in his whole life. And he is sure that everything he's saying is right. Just as you both on, it's a good second and you bolt. Neither of you can see that this other guy just can't understand. Cause I know the truth. And he does. Isn't that great? That's how I feel. But yet, and that's how he feels and that's how he feels. And that's what's going on in North America and all over the world. How I feel, I don't think that's fair to compare the [inaudible]. I don't think so. What I think is what I see with Eddie is that he has so, so we all want to believe that we're responsive to evidence. Getty does ideas. We won't belong to be there were scientific and in that we'd have our mind changed based on the evidence, but he can't change your mind and you can't change his mind.

Speaker 4:          02:26:09       But, but, but that's not true. That's not, that's not a character resisting to me at all. I changed my mind all the time based on the evidence now, right now, uh, well I sent Eddie several sort of what could be considered conspiracy, but they were, they were reported by mainstream. Some of the stuff was, and you remember that we were talking about recently, I can't remember what type of text message. No, no, no, no, no. This was something else. Yeah. And it was a real one. Oh, it was fast. Glenn Greenwald's article in the Guardian about the, the government turning on Donald Trump substantiated reports, clock political operatives hiring, you know, x intelligence officers to discredit a candidate. And this is happening and this is what the biggest fear is. What do we believe at this point we'll all the fake news and we have to be very, very vigilant about.

Speaker 4:          02:27:04       And so when I formulated an opinion, one of the great things about doing a podcast is I'm found out all the time to be wrong. I love that point of view. And I'll be like, I'll say something and people will be like, Hey, by the way, bullshit, because here's this, this, and I go, Geez, that's embarrassing. I was wrong on that. Great to be wrong, just to get new information. So we have to all be willing to set that. First of all, I don't think all the people in mainstream media or criminal, but you do. I don't see any evidence for that entity. I do see that sometimes mainstream media is discredited. I do see sometimes that they make mistakes. I do sometimes see sometimes like rolling stone articles gets it really wrong. And there are examples of course, of mainstream media where they get it wrong.

Speaker 4:          02:27:43       Sometimes they get it wrong very badly, but I have to believe is that in a lot of times they get it right? Yeah. Because I mean, just take a couple of things, like if they're reporting on the war in Syria and how many children are killed and you see that you see pictures and you see video of children crying in a hospital, it's just not the same when you're that Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, you've got to stop doing that because you're just trying to discredit what his ideas are by making jokes about it or mopping in or show. But no, you're munching your mocking and knew you were mocking earlier saying you don't believe it's how you indoctrinated.

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       You were telling him that he's, he's brainwashed. You were telling them that you're mocking it instead of just having an open conversation about the possibilities. My point, although I, I'm probably 75%, uh, think like Brian, we all are just thinking all of the information that we've ever been exposed to and we've built up a belief system based on everybody has. And when our belief systems don't mix, we have a problem. And that's the problem that I think Eddie actually believes that wholeheartedly. Yeah. Mocking his thoughts by saying, you're brainwashed, you're brainwashed. Brainwashed. But he didn't say, you're brainwashed. You've, you've said it many times. What do you, what do you, what is your expression then? Because that's what I'm doing is paraphrasing. What am I saying? You? Yeah, exactly. You say he's written [inaudible] it's not a rational debate, the situation, and you really don't know anything harsher than it worked on you.

Speaker 2:          02:29:23       You're saying he's brainwashed in responding to what you're mocking him by saying that, you know, you're right, but it's not the way we figure things out. It's just not because it's like all of a sudden you pick teams, everybody tries to win. Look, I did it a good chunk of my life. It's just not the way to communicate. It's a constant way that people do it because nobody ever wants to be wrong. And when you, when you get into debates and becomes a mind a game, as much as it becomes a conversation, I'm saying that's really bad for everybody and that it's really just like if you, if you're still in it, if you know your side is losing and you know you don't have any facts on your side and you're still in it, you're fucking it up for everybody else. But if you make sense, if you make sense then you don't need all that you, you know it worked on you, you're a, you're a fucking brainwash.

Speaker 2:          02:30:09       You don't need all that. If your, if your facts are in line and if you've done exhaustive research on the subject and a lot when you just blanket throw all mainstream media is CIA operation mockingbird nine 11 was an inside job. Chem trails got to go out and actually billion babies. So we're trying to solve problems you meet. And so one of the problems, like for example, healthcare, universal healthcare, gun control, these things, it's very, when you get into it, it's really difficult to come in. And we were talking with, Joe and I were talking about this. You can't know everything. Control. Look at this right here. Here's some conspiracy shit that's real. Another Glenn Greenwald polled Washington Post is richly rewarded for false news about Russia threat while public is deceived. Wow. And Glenn Greenwald who exposed Wiki leaks. Of course, he's the guy who was the reason why he works for the Washington Post right now.

Speaker 2:          02:31:00       He's, he has a, an investigative journalist. These are the kind of guys I love. No, he doesn't work for the Washington Post's investigative journalist. So he, he doesn't work for the Washington Post supported by somebody who has the Washington Post. Who is he? Who, no, he's The Guardian. The Guardian is essentially a British leftwing mainstream news source. But this is a classic example. Now Eddie, he just, he just exposed what would be considered a conspiracy now and he's just, the guy did the thing about Donald Trump. But I mean, I'm saying, I'm saying, but this is a very good example. This is an investigation, but I do, I do believe that, uh, I do believe that, but he's on the payroll of the Guardian. Some guys, some guys are are jumping ship and, and doing the right thing, but he's the reason why Edward Snowden got all that information out. That guy, Glenn Greenwald, I remember he works for a [inaudible] body is a psychotic. Not Everybody is down with the program. Some people are like, they're coming forward. There's whistle blowers but Obama, but he's not a whistle. He gets paid by the Guardian, you know, legit journal. Some guys are legit, never said, oh, I'm suspect of all. I understand.

Speaker 2:          02:32:15       I believe, but he's mainstream. This guy is mainstream as a get some mainstream, all mainstream stuff. For me, I, I'm skeptical but some, some, I didn't say everything was false, just some, some guys are growing a conscious, I don't think there's anything wrong with Eddie being skeptical. No. Journalism journalism is based on being skeptical. Michael Shermer is a skeptic. You being a skeptic means I need, you told me something now I need to trust. Is it fun? Was it three or five or six or between three and six but the bottom line is you should always be a spa skeptic as our credible news sources because they say, what was the news? What was the story? What are you saying? Okay, I need sources. I as the editorial, as the, as the editor in chief or whoever it is who okays these things, I have got to see tangible, measurable proof, which is why the rhinestones story about the Uva case was such a big deal.

Speaker 2:          02:33:12       Now because they printed this story was a made up story about rape, about a gang rape that never took place. No, there's no sexual assault history. There was, it was not real. It was all fake and they printed it and they printed it because they didn't want to ask the hard questions because it dealt with something that was a taboo subject, sexual assault, and they liked that as a catastrophic failure of journalism. These, these checks and balances are in place to make sure that we know the fucking truth when it gets printed in such a prestigious magazine is a rolling stone and it gets dealt with right now. It's still going on. Yes. Let me ask you say get, they get found out. Look at Brian Williams. They get found out. They get found out by their own, within their own organizations. They got find out our scientists and professors, uh, is there a history of them being bought and paid for some of them? Hold on a second. Let me, let me, let me qualify that. There have been tens of millions of scientists over the course of human history. There have been a small handful that have been corrupt and those small handful that had corrupted, we have found

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       out about the results have been catastrophic. What they've done has been horrific. What they did with the sugar industry, what they did with tobacco, what they did with, there's a lot of fucking now the environmental catastrophes that were downplayed by scientists. There have been some bought and paid scientists 100% but that's just like there's certain people that are going to be corrupt. The vast majority applied to the rules of science. Dedicate that. Right. So do you think that it's possible that journalists are bought and paid for some of them? There's absolutely proof of that. That's why. That's why you gotta be skeptical. Like I don't know which one you want. You can be bought. But Eddie smart, that's way not in a paranoid hiding in a fucking corner. No, but Eddie, you guys are full of Shit. I love you. But when you're talking about something like the economist that you don't have any information about it all set, then you blanketly dismissed them.

Speaker 3:          02:35:10       That is where, that's where it all started from. I said, I don't know anything about the economist, but it's mainstream media and if they're speaking the same thing, everyone else is spewing like CNN and see and listen. That's just the way I am, dude. That's just the way that they compete with these. I'm not saying you should be that way. I'm just saying, Hey, listen, you know, I try to help people. I said, listen, you're being fucking honey dick. You're being punked lake up. I tried to do that, but I'm not going to go crazy with it after awhile. Zoned by the Rothschilds. Well, can't shock me now that doesn't shock me that, I mean it's a public company is Cadbury, the Kennedy people and they make great public has done by Rothschild to public means anybody shot. So that's what I'm saying. I'm saying when it's coming, when, when scientists and uh, professors have been bought and paid for like big ones, like Ivy League schools, like Yale scientist says this, Harvard professor says this to push some agenda or it could happen. And then there's, you know, and then operation mockingbird, you kind of, you, you can't ignore that, you know about it through mainstream media. I'm just saying, I don't know who's who and I'm just getting wine. I don't know who's who. And I know one, this is for me, this is just me. For me, I'm 100% convinced the moon landings were faked. You don't have to believe that.

Speaker 3:          02:36:42       There's no proof that the earth is flat, but don't book until she, but no, no, no, don't you. But that guy, hey listen, there is no proof that the earth is flat where all the pictures of earth from space, CGI is ended by NASA. It's the way our satellite stage Johnson [inaudible] about flat earth is. I want to hear it so I'm just going to flat out no. Why do you know why it's a perspective issue. Do you know that? Why? That's why they pieced together the pictures of the earth because it's a perspective issue based. The earth is fucking gigantic space station. You're not far enough away to get the full earth and the bottom line when you should miss as you want to take a chance. We would watch every space document or even can we look and had all this series, the universe put one to 12 we were so into it.

Speaker 3:          02:37:44       I was stolen. I would watch these star documentaries all they just get every now and then I'd watch it and I think it is weird that we're watching 100% CGI, like everything we're watching because there's no actual footage, but that's because they don't have the capability to fill it out. Know the names of the scientists. I don't know the name of the astronomer or the astrophysicist, but somebody figured this out. They got something out there taking radiation question. Here's what I'm saying is what I'm saying real quick, real quick or a flatter. So when you look at the stars every night, the Orion rush donor talk, dude, that's all. This is definitely not stoner talk question.

Speaker 3:          02:38:29       There's a question kind of like every night we look up at the stars and we see that the belt, that Orion belt and we see that that north, Yup. You see that Shit, right? Right. Do it tonight. You and me holding the everyone. Isn't that weird? Okay. Let's say this is the sun right here. Let's say, look man, I don't know why this is pissing people off, but this is the sun and the earth. [inaudible] figured out any question. I just want to ask Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. This is make fun of me with this. Here's the setup, here's the earth, and it takes a year to go around. We spin around, that's mainstream everybody. And then we got mercury and Venus and Mars and Saturn out here. So they're all going to Dallas. And the solar system, according to mainstream, is that like a plain Wall Street son's going around the Goddamn the earth is spinning a thousand miles an hour and it's going around the sun like 60,000 miles an hour.

Speaker 3:          02:39:31       And then the sun's going around the fucking black hole, like 900,000 miles, something like that. So it takes a year for the son, for the earth to go around. Yeah, it's huge. It takes a year. So right here is January and then right here, June, right. So when the sun is facing, when we're facing the sun, it's daylight. And then when we spin this way, it's nighttime. So when it's nighttime, the sun is over here and we're looking at this side of the space. We're looking at this side of the space, right? There's Orion belt that north star every fucking night. It's there. By the time we get to June over, like when we're looking at this, this side of the universe, what the fuck is on the other side? Why don't you read some books

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       and get into it? No, no, no, no. I don't want it. Don't hold us here hostage. No. See these crazy questions. Listen, you guys are still what I'm saying? Why after you need to tie somebody figured out. I don't know what it is, but somebody figured it out. It's just a question. Well, Eddie, I don't know. The answer does is on the other and when in six months when the, when earth gets over here, why is it still the same and different areas, but you want to guy hold on a second all the time. Do you understand that it's not. There's a procession of the equinoxes. There's a cycle and this cycle of thousands of years they've mapped out. They know exactly. There's a wobble to the earth. There's a changing in the sky that we look at, and it's one of the ways that they get determined when you go back in history and look at certain things that they had lined up to certain constellations, like in Egypt is one of the ways they lined it up.

Speaker 2:          02:41:03       They line it up because they understand that we're looking at a different area of the sky every night. It's slightly different and it changes over the course of thousands a year for every night. We don't, you shouldn't miss. It should be, that should be a completely ready to fly a plane and you shouldn't miss it when you shoot a bullet. Even I think snipers have to take into account the curvature of the earth. We're talking about flat. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the stars. Let's wrap this up. I gotta get out of here. I really got to get out of here. I can't do this flat though.

Speaker 7:          02:41:37       Perfect.
