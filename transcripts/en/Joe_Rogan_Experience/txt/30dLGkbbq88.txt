Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches think and I know that black Sabbath is getting back together with the original lineup to do two shows at the Birmingham Nec in England. So I called Sharon Osborne. I said, Sharon, I got this great idea. I fly out and hang out with black sabbath and bro down with a band and go to band practice and have a really good time and you put me on the guest list for these shows and I hang out for free and it's like the best time I've ever had and knowing she'd hang up on me and she said let me call him and ask him if that's okay because I already knew it, but I didn't know the rest of the guys and she called me later that day. She said, oh, they think it's fine. Here's the address. I'm just let us know when to expect you.

Speaker 1:          00:37          So I booked, I booked it around my trip to Africa. So I went a USA London bus up to Wales where they were practicing a taxi? No, no, the, his assistant came and got me. So I hung out with Sabbath at band practice. Me and the band in full band rehearsals, the best, uh, watch the shows that you reunion shows at the soundboard and then the next day I flew to Kenya and so it was just a good, you know, that was a good chunk of travel and I ended up in South Africa after all of that and said to myself, okay, I'm going to come to Africa once a year. And I just started picking out different chunks of it and it just started going and that was 20 years ago and I've been there, I don't know, like 20 sometimes. Wow. Yeah. And you never don't learn it. I call it the big book.

Speaker 1:          01:26          It's where you learned about life and death and Oh, you can learn that anywhere, but you see big stuff. You see people who suffer, people who have no food or water security. Like you and I, we talked about retirement and life insurance and vacation. They, a lot of tribes, there's no words or even ideas in their lives. Like I was hanging out with some maturity people once in Uganda a few years ago and I had a translators at Dinka guy who spoke, I guess whatever a truly people speak and I said, can you ask them if they have any words in their language for life insurance, retirement or a vacation? And they understood retirement. You get too old, your kids take care of you, but a vacation. They said you leave somewhere and you come back. Why would you want to leave your home? It's where all your friends are in your family and you.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Why would you ever do that? Or like life insurance, like what the hell are you talking about? And you start meeting people who their sense of time and space is, I've got a bowl, there's some rice in it. So like today I got tomorrow, we'll see where you and I think, okay, in December I'm going to do this and we really have a realistic expectation of being alive and breathing in December and in your life. You've no doubt thought of, okay, when I retire or whatever that means to you money. Some kind of security up the road, there's parts of the world where people live their entire life 37 years and then they don't have a day of that kind of security. They got the t shirt, a stick and some shade and I try and not as some voitier I'm trying to understand the world and I can understand it by reading some books and seeing some documentaries, but there's nothing getting out into what Mark Twain called the territory of phrase I stole from David Lee Roth when he said it to me.

Speaker 1:          03:05          And David Lee was actually a real inspiration to do a lot of traveling because one time we were talking and he just come back from open sea kayaking in the Pacific. So I said, so why is it Henry is because don't get eaten today is a great thing to have on your to do list every once in awhile. I said, damn, that is profound. You know what he was doing up until recently he moved to Japan. I didn't know anybody there and he was taking Kendall lessons. So learning how to sword fight the Japanese master. Yep. But this dog. No, no, he told me, he called me one Sunday a while ago. I helped him with this autobiography. So I worked with Dave really closely for many, many months. I met him when I was in black flag 30 some years ago. Uh, I walked by him at an art gallery.

Speaker 1:          03:46          I went, wait a minute. And he went black flag, right? No Way. It's the van Halen guy. We became best buddies, but he called me from Japan and said, uh, you know, he's learning Japanese. He's very smart. And he was like learning Japanese and started speaking Japanese and he's just taking lessons, you know, you said the sword guy was just like everyday just like, you're stupid. He's just like, just breaking them down. Yeah. And he just got an apartment there. Yeah, I mean there's loving rockstar just gets like this normal apartment with his dog and just starts taking Kendo lessons, everything. David's always had a greater appreciation of, of, you know, that kind of discipline in me comes up through martial arts since he was a kid. And I think as someone else in his family's into it, but he's been that way, you know, that kind of discipline and you can see it on stage.

Speaker 1:          04:36          The guy is very physical, but it's coming from a real disciplined, not messing around kind of aggression and control. And I dave really loves Japan and he says he called me and so I'm living in a small apartment. I'm taking my language lessons, I'm taking my martial arts stuff. And he was doing sword stuff for quite a long time though. Yeah. He's always been involved in martial arts. And even the way he sort of approach to hedonism, I always felt like it was sort of like an applied approach to hedonism, like his rockstar lifestyle thing, what he was doing. It's almost like, look, not a lot of people get a chance to do this. Yep. I'm going to do it. Yeah. One time he, when we were working on his book, he said, you know, I go home to Pasadena now. And then were you born and raised in some of his high school buddies?

Speaker 1:          05:21          Seemingly like, well Dave, you know, it must be nice, you know, being David Lee Roth and he, and he said, you know what, on graduation day from high school, we all were on the same starting blocks. You chose the bank job, that's a sure thing. You're going to die in that cubicle I choose. And he said to sail the seas of consequence. I was like, I love that. And I was like, yeah man, that's daring. And so he won. I mean, like he said it pretty good ride. I record and, and so in my own way, you know, I come from minimum wage work, I'm nobody from nowhere and I got into music via punk rock because the band black flag said, hey, you're a crazy guy. You want to try out to be our singer. I'm like, what do I have to lose? Yeah. And so I went for that and it led to everything else.

Speaker 1:          06:05          And ultimately why I'm here in this room with you today. Do you miss rock? Do you miss touring as a musician? No, no, because I did it. I did it really hard until I had nothing left to give to it and so now if I went back to it, it would just be repetition and it might be fun repetition, but it wouldn't be meaningful in that I wouldn't be putting out anything new and for me the day I stopped doing music was I woke up one day and I just sat up and he was like a, a light bulb went on. I went, wow, I'm out of lyrics. And it wasn't like, oh no. I'm like, okay, well give me my scroll. I guess I've graduated. When was this? A 2000, three years that, and I just call it the manager. I said, Hey, I'm done with music.

Speaker 1:          06:51          And he saw 15 percent of that though, poof. And he's like, no. I went, yeah. He goes, why? I said, because I got nothing new to add. These will then just go out and do the hits. I'm like, man, that's not what coltrane would have done. It's not with miles Davis would've done. I just can't. I don't want to repeat. It's not artistically brave to me. And so I'd much rather just try new things, but thankfully by that time I was already doing talking tours all over the world and they do very well. Tons of acting, voiceover. I had all this other stuff I was doing, had the book company, a record company, music publishing. I had all this other stuff and so I just kind of let all of that stuff fill in, put it this way. I'm busier now than ever and I don't miss the music.

Speaker 1:          07:36          I see bands in the airport all the time, but like the laminates in road gear, I'm like, yeah, rumble young man rumble. I had my fill. Well, it's beautiful that you did it on your terms. You decided to do it. It wasn't just, it wasn't like there's a lot of aging rock stars that have that sort of existence where they have to go out and do the hair. No one wants to hear. He knew shit. That's a big part of the problem. And so they have to do that weird circle the wagons thing, like we're going to play this album in its entirety. Okay. I go to some of those shows, uh, I, I, you know, throwing my money down and go see that band, do that album in its entirety. It's cool, but it's not for me. Well, I've heard the stones still put on an awesome show.

Speaker 1:          08:15          I think one of the cool things about it is like, wow, mick jagger can still fucking do it. He still apparently works out twice a day. Yeah, he's amazing shame, great shape. Um, there's some people and they're, they're rare. They actually, it's not about money. That's when I really start trusting those old rock stars. Like Rod Stewart doesn't need a dime. I mean, that guy can buy four countries right now. He's probably playing tonight and Las Vegas or somewhere. Elton John. They just really liked doing the thing. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, there'll be rocking. They'll die on stage and it's not money. It's not like, hey, we might get populous like, man, we really want to play brown sugar. I don't, but I admired them. I think it's what I'm saying is I think it's real. Yeah. Well I'm sure it is real. I'm sure it's real with a lot of them, but what I like with you with what you're saying is that you had already figured out all these other paths in life that you were enjoying putting your creative energy and just decided.

Speaker 1:          09:08          I just, I, I know it was summer 19, 84. I was 23. I was in black flag and we were touring. We were staying out of California because the Olympics were coming and we knew the cops would just be looking to smash down any supposed Ne'er do wells. So we just stayed on tour the whole year pretty much. And I noticed all these great bands around the very talented people and ever. We're all broke between tours were like living like sharks. If we don't like tour, we don't eat. And between tours, the guys in that band, they're all waiters. I'm not putting that down and say, but the music wasn't keeping you in rent 12 months a year and I'm not nearly as talented as any of them. So I said, man, if there those guys are struggling, then what am I going to do? I better get plans B, c, d, e, F and g together, and in those days I just started my little book publishing company, so I'm going to work harder on writing.

Speaker 1:          09:56          I'm going to become much better. Start doing the talking shows. I'm going to get much better at that and I'm going to start saying yes to things when they come along. A couple of years later, Hollywood started calling, Hey, can you act them because well as I can sing and click, but I started, you know, acting is crispin glover, the actor. One day he said to me, he said, Henry as a just please consider acting. Just like just if you get an audition, don't necessarily say no just because you're the music guy. Like he said, I think you might really like it and you could probably do it. And so I said, okay, and within a year I was doing film and then, Hey, can you do a voiceover? I'm like, yeah, I got a voice. And so I just started saying yes to more stuff and that was the plan.

Speaker 1:          10:38          Just have more things to do, which is fine because I don't like sitting around anyway and then ironically music ended up being very, very good in all of that for me. But I had plans, other plans and I've noticed that a lot of old geezers around my era, they didn't come up with something else and they just, I don't know why and they didn't make another plan and they get put into those weird tours were there. He, you know, you bring your kid all of that and it's more that they got more than they want to and I'd rather wake up wanting to do stuff not having to do stuff. I think like you were saying a while ago, like less obligation just so you clear the deck so you can really do what you want because life is short. I mean last week I was 20 and now I'm 56. I mean it goes by really fast. It doesn't matter if you're in a cubicle or a prison cell and then you wake up one day, you're like, damn, that was fast, and so you might as well make it as much as what you want it to be as possible because all you're getting is older. I don't understand why people don't fear that I wake up every day, but with the, uh, the grim reaper side whistling by my ear going, you better get up man. And it's all the up I need. I don't ever sleep in.
