Speaker 2:          00:00:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Justin wren. First of all, thanks for doing this. I'm so glad we could fit you in. I was, I was a little worried we were going to be able to get you before you got back to the Congo because you're on this kind of a whirlwind thing. You know you have your back at La. Have for only like a few days, right? Actually, I head out to Vegas after this and then I'm driving there and I fly out tomorrow. For those who don't know. Justin was a contestant on the ultimate fighter is a mixed martial arts fighter in the heavyweight division for the UFC. And then I started reading some stuff. I think the first thing I read about it was a on the underground, uh, which has mixed martial arts.com. It's this great website that we both belong to. It's probably the best, uh, mixed martial arts message board in the country, in the world really.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       And uh, there was a, uh, a thread where it was talking about you going over there and helping people in the Congo and working with these pygmies and this would become something you were really, really devoted to. And I was like, wow. Like who saw that common? Like check this guy out. I saw a picture of you before that with a pig that you had killed with a knife over your shoulder. You know this, I'm like, this guy's a fucking savage. He's got a pig over his shoulder. Yeah. There's a picture of you with this, uh, with this wild hog over your shoulder. I'm like, I want to party with Justin wren. And the next thing you know, you go from there and you're, uh, your mixed martial arts fighter, hog killer, pygmy saver. I mean you're, you're over there helping all these people in the Congo.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       How did it all this get started man, I just heard about how much they were suffering and uh, I, I had no clue. Like I fighting, I wanted to fight against people, you know, and I wanted my dreams, my everything. And then when I heard about the pygmies, I just heard the suffering that they were going through. I heard that they felt forgotten her, that they were enslaved. I heard that the four out of 10 is the small stack that you can find four out of 10 of their children die before age five. And so for me, I was just like, man, that's brutal. And I knew that they were not given citizenship in their own country and so I just went there to just learn and see and sit with live with them, sit

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       around the campfire. That's where I've learned most whenever the slave masters on, around whenever, uh, whenever those guys are asleep, then they'll really open up and tell you what everything is happening. Um, and so it was just a ton of suffering and that's how I went over there. I just went with a burden to find out what was going on. Could you put that a little closer to yeah, absolutely. How did you find out about it at first? What was the, uh, what, what mean? What led you to this? Uh, I had a buddy that was having a plan to go to the Congo and he was going all by himself and I mean just completely, utterly alone. And it was like the worst conflict zone on the planet. And, uh, heard about what he was doing, heard about, uh, what was happening with the pygmies and heard his wife, uh, was a little worried that he was going.

Speaker 3:          00:03:41       And, uh, I just was looking for something with purpose and passion and I felt like I could be passionate about fighting for people. And so I went with them and uh, heard all the terrible stuff that was going on and we went there to see what we could do to help. Wow, that's so inspiring. And for folks who haven't seen it, there's a video that Justin did that's gone viral and this has really brought a lot of attention to your cause and, and what, what you're doing. There's a video of you with these young pygmy children then, or is this the first time they're seeing a white man to, to preface the video? This is actually not the pygmies. The video. It's actually the band too. And the band to are the tribe that's actually enslaving the pygmies. Oh my God. So it was, yeah, it was uh, around some of the pygmies, but this was the least remote location.

Speaker 3:          00:04:25       Like you'll see that there wasn't many trees where I went was 85 kilometers deep in the jungle where you couldn't even see the sky because the canopy of the rain forest is so tall. And so this was the band. Two people in the band too. People are ones that enslave them. He was actually a gift because I don't, that video to me is a real gift. It, it shows me, uh, even though I hated their parents, um, uh, you know, you can't even see that in the video that I actually just had a hatred in my heart towards it, the parents of these kids. Um, but yeah, so that was brutal because I, on the Ugi also, I posted a video. Um, we're actually a thread about how I, I buried a, uh, a one and a half year old in the Congo and his name was Andy Bo.

Speaker 3:          00:05:06       And so this video that's playing right now, you can't even tell that they were, uh, that, that their parents are responsible for the grave that I dug, I think two days before that video. So these are the boon to people's Bam, to the a n t u and the band two people are in slaving the pygmies. And this has been going on for how long? Uh, it's actually rather recent. I mean, there's been types of it for hundreds of years, but, uh, they have different kinds of slavery within the pygmies. There's ones that they're held to gunpoint. Uh, there's by the rebels and the gold and Colton at diamond mines. Uh, and then there's other ones where they're, they're in shackles, but then the ones that we've actually, I didn't get to say that yet, but we've actually set some slaves free. Some pygmy slaves that were from the band too.

Speaker 3:          00:05:51       And we negotiated with the band to people who go up and they buy up the land from underneath the pygmies. Pygmies don't have a way to make any monetary gain. They don't get paid anything and money. They get paid sometimes corn, sometimes bags of salt, sometimes bars of soap, like a bar of soap for two days of work they might get a bar soap to bathe with. Um, and so yeah, the Bantu people are the ones that are enslaving them that we're actually negotiating with them to, to free him. Wow. Yeah. What a crazy environment that must be. The Congo itself, not being able to see the sky and having all this insane conflict going on underneath the canopy of these trees. Also primitive dealing with things like slavery and forcing people. What's really crazy is forcing people to work in the minds to create the very things that we need to power our most technologically advanced pieces of electronics.

Speaker 3:          00:06:41       Like these laptops, that Cold Tan, right? Yeah. Colton, I think 80 to 90% of it is found in the Congo. So it's only found in two places in the world. 80 to 90% of it's the Congo. 100% of its rebel owned. There's not a legit mine. And so that's insane. Most of it's pygmy slave mind. 100% of it is rebel from the Congo. Yes. The Democratic Republic of Congo, all of it is rebel owned. So there is no Karma free cell phones, electronics, smartphones, not max, not flat screen TVs. So I mean I support it even I have the, the apple products, iPad, iPhone, everything. What a bizarre, fascinating sort of a statement on humanity that is. Yeah. It's actually pretty crazy man, because I had um, some pygmies come one time and give me some Colton and I didn't know what it was though at the time.

Speaker 3:          00:07:31       Uh, I didn't know. I knew that there's golden diamond mines there and that they were slaves in those, but I had no clue what Colton was a and that was after my first trip. But they actually put some Colton in my hands and I was holding it and they were really excited to give it to me, you know, this is why their slaves and, and and so they thought I'd be a static and so I'm having to ask my translator like what? Like what is this stuff they're handing me? I didn't know if it was like a rough diamonds or if deep inside there there was gold or what it was, but it was Colton. What does it look like? It's like this black dark mineral. It's almost, some of it almost looks like a crystal or I don't know if you can throw up a picture.

Speaker 3:          00:08:08       Almost like coal. Yeah, almost like goal. Um, it's, it's long and Jaggedy it's kind of a, I dunno, you know, those like crystals that you can use to be able to buy like that are long like that there'd be a black one of those almost. And sometimes it has more of a coal, like charcoal kind of feature to it and it's, it's heavy. Uh, but it's, it's a great conduit for electricity and that's why we're using it in all our smartphones and everything. And that's why they're slaves. But I wasn't excited about it and I didn't know what it was and I, but for them, you know, think how, think how crazy that is. That's why they're slaves and I don't even know what it is. And they're just a static to give it to me. And while it's a huge source, I mean, you need it all over the world. Yeah. And most people are completely ignorant as to what it is and a set, especially where it comes from. Right? Yeah. It's very bizarre. Like I had explained that to someone when

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       they were talking about, um, uh, how much better it is to have an electric car. And I'm like, do you understand that that car is filled with conflict minerals? Like it's not that simple. It's not as simple as like, you're good. And the guy with the gas guzzlers bad. Like, no, there's a lot of fuck Uri in creation of your car. Batteries like lithium ion. That's another reason why we're in Afghanistan. This is a lithium stores is trillions of dollars of lithium and, and Afghanistan. And that's what you need for lithium ion batteries.

Speaker 3:          00:09:24       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's insane. I, I can't even, I don't, I mean, I know we have two hours, but I don't even know if I could get into some of the, the stuff. I know that Shane from vice has been on here and then someone was saying someone else from your end tomorrow. Is He really? Oh Man. I wish I could meet that dude. Uh, each has a cool guy. You want to meet him? If he could stay til tomorrow, you can meet him. All right. We'll have to see about my plane back or something like that. He'd be happy to meet you, man. He's a big, crazy, coolest motherfucker on her. I think he's awesome. Yeah, he's a great guy. You see super easy to talk to, to just really like down to earth. And he goes to some of the craziest places. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:59       Oh yeah, he's returning back and forth. You know, I wonder what he thinks about me going for a full year. Just, I know that he said it was a crazy time going there and uh, and I just would want to pick his brain. What party you went to. Is that what you're doing now? You're about to go for a year? For a full year? Yeah. I'm going to go for a full year and I'm partnering with the Oldest University in the Congo and they have been working on this project for seven years and we kind of just linked up together to where, uh, our visions just are kind of the same. We want to free these people and give them a sustainable ways of life. So, um, one of my best friends now was born and raised in the Congo, was educated, got his doctorates in Australia, but then he came back to the Congo and he's the dean of the School of community development.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       So we teach you some different ways of agriculture, water, wills, all these kinds of things. So he's actually setting them free. And that's what we did in September. We saw 60 slaves be set free, put on 30 acres of land and get a water. Well now it's doubled. Now since I've been back here, it's been 120 slaves that free men, women and children put on 60 acres of land. And then now, uh, you know, we were wanting to find a way, we think that me going there for a year, and if we were able to fund raise $50,000 so we could find a thousand people at 50 bucks, thousand people, 50 Bucks, that's a thousand slaves freedom. And it would, it's, it's a nuts, um, amount of stuff that that would do. How many people are slaves right now there? Well, the pygmies in the Democratic Republic of Congo, there's a few different, it's hard for them to do a census, you know, I mean, these are hunters and gatherers and nomads and slaves and then in dangerous areas and then really remote area.

Speaker 3:          00:11:28       So there's a few different senses and, uh, that they've tried to do. The lowest I've seen is 300,000 pygmies and then another, I've seen a 600,000. And pygmy actually literally translated means elbow height. So I mean they're smaller than everybody else. It's almost like they're just a, the worst bullying victims, uh, that I've ever been. So the average men's height is four foot seven. So are, are they in any way like a, have you ever seen any of that stuff on? Um, uh, the, uh, the Hobbit, people from, uh, this, uh, island of, um, the remains they found now. Yeah. They found remains of people that lived, you know, tens of thousands of years ago with, with humans and they were the real tiny, like almost people like things. It's, it really interesting when you see like some of them like the pygmies where you have like a whole race of them that are like really tiny like that.

Speaker 3:          00:12:17       It makes you wonder like, how did that, how did that separate strain branch off way, way, way back in the day. And the evolutionary chain of these, these people being developed. It's really odd. I mean, it actually, one of the, one of the problems that they, uh, they have is that, um, they're called half man, half animal. Uh, by the surrounding tribes. And so that's one reason why I've met people, uh, that have been, that their families, members of their families have been victim of cannibalism. Uh, and so yeah, I've, I've, I've pictures that Santa Buzz of cannibalism, they actually, the surrounding tribes believe that if you can consume the flesh of a pygmy, uh, that you can gain super human strength. I mean, from taking the genitals off of small bullies and putting them under businesses, uh, it will bring you wealth from eating their flesh. Yeah. The rebels believe that if you eat their flesh that you can, uh, what does it, it makes you not bulletproof, but what does it, whenever a bullet can just fly right through you.

Speaker 3:          00:13:15       So basically not invisible pervious. So it just, they, that's what they believe you that you take children's genitals and they put them under a business. That's what they'll do to them. And then we'll, uh, think that that brings him many blessings. It, that some of the witch doctors have done that and Uganda, but they do it in Congo. Ah, the part of the Congo that I'm going to is it borders Rwanda and Uganda. And so I'm right over the border and then in the jungle kind of, um, Booney as where Shalom university is. And then 85 kilometers from there, there's a part of the Congo called commander. Um, they say it differently than that, but then we go from there deep into the jungle and where that is, there's some different rebel groups that have, that have done just brutal stuff there. And, uh, that's some of their beliefs.

Speaker 3:          00:14:00       Wow. Yeah, I was pretty crazy. There's one place gets so messed up that [inaudible] crazy man as they should be. The richest country on the entire face of this planet. They have every element on the periodic table, every single one. And uh, and they have the most fertile soil. They have gold diamonds. Now Colton, with all this taken off, they should really be the richest country there is. And then all the corruption and everything just ruins it. It's, it's so, it's so crazy. The corruption is so nuts. The warlords and the whole system that, uh, that they've got going on down there. It's so, it's so bizarre to look at the United States of America here in 2013 how everything is and then realize there's another part of the world that exists in the same time that is essentially living the way people live thousands of years ago with guns though. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 3:          00:14:46       And that's what's so crazy is the pygmies. I actually have my grandpa's, I've been accepted as family there now and um, I, my grandpa [inaudible] is his name [inaudible] and he gave me his bow. So it's pygmy bow and arrow that he's had for 30 40 years old in your hands. It's actually pretty tiny man. It's pretty tiny but, but in it, it has all these things that are almost like a pygmy tally mark and it's all up and down at the top of the bow and the bottom of the bone inside. And it's all the kills that he has of certain types of antelope. And he gave me the, I think I have like 10 arrows, five with like the metal on it. And then for that are just straight would that are sharpened and they have this like circular thing around the tip of it.

Speaker 3:          00:15:24       And I thought the ones that are metal would be the ones for the antelope because they look like they would do more damage. But it's actually the ones that don't have the metal on it, uh, that are just carved a out of the wood that are the ones that go after the antelope because they dip the tips of them in poison. And so it's poisoned arrows. And those are the ones that go after with the biggest ones in the, the metal ones are more for like monkeys and small little pigs and things like that. Wow. So you're going to go there and live with these people in like a tent made out of leaves? Yeah. It's a, a twig, a Twiggly fuck man. You shouldn't pull the people see the picture. Do you have it on your website or anything? When did you send me those pictures?

Speaker 3:          00:15:59       Yeah, I, some of the pictures over. Um, yeah, it's a twig leaf hut and they, they rebuild them basically every night. Every night. Well, it depends on if it was raining, the rain forest. And then if it's a, if the wind is blowing, uh, actually have pictures of, I think like the widows and orphans that lived in one hut together were just in the middle of the night. It didn't even rain that night, but the wind blew in. Their whole roof came off. And so they have to go get the leafs again and place them over banana leaves and different, like those big elephant looking here, leafs. And so they just get those and they cover up, um, in nine different villages I went to last time I was there for a month and nine different villages don't we do not one of them ever owned a blanket, so they're just sleeping straight on the dirt, man.

Speaker 3:          00:16:38       That's it. And no blankets? No, no, just sleeping straight on the dirt. Wow. First Time I went to one of those tribes was I saw the chief and I was putting up my tent and they about lost it and had a little air mattress, you know, and I had a sleeping bag and I mean to them that was the Ritz Carlton. So I let the chief habit and I said, yeah, so I let him have that and I slept in his hut and uh wow. Yeah. And then site. Yeah, he was man and they all passed around the air mattress and that they're actually like holding it up above them. Almost like a crowd surfing, like crowd surfing at a concert. But they're doing that with Eric mattress so everyone could feel it. Wow. Yeah. So they've never had mattresses. I mean this isn't like a new thing to them.

Speaker 3:          00:17:19       They've slept on dirt forever. Yeah. I haven't come across one pygmy in the remote locations that had been to the other ever. Pygmies and other locations that have cities or anything like that or no, no, they're, they're actually basically if they come to a city at all. So yeah, there we go. That would be home sweet home for, uh, for a full year. That's the kind of villages that I'm staying in. And if you look in there, I think on top of one of those huts there's like a few clothes and if they, if a pygmies had close, they've been a slave. So there's basically the only pygmies that are there. Yeah. So some of the clothes, so obviously these ones were have been slaves and most of the ones I've ever been to have been slaves. We've only been like one village I've been to where they were so remote that they still weren't enslaved and they can be hunters and gatherers.

Speaker 3:          00:18:01       But the deforestation with the trees falling that you could drive to Mack trucks through a, those are scaring all the animals away to where they basically can no longer live like hunters and gatherers because the animals just flee from all the trees falling. So the, there isn't loggers, is that what it is? It's loggers, but it's also the guys that are, uh, like the Bantu, the slave masters, they can get the pygmies, they're slaves to go cut these trees down in, into pygmies. Trees are wholly, uh, they believe that the ancestors of their, um, yeah, their ancestors live inside. The trees become trees and uh, they bury their dead inside holes inside of trees. They find an opening in it. They'll put, put their dead there. Um, and so they're having to cut down what they've lived in for thousands of years. And then the rain forest preservationist and wildlife conservationist, they, they push them out.

Speaker 3:          00:18:49       They'll buy up the land and they'll say pygmies aren't good for this. And they'll kick them off the land and they'll buy up thousands and thousands of acres. Actually thousands of square cushions. Yeah. They'll kick the pygmies off. So they're more interested in the trees and the are the pygmies. Absolutely. Wow. Yeah. I, I've, I've, I've heard from my family members in the pig pygmy tribe and when I say this, like literally I have pygmy family that are more family to me than some of my family here in the u s and so on. Crazy cousin who gets drunk and grabbed it there. We're sure. Yeah, there's some piggies I just love man that I love and uh, and you speak their language. I must speak the language. I speak some of it, man. But, but not a lot. And during that year there for my birthday coming up, I'm going to get Rosetta stone, I think in a, that's what I'm asking.

Speaker 3:          00:19:33       How could you not? You're going to live there for a year. You say you love these people. What do they have been talking shit about you the whole time and you gotta learn pygmy and find out? Well, they don't have, they don't have a Rosetta stone. That'd be funny though. I'm the crazy uncle. What is the language that they have? Like what is it called? It's like a, it's not the clicking is, but it's close. It's actually a tonal language or a polyphonic. Actually there's, there's some sweet videos, I don't know if you guys want to pull any out, but on youtube there's a, they do a thing that I love called, uh, uh, the water drum. And that actually isn't gonna be on my youtube thing, but you could look up pygmies water drum and on youtube and there's some sweet songs. They'll have like seven to eight women, uh, inside the river.

Speaker 3:          00:20:15       And then they, they each have a part to play and um, wow. Uh, and they just slapped the water and it's, it comes out the beautiful songs. Or they also have something called polyphonic singing where they each have a, uh, a tone that they do and they actually, some people would call it the language of song that's trying to think of that, but their language, sometimes they're joking around with each other getting into it and it sounds like they're kind of singing to one another. Wow. So that's the ones that are in the more Romaine remote locations. The ones that had been slaves for years and years and years. They've started to learn to speak Swahili.

Speaker 4:          00:20:46       Yeah, there it is. And you're not in it for just the boobs, right? No, sorry, the Sag after awhile. Is there a drum

Speaker 3:          00:21:00       to that as well or is that all just the water. Bottled water.

Speaker 4:          00:21:02       That's awesome. Yeah. This is just three. Whenever they get like eight to 10 in there, they get some intense songs. This is hilarious. Take a pause. Wipe your eyes.

Speaker 3:          00:21:20       Wow. They also have something called the tree drum. They'll, they'll uh, hollow out at tree and they'll get some harder sticks and they'll just beat the side of a tree. And it's, it's odd man. It's sweet. So what are you doing for food out there? Uh, the last month I went, I took about 40 to 50, uh, power bars with me. Man, my bag was so heavy because I had took a, I took a supplement shop with me and, uh, but I mean, they, caterpillars I've eaten, like I normally don't ask the different parts of it, but, um, uh, like whenever they do goat, which actually pygmies don't eat goat, they believe that it has a evil spirits inside it. So even though goats are really easy to raise, they won't eat it. Goat, the hunter say that a goat makes you weak in the knees. And then the women just don't like the flavor of it. And they all think that it, they've seen it. Evil spirits come inside of them. And so they don't eat goat's did they see drag me to hell? Is that what it is?

Speaker 3:          00:22:17       The Gate becomes the goal becomes evil. Remember that? I never saw it, but yeah. And so they, they eat, they'll eat chicken, whatever their slaves for. I have a picture I think of, uh, of my buddy Harry and, um, he, we call him Harry because he's the only pygmy I've ever seen with facial hair. Ah, that's why that video is so unique about me because I went over there and it wasn't just like some guy, uh, from America that went there. Giant, White, hairy dude. What the fuck is all this? That's why my buddy started calling me the great white Sasquatch. What do you think about your tattoos? Oh yeah. That, that is a crazy, not to the pygmies. The pygmies actually tattooed their faces sometimes. Um, the women, uh, I've come across a few of them that are more like traditional or remote. Those women still carve their teeth.

Speaker 3:          00:23:00       I don't know if you can Google that. They actually carve their teeth and it makes them almost look more like a, a Pirana to me it's not attractive, but to the pygmy men, it's attractive. Yeah. They, they, uh, hate below jobs. I hate to, I don't even want to be tagged those teeth. Good. Perfect. You read my girl. I don't know if you guys can find a picture of that, but, uh, it's, uh, pretty, pretty crazy looking whenever a smile, there's a lot of, um, strange things that, wow, oh my God. That African people do to customize their body. The neck rings. That's very strange. The stretching of the lower lip. Serie a women do the, they put a plate in their lower lip. Yeah. Well the, the Masi they do, they're a big gauges in their ears and whenever they get so big that they start flopping around, I've actually been brought into that.

Speaker 3:          00:23:54       So the pygmy tribe brought me in his family. Uh, the Masai tribe had a ceremony and made me a warrior and they painted me red head to toe. Um, they gave me a spear that killed two lions. Whoa. She's seen the main of the line that it killed the head warrior, you know, gave me my name, which is Mizzou. Simba Maasais Milan. And that means though the white lion, Masai warrior. So I'm a part of the warrior class, the Masa. And whenever the wind blows with them and there was big gauges, um, they'll just twist their ear loads and then wrap them around the top of their ear. So it looks really funny. But uh, but that's just on a windy day. So they killed lions with spears. Is it because the lions are attacking them or just they just got to be gangster? A little, a little bit of both.

Speaker 3:          00:24:36       Really. I think the younger guys go out there to impress the girls, but, uh, to kill a fucking line with the speed, their waiting, just show your deck. The, the, uh, the, what is it? The guys, um, oh, the, they there. Those are shepherds. So the pygmies are hunter and gatherers, but the Masa or shepherds. And so they take care of different cattle and goats. And so whenever they're doing that, they have to protect, uh, their herd. And that's against lions and Jaguars, cheetahs and leopards. And so my spear, they actually showed me the skin of the leopard that it killed the main of the lion that had killed. Um, and he also said it killed a man. So I guess I have a murder weapon, but a holy shit. Yeah. He, but he was protecting their cattle. A thief came in there and a actually came with, uh, a room Goo, which is a club.

Speaker 3:          00:25:25       Um, and so it was a room Guo versus a spear. And it was a warrior. So anyways, it's pretty, pretty crazy. Wow. What is it like, what kind of a head does this thing, the spearhead, the spearheads about this long. And it's heavy because I mean at all? Uh, yeah, actually they have this, uh, the wood part of it in the middle of a Maasai warrior spirit from like an olive tree of some sort, and then they put it through the fire and make it really, really strong. It's a hardwood anyway. Yeah, that's a hard way. And they, they, they know how to treat it through the fire and make it like rock solid. And then one end is almost like, it looks like a javelin. And so that's the end that they use for either target practice or just sticking it in the ground whenever they're walking around and the other, and they only use for whenever they come across the line.

Speaker 3:          00:26:06       Wow. So one end, they throw it just to like to just to practice. Yep. And, uh, we took some balloons over there to see if the kids would like it. And to be honest, uh, the, the warriors liked the balloons better than anything because we blow up those balloons and just tie them, throw them on the ground, and then, uh, they would, the different warriors would stock the balloons almost on every time. Almost the first throw, every single time they nailed it. How far away? Uh, I mean not too far because the wind's blowing in there. They're stocking it and whenever they're going after a lion, they normally wait until they're close because if they miss, they, they, they wait until it's close. And so, I mean, probably here to the door, me and only like 20 feet. Oh, well, I guess some of them did it farther where some were getting it from all the way to the, to the window.

Speaker 3:          00:26:55       So some of them could actually throw him pretty good and for, sometimes they get jacked when they go after these lines. Oh yeah. The, the, the, the spear that I have, um, the guy that's the warrior that gave it to me, it seems almost like it's like most is his name. It's like most and the other warrior mean I'm slipping on his name. Uh, but I took a picture of both of them in the one guy that I met, he had this, these teeth marks out of his, uh, his knee. He's kneecap. He, he had a big room Goo, which is a club, but it was, it was like a walking stick for him. And, uh, his knee was really swollen and it had these chunks out of it. And then, um, we, uh, I asked him what happened to his knee and then he pulled over.

Speaker 3:          00:27:36       They always wear red because that way if they're ever wounded in battle or anything hits them, they, you don't know that they're bleeding. And so he pulled down his, uh, his Shuka, which is like a robe of sort for the warrior class. And he pulled it down and down his shoulder blade and the back of his like shoulder. He had claw marks, I mean, just wicked claw marks. And so the, the lion had attached onto a shoulder on to his thigh and then bid into his knee. They showed me the scars and the w the head warrior is the one that saved the other warrior and that's the spear that I have hanging up at my house. Wow. So as the line was biting him, homeboy jacked him with the spirit that came after this one that wasn't even on a lion hunt. This was just, they were going after, uh, or they were tending the fields, tending the flock and aligned came after the guy to fuck cats.

Speaker 3:          00:28:28       That's all I have to say. And I'm more of a dog guy. Yeah. I'm way more of a dog guy. I, uh, I have chickens right now. It just got a little baby chicks. That's awesome. My little girl, they wanted to get chicken, so we decided to get like a little chicken coop sort of a situation. Um, but the fucking cat, I have two cats and my one cat, this motherfucker just paces in front of that door and laughed and Ryan, and it doesn't matter if he's trained, it doesn't matter if he's sweet nippers he can't wait to murder one of those birds. He just can't get it out of his head. Like in his head. He's got to get in there and fit. He hears them. He sits out in front of the dorm, the owls and you know, it's, it's almost like you want to kick his ass.

Speaker 3:          00:29:08       He like, come on man, why don't you fucking leave them alone? They're little chicks, but in his DNA there was just no stopping that. That's what he wants to do. Yep. Have you ever seen a live? Uh, yeah, I, I've just seen, I've seen a two different times. I've seen two and a one time they were sitting over a, it was either Cape Buffalo or a, what is it, a water buffalo water buffalo. I think it was a water buffalo and uh, it was still chomping down on that and so it wasn't paying attention to us. I had my spear though and I did, but I wasn't going to test it out. Like some guys are trying to go over there, have practiced with it. I have practice with it, but I'm not going to use it man. Like, I'm not, I'm not what they already gave me, uh, the ceremony and gave me the spear, made me a warrior.

Speaker 3:          00:29:49       In fact, the other ones, they can't be a warrior until they kill a lion. So they come back with the female tail a waving it in. If it's a male, they come back with a law. The main wrapped around them. Yeah. You got to be a w two w you have to be Elian killer to be a warrior. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Yeah. Until then, you're kind of a lesser class. A male should bring a blue state policies in this country. Yeah. So I thought I was a warrior. That's what I tried to connect with them, you know. Hey, I fought. We, they wrestle. They just do take downs though. They don't do any like ground fight and you show them some moves. I did. I did. I wrestled two at the same time and picked them both up. Uh, so they thought that's how they thought I was a warrior because they were like, oh wow.

Speaker 3:          00:30:32       As wrestling, like we can't dot. You had a line of them. Did you submit anybody? Uh, you try to teach them at a tap man? No. Uh, for me, I would just pick them up and put him over my shoulder. I did that with both of them at the same time. Wants to do what you got to remember. They're, they're skinny skinny dudes. I did start to put one in a guillotine choke, but then I started thinking, man, this guy killed a lion. He's not going to tap. Right. You know, so I'm like, I'm not going to hurt this guy. I'm just going to play around with them. So is he trying to wrestle with you? Oh yeah. They have figured out your sprawl. Yeah. Get doubled under hooks. You're like, what is he doing? And they trying a couple of different kinds of like colored ties and trips and then they do like a double, almost like a Thai clinch real.

Speaker 3:          00:31:09       Uh, and so they do that and they just kind of like, um, circle each other and they just do that amongst the warrior class. Just a, almost like a ranking system of sorts. So, uh, but you should be able to go in there and school those dudes and why when it came to wrestle, create a whole elite team. Yeah. Masai warriors, Kenyan wrestling team. That'd be pretty crazy. It's like you could be like your own Sandra Bullock movie. A white guy goes over there, teaches them how to wrestle, brings him into the state championship. They got leaves for shoes, teach him. And Cy had a fucking tap people, they probably don't understand this, like probably so many different techniques you can use. I don't, they don't see comment. Right? Yeah. But the craziest thing is, is that they have all these cactuses and briar bushes all around.

Speaker 3:          00:31:55       So inside the village, the wrestling was, was okay, but it was just, it would happen anywhere. And anytime. I remember I had those, a five finger shoes on and I stepped right on a briar Bush and it went straight through the soul of it and into my toe. And, uh, I mean, just, I'm like, come on guys, let's at least were you, uh, you know, so you just said it like, where do you used to? The mats were used to the, to the sissy stuff. And so those guys are just, they're worried be barefoot too, right? Yeah, they're barefoot. I got shoes on, I got, I got hiking boots on. I have, I have everything. So when they step on a briar Bush and they're barefoot, they just walk it off. I don't know. I didn't, I didn't, I guess I'm the only one, even while we're wrestling, I'm not aware enough to know there's a briar Bush around or herself ridiculously tough feet too, especially with the pygmies, the Masi too.

Speaker 3:          00:32:41       But a lot of the, I now are getting a sandals made out of tires, so like tires at blowout, they'll uh, they'll make it out of the, the rubber from the tire. But the pygmies, they don't have access to stuff like that, especially because they don't have anything to bargain or barter with. They don't have goats, they don't have cows and their slaves. So they are mostly barefoot all the time in the running through the jungle and stuff like that. And so they're the soles of their feet actually almost like the soles of shoes almost. I mean, not, not, I mean, they don't have the, the gripping and stuff and, but uh, but they're thick. They're really thick. Have you ever seen that studies show where there's two dudes, I think they call it dual survivor or something like dual survivor? I don't remember the Cody.

Speaker 3:          00:33:22       Cody a Landon or Landauer's, I dunno. Whatever homeboy's name is pig tails. Yeah. Yeah. He's got pigtails, big gorilla looking dude doesn't cold weather snow, I mean berries and stuff everywhere. I saw the one and because I'm trying to learn from those guys some survival stuff, which the pygmies no more than anybody, but um, while I'm here, you know, learning from that show and they did like the swamps of Louisiana or something and there's all these water moccasins and all this stuff and he's barefoot and there he, he's walking through and poisons fighters. And first time I saw him scared like he was, he was terrified walking through that. Yeah. One bite from one of those crazy fucking animals that live down there and you're done. You got a lot of that in the Congo as well. I've watched some documentaries in the Congo and then there's the only place in the world when they have spiders that move in packs.

Speaker 3:          00:34:08       No. Yeah, yeah. And then, uh, their aunts manner, pretty crazy. My buddy I took with me, um, he went to take a dump behind a tree and he put his, he put his back against the tree and he had these ants crawl up and just start biting them. Uh, like these ants though, make you bleed. They're, they're chompers on him. Like literally, um, what's, what's the most brutal part is they tried to find the softest spot to bite or something, they, with their sensors. And so whenever they came up my, my leg, uh, I didn't notice them because how fast they are. Uh, I didn't notice them until two were on my left nipple. And I was like pulling this thing off. And I mean, I'm having to pull the aunt out. And whenever I finally got it off, I literally was bleeding. Um, like just from a fucking aunt.

Speaker 3:          00:34:53       Yeah. And they travel in these things, like I'm talking about. They like roads. So sometimes the, the path that you're walking on, if it's a pygmy path, they're small. Really, really small. Sometimes the, the, it's wider than the path of ants. Like a, I mean like a road, a road of ants like this thick. And I mean the, the answer when like this, this long and about an inch long. Yeah. But there's millions of them that they make these roads that are wide. They answered goddamn terrifying. Yeah. And even really are Brian Callum, a good buddy of mine was working, I think in Borneo. I think you said it was, I forget where it was. It was in some jungle, but he said they would have to pose it in Congo. No, no. But they had to put Turpentine over the posts of the, they had a suspended tents put turpentine over the posts of the aunts didn't climb up them.

Speaker 3:          00:35:39       He said, well, when you were lying in bed at night, you would hear the ants walking through the forest. Yeah, absolutely. We can to them. You can hear him. Yeah. I mean that's the part, see, that's, that's why I know I'm passionate about this and that I really feel like this is my life's purpose because I don't, I don't like creepy crawlies. I don't like stuff like that man. And, uh, I think I sent a picture of a black Mamba. I almost stepped on a, and luckily the pygmies killed it. It was an angel. And uh, and it was, it was pretty crazy because all of a sudden I heard, I heard the hut next to me, which at this tribe was a chief and, uh, I heard his wife going nuts and I would sleep with a, I would actually sleep with the, Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       There it is. That's the Black Mamba and um, that almost got you. Yeah. It was like five or six feet long probably. Did you guys eat that thing? See, I thought about it and they, they, they see, they believe, they believe trees and snakes are their ancestors. And so even though they killed the snake, if it's a python, they won't kill it. They'll, they won't kill a python. They'll drag it to where it's safe. The only python I've heard of them killing was whenever they had gone fishing. And then they had it almost on like a stringer of sorts. And then a big python came by and took their fish. And then the guy was so mad he killed that python. Um, but the pygmies were mad at him for killing a python, uh, because they aren't poisonous. But the black Mambas, they know how dangerous they are.

Speaker 3:          00:37:00       I think it's like 20, 30 minutes and you're gone. And those things can get up to like eight or 10 feet long. And then the fastest snake in the world, one of the most venomous, so fastest, most aggressive, one of the longest. And uh, so it just seems like Congo man, like everything, there's some of the most beautiful places in the world. I mean, the mountains covered on the equator covered with, I mean, the most gorgeous trees. A silver back gorilla is, I mean, just some beautiful stuff there. But there were some gorillas in the wild. No, I haven't. I haven't, I think they said, I've heard we've heard them and we've heard definitely monkeys, but I haven't seen the guerrillas. Have you seen monkeys? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. A lot. Like, yeah, it's the Mohs cy, not the pygmies, but the Masa. I actually will target practice with their room.

Speaker 3:          00:37:43       Goos their clubs. They'll throw those at the monkeys. And so poor monkeys, the monkeys get no fucking slack. It's just like the pygmies, pygmies, the monkeys, the little guys get picked on. Yeah. And I actually, that, that, uh, Black Mamba that was up there, I heard them going nuts. And so whenever I got up and I crawl out of my hut, so, which I mean, those things for me to get inside, sometimes I have to be on my elbows. And so I start getting out of it and I'm like, what's going on? And I had a video of it and uh, I should cut it off right before I asked the question, but I didn't know what kind of snake it was. I thought Black Mambas were black, like just black. But it's actually their mouths when they open their mouths. It's like pitch black inside their mouth, even.

Speaker 3:          00:38:23       They're like, teeth are black. And so, um, that's how they got their name Black Mambas and so, uh, but they're, they're gray on top and then white on their belly. And so I didn't think it was a black Mamba at all. And so I was, uh, I, yeah, I was getting out of my hut and then I got slapped in the belly a and stopped and I didn't know what was going on until I got my phone on because it's pitch black. Yeah, man, that's the thing I almost stepped on and it's like 20 or 30 minutes and you're dead. Oh, what a creepy look in alien, like creature. They had only hit it in the back of the tail and so it was still slithering around. Actually, I'll pull up. Wow. I don't think I uploaded it to anywhere, but maybe my phone. So they won't eat these even though it's a source of protein hungry?

Speaker 3:          00:39:06       Nope, not at all edible though. Black Mama. I don't know about bike mama's. I know that the pythons are, uh, rattlesnakes are actually pretty tasty. Yeah, I think, I think if you cut it off far enough, far enough down from its head, then I bet it wouldn't be poisoned us, but they weren't going to eat it all, huh? Yeah. And then I, I asked on the right before this video, uh, cuts off. I ask if, uh, if it's poisonous and so, yeah. I don't know if I can, if I can email the sows or Pete. Pretty much everybody there must know somebody who's been killed by something natural in that area. Oh yeah. Whether it's a crocodile or whether it's a lion or whether it's whatever the hell else is out there. Yeah. The, the rivers close to the pygmies are full of crocodiles and hippos.

Speaker 3:          00:39:51       So crocodiles and hippos live in the same thing. Oh, pumps too, man. That's another problem, right. Only hippos kill more people leaving than crocodiles. Yeah. A lot more. I got a video of a hippos and crocodiles all in the same water hole and the hippos, we'll like swimming right next to the crocodiles and they don't give a fuck about the crocodiles and they remotely concerned. I don't think, I don't think hippos are concerned about anything. And I don't know if you know that, but they do like a bark. I mean it literally sounds like they're barking. Um, like a softer bark. Not so like, like doggish, but it sounds like a bark and that's how hippos like communicate and stuff. And so like in the morning and in the afternoon, like towards like the sunsetting and sun coming up, the hippos are barking. And so you hear that and hear a little leave house.

Speaker 3:          00:40:36       Yeah. And you hear these murderous giant pigs. Yeah. They're like thinking like a pig or cousin to a pig or some shit like that. Probably. Yeah, I think, I think, I think, and I think there's even like pygmy hippos. So, uh, like pygmy hippos picked me crocodiles, pygmy monkeys, which are like the size of your finger. Um, like my, like actual monkeys that are like donkeys and size of your finger. Are you anywhere near that area of the Congo? A, I think it's called [inaudible]. Do you know where that is? Bili Bi Loi. Benny is really close be in, I know that Zoe, I don't have if ever heard of a that chimpanzee that they found there. Oh, the one that's supposed to be massive. Uh, the, I've heard stories from the pygmies talking about a, uh, a like human type monk and not human type. They weren't talking about like big foot.

Speaker 3:          00:41:29       And if they were, I guess they were talking about me, but no, they, they, they talk about, uh, different kinds of animals and, but they all start about this scene, spirits and stuff like that. Right. But I mean, I've asked him about, I forget what they call it. There's like an actual, like, Swahili name that they call that, uh, that potential dinosaur of sorts. It's friend David Choe actually went out there looking for a long time ago for vice, it went for vice.com and he went to look in the Congo for like a brontosaurus. Wow. Well, it's so crazy. It's like there's a saying, the Congo was called the heart of darkness and uh, on the dark continent and the like, the pygmies I think are the ones that have the saying that it's, I can't really say it eloquent like they do, but it's called a, it's, they say like, it's basically hard for a fish to navigate through the rivers because of how thick everything is.

Speaker 3:          00:42:19       Um, and it's just hiking and everything is just, it's actually, I guess better to be a pygmy because it's, it's hard to move around, especially whenever you have like an 80 pound pack on your back. I'm trying to figure out how, how I'm going to go. I haven't sent this picture in, but that's a, that's part of the ways that we get through like 85 kilometers hiking and styles. So it's just so thick. Yeah. People tried some European, um, a nobleman tried to live there. They tried to settle into the Congo because there's such a vast amount of resources. They just figured, look, we'll just carve out a little place and then make a house. And the forest just swallowed it all up. They just couldn't keep off. Yeah. I think in the 18, late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds, that was whenever they went there for all the rubber and really slaughtered a lot of the Congolese.

Speaker 3:          00:43:08       And then, um, since then they came in for the golden diamonds and now they're there for the Colton. And you can go through whole colonial like, uh, like settlements that are from like, uh, the, from Belgium and other places that have settled there. And it's from like the early 19 hundreds, and it's just, uh, almost like ghost towns. Um, but they're like the Belgian colonization stuff and nobody lives there. Like trees are growing up through them and everything, but they're brick buildings and the Congolese don't live in brick buildings. A lot of them don't unless you're more towards the city. Wow. So, um, these pygmies that you talked to, had they seen that big giant chimpanzee at any of them? I don't know. I, whenever I, I heard lots of different stuff and normally they open up around the campfire at night. I would have to pretend sometimes to go to sleep, um, for the band to slave masters or the kids to leave.

Speaker 3:          00:44:02       And so Shalom University calls it Campfire University for the pygmies because they'll open up and there'll be real around the campfire. And, uh, they'll actually, cause if I ask him in front of, I had a chief, uh, of the band to come to me and welcome me. It will. First he was like, what do you want with my people? What do you want with my property? Uh, and then he, and then I told him I was just there to learn. Um, I was with the university where they're learning, doing research and just here to, to help and benefit. And then he gave me an egg. Um, he told me he had a gift for me. And, uh, so he gave me just one single egg. Uh, it wasn't until, and I was so grateful and thankful because, you know, he gave me a gift and I was gonna be able to eat it and everything else.

Speaker 3:          00:44:45       And as I'm cooking it, uh, and, and the pygmies are helping me cook it, uh, and after I eat it, um, they finally tell me around the campfire after I had pretended to go to sleep and then got up to come back around the campfire to talk for hours until we fall asleep around the campfire. They finally told me that the egg they gave me wasn't the Bantu chiefs. It was the pygmy chiefs and the pygmy chief had saved that to give to me because he heard that a visitor was coming. And so the Bantu chief like just, you know, took his gift, completely, stole it and acted like it was his, uh, and really it was the pygmy chief and he was giving me everything that he had to give me because that's food for them, like foods, foods, their livelihood. Um, and that was a clean source of food.

Speaker 3:          00:45:28       And, uh, so yeah, it's just, it's pretty messed up how they treat them. Wow. That's, so, that's gotta be so strange for you to be around both of them, to be around the band to people. And do you, do you try to communicate that there's, there's something wrong with this? Yeah, absolutely man. And uh, so in six of the places I went to, they referred to them as, these are my slaves, these are my people. These are my property, kind of of sorts. Three of the places I went that were even deeper in the jungle, they said, what do you want with my animals? Because they believe them to be so low class like that. I see a man, the, the, the tribes that surround me, it's, it, most of it spanned too. Sometimes it's rebel. Sometimes it's other tribes. Uh, but they, they treat them worse than they treat their cattle.

Speaker 3:          00:46:12       Then they treat their, well, they don't have cattle, but they have goats. And I don't know if that falls into cattle category, but, uh, but they treat their goats better than they treat pygmies. That's insane. And they've always done this. This is just, well the pygmies used to never have to depend on the band too. So this is why, I mean on the Ugi some people have really been, uh, they're really interested and they'd been trying to find out what kind of slavery there is and the slaves that we've been able to set free. They weren't in shackles and they weren't held at gunpoint. Like, I don't know how to do that with the rebels yet. Maybe in the year I'm there. Um, I can befriend them. Like I had to befriend the slave masters, so they would want to learn and stuff. Um, and so with the band to people, we just had to sit there and say like, Hey, you know, these are people.

Speaker 3:          00:46:57       Like I'm an educated guy from the United States. I'm not really that educated. But uh, but the Shalom university guys, those four guys I'm with to have masters degrees and to have doctorates. So they're really educated and they're the ones leading the university. So I'm like, these guys are, are, are knowledgeable and, and, and I came from us. These are actually people like fully human beings. And the band two eyes would get big like what? And then they'll see us treating them like humans, treating them like they have value treating them like, you know, they're, they're like, like they should be treated. Right. Um, and so it starts to, to change some of the things in, in the pygmies are more slave to the band through circumstance. They used to not depend on them. They used to be hunters and gatherers and not have to worry about it.

Speaker 3:          00:47:37       But whenever I can see the sun at times, and it sounds like this earth quaking thunder going on all throughout the day, thunder going on, but I see the sun, it's not raining on me. I'm like, why is there thunder? And then we finally get close enough to where we see some of the deforestation going on. And these are, these are trees that you could drive to Mack trucks through, you know, and, and, and they're cutting these trees down. And whenever those things fall, it sounds like thunder. And so the animals just flee. I mean, and, and I think, I think last I heard and I don't know that it's scientific, maybe someone can find it, but uh, but I think they said that the deforestation in the Congo, the second largest rain forest in the world, um, is up to the size of Texas or over Texas and the last like 15, 20 years less 1520 years, man, they've divorced, did the size of Texas and I've seen it, I've gone to places where it's just big, lush, awesome forest and then you go to this place and it's just like wrecked and it goes from like looking like the rain forest and now it's looking like this might turn into like deserty kind of stuff because like they've just, it's barren and no one does any or makes any attempt to replenish the forest.

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       No, not all. And see that is why the rain forest conservationists, the wildlife preservationist are getting involved in ways that they're trying to buy up that lane and protect it. And I agree with that. That's why I feel like what, what Shalom is wanting to do and what I'm wanting to partner with them. It's a, it's a all encompassing thing where it's like human slave liberation. It's a rain forest preservation and wildlife conservation. It's, it's, it's attractive to all those people. There must be a tremendous amount of money that they're making from those trees though. No. Oh, massive amounts. I mean, some of those are very rare woods. Uh, other things that they're using it for is, uh, his charcoal that seeing the Congo, since they don't have like electric electric plants and things like that, they have to cook for them to cook. If they burn up wood, it's not as long lasting or as hot as charcoal.

Speaker 3:          00:49:36       So I have a picture of a woman that was a slave for charcoal and, um, she had to, her slave master put this bag of maybe 120 pounds minimum. I mean, the bag of charcoal was taller than she was. I mean, a pygmy woman is, is small. Um, I don't know if you can pull up the one chai booze Sicu, the picture that says [inaudible]. Um, but I mean these are small people and they're carrying bags of charcoal where two slave masters put it on their back, tie a rope around their head and this woman having to walk four or five kilometers on these little paths carrying this charcoal and they'll cut down the trees to make charcoal. They'll cut them down and they'll start a fire and, but they'll put like dirt over the fire and it smolders and it, I don't know if it's a week long process or a few day long process, but it makes it just a long burning.

Speaker 3:          00:50:24       And so that's how most people cook in the, and in Rwanda and in Uganda and in Burundi and those places we'll get charcoal from the Congo jungle cause there's so much wood, they don't even think about it. Wow. Yeah. What a fucking trip. So these, these poor people that are, are just recently slaved. Hmm. These, uh, these poor people, these poor pig beans. Before that they, they were, they were able to hunt and gather the, able to do everything where they treat it as people. Then, uh, I would say there are treated a lot better, but still they've never been believed to be, um, fully human. They've always thought of them as Subhuman, part monkey, part, um, part man. And uh, the thing is that with the Bantu, uh, the relationship, the band too and pygmies used to have is they would trade, the pygmies were master hunters and they still are a, if there was more wildlife, this was a specialty, but they would go hunt bushmeat and then they would come to the band.

Speaker 3:          00:51:29       What's bushmeat emotionally like? Uh, some monkeys, um, uh, also antelope and uh, just anything wild game inside of, so that's try CQ that you just put up. That's my mom and the tribe. Oh, it sounds so grown woman. Yeah, she's in her mid forties. She's probably as old as my mom is 46. So that's taboo seeker and she's awesome. She, that was her first picture ever taken of her. So I have some other ones where she smiling, but that, that's the one that shows her, uh, her size. So that's how they got their name p pygmy, which is elbow height. So they really are just like the bullied people of the world. Yeah. And he's bullied people the world. I mean there was times that I've gotten sick to my stomach hearing the stories that have happened to them. And that's what I was saying, that they would go hunt and then they would come to the edge of the forest where the band to are and the band to grow corn, grow, grow beans.

Speaker 3:          00:52:22       And they would basically want some side dishes to go with their meat. And so they would trade sometimes like the, the, the wild plants that they would gather and they would come and trade. They're either bushmeat or they're hunted animals and they're different kinds of like mushrooms and stuff. And they'd trade it with the band to peoples for some corn or beans or rice or a cassava leafs, which I can make a Ugalde out of. Um, it's like kind of paste like thing that takes on the flavor of the meat. And they would do it had a trading relationship. Sometimes band two would go find the pygmies because they wanted some meat and they weren't the best shepherds. And so they could grow the corn and beans, but they wanted to meet. And so that's how the relationship started. And then they started to get exploited whenever they could no longer hunt.

Speaker 3:          00:53:07       Like they, they, they, they really can. Um, the animals started fleeing, uh, in the wildlife conservationist and rainforest preservationists. Preservationists are trying to push them towards the road. They made a bunch of promises. Uh, I mean a lot of these NGOs that had their special interest would promise the pygmies, if you go off the deep forest, if you let us have this, um, we'll take care of you whenever you're closer to the road. We'll make sure you you're taking care of. And then they just never took care of him. Uh, and then the band to buy up the land from underneath them and then in slave and say, you're on our land, you work at. And so it's just kind of a whole crazy, how does people feel about you taking off going to America to, to let everybody know about them and then flying back again?

Speaker 3:          00:53:53       Mean he's this, uh, this must be so bizarre for them. Yeah. Well, that's what's crazy at first, every, all the night, well, I've been to more than nine, but the last time I went I went to nine different tribes and of pygmies, a little nine villages, each one of them. I'd never seen a white dude before. Uh, so that scares them. I mean, there'd be times that it would take an hour, maybe even sometimes a little over an hour before someone in that tribe. Most of the time it was always women or children, uh, that would finally come up to me and touch me to make sure they don't go through me like I was a spirit or a ghost of some sort. Um, and then once one person felt me and I'd play a game with them or something like that, then more would, I mean literally come out from hiding behind trees, come out from, uh, from the forest. Whenever I come in, sometimes they would flee, run, cry kids like flailing on the ground, like just freaked out by me. Um, but whenever I'd make friends with them, uh, then they would ask me one thing, every place that I went and all nine tribes, they asked me will I help them have a voice? That was the thing. They were like, we have no voice here. They're the only tribe not allowed to have their citizenship, um, in Congo and like, so they have zero voice. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:55:08       What a strange turn your life has taken. That this is a, you've gone from being on the house and the ultimate fighter, you know, competing in the heavyweight version of the show to now live in a grass hut in the Congo. What a, that's a string or a leaf, hod rather strange journey you're on, man. Yeah, to be honest, I wouldn't change it. I mean with, especially with this video going viral and with a, yesterday, um, US talking about a book deal and, and today I went out to, uh, to lunch with a publicist that will really worked on the blind side and the movie invincible. And, uh, I forget some other big time blockbusters that he worked on. But, uh, I mean people are saying that this is a kind of crazy story and the whole thing is the Sandra Bullock movie, man. There we go.

Speaker 3:          00:55:58       I'm going to have her, I'm gonna have her play me my is Justin a chick? Yeah. Yeah. Well we pulled it and uh, he was more likely to believe that it will more vulnerable situations. You get this giant MMA fighter go into the Congo, kicking people's asses then ain't right. Yeah. Yeah. No, me and I just, the, the wild turn is man, I just feel like it's, it's something that I can be fully, wholeheartedly passionate about and I'm, I'm fulfilled doing it. And uh, and when I say they're my family, I mean it seemed very, very sincere. How old are you, Justin? 25. So this is a good time. You don't have kids, you don't have responsibilities. You can, you can go and just follow your, your desire and your passion and your, your, your interest here as the only thing that really, I mean, I have a future wife and uh, got to find her.

Speaker 3:          00:56:49       What's that? You got to find her. I have her in Dallas Fort Worth, right. She's in Dallas and you're going to the fucking Congo for a year. So how does she think about that at first? Well, at first she was pumped. Then, uh, she, she's done like some different trips around the world and has gone and helped a orphanages and Mexico and she kind of has a heart to maybe one day started an orphanage. Um, and so she's got a great heart man. She's awesome. She's gorgeous. Um, but, uh, the s the first time I went, um, I went one time before we started dating and then the second time I went, uh, it was, it was hard. It was hard for her because she started doing some research, started finding out that, uh, the Congo leaves, people call it the African Holocaust, that's what they call it.

Speaker 3:          00:57:33       Um, because depending on what stats you look at, they say it surpasses, uh, the death of death toll of the Jews and the Holocaust, which is pretty crazy. But some stats say 6.8 million Congolese and the last 10 years, some say over 5 million, but it's between 5 million. And 7 million men. Um, and so it, it really is like one of the, if not the, it is the worst conflict zone last year in 2012 because then she was saying, maybe I'll go with you. And I was like, yeah, and then, uh, maybe, uh, we'll, we'll, uh, we'll talk about that. And uh, but the staff for 2012 was that over 400,000 women were raped in the Congo. It's 58 women every 60 minutes. So, uh, you can't bring your woman to the Connoco, especially not kind of, it was the most dangerous Walmart parking lot in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:58:23       Uh, and so it's, uh, it's, it's been a crazy journey. It's made us both grow a lot in a relationship to, um, me being gone for that month there and her, you know, sitting there and thinking about, am I okay? Cause I know contact. Um, so all this different stuff. We, we've really been on a journey and we were talking about even getting married before I went, and then now we're, we're talking about waiting until I get back from the year. But it's just something I know I got to do. Are you going to come back at all during that year? So far, no. I mean like spring. Greg stirred, actually my girlfriend's sister's getting married and a, I might want to come back for that. But uh, but so far, no. And it depends on my visa. Luckily with Shalom university I might be able to get like a student visa.

Speaker 3:          00:59:06       Uh, I might be able to do something with a school to get a year long visa, but if I can't get to your long be something, I'd have to come back. And you have no income while you're doing all that? No, man, I have the last year and a half, man. I've honestly felt like I was just a nut. Like, well not enough. I knew it was right, but I felt like a lone nut. Like everybody, people be like, oh, that's really good, but why don't you go back to fighting? Uh, I mean, I've worn my last three fights and then I took some time off to go see the world and see what people I could fight for. And I couldn't find anyone better to fight for them, the pygmies because they're the worst off people group on the planet. And, uh, but yeah, man, it's, it's been a crazy journey, you know, from people, a family, from close friends all see.

Speaker 3:          00:59:45       And I'm an idiot for given up fighting and I could actually do it well and, um, at grudge training center, going from, from being invited thereafter, the ultimate fighter to then being kicked off of it when I was a drug addict to then being invited back onto it. Uh, and then, um, me saying, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to leave and go, go here. And then they'll be like, what are you doing? You know, uh, my coach Trevor Whitman, he's awesome. I love that dude, Bro. He's one of the best guys I know as a person too. He's just incredible. Him and his wife, a big giving hearts. And we, uh, we set up three different hospital visits for the, for grudge fight team. I was, uh, official volunteer at the Denver Children's hospital. So we went there three different times as official, like whole team.

Speaker 3:          01:00:28       Um, and so that was great. That was how I started showing them, Hey, I've really made a life change here. I'm no longer the drug addict that was coming in here. And, uh, and I mean we're actually a depressed drunk drug addict. Tried to take my own life, all this different stuff. And what were you, what were you addicted to? Was addicted to a bunch of pills, a bunch of pain pills. I had three different doctors that would, that would give me scripts. And, uh, I had one doctor that would give me a hundred at a time and I could go to all three of a hundred at a time. No joke. Which pills? Uh, well, hydrocodone a lot. But then also, um, I even gotten into like harder stuff like on, is that Vikatin? Yeah. And then, and then, uh, and then oxy and oxy is the hardest, right?

Speaker 3:          01:01:03       Yeah, Bro. I don't, I don't remember two to two and a half months of my life. Like just, there's no memories except for there's one hazy memory and was from my best friend at the time and we're, we're building that relationship back. But, uh, uh, my best friend at the time, the guy that got me into fighting and then my first fight was because he was in the hospital and, uh, and he couldn't make it to the fight. He had a staph infection where they almost thought he was going to lose his, that his leg. It was that bad in a lot of guys get that. Oh Man. Yeah. And he got, he got, he got put to the side, like they literally thought we might have to take his leg. It was deep and do as like, oh, they thought it might've been in his femur bone.

Speaker 3:          01:01:39       So he's laid up man. And uh, and then I went to the, to the promoter, told him he's out. Then the guy started talking trash. He just ended up in the hospital one day early and the promoter had watched me wrestle. It was an Oklahoma. And so he knew my high school wrestling coaches who are both two Olympic gold medalist, both wrestled Oklahoma state were national champions there. Kenny Monday and Kendall Cross and uh, Kenny money fund MMA for a while. Yeah. Yeah. He was one of my training partners to whenever I was in coaches whenever I was fighting. Um, he's been a coach of mine since I was 15 years old. Uh, and then, yeah. Anyways, the guy, uh, his name's Justin McCorkle, I think he's like a foreign one, pro MMA heavyweight. And um, yeah, I missed his wedding, not just being there, but being the best man.

Speaker 3:          01:02:23       And I remember I had an eight minute voicemail and meet at like 10 seconds through because it said something like, you missed my wedding. And then I'm like, oh, freak, you know, and then it paused and he goes, you miss being my best man. Uh, and then I just remember hanging up because, and going straight back to the drugs. And so I'm a medical marijuana license for three years, which I'm cool with people having that. But I went with, I would always piggyback everything. Like I would, the reason grudge voted me off the team was I started waking up and fixing my steel cut oats, fixing my egg whites, getting my berries, putting in the steel cut oats, um, fixing all that. But then, uh, starting on my vaporizer before practice and then hitting a, the pain pills and then starting with a washing it down with hard liquor man.

Speaker 3:          01:03:08       And so then I go train and they knew it. They knew I sweated out love out of my poor was coming liquor. Um, they knew that. I mean, how would you bro, I don't know. I mean I was going through a literal, when I say depression, I mean like the darkest, deepest, um, most desperate time of my life. And what was that being caused by? Um, selfishness. I don't know, man. A lot of different things that, that didn't, uh, it didn't make sense to me. I grew up at 13 years old. I was, I was heavily bullied. That's when I found the UFC. Uh, 13, I sat at the lunch table by myself, had people throw stuff at me. I, uh, I was invited to my middle school crushes like a birthday party and, uh, and it was a costume party. I got the invitation.

Speaker 3:          01:03:56       I'm like, no ways costume party wins a prize. And I remember her dad worked for Dr Pepper and, um, she loved transformer. So I came to the party as a Dr Pepper transformer, like with the Dr Pepper Cardboard and made out of a made out of duct tape and Dr Pepper boxes. And, uh, I got there and I was 30 minutes late. Everyone's pointing, laughing, calling me an idiot. And that was whenever I was probably, I guess maybe in the first fight of my life, uh, was suicidal thoughts cause they were like, you're so worthless. You should just kill yourself. Um, 13 old. Oh yeah. I mean I left there. Oh, I there no cell phones. So I walked and I got to dairy queen. I lived in the country, so we like that. They call that the Texas stop sign, dairy queen. And, uh, and so, uh, I went to dairy queen and, uh, I, I think I remember one of the, uh, employees, I'm coming out to throw away trash and I'm like sitting there behind the dairy queen right in between kind of the dumpster.

Speaker 3:          01:04:51       And then they're like, what's going on? And I was just sobbing. And then I went inside and called my mom. She wasn't there for a little bit and had to sit in there. They asked what was going on anyways, so that was this big left turn. But that's when I found the UFC. And I thought maybe a few weeks after that, and I thought, these guys don't get bullied. Uh, these guys are like modern day gladiators. Um, I, I, and I was, I mean, I was mesmerized by the sport of it because I loved sports and I always played sports growing up. Um, but this was multiple sports putting one. And I'm like, man, if I could just become one of those guys, I'll have all the passion, the purpose, the significance, the, I'll never be this dude that I am right now. And, uh, I'll, I'll be the exact opposite.

Speaker 3:          01:05:31       And so I set out for that and started at 15. So wrestling under two Olympic gold medalist, 17 won my first national championship. 18 was living back and forth with the Olympic training center. 19 started fighting professionally. 21 I was on the ultimate fighter 22, um, fight in 23. It was main event at the hard rock and another promotion. And I think every time I got my hand raised and it got worse as this drug problem got on. But, uh, uh, I stopped looking forward to even the victories of fighting and start looking forward to the parties after the fight. And then I started thinking like, uh, I don't know, every time I get my hand raised, uh, if you can find a picture of me or a video of me smiling after a fight, that would be the first for me because I don't think I smiled after any of them.

Speaker 3:          01:06:13       Wow. I was always looking towards the next one. You know, most guys jumping up, smile and screaming. When was your issue with, with drugs? Was it after the ultimate fighter? But it was, it was before and after. It got really bad after and I mean it got brutal after I, uh, actually the, the week of my job, I don't know if I've ever, I told Loretta hunting this, I'm a couple of days, I did an interview for sports illustrated and uh, um, the week of my John Madsen fight I was taking handfuls of pills and I was uh, in, in, in some guys can function, um, and, and fight and everything. Me Though, I would piggy back everything if I got, if I got high, I needed, I needed the pills or I needed a drinker. I never did one thing that was my, that was a huge problem of mine.

Speaker 3:          01:06:59       I always piggyback that I had to have something else and so I was doing that the week of my John Madsen fight for the finale. And while you were there, how was high that week and the pain pills like lots of pain pills like the day before? I didn't the night, the day of how did you not test positive? They didn't, they didn't test me on that one. They tested me when I fought at the hard rock. But at that one they didn't task, they only tested the main events. I think that was the time that there was a commission. Yeah. Or even the, I think the commission hit a time where they didn't test everybody on the card. They were only gonna do like the main event fights or something like that. And then I was kind of in that window. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy, man. What, what would happen if they did test you?

Speaker 3:          01:07:39       Oh, I would've failed big time, which is like a lot of the other guys do. But I mean, not a lot of the biggest, so you knew you weren't going to be tested. Is that why you were kept taking the pills? I honestly, yeah, I would have taken him anyway. I didn't care. I never did any sort of steroids. Never. I already, I already felt empty enough, I guess with some of the victories. And I think whenever we got real bad was after that Roy Nelson fight on the ultimate fighter and Dana and rampage and Rashad and coach t and basically everybody except Roy. Um, was telling me that it should have, well that I won or that it should have gone to a third round at least because I think one judge thought want to thought he won. It was a split and we only went two rounds.

Speaker 3:          01:08:18       And for me this was my dream. And uh, and so whenever that was taken from me and I felt like it was taken in a wrong way, then what really got bad was after the Mattson fight, um, I lost a split decision again. So two back to back. I just, I lost it and I went straight. I mean, I don't even remember that we can Vegas. What started you off on pills in the first place? Well, it was it an injury this right here. Um, so do you know how many times I've heard that man will guy gets injured? Is doctor puts them on pills? Carl [inaudible] same story. Went off the deep end. How goddamn addicted or the addictive or these pills and it just got handed them out to, I remember, uh, a bit about my mom would confirm it, but, uh, whenever this happened, I was 18 and I was living at the Olympic training center and I wrestled a against the world champion.

Speaker 3:          01:09:08       I didn't give up a point. It was kind of like I could have given up a point, it would have been similar to, could have tapped or let it snap, but I just didn't want to give up a point. So I let him and snap and uh, anyways, I probably took at least a month worth of the oxycodone and a week after that I went back. Probably took three weeks worth. What happened next with arm? What position was it in? It was just wrestling, Greco Roman wrestling. So, uh, have you ever seen a gut wrench like short Recko how they go to turn somebody? Um, so I was fighting it, the post explaining to people who don't know anything. I was, I was a on my belly. A guy who maybe took me down and, and once he's on your back, he goes to do a gut wrench. She wraps around your ribs and he starts to crank down with his shoulder on the back of your shoulder blades.

Speaker 3:          01:09:51       You're trying to fight it so your back doesn't break 90, it breaks 90 degrees and in your back angles towards the Mat, the guy gets two points or maybe you one point sometimes. Uh, but I didn't want to have my, uh, backbreaking 90 to where he get any points. So just let it keep fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting. And I tried to to do this hot thing and whenever I went to do the hop hit, that's whenever all his weight came down on it. Super Experience Guy. He's like 33, 34 and I was 18 at the Olympic training center where he was world champion and Olympic bronze or silver medalist and it just snapped it whenever it snapped and went completely behind my back. One of my buddies at the Olympic training center puked because of it. And uh, so I was laying on it completely behind my back.

Speaker 3:          01:10:32       Like if I was on the bet, the mat right now is completely behind my back, except it was this way. So it was show part of this whole part of my heart is wicked. This whole part of my arm was under my back, so it broke it, it dislocated it and it tore the old Neri collateral ligament. Um, so they did a nerve transposition. So I have no more funny bone. Uh, they moved it to where it's right here. So if I talk on the phone too long, these three nerves go numb or I'm sorry, these three fingers go numb. Uh, and then they took a, they were going to do, is it a cadaver? Cadaver? Cadaver. Cadaver. So they were going to use a cadaver nerves that Zombie show? No, no. For the torn ligament, the UCL, the ordinary collateral. But then instead they use the, uh, there's like three tendons in your hamstring that are kind of like this.

Speaker 3:          01:11:19       And he took the center one out and they said a tendon is stronger than the ligament. And like, we want to put some strong in there. If you're wanting to be an Olympic caliber athlete, um, and they said that that was actually maybe a harder chance for it to, to take, um, but it was the best chance to take instead of a cadaver, which might be weaker, smaller person than your body could reject it. Right. Dominick Cruz nine brutal blows it out, has to do it all over again. Yup. And so they, they wanted to use that tending cause of stronger, and he said, and it's going to be from your leg. And he goes, and you want to fight Sunday? And I go, yeah. And he said, well, this will be like you're kicking someone in the face then. And I'm like, okay, that sounds pretty sweet.

Speaker 3:          01:11:55       Uh, but yeah, so that's whenever the drug problem probably started. I remember I was, I was piggy back and even then, um, kind of started going into depression because I thought, man, did I just lose my Olympic dreams and my MMA dreams? Uh, so, and I was doing all the oxycodone. The how old were you at this time when you hurt yourself? 18. 18. Yeah. So you're 18 years old. No drug problem before. No, get on the pills. And I had smoked some weed before and I drank, but not as never, no nothing where I had to have anything. People in my family that have had the same issue, guy got injured and all of a sudden taking pills for his back and he's a fucking loser now. I mean, he's just gone. It was a normal guy and now he's a loser. And I've met so many people that know somebody that has that same story or that have that same story and then like you pulled themselves out of it.

Speaker 3:          01:12:41       It's so terrifying. It's so terrifying how they're just handing out some of the most addictive medication that the world has ever known. That that really is what it is. It's brutal, man. I, I owe and it's heroin. Yeah. And I know drive on it. I would a man I, and I know that's, hey, you should have that reaction. I, I have that reaction to me now looking back at my life and, and, and just, I mean, I dunno, thank God that I didn't, I didn't kill somebody or a family or, but I remember the time that I really wanted to end it. I just took a handful of the hydrocarbons. Um, I was taking Adderall to, uh, I, and then I was, uh, drinking straight. I'm actually, I didn't drink it straight, but I had it, uh, in a Sonic Cup, but it was ever clear, like a strawberry slushy up, brutal and knows how to party.

Speaker 3:          01:13:28       I told you about the, he's got a dead pig on his shoulder. I got to hang out with. And then I was, I had my tinctures. Tinctures are, yeah. And so I had those and um, and so I just took it all and driving and I blacked out. Oh yeah. What a confusion. Your mind, you had a civil war going on in your brain? I did. And I blacked out driving and, uh, I do what? I've been so low that have woke up in a drug house up in kind of a outside on the outskirts of summit county. Um, and uh, it will, you still usually live in boulder? Yeah. Yeah. So you know where summit county is then with like Breckenridge and keystone. So we'll go up on me and I loved it. Yeah. I wish, uh, yeah, I'm in Texas right now, so Congo is going to be beautiful too, but I miss scholar is another level.

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       Yeah. It goes a different level of life. It's like so vibrant and green, rainy and everything that, I don't know if you know this, this is a completely different subject. But in Uganda, right on the border of where I'm at, there's, it's on the equator is the jungle. Um, but there's mountains that are so high that there, I think the only, uh, glaciers that you can find on the equator. So there's like actual glaciers in Uganda, in Africa on the equation, the equator right outside the jungle. That, so there's glaciers. That's insane. Yeah. So anyways, that's completely random. What made you straighten up? What made you sober up? I knew I was going to die. Well, that was one thing. Uh, how did you do and you clean up?

Speaker 3:          01:14:59       Uh, for me personally, um, I had this guy that that was just brutal man. He a brutal in a way. Like he was relentless. He was just coming after me, man, saying that I had a purpose to live for, um, saying that, you know, uh, he told me this and I remember, I'll always remember this is my buddy named Jeff Donkey. He'll probably be watching this. He's an awesome dude. Man has a great family, great wife, great kids. Um, and he told me, Justin, you're in the battle for your life. Like if you, this life is a battle ground, not a playground. If you treat it like a playground, you will lose the battle. And then he started talking like, what's your game plan for victory here? And I'm like, man, I got a perfect game plan, right? Like, I mean, thank God that guy didn't find Brian. You'd be like, well, I'm no, no, I'm not. No, no battle. I'm here to play. Fuck. What am I going to lose? That eating too much pussy.

Speaker 3:          01:15:57       And so he told, he told you that you have to find your purpose. Yeah, he said I had to find a purpose and that I had a purpose. What does this gentleman do? Um, he's a Roofer, so he's a childhood friend and uh, not, uh, actually he's even older. Like I had some family friends in a debt, a guy that was like a second dad to me and his kids are some of my best friends. And um, and Jeff was kind of in that, that core group, but he had heard through the grapevine, uh, that my mom had come and checked on me and that like two and a half period. And I think my, my dad might've came, but, uh, but she had broken into my house that was in color and not broken in, but she just was able to get through the back door, saw the drug, saw the pills, saw how has living, and it looked like hoarders or just just filthy.

Speaker 3:          01:16:41       Um, and so she knew that he might be one guy that could get to me and get through to me. And so he called me every single day for two months. I mean called me, left me a voicemail, text me and email me and was pissing me off. Man. I was getting livid with them. And then whenever I got kicked off a grudge, I got up to my phone and it got out to my car. I was like an angry tears. I didn't know what to do. Um, because like I was living my dream, but it was a nightmare and my dream was reality. But it was literally a nightmare. Right? You're living your dream as a competitive MMA fighter, but you're also a drug. I had, I had transform successfully, I guess we can go back that I transformed successfully from that 13 year old loser that was invited to the parties.

Speaker 3:          01:17:21       And now I was that maybe quote unquote modern day gladiator, ultimate fighter, mixed martial artist and uh, and somehow I wasn't fulfilled. Somehow I was a depressed drug addict and um, and whenever I got to my car, I had a text message, voicemail, all this other stuff then want to hear from him. But the text message said this was when your iPhone, it didn't just say text message on it, it would say like the actual message and on the actual message on the screen it said check her email, checked my email. The very first thing said a game plan for victory. Um, and then whenever I opened it up it said the best thing you'll ever do in your life. Uh, and it was a trip that was paid for and I thought it was maybe like a a detox detox kind of thing or a rehab or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:18:08       So I was interested in, I just got kicked off of grudge. I think Trevor was the only guy, maybe Brendan? No, I think there was like 30 guys or something. They got there early to vote on the day of sparring to vote if I stay a part of the team because some of the guys that had it with me and Ti, coach t brought me into his office and he said, Bro, like we can't have our name attached to you anymore. Like, I'm the only guy that once you still a party, I could veto it. Maybe I'm the head coach, but I'm not going to go against the guys and grudges. Unique man, because grudges, it's a family. I mean, then what I mean like it's, it's like the, I think for Elliot Marshall, we threw a surprise baby shower for him. I mean, in fighters throwing a baby shower for a fighter, you know, like that's just not normal.

Speaker 3:          01:18:53       And a lot of fight gyms are there. A bunch of gym hoppers and a bunch of selfish dudes and they're never going to give the coach to the money or they're never gonna. They're gonna try to knock out their training partners. Like we, we just worked like a head cookouts together, all this different stuff. But I was the one guy that was a, that was the problem. And uh, they voted me off and so me and I was just, I was empty. I felt like, man, now my dream or my nightmare, but my dream now that's even ripped away from me. So now I had nothing,

Speaker 1:          01:19:18       you know? I know that you've gone through some growth as a human, as a man, some spiritual development and character building and all that. But I can't help but be terrified at how smart you are and how to gather and passionate you are. But yet you still got hooked by these fucking pills. Those goddamn things scare the shit out of me. And I know you were a younger man at the time and you didn't, you didn't have the life experiences that you have now, but you're not a loser. So the fact that you got just sucked up into it like that, it's, it's so terrifying to me.

Speaker 3:          01:19:50       Yeah. I mean, they're, they're dangerous man. I think they should. I don't know how they could, they could, uh, watch it better. You know? I mean, I, I shouldn't be able to go to three different doctors and have one given me a hundred at a time. I mean, you know what I mean, hundred, this is going to Colorado. Yeah. At least they have. I mean, I literally just go to three different pharmacies, three different doctors, three different doctors to be, that was the whole topic of a vanguard show called the oxycontin express. Oh, I was on it. I was off the board at the man. I was taking the train. It's about Florida. It's Florida. Had these things calls up pain management centers where you would go to a doctor and the doctor would say, what's wrong? I hurt my back. What? You need a prescription for pain pills.

Speaker 3:          01:20:32       So the doctor writes it in the same facility right next to that, you leave the doctor's door. The next door is the pharmacy that only sells oxycontin. You go in there and you buy pain pills and they have these fucking pain management centers and they're all over the place. So you essentially have these oxycontin addicts waiting in line it, all these parking lots to get into these places. And the places was filled. They were filled with poor people that were just hooked on these goddamn pills. And I think, I think for me, uh, uh, mean I appreciate you saying like, you know, you're not a loser. Smart guy or whatever. I think it's true. I mean, I'm listening to you talk, you're, you're obviously a smart guy. Well, I appreciate that. I think that worked in my advantage for my problem. Uh, I, if that makes sense.

Speaker 3:          01:21:12       Like, it, it, it, it fed it. I was able to justify it, justify owning also, but to the doctors even like articulate it, I wasn't the same kind of guy they would classify as we got to watch this guy. He's a professional fighter. He does have a bum elbow. He's got a back problem. He, uh, yeah, we can trust this guy. What was your back problem? I actually, in my last fight, I a herniated one disk and I bulged another. And so I have a, I have an x ray that they have a messed up, uh, actually a bunch from the, mainly it was the thoracic, the thoracic, and then one or two of the lumbar. But, um, I have a x ray of, from those pain management places. I think I had six different disk where they put these, uh, injections into my spine of Cortisone, kind of like cortisone.

Speaker 3:          01:22:04       I'm trying to think of some sort of steroid a little time for absolutely. That was brutal because I was supposed to be in a twilight kind of sleep and I woke up during it because he hit something and I just remembered just ah, uh, and then they put some more in me and I was out. But yeah, I had a boss and in here yesterday and his, his right arm, it's like shriveled away because of a neck injuries cause the disc injuries. I used to get stingers all the time from wrestling. So it's so amazing how many guy you have a bulging disc now and my neck and uh, it's amazing talking to how many guys talking to people, asking how many guys also have the same injury or a similar injuries were in their lower back or in the middle backer. It's fucking everybody.

Speaker 3:          01:22:44       Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah. And I mean, it's easy if you want to get, if you want to get it, uh, you know, fund your or whatever, find your addiction and you want to find a way to feed that and you can, if you want to find something to take a pill for it, they'll, they'll, they'll get you. Absolutely. Even one of my doctors was an Iowa, so two, we're in Colorado. One was an Iowa. We won't go there, man. That's a, that's terrifying shit. But it's a, for a lot of people out there that might be struggling with that very problem right now listening to this, you know, hearing you that you were able to pull yourself out of it, I guarantee you, you can inspire people to do the same when they can realize they listen to you and go, I want to be that guy.

Speaker 3:          01:23:27       I don't want to be this guy that I'm now a slave to his bottle of pills that I have to figure out how to get every week. You know? I feel like that's one of the reasons I have that connection to the pygmies. Like, I wasn't a slave to a band too, but I've bet I've definitely been a slave to something. Uh, and, and so yeah, if there is somebody that's watching me and that you can get out of it because, um, there's definitely hope. How did you, how did you do it? Did you go cold Turkey? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I actually, I went, I ended up going on that, uh, that kind of retreat of sorts with my buddy and he just loved on me, man, in a way that, uh, it was genuine. It was authentic. Where was the retreat? What did you guys do?

Speaker 3:          01:24:07       Have you ever heard of the hallmark family or hallmark cards? Sure. I know they're big in Texas. I don't know if they're not sure, but it was actually their house or their ranch. Um, and it was, they kind of donated this ranch to be for all walks of life, um, kind of all beliefs and for people to come there. And, uh, it was a vision of this one guy that, that wants to just have a place where people's lives can be changed and stuff. Man, there's these, there's like 20, 30 guys that said that they are not that said, but they literally went to war for me in my, in my life and told me how to life worth living. And it was, it was awkward, kind of, not awkward, but just right. At first I was like, what's up here? This is crazy. Um, but for me, I had a, I had a radical change, man.

Speaker 3:          01:24:50       It wasn't a, it wasn't a, it wasn't a slow process. It was like I finally realized I have a life worth living, um, in my life can be for a bigger purpose than myself. Then getting what I want when I want it. Um, I can make a contribution to this planet, to this world, to people. Um, I can not just fight against people. I can fight for people. And that's what it was demonstrated in front of me at this retreat. Um, and I'm, I'm not man. I have my own personal beliefs. Everyone does, man. Uh, but this was a, it was a Christian retreat and for me it changed my life, man. Because, uh, these men weren't like, because Bro, if you want to go into some jacked up religious background, I got it. I've got a jacked up religious background. Um, I have family that says if, I mean just crazy stuff like you have instruments in your music, you go to hell if you have tattoos, you got to have them only tattooed guy and my family.

Speaker 3:          01:25:44       Um, and I have a whole back piece and, and, and all this stuff. And I had another one where, so they're super like legalistic and this rules and this other one, when I'm 13 years old, I left up a church camp. When we church camp, I ever went to, I left the church camp, have bruises on my neck because they tried to cast demons out of me. Um, and then, yeah, yeah. And then I went to Catholic school and had a background where, you know, the, the parents were throwing keg parties for us and then only there in this place and this retreat. And I told the guy, Bro, I don't need anything Christian, Bro. I don't need it. I don't want it. Uh, I know your type, like if I sit around the campfire and hold hands with a bunch of sissies punks and sissies and sing Kumbaya, what does that, what is that going to do for me?

Speaker 3:          01:26:29       I need a real answer. I need some like real hope and me and the guy gave me an answer where it was like, you know, a real people with real problems could really use a real god. Um, and for me that just kind of struck a chord. He told me that if you, and this is again, this is my beliefs and stuff, so I'm not throwing anything out there on anybody, but he told me, um, and it made sense to me. You've experienced the counterfeit and for counterfeit to me, anything, there's gotta be an authentic. And he told me, you know, if there's going to be a full ex a watch made a fake Rolex, there's gotta be a Rolex and you've been around the fake stuff, you've been around the full Lexis, you felt the weight of them and they broke on you. You, you've seen it and you, you sometimes gotta get close enough to where it ticks, where it has a smooth transition.

Speaker 3:          01:27:12       Other Times you got to actually hold it because there's that smooth transition on the Rolex instead of ticking. Other ones are so tricky. You actually got to feel the weight. What, what you're making an analogy too is the fake religious people, the people that know the people that, that, that, that abused me. And there's a lot of religious people that abused people that judge people that all this stuff, man. And, and for me, and what this guy shared with me and what he did was he didn't look at the problems I was going through except for to help me out of him. He didn't come down on me about any of them. He didn't judge me. He didn't say you're wrong. He didn't say God hates you. He didn't. He said, God loves you bro. And you got problems and that's okay. And Love God, love people.

Speaker 3:          01:27:51       If you can do that thing, it would solve all the problems. If you could love God and love people that and then that would change things. And so that's what changed my life was like wow. And the Wa what had to happen first was to see if God could actually love me. And then I felt it me and my own personal experience and encounter. Like I felt like, man, God, God doesn't hate me. He might love me. And then I feel like he does love me and then he wants me to love him back and love people. And if I can do those two things for me, that would change. It has changed my life and I believe it will change others lives if I can do that. I think for a lot of people who are atheists, they hear this kind of talk, one of them, one of the things that comes to mind is they're going to like, where's is God? You're talking about? Where's this evidence? Um, to, to put it into it, the way I kind of look at it, like a lot of people, uh, have thought for whatever reason that, uh, that I don't believe in God or that I'm anti God or, or that I'm an atheist. I'm, I would, I would not classify myself in any way, shape or form. Uh, I definitely don't think that I am an atheist because I, I don't not believe in God. But what I think

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       is that when someone can tune into the genuine intentions of the best aspects of any religion, whether it's Christianity, whether it's Hinduism, whether it's what it really boils down to is love and generosity and, and, and fellowship and, and moving towards good and bringing people together with happiness rather than moving towards bad. And what you've done in your life, you can call it God, you can call it anything, but what you've done in your life is recognize the worst possible aspects to chemical addiction, the depression, the sadness, the failure, all the self sabotage. And then realize there's another way to do this. I've hit the worst possible frequency. And I've also kind of barely been able to tune into this great frequency, well, what is this? Knowing the lows and the lowest lows, sometimes you can really sort of extrapolate that there's a, there's a counter to that.

Speaker 1:          01:30:06       There's 180 degrees to that. Just like your friend was talking about the full lux and the Rolex, you know, you call, you know, for a lot of people that have a problem with the word God. You know, I had this Guy Alex Grey on who's this visionary artists, really fascinating, fascinating guy, and he's also this a psychedelic adventure. And he throws around the word God all the time and he's like, you know, we kind of have to take that word back because the word God sort of has this bad heebie jeebies yeah, yeah. Like, Oh, you're talking about nonsense. But no, you're not necessarily talking about nonsense and you're, you know, just because you can't prove it. And just because you know, the, the Bible was written thousands of years ago, it doesn't mean it's all bullshit. And the, the, the true frequency of love, the true frequency of fellowship is really what, what leads to happiness.

Speaker 1:          01:30:53       If you're experiencing that yourself. Oh Man, I am. And that's what this, this vision is for me with the pygmies in the Congo, like a lot of people have misinterpreted it to where they've thought, oh, you're just going there to make a bunch of converts. You should take him a sandwich instead of a bunch of converts. Like if, if people, if, if you actually looked at what I'm doing, like I'm actually doing slave liberation, rainforest conservation and wildlife preservation, all wrapped into one sustainable ways of life. This and that. It does not hinge around, uh, it does not really hinge around if they become a Christian or not. If they don't and they don't want to and they will, they want to worship their god, do witchcraft, do all that fine. I'm going to love you the same way I feel like God has put on my heart a desire to love them and to love them well and to love them regardless of their choices that they make. Just because my choices are to love them and it doesn't hinge around if, if they do what I want them to do or not. Like they're my family. And so I want to see them be, be self sustainable and all that other stuff. So it's not about, it's not about like are they going to converts or anything

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       like that at all. It's about, I'm going to love you guys and see you guys go from being slaves to being liberated, to being free to being put on your own land, to being able to farm, uh, to being able to produce your own corn and beans. Crops which are getting ready for their second harvest, first time in history. They're gonna have their own school. You're gonna be educated. Once they're educated, they can represent themselves at the capitol. They can be citizens of the country after that. I mean, it's just, it goes on and on and on and it's like anybody, I don't think anybody who's reasonable who listens to you would think that you're just trying to convert people because you're a religious zealot. It doesn't sound like that at all. It sounds like you're doing everything absolutely perfect with the best intentions possible.

Speaker 3:          01:32:35       And thank you. It's beautiful story, man. It really is. And it's one of the reasons why I wanted to have you in here and talk to you about it and it's become more beautiful the more I hear about it, man. It's, it's really cool. And uh, please come back again when you're back in town, when you're back a year from now. Yeah. Again, you got my number. Get in touch with me and let's do this again and tell me more things. What's the end game? Are you going to stay there forever? Man, I honestly don't know. We're talking about that with my future wife because, uh, she, I don't think we could live there forever. There's no, there's no, but I do want to go back often in this one years is my way of committing to them. And this is what's crazy man. Like I'm trying to find a way to turn this huge publicity or they're going viral.

Speaker 3:          01:33:19       It was on Jimmy Kimmel and TMC and the today show and now there's going to be a book and I'm trying to find a way to go from 800,000 views to $50,000 or, or even maybe even 200 to 250 which I know that sounds like, oh, he started Kickstarter. Yeah, we're on Indiegogo right now. And what does now that goes, it's a, it was before Kickstarter. It's a crowdfunding site. So it's indiegogo.com/projects/fight hyphen for, it's for the fight for the forgotten, but hyphens in between it. So indiegogo.com/projects/fight for the forgotten, but there's hyphens in between fight hyphen for difficult as fuck for someone to give you some money. I know, but where you can go to fight for the forgotten.com and then you hit donate and then it would take you the Indiegogo page, fight for the forgotten.com go there, please go there. And uh, and and donate some cash.

Speaker 3:          01:34:13       That sounds, that sounds amazing, man. If we can help you, if we can help publicize things, we can tweak things for you, just let me know you're going to have any access to the Internet while you're out there. Actually my buddy that I brought in with me, the film maker, he's got a buddy that, uh, is developing this military technology that's been picked up by him, but uh, they can fly like drones and stuff like that from a briefcase and you'd take this briefcase and uh, you can take it to remote places of the world and you set up these four squares or something like that. And inside of that you have perfect Wifi, high speed stuff. So they're trying, they're trying to see if they could get that to me cause I've had zero contact while I've been there. So I'd love to be able to Skype with people, talk to people from the jungle of the Congo.

Speaker 3:          01:34:54       All I needed was some power that would definitely help. And when you do do that, please let us know and we'll tweet it and we'll get, we'll get it out there to as many people as we can. Yeah, that's great. They'll hold the whole main goal is getting potentially, oh, well that's, that's actually what I would love to do is if we could get Shalom university and it's, it's the shares that the Indiegogo page, if we could get them a research center on the land, uh, and I'm talking about 1200 acres of land, if we could get them a research center, then that would mean they have year round students on the pygmy land and they'd be able to develop them in different self sustainable ways of life, crops, waterwheels all this stuff. College students, we get credit to uh, develop the pygmies and sustainable ways of life.

Speaker 3:          01:35:35       And uh, so the, the big goal would be 200 to 250,000. I think it's right there. And it says what it does and it's, it's some crazy stuff where, uh, where, I mean, I'll, I'll read it real quick and uh, but it's, yeah, so for 200 to 250,000, and this is with the university, this isn't something that made up, this is what they've been able to say. It would, it would literally have three to 5,000 slaves put on five square kilometers of perfect rain forests, five square kilometers of land for under, for the $200,000 price. But then after that it would uh, preserve the culture of the pygmies. It would get water wells, it would get nutritious crops growing. So not just, uh, not just corn and beans, but like, like good crops. It would have a tilapia upon that stocked so the corn would feed the chickens.

Speaker 3:          01:36:23       It would also feed the Tilapia and it would feed the pygmies and it just is a self sustainable way of life. It could have like a earth bag home technology where, have you ever seen those? The earth back homes or the ECO domes? Those things are going crazy today. One of my buddies was over there having a meeting with them and they might want to support this project were four in the u s three to five men. It would only take them three to five days to build a three to five room home. And it's under $300 in the u s all it is is sandbags, sandbags. You fill it with dirt and he make this like Adobe that you put on the outside of it. And so we're trying to get that technology over there too. I'm Shalom University is like all on board wanting to do that.
