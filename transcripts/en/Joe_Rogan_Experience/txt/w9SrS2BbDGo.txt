Speaker 1:          00:00          I know that, I know, I know, I'm just saying it's fucking. I mean they fuck up all the time. It's brutal,

Speaker 2:          00:06          but it's always live on it. Always goes to itunes in the unedited forum. We just have to reboot it. It's back up now. Okay. Um, so where were you,

Speaker 1:          00:14          um, natural disasters, natural disasters? So I think what we're, you know, it's, it's basically we can see where we're going right at the moment. There's more and more natural disasters coming faster and faster. Some of that may be because of the fact that we're going through a whole solar system wide transition as scientists like Dimitria from Russia talks about in this guy dieter borrows, some of it may be because the level of human consciousness is more meshed with the natural state of the planet than we actually can comprehend quite yet, which is what most of the indigenous people believe. And I've been visiting, like we've been doing retreats down in Columbia to work with the Kogi Indians and they walk like 25 hours down from the mountains to hang out with us. And that's basically the message that they've been giving us from, from their, from their older understanding of the nature of reality, you know, it's somehow the level of human spiritual development and how much we are in a reciprocal relationship to our local world, you know, has an effect on what type of catastrophe is, do or don't occur. That's their perspective.

Speaker 2:          01:17          So, uh, when the earth is sick, it's because we're sick and we're all sick along with it. So as tsunamis and hurricanes and earthquakes and ultimately shifts in the polar ice caps and shit like that, and super volcanoes and yellowstone that are ready to blow and kill half the shit on the continent that, that is all in correspondence with the sickness of this species of us. That's, that's the indigenous perspective. Tam. That's a scary thought. But listen, man, if we look at the ideas of quantum physics that even observing something with certain intentions can actually change the outcome of particles. You know, when they do those tests, those slot tests, and they show that observing and experiments actually observing experience actually has an effect on the result of the experiment. Or, or you could say there's no such thing as just being an impartial observer. You're always participating in, in the outcome. That's a better way of looking at it. It really does make sense that it, it, it operates on macro micro and ultimately, you know, this one gigantic level,

Speaker 1:          02:18          right? Which is what like Western alchemists talk about when they said as above, so below

Speaker 2:          02:22          fucking crazy. Is it the idea that human behavior can actually inspire storms? You know, you don't want to say that because you don't want to say that. Like the most fucked up places. The places get the storms, but I used to do jokes about it. They're cruel jokes that I would never do now, but I just do jokes about how tornadoes were attracted to the smell of white trash. They just circle when you have too much macaroni and cheese and, and 40 ounce beer in one location, but it's a terrible idea. There's a terrible joke. It's, it's really cruel to think that you're cooler than these fucking poor people that live in some place where the sky becomes an angry monster. But it is kind of

Speaker 1:          03:00          weird that they only landed fucked up places. You don't want to think that, you know everyone to blame people for that. But wow. You know, I mean obviously we know that's not true because there's geographic centers in this country where there's certainly attracted to, you know, but the idea that more of them come because people are more fucked up and they're accelerating because our society is deteriorating. That's a terrifying thought that we're responsible for that. Well, or, or even on a one percent level even that, that we're responsible for just having any influence on it. Not that we created, but that we even have any barriers as I discussed in like the 2012 book. Like the Hopi for instance, who live in Arizona, tribes like that may have actually chosen to live in very difficult environments where survival is really like on a knife edge because it forced them to be able to do things like rain dances.

Speaker 1:          03:51          So they did it on purpose or do you think that it. Is that in or is it that is the result of them living in this difficult environment and develop more character? Well, it's quite possible because they had a large choice earlier on of where they were going to leave and it's possible they actually chose to leave and live in very difficult environments because it forced them to develop their initiatory and psychic capacity. The only reason why I'm questioned that is because back then the resources were so scarce and you were on foot essentially, so if you were on foot, how much fucking ground can you cover and how much do you know about other lands? You know? How much do you know about if you move five hours south doesn't get that cold. You don't fucking know that. Actually, I totally disagree with what you're saying on both levels.

Speaker 1:          04:30          First of all, I think that they did. No, I mean for instance, we now understand that there was like a sign language. Even native people who didn't speak the same language could actually communicate with very highly developed sign language. There was all across the continent and second of all, what they've discovered is that a lot of native cultures were actually more like cultures of abundance and cultures of scarcity that actually the amount of work that they had to do today though, you know, compared to what we have to do know an average day, it was a lot less than. But that doesn't make match up with your idea of them moving to a very difficult environment to stay alive. Because I'm talking about the hope in particular, let's say like, yeah, they were like the Tibetan Buddhists of the native people, they chose the most difficult spot. What they state this anywhere as is just a conclusion or a feeling you have.

Speaker 1:          05:11          No, it's a theory. It's a theory. I mean, you know, maybe it's ludicrous, but, but, um, uh, it was just inside my visited them for the book and I read a lot about them anthropological accounts and so on. But the whole thing is they would put themselves through these extraordinary, uh, you know, uh, you know, kind of, uh, efforts, you know, the, the Hopi snake clan. They would go all around the area that we collect all of the most poisonous snakes they could possibly find. Then the men would sit, you know, just naked wearing, going kloss in a circle with their knees touching. They would open up all of the snakes in the middle of the circle and the men would have to sit entirely still until all of the snakes had crawled past them. Wow. That's pretty fucking wild, right? They definitely, definitely had their shit together when it came to rites of passage. You know, I remember that movie the, a man called horse.

Speaker 2:          05:57          Do you remember that night incident? It was a, it was a, um, I forget the guy's name, the. He played the father in a gladiator. Peter O'toole, I believe it's Peter O'toole. I might be incorrect. Anyway, amazing fucking movie. But one of the scariest parts of it is one of these rights of passage that he has in order to become one with their tribes and American or a be an Englishman. I forget the fucking bills, but they hung him by his nipples. You know, they used to do shit to test you.

Speaker 1:          06:22          Oh, there's are the, the sun dances, they put the, they lance you through the, uh, the pectoral muscles hang you up. Really. Is that necessary? Apparently, yes. It's the Indian equivalent of about teeth straightening I guess, or botox ingestion or an injection or something. Oh, it's way worse than that. Are Way better than

Speaker 2:          06:41          rather it's um, I think, you know, just having something like having a bar Mitzvah, having some sort of a celebration. It doesn't even have to be, you know, you're hung from a tree by your tits. It just has to be something where like, okay, I, I pass through the door.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Well, it's a symbolic. That's actually what you're saying. For me it was like a big distinction for those cultures. Initiation was actually about going through some process through which you would master non ordinary states of consciousness. You mean on what would cultures, the native cultures. I mean, initiation was not just a celebration. You actually had to overcome, you know, a life death crisis yet

Speaker 2:          07:17          warrior for them too. I mean, you're in a constant state of, you know, defending your tribes and you know, you were, you had to be able to overcome very, very terrifying situations even in hunting. You know, they had a makeup man out of you.

Speaker 1:          07:31          Yeah. But, but I, but I think that a lot of it was really more about learning to have a disciplined approach to non ordinary states of states of consciousness to control states of consciousness. I mean, what do you mean by non ordinary to mean like pod enhanced? What do you, I mean obviously pod mushrooms and these are all native Ios Osca and so on. But then also things like fasting, you know, and being, you know, not eating for five nights where you're just sitting on a mountain top or something or what's the benefit of that? It's both exactly puts you in exactly the same kind of state as the psychoactive substances. Five fasting for five days. Those will bring on a visionary, visionary experiences, you know, they were, and, and force you to, you know, discipline your mind, be able to withstand, you know, ingression this from like the astral realms. And so on,

Speaker 2:          08:20          what do you say to people that say that doing something along the lines of fasting where it's actually possibly dangerous to your body and that's what's causing you to have these experiences. It's really kind of a silly thing to do in this day and age where you could choose other paths to the same sort of results without damaging your body and shutting things down. I don't know enough about nutrition to tell you whether or not it's healthy, but I've read a lot of people that start talking about fasting for days and days, days and they say it puts strain on you.

Speaker 1:          08:43          It's not good for you. I mean, I don't know. No, I wouldn't say it's not good for you to not eat. It probably isn't. I don't know. I know I didn't know a lot of people who love it and find it to be very helpful. That actually one of them in terms of extending the human lifespan, they found that, you know, reducing your caloric intake is, is, is the most direct way to do it.

Speaker 2:          09:02          Does that make sense? To just. Your body's going at less Rpms, you know, a, a race engines, not gonna, not going to last as long.

Speaker 3:          09:09          There's a good episode of Penn and Teller Bullshit. Look at the cleansing episode where they go through like the the diets, like the lemon detox diets and shit like that where you don't eat the officer, go through the colonics and the whole thing like that. That the whole thing is, it's a crock.

Speaker 2:          09:24          Shantelle is bullshit. Make some excellent points, but they also make some silly ones because they. They want to find the conclusion that everything is bullshit. That's what they're doing. I don't think they dismiss yoga. I watched them dismiss Yoga. We're just talking about. It's just stretching and stretching and I was like, wow, you're crazy. You've never done a yoga class. If you do yoga for two hours and tell me that's just stretching. Yoga makes you hot. Yoga makes you. I've, I've gotten is high from yoga as I have from a couple of hits of pot. No doubt about it. No doubt. Like real strong pot. I've gotten to like body tingling moments. Like especially if you take like a real good class, like hot yoga where you go real deep into poses and you really hold them. Anybody that dismisses that as just stretching, you're either not giving me the full information that you have access to or you did a really sloppy job of investigating it, you know, you can't just say these fucking Indian masters that had been doing this shit for thousands of years or just stretching and that's why they have these very specific poses that they believe activate very specific regions in the hemispheres of the, of the Chakras of the body.

Speaker 2:          10:31          You can't just dismiss that a

Speaker 1:          10:33          cat if you want. I mean, that's what's so a kind of interesting and cool about what's happening right now and how things are so complex. I mean, yeah, I mean, you know, I mean I was looking at a book by this guy, Dean Raden, who studies a psychic phenomena as a scientist that incident noetic sciences and we interviewed for a film or read a book called the Self Aware Universe and he analyzes a whole century's worth of data and psychic experience experience. Statistically. He even looks at reports from the US army and the government which support the existence of psychic phenomena, of non local communication mind to mind, which means that consciousness is not simply brain-based that exist in a different way now. But I've also read recently this book by Richard Wiseman called Para normality, who believes there was no psychic phenomena, you know, busts every evidence for it, you know, and, and in his own way is quite convincing, you know, so, so, so for me it's, it's, um, it's just makes it a very interesting time, you know, where you can approach anything and analytically rip it apart and find the weak spots. But, but maybe what, uh, what's missing from Penn and teller and Richard Wiseman's understanding is the sense that a intention is somehow a fundamental aspect of the universe, you know, so, so if your intention is to, you know, take something apart, desecrated, ignore it, you know, and so on, you can do of that for sure.

Speaker 2:          11:54          You know, but, um, but, but within there you've kind of missed a subtle key that actually makes a life worth having in a way. Well, intention is aware and you can be aware of it in a very tangible form in the art of standup comedy. It's you cannot be thinking about something different. Say something else and have the people react to it. They won't. It won't work. It's a weird thing. You could have the joke worded correctly. You could say it with the right intonation you get, but if your mind is an intuit, they can smell it. It's the weirdest fucking thing in the world. The a connection that you have with an audience. It could be an audience of 200 or it can be an audience of a thousand. If you've reached that full connection, it is like a giant mass hypnosis. There is some sort of a relationship that you had with these people and if somehow or another something hits you, you remember something or something bothers you or you think about an argument that you got in with your girlfriend or a bill, you forgot to pay her.

Speaker 2:          12:54          Any distraction that makes you feel in a negative way. Even if you're saying the words the same night, the audience will feel it. They will feel it and they will back off you. You can feel it. You could feel them go. He's not, he's not engaged. It's a religion man. It's real. You can't tell me it's not. I've always said that, you know, I do my best to, uh, write standup. I sit down, I do my best to put in the time to be there to make the writing happen, and I do in the time when I perform enough so that I get onstage that I'm really comfortable and relaxed. But ultimately at the end of the day, I'm not exactly sure how that shit is even coming out. I don't know where it's coming from. I don't know what's happening and when I'm on stage, when I'm completely locked in, I am as much a passenger as I am the person who steers it.

Speaker 2:          13:41          And as long as that works, as long as I'm in that groove and the audiences in that group, the whole thing will go seamlessly. But one little hiccup, one little bad thought, one little error, one little stress point, and everybody hops off the the, the bride and weights and looks at you and goes, you're going to get this thing going again. And Yeah, get back in. Everybody gets back in, we're okay. We're okay. Do you know what you're doing now? I know what I'm doing now they can tell. And that's a psychic connection. That's a legit tangible, psychic connection that when you're on stage, you feel it from the crowd. You feel like waves of positive and negative. You literally feel the energy and you can say that, right? You've said you've had really good sets on stage and you've had jokes that bombed and you've met people angry at you. You felt that, right? Don't you feel it like a wave?

Speaker 3:          14:28          It, it, it, it affects you. Just like anything like getting hit by a snowball. You know, like if you got a bad joke on state, if you got, that's the worst. If he had a bad joke on stage, but uh, and it would hit you before you were like having a great day. After that you're, you're having the worst day ever. You just got hit in the face with Villanova. You life is the exact same life. Literally. None of the hard details

Speaker 2:          14:52          have changed and yet you feel you fucking loser, you know, because these people have let you know, you have not given us what we want. Is this weird sort of an exchange that's going on because I haven't had no. CIS and Trans are things that are operating like much of the time, you know. Have you ever watched a massive doses show? Yeah, I did watch my college one, so thanks. Sorry. They used to have them all the time in Boston at the, um, there's a place called the comedy connection. Every week they had this guy, Frank Santos, who would do a hypnotist comedy show that seemed like bullshit until you saw it a few times. And when you saw it a few times you would realize, oh my God, these people are really fucking under. It's so weird. And not everybody, he would know, he would go up to the people that weren't and he'd look at them and go, okay, you get off the stage when he pulled the people off the stage.

Speaker 2:          15:40          But the people that were up there, for whatever reason, he found their, their, their hack code and got into their food. I tend to look at most of our politicians and uh, you know, news anchors is kind of a illuminati sorcerers who use a transit gnosis to keep people in a, in a, in a lower state of consciousness, loaded state of suggestibility, Illuminati. I hate black wizards. He got, he got robbed by a black wizard guy dressed up like a wizard, put a gun in his chest, sort of guide a fake beard on. So he called them black wizard

Speaker 3:          16:13          socks. Man, there's this guy at my starbucks and I feel so bad for him because he, he totally reminds me of him, that guy that robbed me. And every time I fucking walk in there, I'm just like, damn, I'm fucking totally just eyeing this guy more than I normally would. I somebody waiting in line and I'll just be like, what's that guy doing? Like a dog that used to bite you? Yeah, exactly. And He, I've caught eyes with them like three times. I feel so fucking bad about this. I might have to switch starbucks because of it. Just switched to our bugs. Yeah, I'll just do that. Just, you know, I was Kinda mad. Yeah. But then he's like, he's kicking me out of the starbucks. You know, what, if it is him to the idea that you somehow or another manifestation

Speaker 2:          16:53          that is where things get really spooky, you know, the people that believe that you manifest every single action in your life and that you have some sort of alternative that really you, it's more like the, uh, I liked the Vedanta perspective of the. Basically there's like a singular consciousness, you know, we're kind of like, you know, we're, we're part of the projection, okay, what, what is the way? If that is the case, how can I avoid some horrible bullshit in my life? Can I just have to do the right thing and be super nice and always go in a positive direction and you can't draw like I'm starting to think that you can't control if you can't afford it, just ignore it or what's the bullshit that you can't ignore? Oh, well, just a like life, life and death. People for whatever, for whatever

Speaker 3:          17:34          right now in all my life, for whatever reason right now, the last year to two years in my life have been the most psychotic and crazy, but yet I've also been paused. Please, please pause. Please. The most successful place

Speaker 2:          17:50          he's been dating porn stars. Okay? What the fuck man.

Speaker 3:          17:54          Already know what I'm saying. I also want what I'm saying. Dog fucking die. I've also got mugged at gun. I've also fucking a million other things that lately that has been happening that in my whole life never has. My life has been boring as fuck. You know, and now I'm having horrible things happen to me at the same time as I'm having the best time of my life. Well, you know,

Speaker 2:          18:14          maybe that maybe there's something wrong in the formula of how you're interacting with the grid. Maybe there's something wrong. What if you had to look, forget it. Forget it. Forget your life. Put it away. You're not even you.

Speaker 3:          18:26          If you had to look at how many people were taking a lot of people, that's how the government spends money. Hopefully not one of my friends I've got. Please hold

Speaker 2:          18:34          place if you were not you. Okay. Forget about the emotional attachment that you have all day. All your issues. How would you fix you? What would you say? You know, the one thing that we would like to correct about Brian would be x. What would it be? What's the number one thing? Yeah. If you had, if you could, instead of working at something, if you could just correct something about your behavior, the way you think about things or the way you look at the world or anything. What would it be?

Speaker 3:          18:58          Uh, did not throw. Come on walls. Okay. What if you just stopped doing? I really don't. I really don't. Like I never think you don't believe that any of you on myself. I don't feel like I have any flaws. I don't overthink it. My, my, my personal. This is what I'm trying to

Speaker 2:          19:15          gets it. This is what I'm trying to get to. I don't know if it's either or. I don't know. If you look, there's babies that are killed in drive bys and when I hear about that I go, well that doesn't know how the fuck does that work? What's going on there? He knows the baby. Have some negative thoughts that haven't been. Then I think about it and I think about all the positive things that have happened in my life and all the positive things that I know have manifested themselves through a certain type of thinking, a certain ethic, a certain way of looking at the world and I wonder if it is either or or if it's a combination of things. You know what I'm saying? Daniel?

Speaker 1:          19:48          I like tuned that for a second. Sorry. I just personally think that I'm trying to kill. The only choice we ever have is to look at the bright side of the or the crappy side. So why not just always look at the bright side. Yeah, but you were looking at the end of civilization. Just looking at the moment. I was looking at your dues statue and your Voodoo doll and you're kind of getting your, your, your sort of demon that represented

Speaker 2:          20:13          this. Well, no, I'm actually, the Balinese stuff has just. I've always been fascinated by eastern art. I think it's beautiful and I, I think it's amazing how cheap it is. You could get this amazing.

Speaker 3:          20:22          Thank you. Because that's a haunted. That's why. Because there's little kids that made it as a four year old kids. Made it a little ginger kid

Speaker 2:          20:29          artwork. Man. I love this one of those things. I'm not really into like, you know, I've, I've bought paintings before and I don't kind of get a lot of what people are really into. So there's some. I was at a, um, a guy's house once and uh, he had a picture on the wall and I go, oh, did you couldn't make that. And this guy goes, oh no, that's a little bit, but uh, that's like $30,000 and I went, what the fuck are you talking about? It looked like some painting on some are ripped pieces of cardboard that were randomly stuck in a beautiful frame and I really thought that it was something that a kid did. So I don't get that

Speaker 3:          21:05          there needs to be done one that's just that kind of shit like Gold Buddhists, but more of a corporate place that's just super cheap. Like that could be like $10. I want to buy a dragon mass, but I went feathers. I want to be cheap, you know, because like that kind of Shit's popular. Everyone likes that kind of shit. Why don't they make it like a walmart of that shit, Brian? I think you're missing. I also think that they should make cat food and dog food into one food. They could probably easily do that. I don't think they can. I think they have different dietary needs. They can all eat chicken. Right. Okay. So put that on the list. If you want to go check it all. Even bazell put chicken base. This guy is brutal to work with. I'm sorry bro. I brought a serious man in here. It's fucking New York Times crazy. You're talking nonsense about cat and dog food. You Lazy contract and go out and buy the cat food, the dog food and stop fucking up the shots. Eating dog food and my dogs eating the cat food. Wanting to just make you got a problem that you've got to pat

Speaker 2:          21:57          girlfriends. You fuck this guy. He's. He gets a new relationship and it's like, oh my God, we should get a kid and they go out and they get a fucking dog and then the girls dump them and he's got a God damn.

Speaker 3:          22:08          It's like watching lower for nanny. I'm like, daddy warbucks

Speaker 2:          22:12          brock. Sorry man, this. This is a serious podcast, but it's also. It's also a comedy podcast. The good news is we've had an excellent conversation. I guarantee you a lot of people will buy your shit.

Speaker 3:          22:23          So. Hey Joe. I was at the comedy store and there's. There's that whole coast that goes thing that happened at the fucking ghosts anywhere. I know, but I'm so tired of, do you believe in ghosts? Of course. Oh my God. Jo. I was, I was sitting in the green room behind the main room. We were all smoking hot. Doesn't know that ghosts are real. I've collected so many incredible stories about ghosts. Really. What do they do?

Speaker 1:          22:44          Uh, I mean, a friend of mine, her, her, uh, friend's brother had had committed suicide and she was sleeping in the house where he had died and she had a dream that they were having sex and she woke up from the dream and um, her, her covers were up and there was this kind of like spirit figure over her. And as soon as she began to open her eyes, it dissipated. There's no way that could have been a dream inside of dream. Of course, it could have been anything. Of course it could be, but I'm gonna have, you know, I mean, we, you know, because there's no, you know, how are you going to verify this type of thing? What I've collected a whole number of anecdotes told to me by people and observing their, you know, their, their state, their, their, their, their, their, their efforts to kind of understand it, to fathom at my own experiences. Also I've had similar, you know, it's, I, I think that there's no doubt that, you know, probably, you know, psychic energy collects in physical environments and when people are no longer there, if they have a stake in that environment and they are not finished with their business in the world that they out, you know, or some pieces of the energy of it

Speaker 2:          23:47          and resentment or something, some sort of a bad energy is enough to keep a resident

Speaker 1:          23:53          do. When my father died, I mean he had a loft, was full of his paintings and sculptures, you know, the last. And he had a big freight elevator. Like I was working with two guys bringing his stuff out. As we're bringing out the last shipment of, of, of his sculptures down in the freight elevator. Suddenly the light bulb and it just totally popped and we were in darkness and you know, we were all looking at it. We, nobody had touched it, you know, somehow that psychic energy that was, that was constellated between us and him, you know, caused this thing to happen, or the light bulb I was Joe, I was in the phone call that you going to have to make today. To me, there are certain things when you feel the synchronicity, it's like, it's like a click, you know, and it's like you have an intuitive, you know, acceptance that uh, you're, you're being shown a little bit of like the fabric of space time making a little bit of a ripple or something. I was in the green room

Speaker 2:          24:45          seriously with like eight people in the comedy store to started the company store, if you didn't know for just Fyi was Ciro's nightclub and it was a bugsy Siegel's hanging out in Hollywood and a lot of people allegedly were murdered there. And every single person who has been there for more than x amount of years has some sort of a ghost story. Every one of the waitresses has something managers have something, you know, how much of it is psychosomatic, how much of his suggestion,

Speaker 3:          25:13          how much does the other comics, and I was sitting there with like eight other people were just smoking weed, hanging out, talking, and suddenly the door sounded like somebody shot a gun through like, it didn't feel like sound, like somebody just shook it or kicked it. It seemed way more powerful than that to the fact that I think everybody in the room kinda got down was like, what the fuck was that? And we all Kinda got down like on the couches and on the ground as if we all thought for sure that was a gunshot, right?

Speaker 2:          25:38          We'll lose. Let me stop right there. And then of course, old ass building. Here's what's important. This is a building for the 19 twenties. That's fucking fault line, right? Those buildings shift and every now and then they shift and they literally, and it'll, it'll make a noise. I've been in the car when it makes noise. Okay. It's old married. Fuck. I'm not saying that it wasn't a ghost. Now the most likely explanation is that right?

Speaker 3:          25:59          I thought it was another comic and he's just like the secret, like, Oh yeah, we take this plunger and then we just hit it as hard as we can

Speaker 2:          26:06          let comedy secret. I'm sorry, my grandparents lived in a uh, supposedly haunted house and I stayed there with them in, uh, in Newark, New Jersey and it was on north ninth street and there was a guy who actually died in the house and he was a guy who was renting a room there and he died and they, they always thought that this house was haunted though because the house was always making noises, but it's a fucking house that was built in like 19. Oh nine, you know, it's an old fucking house and when you're dealing in a place like New Jersey that's moist all the time and it rains all the time and then it gets hot in the summer and cold in the winter she would is like, you know, it's an piece of, you know, construction. It couldn't, it constricts, it expands depending on the moisture in the air, depending on it being cold or hot and the car, the old houses like that. They make a lot of fucking noise in the creek. There always were clock and people are just fucking places or it's an old house man, but I'm not completely averse to the idea of ghosts, but a lot of people that talk about ghosts are full of shit.

Speaker 3:          27:09          Well I just think if there is goes, there would be an easy way to prove it and we've talked about it before. You just go to somebody that's like wifes got died in a rape and you go to his grave and just or her grave and just start humping her grave or something. You know, if there was such thing as that goes, goes would come out and be like, dude, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          27:25          They wouldn't want to indulge you and your nonsense. Maybe you would hit the wrong if maybe maybe it's not something that can easily be tuned in. Maybe it's like the northern lights, like the idea of, you know, you can't capture the northern lights and put it in the fucking beam and blasted on Manhattan. The northern lights are, you know, it's a theory that some sort of a thing that moves and pulsates in the sky, you know, maybe that's what like a ghost is like a very minor version of that. Like it doesn't have a rhyme or reason for when it exists or doesn't exist, but it doesn't have a rhyme and reason. It's just we don't understand those laws yet. You say that violates nature. Just that our understanding of natural law is limited by our, by our mental conception, by the type of science that we've constructed and so on. Are you convinced, I mean what like when you look at the evidence of ghosts and not go shows, if you looked at.

Speaker 3:          28:18          Wait, wait, what evidence are you talking about? Do we have any solid evidence ever that there was a ghost or just speculation?

Speaker 2:          28:23          Almost entirely speculation. There's no scientific evidence. Well, it doesn't mean that they're not real. Because if you think about what a ghost is, if it goes to something that's not in this dimension and sort of flits in and out of it, and how do you measure that? I mean sciences, you know, everybody says, well, science says there are no ghosts or there's no scientific evidence that goes will science was not really designed to measure shit like ghosts. Science is designed to measure like how much does lead way. You know what happens when a star goes supernova observable things. When you get something like a ghost. If a ghost was real and it seems incredibly rare phenomenon that depended on some really exotic conditions, how the fuck you.

Speaker 3:          29:04          I can imagine that I'm giving the offer. If there's any ghosts listening, they can fucking raped me tonight and they could just rate my ass all day long with sticks. And if it happens, I'll let you know. I've got news for you. If they're going to come here from another guy can do better than me. I mean for instance, there is like um,

Speaker 2:          29:20          decent and interesting evidence around a reincarnation really. There was a book, a person's name in Stevens, was a professor at University of Virginia to like 2,500 page book called neurobiology and reincarnation intersect and he found all around the world there were children who had spontaneous recall of past lives and often very specific like an India. They'd be like, you know, I was, I

Speaker 1:          29:42          lived in this town. I'm, my wife had this name. I had two kids. So in a number of cases he found these kids and he went back to the towns and they talked about and, and they found this family and establish that there had been this, this connection and, and um, the sense of familiarity. No, no genetic, no genetic line, no genetic link. And sometimes the kids would even have like a pronounced birthmark, like a birthmark on the neck or something. And it turned out that the previous incarnation perhaps had died of a wound to the neck and a fight or something like that.

Speaker 2:          30:14          Is it possible that the connection is an abstract one that you know, that they, they, they haven't met it yet, but that yet there's not a, a balanced value to learn to experiences that are transferred through genetics, like instincts and that perhaps some instincts that we have a really like things go wrong. You learn from them. That's why you're afraid of cats. Mean kids are afraid of them.

Speaker 1:          30:36          Seven year old kid and suddenly out of nowhere saying, you know, I have a wife and Agora, I have two kids

Speaker 2:          30:41          to see them. Yeah, this is. But this is my point isn't impossible. I mean, isn't it possible that somehow or another that there is a, a memory that through whatever, a mutation or whatever extreme condition or weird circumstance as far as like physical biology becomes a more potent one and that this as it is transferred through through generations awakens this memory awakens this, this, this experience that someone who shared these genetics, oh so many generations ago actually did have. Then all of a sudden, for whatever strange,

Speaker 1:          31:12          if there's any, um, idea that, you know, genetic material, it could have, could have hold memory like that.

Speaker 2:          31:18          Well, what about memes? What are the, what about the idea that even racism can be transferred genetically? I mean, that's a really kind of a, a widely considered idea. Almost unprovable, but I considered by mainstream science.

Speaker 1:          31:28          Yes. I think a lot of those, those, those ideas about all these things being inherited by the genetics being this kind of master molecule are actually being kind of challenged right now by the emerging biology of epigenetics, which is recognizing that, you know, awareness actually begins at the boundary of the cell where chemical signals are exchanged. There's a kind of cognitive process that happens even at the permeable boundary of the cell as some signals are allowed in and some are ignored or rejected and that's what's allowed in actually then influences how the genetic material expresses itself and reproduces itself. That actually it's not so much the genetic material is the master molecule. It's more as if the whole cell is a unit of cognition or awareness. This is very much thinking of people like a Varella,

Speaker 2:          32:12          but is this a theory or they have done. Okay, well, they haven't done it, but everything was counting.

Speaker 1:          32:18          Yeah. I mean, this is a look at the biologist Bruce Lipton. He has a book called a biology beyond belief. Really looking at how, um, you know, consciousness and awareness began even at a cellular level and how that in itself influences and inflects how the genetic material expresses itself. That the genes are not master molecules. The whole idea it, it's so fascinating.

Speaker 2:          32:40          The idea of, you know, I mean w w what, what instincts when we're, we're, do we instincts come from. I mean, is it all from one initial source, you know, stay away from fire. You get scared when you see snakes. I mean, these are all learned impressions and in our, our material, the material that makes human beings are certain things that you show people and children when they're really young, have certain fears and notions of the bogeyman and the, you know, the, the monster that lives in the woods and the things in the dark and, and a lot of these are imprinted from being killed by Jaguars from some protocol hominid that lived 5,000 or 5 million years ago there got killed by Jaguars. And those, those instincts are still tingling in the background noise of our mind.

Speaker 1:          33:22          That's possible. And that could also be explained. You ever get into like rupert sheldrake his ideas around the morphogenic field, but knowing when their parents coming home, so maybe there was this species encounter that was like a near death encounter for humanity and it left this morphogenic field of, of, of fear and terror around the snake, around the Jaguar or something like that.

Speaker 2:          33:42          Yeah. Well we are certainly moving. I mean if I had to guess into some sort of a state where that becomes more and more aware now, wouldn't you agree? What becomes more and more aware that the state that have this interconnectedness, this morphogenetic field, this idea that you know, that we are living in social or a complex meshwork of biological life and natural natural laws and physics and space and radiation and all of it together combined by and it sort of people are realizing it now like way more than ever before. I mean, when I was a kid, there was no talk. There was nothing along these lines.

Speaker 1:          34:19          Yeah, it's extraordinary. And, and maybe that is pointing towards the kind of next phase of evolution as a species. I mean, do you think it's technology and it's going to do that? Well, I think we have to look at technology itself as an aspect of the evolution of consciousness. You know, that actually like we're, we're a tool using and toolmaking species. We make a new tool and then we look at the tool with the instrument we've made. It reflects us back at ourself and then it gives us new metaphors for understanding ourselves. Then it allows us to make another more advanced tool and that creates a whole new set of metaphor. So now we've gotten to the point in our tool creation and tool using or this feedback loop is happening faster and faster, so we're having, we're, we're better, but it's still a tool as a projection of our consciousness, of our thought into the material realm, which then gives us information about ourselves, which then leads us to create another tool which also advances and evolves our consciousness. In that

Speaker 2:          35:12          process, do you ever get to the point where you, uh, you, you get upset that you have a connection with these, these items, these technological items like phones or do do not regret it ever? Or do you just accept it,

Speaker 1:          35:24          enjoy it? Like I think it's very fascinating and it's also as we've been, part of what we'll be doing with reality sandwich is bringing people down to work with indigenous Shamans and elders. So recently we went down to the Columbia and worked with these Kogi guys from the mountains in Columbia. And when we hung out with them, we were in a place without any electricity for eight days. So no phone, no computer after like a day and a half. I was like, what did I want all that stuff for again, like, this is so much nicer now. Suddenly you can see the stars at night. You're like light a fire and the fire goes out and you go to sleep. You wake up at dawn. I mean, you know, I think that actually we, we may find that we've gone way too far on this technological path that we thought that we've had a kind of, um, in a sense the religious belief of modern society is linear technological progress leading to some kind of singularity or transformation that we may actually back up from that and be like, well, wait a second.

Speaker 1:          36:18          Where is this stuff leading to? I mean, actually I have more plastics in my tissues. You know, my eyes are going bad from looking at these tiny screens. You know, why is life constantly mediated by glowing rectangular screens anyway? That actually we might want to retract from this technological path and develop in a different direction, which doesn't mean rejecting technology. It's more about mastering our projections rather than, rather than feeling that we always have to get a meshed in them. And then move in that direction, is it sort of like riding a bike too fast and you're going downhill and you go, oh fuck, like it's good to ride this bike. But I've gotten kind of away from my own biological control of this situation. Well, that's certainly what's happened to us as a species. I mean, um, you know, in every level we've been seduced by our technological production projections in a sense. We've lost our grounding on the planet.

Speaker 2:          37:07          What do you ever consider the idea that when some sort of a weird symbiotic relationship where it's our job as the host to create this environment? Where are the parasite, which is technology? There's new life form that we've created to exist in that ultimately discard us because it is the next stage of not organic life, but of consciousness and that consciousness. The next stage of consciousness will be artificial consciousness created by this, this consciousness that was created by biological life and that we are only here to usher in the next stage. That next stage is in electronic form. A stage that doesn't have emotions or nonsense or

Speaker 1:          37:44          any of this shit that is not the way I look at it. And we don't, we don't. Well, we don't, we don't know. We have no, we have no reason at this point to really believe that, you know, an artificial intelligence can become conscious in the way we are. I mean, machines may have, you know, a form, I mean everything. We have a form of sentience but, but, but, uh, you know, we may still have a very important role if we're, if we're in our proper state, you know, in, in, in the cosmic unfolding. But should we, I mean if,

Speaker 2:          38:13          or a, a step along the way, what, who's to say that that step eventually a continues along a biological train. Maybe it really is truly our destiny to create some sort of an artificial life that's not burdened down by our, our, our monkey DNA and all the instincts that we needed to evolve to this point with the curiosity that would allow us to make something as crazy as artificial intelligence. And maybe we're just the carriers maybe where the carriers of the disease that eventually takes off and, and.

Speaker 1:          38:40          Well, I guess part of what I would suggest to you is that, you know, part of our opportunity right now is to become cocreative with the evolutionary process. And that in a way means that we have to step into a much more responsible and mature role where we actually become participants and, and in a way we still kind of enjoy the spectacle of our own alienation and our own potential destruction. So we kind of enjoy kind of like elaborating the, the, the sort of futuristic mythologies of how our technology is going to overwhelm us or devour us. I mean that might be the case, but all we really know at this point is that we have, will, we have intelligence, we have consciousness and we're not using it very well. So the first thing I would think that we would want to try to do is use it very, very effectively to see what type of better situation we can rapidly create. You know, rather than fobbing off our responsibility onto, oh, there's going to be this technological thing or it's too late, we fucked the planet, or there's some new age psychic children coming along. All that stuff to me is just bullshit ass dodges. That basically is other ways that we're avoiding taking full responsibility for the planetary situation that we as a species have created, which is for me is really the only way we're going to possibly create a better world in the time that we have before things go to hell.

Speaker 2:          39:59          Well, I do agree that as a person who's a big proponent of team people, you know, I definitely advocate the idea of us figuring out what the fuck we are doing and making it better for all of us and our relationship with the planet. But to me that doesn't seem like you're fobbing that off. But the, considering the possibility that we are merely here as many other parasites and hosts are in this world. And you look at like grasshoppers where there's they're infected by aquatic worms and aquatic worms trick the grasshopper into jumping into water and the grasshopper drowns.

Speaker 1:          40:31          Well, so the world can be born out of it. I personally think that we actually are infected but by a parasitical agency. And I would say that agency is something like the dominator empire complex, the, the sense that we have of separation from nature, the sense that we have the right to, you know, annihilate ecosystems, dominate ecosystems, control other people. The whole, the whole trip of empire, the slavery. I mean there's still tons of slavery around the world domination of women that, that's, that's the parasite that's eating us alive right now. And that's where, you know, if we can go through our entire initiatory process, we, we, we can, we can begin to, you know, find the antidote or the cure to that. But it's not about, you know, from my perspective, like giving it up to technology, you know, as an amazing thing. It's more like reclaiming our, our human capacity.

Speaker 1:          41:21          And for me, that, that's really where the, the knowledge of the indigenous people is not, you know, folk tale. It's not silly, it's not worthless. It's actually something that, that, you know, those of us who care about you seeking to, you know, move into an evolutionary framework. Uh, you know, it's, they, they have, they have tools and gifts for us. And that's why part of what I've been trying to do over the last couple, well a lot of my work but, but now in a different way is build bridges to, to the indigenous people and their knowledge systems, you know. So I'm working now with the Kogi in Columbia and also

Speaker 2:          41:54          the sequoia from Ecuador. Uh, wha. What, what I meant by that was not that it has to be, it almost like when I, when I, when I look at the relationship that we have with, with technology and I look at the relationship that different parents sites and different hosts have it just as a consideration. You have to think about the fact that our society is completely obsessed with pushing innovation. We're completely obsessed and I often look at the dominator culture, what you describe, and I say, well, you know, you're right. I mean that is a huge fucking problem. War and the domination of other countries and battling for resources, but what do you say to people that say that there's no way you can have a society that, that reaches this particular height this fast without that as a byproduct and that in fact the reason why people push so hard to innovate and to create new things and conquer new, new, new new boundaries both scientifically and socially, is that it's all almost a byproduct of this desire to innovate and create and produce this next thing and that this is all a part of us creating some artificial thing.

Speaker 2:          43:04          Some intelligence.

Speaker 1:          43:05          I, I think we have to. We have to, we have to break the trance of technology, which is not to say that we reject technology, but we have to break that trance that somehow, you know, there's this linear technological progress is necessarily, you know, bringing us to something super amazing. And for me, the shift in the future is more to a kind of psycho technical phase of development. By that I mean that, you know, if you do, you know, if you've had the DMT and the Ayahuasca experiences, the yoga experiences and so on, you, you recognize there are these vast dimensions, you know, within the psyche that are basically unknown incontinence and, and in a sense that for me is where the action is going to lie for us in the future, you know, as well as potentially exploring other planets, other solar systems and all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          43:56          But, but at the moment we really more need to get control of our thought projections. And the only way to do that is to undergo an initiatory process that involves, you know, kind of getting into our unconscious patterns. Initiatory process. What do you mean? Yeah. Well, I mean like, you know, hanging, you know, fasting or hanging by your packs for six days or taking Iowasca, you know, for a couple of weeks until you know you're, you're, you're so nauseous. Did you can't believe it, but still vision. The insights keep coming up and they begin to heal. Have your, um, you know,

Speaker 2:          44:35          pathetic humanness, you save the setting humanness, but then why are you, you completely averse to the idea that we are just here to develop something else, which I mean, we obviously are just a step along the way and will be unrecognizable few million years. Think that what we're here to do

Speaker 1:          44:49          develop is, uh, you know, integrity, consciousness and willpower. And once we've developed that, then we can think about what else we may develop at the moment. We don't have that. We just think we do.

Speaker 2:          44:59          Do you feel happy? Do you feel happy that you're. Um, and I, I believe you are one of the people that sort of an agent of this sort of, uh, I believe right now, currently we're in a very unusual age of enlightenment. And I think that the, uh, the, the level of enlightenment that we've achieved a culturally over the last year. Certainly not everybody, not last year, last decade, certainly not over everybody, but generally has been more than anything that I can ever remember in my lifetime. And people like you that are pushing these ideas and people like you that are trying to challenge the way people view things and the standard standard, a predetermined patterns of behavior we seem to have come to accept you're a part of moving this thing along these. These kind of discussions are part of moving this thing along where people in college or people who are getting their first jobs, people were starting their own first business versus they're stopping and they're reconsidering the direction that they move forward and what their motives are and whether or not they're just caught up in momentum.

Speaker 1:          45:59          Yeah, man, I feel extremely humble and lucky. Do you feel obligated? I feel tremendous obligation and responsibility to, um, do what I can to help out, you know?

Speaker 2:          46:11          So what is there a way to stop this? What, what is the number one problem that we have? If we have a urine for destruction and we're constantly.

Speaker 1:          46:19          The number one problem that we have is that consciousness and subjectivity are mass produced by a system that is basically keeping us in a state of a, you know, pacivity and ignorance

Speaker 2:          46:32          system. A natural system is that system there because like everything else, like the way Alpha wolves treat Beta wolves, that, that, that system is almost set up in place so that there is an antagonist. Sure.

Speaker 1:          46:43          It's a, I see it as an evolutionary process and just as like, you know, the, the embryo has to push against the shell and finally breakthrough, you know, or doesn't, um,

Speaker 2:          46:52          inspired by an antagonist. You, you, Ali, you needed frazier.

Speaker 1:          46:56          Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, and, and, and, uh, you know, we definitely have a, um, you know, a powerful military industrial, corporate empire complex that has sunk its roots into our subconscious processes and, and our psychology and it is going to require, it requires a lot of disciplined effort to recognize how it is, how it is operating through us on so many different levels. And then begin to turn it around from within.

Speaker 2:          47:26          That's the facts, pitches. That's about it.

Speaker 1:          47:30          That's all you're going to absorb. I haven't done this. This is an awesome conversation. Thank you very much for coming over here. And my pleasure. Thanks for having me. Everything that I thought it would be plus more if anybody needs to get ahold of you or check out your stuff, which should they do and what did, what did you hand me here? I'll give you a quick rundown. Evolver.net as our social network all over dot and they have the evolve or social movement. We have about 50 groups around the world now. Mostly in the US who beat up every month. We do consciousness raising. We create a theme that could be the future of psychedelics. It could be extra terrestrials, it could be sustainability or permaculture. We use those as both gathering points where people raise consciousness and learn, but then also nexus points for communities to build.
