Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Hey everybody, Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by audible.com. If you go to audible.com forward slash Joe, you can get one free audio book and one free month of a audible service. You really should try it out. It's an amazing service. They have over 100,000 titles. If you have never tried audio books before, it can really transform the way you commute. It makes being stuck in your car or stuck on a train and makes it an educational experience. It can inspire you. You can take in some cool fiction, you can enjoy yourself. Instead of feeling like a Schlub, just wasting your life away, enrich herself with audible.com freaks. It's an awesome way to get your learn on m and a. If you go there right now, as I said, you can get one free audio book. A book I recommend is called the war of art by Steven Pressfield.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       It's an amazing book. I give it out to people. I have a stack of them at my house. And um, it's all about the, it's all about overcoming resistance, which is something that holds a lot of us back when we procrastinate about things, we feel crappy about it, but when we get things done, we feel great. But how many people actually follow through and continue to get things done? It's not that many. And there's a lot of reasons why. And Steven Pressfield is a brilliant writer and the way he gets into it, it'll sync with your head so quickly. You'll be like, oh, that's my issue. And then from then on you're always going to know what the issue is immediately when it massive manifests itself. And you'll look at it in a completely different way. I've told so many people about this book and I've had so many people come back and say, this book completely changed the way I work.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       And, uh, for creative type folks, it's amazing. But I think it's amazing for anybody because I think that whole resistance thing in procrastination, I think that sort of a plays a part in a lot of people's lives. I don't think it has anything to do with just being artistic. He relates it to writing and art and creating things, but I think it probably goes to a lot of different things that you do in life. The things that you put your focus towards, things that you enjoy. Anyway. Audible.com forward slash joe were also brought to you by onnit o n n I t. We got a lot of new stuff in including a club bells and mace balls and of course we have kettle bells and battle ropes and stuff like that. If you, uh, I've never heard his podcast, you don't know what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       It's essentially like a personal performance website. Like what we're interested in is all different things and increase athletic performance, different things that increase mental performance, which are called nootropics. And we saw one of those called Alpha brain. If you've heard this all before, I swear to God, I don't want to keep saying it like this, but there's no other way to do it. They still clubs look like weapons. Jail. You're starting to add weapons to on it. That's just the no weapons. They will help you wield the weapon, but what they are is a, they're ancient Indian exercises. Uh, these are, um, from a boy that used to do them with hardwoods like hundreds and hundreds of years ago, probably thousands of years ago. And the awkward shape of them and the balance of them makes you a, strengthens up your forearms and your grip. And uh, it's uh, a great exercise as far as like wrestling and hand strength and things along those lines.

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       Club bells are fantastic. You'd be surprised at how difficult they are to use. I only used five pounders throw that hard to use, like for, with a 25 pound club bill, I got a serious workout in. It's real weird. Like we look at weights and you know, we looked at like lifting weight and you know, and people are all impressed if they can lift 300 pounds and you know, a bunch to 50. It doesn't really matter if you can't use it. The stuff that I'm interested in is all different exercises that have been shown to actually increase athletic performance. What I'm interested in is improving the way your body moves. That's why we're interested in kettlebells. That's why we sell the extreme kettlebell cardio DVD. We have many different weights and sizes of kettlebells. We have medicine balls, we have wall balls, which are these big giant, also looked like medicine balls.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       You throw him against the wall and a host of different supplements. Anything that we've found anywhere that we believe increases performance increases your mood. There's a supplement called new mood that it increases your body's ability to produce serotonin. It, it has five htp and l Tryptophan in it, and uh, it's, it's great for your brain to check it all out. Go to [inaudible] dot com. Use the code name, Rogan, and you will save 10 percent off any and all supplements. We're also brought to you by death squad.tv this Wednesday night right there, a Thursday, next Thursday, Thursday, next Wednesday. If you do go into their brand sleeping bag, San Diego this Thursday night, it'll be Brian, Tony Hinchcliffe, who's hilarious, up and coming, young comedian Jason t dot, who we love to death. Very, very funny guy. Billy bow, now, our buddy, Yoshi, you can't go wrong with this show. It's a the American comedy company.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       It's a cool ass club if you've never been there before. It's in San San Diego on sixth street is where at in that area, something like that. You could find it on Google wherever, but it's at the American comedy company. It's an awesome comedy club. San Diego as one of that. That club is like one of the best design clubs in the country, like real low ceilings, tight seeding. I remember when we went there were like, Whoa, this place is sick. This is a great spot. It's going to be fun. Yeah. Next Thursday and Friday, which is tonight. Tonight. Tonight we're at the icehouse 10:00 PM show. It's a great show. Thompson girl. Christina pundits. They didn't make it. No, they can't make enough, but when

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       we had a huge show. Anyways, we have. We have you. We have Maddie Khurshid returning to the comedy stage doing comedy recently. Matt Medicaid used to open up for Rogan back back in the day and he was one of my favorite comics. Who was hilarious. Yeah, and various hilarious, so he's going to join us. We also have Sam triply Johnny Pemberton and Tony Hinchcliffe and Josh fattom and Benji. That's a good show. All right. Ten o'clock. You're freaks and we'll see you there. All right. We have on the podcast Dr Amad Goswami. Am I pronouncing her name correctly? Sir? We're going to get to the bottom of shit folks. We're going to learn some things. He's going to enlighten us.

Speaker 3:          00:06:39       Are you ready? Set. Oh, Joe.

Speaker 4:          00:06:46       Okay. Experience Joe Rogan podcast all day.

Speaker 2:          00:06:55       We are here with Dr. Goswami. Thank you very much for doing this. I really appreciate it. I've seen a lot of your videos online. I read a lot of your your work and it is some very, very fascinating and for a person is dumb as I am confusing stuff. The idea of quantum mechanics and the just when someone uses the word quantum, do you find that a lot of folks that just eyes glaze over?

Speaker 3:          00:07:23       Well, not anymore because you know the most complex, one of the most complex complex concepts of quantum physics is quantum leap is the discontinuous condition. When that gives an idea of how foreign it is to a mind which thinks in the Newtonian fashion you don't. Motion is continuous and quantum leap is discontinuous, but it's used everywhere today. Everybody knows. Right. You know if anything unusual happened, people say took a quantum leap, so that has the. What do they mean by that? I think they just mean like a big jump. I think they just been a big challenge. It's a discontinuous jump. They probably would hesitate and what does that. What does that exactly mean by discontinuous jump? I have to go back a little. Okay, so think of electrons going around the atomic nucleus in anatomy. Okay. When electrons jump from one of these orbits to another arbit, it does not go to the intervening space. However much surprising to your restaurant. Mind that is just suspend your disbelief. Imagine that the electron is here and then the electron is there and the other arpit nothing in between in space and time,

Speaker 2:          00:08:38       not so it just some sort or another they. They teleport themselves or are teleported.

Speaker 3:          00:08:44       That's it. Science fiction language capture a little bit, but where do they go in between? We have to say that, uh, they go to the domain of possibility. That's what quantum physics brings that reality, which it seems to be just this one space time reality that we call it nature. That is not true. There is another reality which must be called supernature transcendent reality. Just like this, spiritual traditions are saying, just like the psychologists are saying in the turn of the century, 19th century pride discovered the concept of unconscious, unconscious conscious to all levels of reality. The spiritual traditions of transcendent, even again, two levels of reality. Quantum physics in the 20th century, in the yard, 1925, 26, discovered the same thing three times the charm. This time we better observe the idea and learn to live with, but there are two levels of our reality. Quantum physics says one level is level of possibility. Wherever taken is possibility. Nothing concrete, no king, no king this, and then this level of reality, who are we of course live where we find things manifest, what things look like. They're particles, objects, concrete, solid liquid gases. All of these are concrete objects. We have become used to them as concrete objects, but they begin as possibilities in a transcendent,

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       so to break it down for the lay person, essentially the lowest form or the smallest form of the universe that we can measure when we get to subatomic particles, when we can look at subatomic particles, they defy the laws of physics. They exist in the same space at the same time, in two different places. They can be both moving and still and they can teleport themselves

Speaker 3:          00:10:41       a little more complex than it actually is. It's less complex than that. Less complex than thou because we have to realize these objects can be shown to be at two places at the same time, but only in possibility. No, but that's. You have to think about it. I try and I just broke my brain because to work possibilities familiar to this is why we did a couple of hours to write her own days because they're a little bit strange what is possibility, but we know what possibilities. Possibilities are things that glimpse at us, but nothing that we can put our finger to it because this so they become fact, but right now it's just an idea right now. It's just an idea. So it, it begins with our reality begins with these possibilities. A possibility of an electron being anywhere in the room. Our knowledge is limited.

Speaker 3:          00:11:48       We only know that it's possible to find the electron here. They're at the ceiling maybe at here, right? I am, but we don't know, but it actually will be if I actually tried to see it, try to measure it, try to observe it, and that's the second domain. Second domain is the domain of manifestation. When an observer tries to measure where the electron is, the observer will find it at a definite place as a particle. That's the manifest reality. So something that is a wave of possibility being, having the capacity of being everywhere without measurement becomes the concrete object that we can say, well, it's a thing there it is at a definite place. So by only by measuring it and measuring it, I'm only by. That's a very hard thing to understand. It is very hard to understand, but isn't it if you're measuring it and that's when it becomes a a concrete object, isn't it?

Speaker 3:          00:12:49       Just assuming it wasn't a concrete object before you measured it and that it's always a concrete object. That's the team you hadn't measured it before. That's the thing. Today we have a new era of physics in which we can propose something which you cannot actually see what the consequent. Don't listen to this. Please let the consequences of it can be seen. So our theories are so good that what we have visualized as theory, the consequences of it is predicted so very well that we got to believe this theory. There's no choice because the consequences of predicted like one part in $100 million to that kind of accuracy. So this is the kind of theory that just boggles your mind. We've never had the capacity of predicting something this accurately. So when the picture says that, well they started as possibility and then they become actually to have no option but to accept it.

Speaker 3:          00:13:48       Although I agree with you, it, it, it, it sounds strange. I mean anytime you're talking about supernature, most people will say, well, we already knew land, but you are not in Ireland. We are in quantum reality where quantum reality is, Ooh, land also real. That is also the thing that people need to. Uh, I mean I've had a really hard time adjusting any of this stuff, but the thing that people need to look at first I think is the idea of superposition. The idea that, what you were saying, the idea that they have measured things both moving and still at the same time and they have shown that things can leap from one place to another. So our real reality as far as science, as far as like accepted pretty much universally, right? There's no, there's no debate in the scientific community about the movement of Subatomic particles right now. Somebody subatomic particles involving discontinuing, there is no debate. So that becomes tables. That becomes Dr. Goswami, that becomes

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       the laptop. That's, that is a real tricky thing to try to wrap your head around Vl trippy thing that when you go the smaller you go, the more it becomes magic, it becomes, it becomes something that doesn't exist in. In our rational world,

Speaker 3:          00:15:10       it's different. More and tricking them. Debt. Let me claim the full claim of quantum physics is not only saying that the smaller you go, but they've brought chickens. When you realized that the reality at the macro scale is made of this small tanks, so of course they affect is visible much more easily measured in this part, the small things, but when the small things make big thing, as you said, microphones and you and me, our body that is, they're all quantum objects, so we also, when nobody is observing us, including ourselves, like when we sleep deep sleep, no body is observing me. Where am I? I am only a possibility. The only reason I can. I can find myself in the same bed every night when I wake up. The only reason for that is that because I'm a macro object, my waiver possibility, although it expansive, just as always must expand.

Speaker 3:          00:16:14       You have seen water. We've expanding, you know, in Detroit Bebo my pebble have what? The water, the water waves will expand, right? Same thing happens with west. The possibility we do tend to expand when as soon as you go to sleep as a way of a possibility, but the waves are so sluggish or macro objects for me to move substantial distance that somebody can discern it. It'll take the edge of the universe so we don't discern it. It moves like 10 to the minus 16 centimeter, but today with leisure beams, we can actually measure such small distances that these macro objects, even macro objects move while Newtonian physics of setting. No, no. They're addressed. What are common sense to say, no, no, they are not moving. But with leisure beam we can actually measure that between your looking and my looking just great. Second objects actually moves which appear to be stressed and have a totally normal. Right? So we live in a heavy, heavy, heavy, wonderfully, a creative world wide creative because this movement also suggest something fantastic that there are new possibilities and if we could capture those new possibilities and make them manifest, that takes prednisone of creativity.

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       So this what you're saying is that objects like this desk are not, in fact still what are slightly moving slightly moving all the time and what is the number that they're moving, how far it. It's fairly at the center

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       of mass of this table. For example, it's a pretty massive property. Moving a block tend to the minus 18 centimeters in a dishonorable time, like a minute

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       too. So it just sort of moves back and forth. And so the whole world we really do live in like a holiday.

Speaker 3:          00:18:06       Well Hello Graham is not always the good better for pet. It is for this case because the objects kind of appeared in more than one place. In that sense, Hologram, the information appears everywhere on the Hologram. So these objects carry information which is in more than one place potentially. It is more than one one place. This is why we say that we have discovered a new world of potential from which our ordinary reality is created, so ordinary reality is not as fixed as they taught it to us. If you allow the objects to go more and more into quantum domain in the realm of expansion into new possibility, that while it has not expanded before, not so much with tables and chairs, mine too, but we taught tarts with our feelings. Then we can really get into creativity.

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       So how would you do that? How do you go into the quantum domain with your creativity? Bam.

Speaker 3:          00:19:03       That's when then I have to talk to you about the creative process. If you look at the creative process, creativity, researchers have found that there are four stages. The first stage everybody knows preparing. That just added up. I talked with you. I get some knowledge from picking your brand. I listened to a teacher. I listen to audios, videos, Internet of course, and get some knowledge about the subject, and then creativity such as find a very French thing happens the most creative people that are not just doing preparation. They also sit quietly and do nothing. They really sit quietly and do nothing. They call it the period of incubation, like a bird sits on an egg, doing nothing. See Magic. It was a tremendous surprise. Nobody understood, why do we need to sit down in the creativity after all his action? Why do we need to sit down quietly?

Speaker 3:          00:20:07       You need to do nothing, and then quantum physicists come along and realized that in between our thinking, these objects talks. They are possibilities of meaning that waves. So like always as talking about the water, where before if a toy pebble in a pond, the water goes to expand as expanding crest lines. So same thing happens with the thoughts they expand in meaning become wave. Some multiple meanings, possibilities of multiple meaning, multiple meaning expanding, expanding, expanding. The more they expand, the more meaning this packet of possibility or contained and so you have a better idea, better possibility, better probability of, of capturing a new meaning because if you have a bigger possibility pool to choose from, obviously your chance of being creative is greater. This is the idea that has explained how creativity comes to us. Then when the actual answer appears, the new meaning that we are seeking, when it appears in the pool, and when I see the gestalt of all the new meanings that'll give answer to my problem, then I fake it.

Speaker 3:          00:21:19       Then I choose it still in the unconscious. That's where my causal power of creativity lies in the unconscious, but now it becomes conscious with the hormone. This is the quantum leap at this continuous change from possibility to actuality. So I actually captured the new job. I actually captured the new thought and and that's so surprising because it's new creativity, researcher, scholar, Aha insight. You have a heart of our heart. So the idea is that the imagination is a quantum realm. Imagination takes us to the jail. More possibility if we can do it from conscious into the unconscious. Conscious imagination is still a stepping stone to they're doing a possibility, but if we imagined consciously, that is like stoking the unconscious. That eventually gets into the unconscious, and this is where things have this capacity of propagating, expanding, wavelight becoming bigger and bigger. Pools of possibility for consciousness to choose from and when we choose a new possibility might arise or the whole combination of new possibilities my learner might arise which are contained.

Speaker 3:          00:22:31       The answer to my question, that's a very interesting way to break down creativity that I've never heard before. Absolutely. This is, I'm not, although it is not that old. I wrote a paper on it in 1988, so, but you know how communication is today. It's very complex because there is too much of it, but it, it is a, it is a fantastic theory that explains all the aspects of creativity, material, creativity, experiments, kegerator data. Um, the other theories are just inadequate to explain the creative process. As I said, just very mysterious. I call it the Doobie Doobie. Do process because you need to do, but you also need to be doing nothing to create, to create the key or the creation process has always been fascinating to me and I, I've been saying this for awhile. Then I think we don't understand. We have the idea of the imagination of what's in the mind as being just, Oh, pretend. Make believe daydreaming like that. Those, those things come to mind when we think of imagination, but everything physical that exists was created in the imagination of the imagination is a machine for creating cities. The imagination created power.

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       The imagination created satellites. I mean these are all because of the imagination. Without the human imagination, there would be nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:23:53       Well yes, and now we look at it frivolously, but quantum physics is taking a little bit further it. Imagination is a good starting point. As I said, lack of imagination is still in our conscious talk, so we have to understand that when we have conscious talks of imagination, then we are proposing the unconscious to look at new stuff, process new stuff. This is what we are doing. What imagination takes us is from ordinary reality, mundane reality that a familiar stuff, imagination inbetween hopster. Beyond that, it's imagination. It's not going to confirm to the to the mundane stuff necessarily read. We can imagine very arbitrary stuff, so what it does, it starts the beginning of a thought process where talks can become more and more and more and more weird and more and more and more and more new, but they're no longer process. It's no longer possible to process them into conscious because then the conscious, we just kind of do it.

Speaker 3:          00:25:01       We don't have the capacity. We are still limited by what we know they known imposes too much constraint on what we can imagine in the domain of the unknown, but as soon as it gets into the unconscious unconscious stuff, more reimagine the imaginary stuff will interact with other imaginary stuff that talks will mix and this mixing waves together will produce patterns, self logical patterns of interference of waves. Even mentioning super position with super superpose and creating many, many more new possibilities than before and one of these possibilities may very well be brand new that the effort has been manifested before. So it's always a mystery. How do we go from the known into the unknown? The way we go is this taking advantage of what we call quantum thinking, thinking where we take advantage of the quantum domain. They told me in a possibility where a possibility interacting with possibility create sub completely new stuff that has never manifested before.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       I've heard you say that you believe that consciousness is non nonlocal,

Speaker 3:          00:26:11       right? What do you mean by that? Well, if discontinuity. See, you are already familiar with discontinuities. Now you want to know even most, most unfamiliar, most intriguing. You know this is. This is like Voodoo. This is really good. Now getting into real cracks of the most surprising thing in quantum physics that surprised even Einstein. Einstein in his whole life could not believe this concept of nonlocality, which he himself discovered with two other later on. How did they discover it? How to discover just theory. You know, understanding what the tour addition. He never shouldn't say never. We could probably do the experiments in his young days when he was a graduate student, I did took that. Theories don't do an experiment. No. What they do is this, a creative exploration of the mind by that day to find new ideas, the new ideas, and then they then to predict stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:27:11       So I starting a idea was, and this is 1935 mind to understanding idea, was that if quantum objects to quantum objects interact, they become correlated. And this is a new word that he used in that paper. He and his collaborators have Rosen and photos, um, these people that really sound in that theory, that mathematics, that if two objects once become correlated, they kniffen when they're not interacting, even if they move away from each other, even then they can communicate, not in the usual way, not interacting with signals. Then the ducks fuse will, you and I are interacting right now, but we are interacting through a complexity of soundwave, sudden electrical wires to this microphones. That's all true signals, but these objects communicate without signals. So their communication use as a medium that can only be outside of space and time. Because in space and time, Einstein himself gave us a theory of relativity which says that nothing can interact without exchanging signals going through space and time, but these objects, quantum objects once correlated, they have the capacity of signal less communication.

Speaker 3:          00:28:34       This is what is called non local signals that local going through space, taking them out of them, how they measure that these particles are communicating. So the key is in that they measure the communication and the soul, that there is no signal because the communication took place faster than the speed of light in all local signal going to space and time must travel either at the speed of light or less than the speed of light. So if something can be shown to travel faster than the speed of light, it has to be non local. And this is what a physicist discovered in the laboratory I learned in 1982. Finally verified by Einstein was dead long time ago, 1955. So he never knew that his theory was one day. Not only prove to variety, but really revolutionized the whole world of physics by bringing in concepts of consciousness.

Speaker 3:          00:29:29       So what did they measure when you're measuring information that transfers between two particles? What are they measuring? The experiment? Is that a little bit complex? Probably for a store like this? Um, but I can give you stuff for that. I just don't know if it's intriguing. They definitely are also easy to understand because there is no signal is easy to understand how to detect it is a little more difficult because you have to talk about four times and Portland's come with a characteristic characteristic called polarization and you get more and more technical and I'm sure your listeners will get a little dry. They will, they'll run away. But, but we don't go that far. Let's put it this way. If, if, if we had it and address certain atoms with relationship, then they met. Sometimes I pair of photons one going this way, one going that way.

Speaker 3:          00:30:25       So what these experimenters did one experiment or was measuring this photon over here. The other one was measuring the photon over there in the laboratory is still separated by a laboratory distance several meters. But the way the communication went, they could flip. This is what takes, gets a little complicated. They could flip the prioritization access of the one of the photons and the other for transportation access seem to have flipped instantly. They could show this by the technology that we have now, Huh? So it was faster than the speed of light and that shows that there's not a local communication that shows around local communication between these two tiles. In case you're wondering what they are. Quanta of light in this could bundle stoplight. Now, how does that correlate to nonlocal consciousness? How to correlate to nonlocal consciousness is the strangest thing that physics is bringing.

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       The the reason common consciousness enters physics was clear even to Heisenberg. That was back in the 19 twenties when Heisenberg discovered his theory. He himself said that, okay, what is happening when we measure a quantum object before measurement, we knew the object only vaguely. Possibly the object is here somewhere. That's all we knew. We could only talk about possibility and probability, but after we measure is a change in our knowledge about the object. We know what the object is exactly. We have measured so from vague knowledge to concrete knowledge. This is what the measurement is about. Now, notice the word knowledge was used. What is knowledge? Now, if you look at the word consciousness, it comes from two Latin words come which is con with and the rest of the work comes from the Latin words, Cuba as C I r, e, scooter, which means to know.

Speaker 3:          00:32:28       So consciousness is the entity we twitch. We know so in this way, what is happening when we measure it? Change in consciousness. So hence, Heisenberg himself was thinking about that measurement process must involve consciousness. How to prove it. John von Neumann, uh, took the crucial step. He showed that the to change an object, a material object from possibility to actuality that concrete math, you could not do this with. And material interaction, no material interactions can ever change a possibility with, into a particle of actuality. I'll think about it if material interactions cannot do it, what is needed is some nonmaterial interaction. Does that mean those molecules are conscious in some sort of way? Well, that means that consciousness within consciousness must be otherwise. There'll be duality. So they are not, we don't set that molecules are conscious, but we some molecules, but have to be. We did consciousness because if consciousness is the ground of being and molecules, atoms, solid objects, objects, everything is within consciousness as waves of possibility.

Speaker 3:          00:33:48       Then we can think of this force that changes possibility to actuality as a conscious choice because what is a possibility where, but a packet of multi faceted potential, lots of stuff can happen, right? Multi-Facets and consciousness users, that particular facet that becomes concretized, that becomes sexualized. So in this way we have found not only the force that consciousness implies that changes possibility to actuality, but we know the nature of that force. It consists of choice, consciousness chooses. And so why is non locality coming in? So how does consciousness choose in an experiment like a space? Here is a possibility of photon. Here is another possibility of Fortuyn consciousness must be choosing them simultaneously because otherwise there'll be no non local communication. So the local

Speaker 1:          00:34:44       communication proves that there is some form of consciousness going on,

Speaker 3:          00:34:49       but a non vocal communication troops that there is some form of matrix that it that is involved with the communication that is faster than the that pervades faster than the speed of light communication and therefore must be outside of space and time. So there's a connection that we can't measure. There was a connection that we can theorize about and that connection has to be consciousness because it involves a change about knowledge

Speaker 1:          00:35:13       Gulf consciousness the same way universally because what you're saying is an instantaneous distribution of information. Whereas I think what a lot of people think of as consciousness is, is being sentient.

Speaker 3:          00:35:28       Yeah, that too. But this is the. This is the. This is the original consciousness. This is the. This is the stuff. This is the base, this is the base to stop. So this is why we connected to spiritual tradition so much. You must have heard that the new science is connecting science and spirituality and once it gets down to the Voodoo, they almost have to know when you get down to those quantum particles, you go, okay, what else you got? What you got over here, man, I don't want to sit down. Exactly right. So like in Buddhism, terroristic score, one, just surprising lines that you hear and then that sort of job. What does your face before you were born, you see the possibility in that parallel, what does your face, what is the face of an electron before it is born of what is the sound of 100 clapping, right?

Speaker 3:          00:36:20       One Hand clapping, right? Very poignant sentences. What does that mean? Well, Tim in quantum physics was the sound of one hand clapping possibility. The sound of one hand clapping is no sound, no sound possibility, only possibility of sound or something is there. Because if he hears something that will be sound right. If it takes the other hand, so if it makes contact with something else in the realm, right? I still don't understand how that relates to human consciousness being non local instead of contained inside the brain, so I'm coming to that. Okay, so then they say the consciousness as the ground of being. When it chooses, we get actuality. So when you force one, the polarity of one to change, the other one chooses to stay with it, stay with it, and that's a concrete measure. Concrete measurement, right? And possibility became measured concrete. We're saying that the, that the medium that chooses is the medium called consciousness.

Speaker 3:          00:37:23       The unconscious straight at that time, but now when the measurement action has taken place, there are. There has to be two observers with brains in those locations because consciousness just does not measured arbitrarily. Right? But the, the idea of those of it changing, it has to be conscious to change. It can't be just a reaction. There is consciousness and there is this observers. What I'm saying is not only we need the concept of nonlocal consciousness connecting the objects, connecting the observers, but we also need the need to get the concept that at the same time there is nonlocal consciousness, nonmaterial consciousness chosen. At the same time, there must also be the observer because without the observer, you never see anything. Have you ever. Can you ever imagine finding something without an observer without a censhare, so you have to measure the effect of the Observer.

Speaker 3:          00:38:17       The Observer is Austin got the presence of the observer changes the experiment. The presidents of separate which changes the experiment. Presidents of the observer is essential for the experiment itself. Not only nonlocal consistency, it says central, but so is the observers, and you have to factor that in when considering the possibility of nonlocal consciousness. You have to factor that in when considering the possibility of actualizing actualizing the possibility without individual consciousness looking. No actualization ever x place. So nonlocal consciousness is a question sort of. It's a, it's a, it's an unconscious existence. Things are processed, but nothing concrete happens in nonlocal consciousness. Only when the observer is there. Then this concretization that we are calling, we use the word collapsed, the webs collapse into the particle. What does this imply that before you existed, nothing else did as well. I mean, what does this imply?

Speaker 3:          00:39:25       So it implies something very strange to absolve. Initially what it implies is that before it looked you yourself did not exist before you. You didn't even exist. I understand that. But can we assume that all this other shit was already here? That's it. So the looking process of looking at the process of collapse, pub sub changing possibility and to actually do not only creates the object, it creates the very subject that you've experienced you. You're looking at you personally, but to all the other people that you live in the neighborhood with these, these buildings were real before you got there. No, no, no. They are. Well, they're real as possibility, but that not real as actually in your world or in the world period. Or is your world the whole world? Will it? Somebodies got to be present in order to get. Actually I cannot say that only me can create actually.

Speaker 3:          00:40:24       Then you'll be in trouble. You're essentially saying that if you'd never seen something, it doesn't exist. No, I get there. I'm not saying me personally, but a sentient objects. Someone someone has to observe before possibility become sexuality. Well, someone has to make it somewhat. There's a building, so we are sort of the quantum connection, right? We have the quantum connection to consciousness, consciousness, nonlocal consciousness all exists, right? Right, but that does not change possibility to actuality only in the presence of a concrete observer. Mostability changes to actually put two and two together. So what happens in the presence of an observer, Nalco nonlocal consciousness collapses, gives us our clarity. Without Observer, there is no collapsed update possibility into actuality, but then look at it from the other angle without collapsed. What is the Observer? There is no concrete. Brain. Brain is just a possibility. This circularity is the key to understanding who I quantum measurement can takes place in the brain, the circularity, this circular kind of logic.

Speaker 3:          00:41:35       The circular logic is what manifests what manifest reality from possibility it all of these devices like the human brain or human living or living Celt, living cell of an Amoeba, even simpler stock pictures, all this heavy mysterious entities that we have theorized about but could not explain the basic characteristic late life sanctions. Now we can understand how they occur. They occur to quantum measurement involving the circular logic. Dark Hofstetter, who is an artificial intelligence researcher, wrote a marvelous book in 1988 called Godel Escher, Bach in this book, conductor. These circular logical systems as tangled hierarchies, so as surprising as it sounds to joe and I'll just throw out to you, brain has a tangled hierarchy within it. This is a specialty and because it has that, it is capable of experiencing consciousness as being the subject. It captures the subject of consciousness. Consciousness identifies with the brain and brain. When the brain is involved in the measurement process, we who are carrying that brain will say, I look, I'm looking at the electronic just as you will brain looking at me. So I'm looking at Ahmed as I'm looking at Joe. Where does that come from? Before the measurement, we are just consciousness, nonlocal consciousness and possibilities within it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:13       I understand that, but I also understand that although I've never been to downtown Detroit, it's real dudes have been there to take pictures. In fact, people built it and they wrote books about it, so I don't have to go there to experience it as an observer to know that it exists. Someone, someone has, someone had to,

Speaker 3:          00:43:34       if everybody and try to all of the sudden just fall asleep including all sentient creatures, then there will be no concrete detroit. That does not mean that they. When the truck comes to life again comes to our consciousness again, as objects, it will become a different detroit. No changes don't occur that fast. You remember the waves of possibility are very sluggish for macroscopic objects, so they try to capture will appear at the same place, at the same colors, the same houses, the same streets and all of that. Except that mistake occurs in thinking that is always there. It's there.

Speaker 1:          00:44:17       I still am not understanding how the human consciousness could be measured or proven to be nonlocal when the brain, what we believe is the center of all this activity

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       that we equate the consciousness. This is a very effected if it's shut off, if it's damaged and know that it affects consciousness profoundly. So what is, what is the basis for believing that this consciousness is not proven theories. I'm out just asking like what?

Speaker 3:          00:44:53       Let's turn our light. What we're really saying. So I at the brain make it a presentation of that consciousness that we are calling nonlocal. So you build a picture of what it is. Same for everybody. It's like, think of it as the, you know, you have seen our archipelago, right? The island stand out over the ocean, but underneath all the islands are connected. So think of as connected by this overarching nonlocal consciousness, but then we are also individual brains, right? We're making. Each of us are making a representation of the consciousness that we call our subject taught. I'm a subject to the object, but I'm an object. We use the subject so we both have that as a profit. How do we know that we are non locally connected, so a neurophysiologist or the university or Mexico, the verified this. How do we know? Well, let's meditate together. He said with the idea that we will be communicating without signals directly without signals, so we meditate for 20 minutes. Then we're sent over to what is called faraday cages. The cages are cages chambers, which are electromagnetically in pervious. No electromagnetic wave can go through the walls of this package, so you and I are sitting in individual product pages. What that means is that we cannot communicate with any kind of electromagnetic signals

Speaker 2:          00:46:21       so you can't send a message, a text message, you

Speaker 3:          00:46:24       cannot send a message, you can extend an electromagnetic method thinking, get it, nothing can get in, but we are still meditating with the idea that somehow we'll communicate directly without signals and now are both of our brains that are connected to individual eeg machines, electroencephalogram, Mr. brainwaves and one of the subjects is shown a series of light flashes that of course will produce electrical activity in the occipital area of the brain and the brain web operators, the Ge will pick it up, have heard it. It appears in time come in in a graph which is called a evoked potential. When we extract the signal out of all the brainwaves, eliminating the noise so far, no surprise. The other subject is not fun. This is what the surprises, so please listen carefully. The other subject is not shown. A series of light flashes, no light process at all.

Speaker 3:          00:47:20       The other subject is connected with first subject only via this intention meditation. We will have direct communication. So how do you know direct communication has occurred? The brain with some this subject not exposed to light waves, just brainwaves of this subject was vegetating basically are picked up from the electrodes. We were a machine connected to that brain and then analyzed in exactly the same way. Eliminate the noise, extract the signal. The two signals extracted, one from a subject who has seen light flashes, one promise object which has not seen light flashes. The tool can be extracted potentials. One is the evoke potential. The other one's called transferred potential. They overlap almost exactly like 70 percent overlap is often the same. Eighty percent overlap of on sale. It's amazing. They'll not only have the same strength but also the same place.

Speaker 2:          00:48:26       So explain to the layman this, this, this. They're experiencing light flashes. The only one is experiencing one. One is experience land, not just the other one. One is all right, but the other one is has a reaction in his mind, his brain and new way. No, the light flashes

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       reaction in his brain anyway, which shows that the effect of the light flashes electrical activity somehow without signals has been transferred from one brain to the other.

Speaker 2:          00:48:59       Why was it then? I'm assume that consciousness is nonlocal fat for we. We say that the two brains are on locally connected. Han locally connected on locally connected Matrix is what we call consciousness. Isn't it possible though that the mind is where consciousness is stored, but yet it communicates mountain locally with other minds and other consciousness that are also stored in people's brains and that the consciousness is in the brain and that the non locality is just the connection? No, they were. They were making,

Speaker 3:          00:49:32       making not quite considerable scenes parties. That's not inconceivable. That not comfortable, but I'll tell you if I suppose you imagine, imagine consciousness to be contained in a brain. Imagine consciousness content in the sprain and the district, but what are you saying? You were saying that my India team, you're just. You're just

Speaker 2:          00:49:56       inventing another word

Speaker 3:          00:49:58       to convert the notion that there is a nonlocal matrix. You want to call it mind. I want to call it consciousness. That's the only difference. Okay, because look, there is a brain here that his brain here normally to loan it, to say that rain involved something else. What brain? False brain contents. Those are words we can give but not necessary. Here is the brand. Here's the brain. Somehow they are communicating right without any signals because signal could not pass through the faraday cage without any signal. This brain and this brain are communicating, communicating by like quiet, communicating with the transfer of actual electrical potential that is measurable by physical experiments, so nothing like mental telepathy, physical, physical transfer of something, physical transfer of energy without any legal transfer of a reaction, not in a physical, physical transfer of information that puts that not energy, no energy actually goes from one to the other, but the brains change in such a way that is obvious. The synchrony in the way this brand changed, but this brand changed because light flashes fall under that brain. This brain changing not because of light flashes, but because this brain is associated with this meditative awareness.

Speaker 1:          00:51:19       That's the case. Then wouldn't it do you justice to get as far away from a city as possible because aren't you constantly communicating with all the minds in your city and if if they're all in a good headspace, that's great, but if not, aren't you experiencing the crazy light flashes of a million neighbors?

Speaker 3:          00:51:37       The possibilities are there. They saving how far away can you get them filled in at the top of the mountain, positive to have that much brain action around you. Yeah. Especially if they're smart and does not need to be so much scared. I mean, it's true that some of that may very well be true in the emotional domain. I actually believed that it is somewhat true, but actually I believe it's true. I believe it's. You could feel it. Look at football stadium, we see this, right. I mean one guy becomes angry and how that anger spreads. That's spread only locally. Most of the people have not even seen the anger where it took place, the gun, so there could very well be a nonlocal component in that

Speaker 1:          00:52:21       kind of thing. A hive mind that you experienced in concerts as well. You know when you watch a concert and everyone has their hand up in the air with a lighter and they're all singing along the journey, right? Yeah. They're locked in there. Man affects us in a very positive

Speaker 3:          00:52:35       yes and so but, but how does that not happen in a sitting at equilar web? Because we would go crazy, there isn't saving guard. The saving grace is the need for correlation unless you and I have some sort of intention that connects us, we will not be privileged to communicate to this nonlocal consciousness essentially saying so, uh, in, in less we have some sort of context to put it into our own lives. It doesn't affect us as information quantum physics. It gives it more exactly correlation. We need to be correlated like that in the, in the experiment that I just described, which by the was performed first by a neuro physiologist named Bell Greenberg at the list of Mexico. But, but that, that kind of thing, uh, you know, his experiment dependent crucially on this conscious meditative intention. Um, but people can get correlated simpler than that.

Speaker 3:          00:53:44       Like in a football stadium. People are getting correlated just by simply the identification with the team that, that can correlate people on the Internet. We never see people, but we are correlated because we are some cause that brings us together. So there are many ways to get correlated. And then if people, once they become correlated certain things, I believe that, uh, it's easier to transfer emotions than actual talks and the trail, we don't correlate very well because talk rational and restaurant, it takes us away from this nonlocal consciousness. But when we are emotional, then this nonlocal consciousness can correlate us and the effects can travel much better. This is why one person, bad mood can get another person to bad mood or one person's happiness can be communicated to another person's happiness. Happiness is most certainly infectious.

Speaker 2:          00:54:44       Well, one of the reasons why comedy clubs work better, you know, laughter becomes infectious when everyone around you is laughing at,

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       well, they'll have your laughing. Meditation today is taking off like wildfire in some places. Laughing. Meditation, I think meditation. I went to India recently, Bangalore and they have parks, you know, where people gather together every morning, like at six, 6:30, and they will have this lafitte vegetation. It's, it's wonderful thing to watch and you watch your self will start laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:55:15       That's funny. You just tickle each other or no, without thinking like this is the thing.

Speaker 3:          00:55:20       Well, part of it of course is is local communication, no denying it, but that jokes and then just the way you just start laughing. It was just started laughing and it was supposed to love so everybody just. But you know, you could not maintain that kind of thing for very long. If anything, the mouth muscles will be tired and so forth. But here, because of that nonlocal correlation, which comes into play after awhile, you can see more than what you'd expect just imitating other people to laugh.

Speaker 2:          00:55:52       Wow, that's fascinating. So these people, how many of them meet?

Speaker 3:          00:55:57       Oh, like 50 people,

Speaker 2:          00:55:58       maybe 50 people in. They just get together and just laugh for how long work for 20 minutes. Just howling. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:56:09       it is kind of a very, very amusing.

Speaker 2:          00:56:13       Wow. If you forgive me, I still don't understand how that makes consciousness nonlocal I understand that there's communication, I that there's sort of a shared

Speaker 3:          00:56:25       laughing meditation, this kind of thing, the experiments you were talking about it, this kind of thing. Something unusual happens. It's not very difficult to show Deidre who is a psychologist working at the Institute of noetic sciences. Dean Radin does the following experiment. He takes what is called random number generators. These things are devices in which radioactive decay is that taking place because are completed and as you know already activity the quantum process. Completely random. Radioactive. Say that again. Ready? What the activity is a quantum process. Completely random. Random decay have taken place. These random decay is a process by computer to generate random airways of zeros and ones. So they are called random number generators, right? I've heard of this so. So we have random already supposedly, and there'll be some deviation from randomness which can be calculated. The rule sub statistics gives you that, but rather than have the tremendous insight of taking these machines to meditative places, I don't know if he has actually done this with loving meditators, but he quit. And what I'm saying is that in the presence of meditative pupil, this random number generators start behaving Nanda randomly. Nanda, I'm normally quite way beyond what the predicted deviation should be.

Speaker 2:          00:57:53       So were they concentrating on specific numbers to be generated once and it should have, you should have one. Did they concentrate on specific one group on zero, one group on? No, they didn't do anything. We're just meditating, just meditating, just keep dating. And how

Speaker 3:          00:58:15       perfect. Uh, the, the random number generator did numbers degenerate. They're not so random anymore, right? There's more zeros done one.

Speaker 2:          00:58:23       Well wouldn't that. In fact, I mean the whole idea of quantum leaping and quantum teleportation, meaning that distance really isn't an issue, right? Yeah. This is not an issue. So why is it that with these people meditating in the room with all this jazz, that it affects it. Whereas I would assume anytime you run a random number generator, there's someone meditating somewhere in the world, probably massive groups of them. How could the effect of just a couple individuals vary that much from the great. Hi,

Speaker 3:          00:58:54       very, very intelligent question. But remember I also taught, told about another factor. People have to be coordinated so that local correlation is important. Now, if you correlate and then look for this affects, send people away and they're still demand correlated because they are meditating, then that should work if, uh, if you set up a group of meditators but not in Los Angeles but in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, but they all are correlated in some ways by telephone or by internet or some intention given by a common source, ones are correlated and they start meditating. Distance should not matter.

Speaker 2:          00:59:35       Okay, so what essentially what you're saying is their energy focused on this one thing can now be measured. Whereas if their energy is not focused on it, it doesn't have an effect on it and the focusing on the thing has an effect and the poker thing has been tension. If we translate the word forecasting to intention, then I would agree with focusing is too general and Sunday the complete notion. It's something like focusing. The intention is focusing. That to me, if, if it's truly measurable, definitely shows are some effect that the mind has to accept that they weren't mind. We use two different consciousness. Consciousness. Consciousness is happening, effect, but I still. I don't know how that

Speaker 3:          01:00:21       keeps you.

Speaker 2:          01:00:22       Oh, from. I mean, I don't know how that makes consciousness being nonlocal. Oh, it

Speaker 3:          01:00:28       how you communicate. Our picture is very simple like this. You and I had transferred. Potential electrical activity was transferred from my brain to your brain without an electrical connection. The connection is nonlocal. No question, right? You're not having any difficulty with that. That's just how do we interpret it to interpret it. How could this happen? How could this happen is because you. Although we have not been exposed to these light flashes now, but you have in your brain memory of seeing light flashes, you have seen light fascist many times in your life and it's because we're correlated and no, no, because you have seen them before. So out of this memories, which are all unconscious processes, by the way, whenever you are vegetating, the unconscious brain, unconscious, unconscious because sub his brain stuff and become. They become the subjects of the objects of the unconscious for processing. So unconscious always has these memories to process.

Speaker 2:          01:01:39       That's an interesting point. Then what happens if you do an experiment where one person experiences something that they have no background in, I've never seen before. Most people don't know, nor does the other person in the room who's going to receive the signal. How does he process in that case, be very difficult. Things done memory based on the brain. Memory exists. Understanding what consciousness is choosing from that. So how did, how did shitty way to communicate? Nope, not at all. Because what a marvelous book. You have to have memory of it though, but most things, most things that we think about help, most things, they are exposed

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       to have memories of it. I mean how, how many new things? Completely new things to do. Get exposed in a day.

Speaker 2:          01:02:27       I will say with this dude on a weekend and exposed to new shits on, but grill is zero because that will be at least something coming. I understand that there's communication. What I do not understand the finding. Give the name

Speaker 3:          01:02:42       what is, how is this memory being actualized in your brain

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       as that cost or some sort of transfer of information, but not even a good one. No, wait, is it always on?

Speaker 3:          01:02:56       Wait a minute. Remembered being quantum physics thinking classically again. Okay. I'm sorry your Tanya. I'm being quantum physics Newtonian unfortunately, but that is the problem. We are all Newtonian when we are not using subtle language so you have to get used to it. I understand your brain is possibility unconsciously just giving you possibility. So unless this entity called consciousness is choosing possibility, it will not have the actual transport potential. Okay, so how can you have it transferred? Potential you potential being transferred by a nonlocal meet Matrix that we're calling consciousness because it has to be consciousness who chooses out of the possibilities of your brain generated by previous memory because you are meditating with your partner and the partner has seen this light flashes consciousness by virtue of that correlation is choosing from your unconscious which has the memory, but nothing more than that has the possibility, but nothing more than that, no actuality, but consciousness is choosing the actuality because you are meditating to receive that.

Speaker 2:          01:04:09       Sir, I'm going to have to disagree with you. This is why I understand what you're saying. I completely do, but I don't think it necessarily means that your consciousness is non local, can make an alternative model. This doesn't have to be an alternative model. Just the idea of communication and only through through information being passed forth where what you're measuring is so like imprecise the. You're saying 70 percent, right? No, no, no. Nothing in precise. Okay. There's some sort of a signal being transferred between one person, another separate papers happened to percentage. Huge. I'll tell you when, and

Speaker 3:          01:04:53       you don't meditate when you don't meditate. Right. The potential up. The other person is vegetating is practically nothing, so there's no transfer whatsoever. Adrenaline's meditating. If you don't meditate, the never found. They never found any turn for potential, but whenever they would meditate, all of a sudden there is the electric potential which is like 70 percent, 80 percent, 60 percent of the detect if a potential. There is something here.

Speaker 1:          01:05:25       Cool. There's something being transferred weekends without. Without any signal. I totally appreciate

Speaker 3:          01:05:33       matrix between the two people. I'm just giving it a name. That metrics we call consciousness, right? Because what is happening in the. In the. In the two people consciousness, remember the vehicle to know it, so what is happening is that something is being transferred which has no basis for the transfer. Transfer takes energy that is already usually experienced here is transfer, taking place without any energy transfer, without any signal transfer, holding the understanding because the possibility of that is already there in the other brain and consciousness is choosing the possibility and making it actual. How is

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       is that any different than distributing information? How is it any different than one person has an experience and relays that experience through information to the other person, cannot local signals through something, some sort of a connection? Yeah, look at signals that even but not like sound signals are being able to communicate. I mean in the meditative state, ics exchanging information.

Speaker 3:          01:06:34       If it is not local thickness than it is consciousness only. Now you got to getting it. You're just objecting to language, but

Speaker 1:          01:06:42       does the person who is sitting in the other room who's receiving these signals, do they have a memory of this? If there's, is there a cognitive impact?

Speaker 3:          01:06:50       Devastate definite signal that I'm detecting for this brain.

Speaker 1:          01:06:55       Does the person aware of it who detects it? The patient there is no cognitive

Speaker 3:          01:07:00       mission and the other person because the brain is so complex, unless you focus on something that we will never, we have not yet been able to isolate a cognitive change and the person.

Speaker 1:          01:07:12       See that's where I'm having a hard time making the leap between what I understand to be a clear sense of some sort of a communication, but how does that mean that all consciousness is long, non local? How does that not mean some real new form of communication that is evolving inside the human body

Speaker 3:          01:07:33       already got the language.

Speaker 1:          01:07:35       I'm sorry, but I mean no, it's that new form. Exactly right. Am I getting Newtonian? Did I go Newtonian on, Ya know, if Tony, they send you a farmer saying that it's but it's rudimentary right now. I'm just giving it a name. Okay. You agreed that there is something. If you're telling me, you're telling me I'm. I don't understand any of this. I agree that in your story and your story and your experience, sorry you all many times and

Speaker 3:          01:08:07       factually during this broadcast, without signals at times for up information or transfer of

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       you have put the electric potential

Speaker 1:          01:08:18       completely based on your story. I mean, spending mental data. I don't mean the story. That's a bad word for it. I have your information that you're. You're presenting experimental data to in 2011.

Speaker 5:          01:08:31       Birth order is in different parts of the world, what we call this matrix of times times far up signals. Yes. East Ohio had our differences. Yes. That's what I'm saying is that it is. If you look at the rest of our theory, because it takes consciousness. Anything information. So we call this matrix consciousness.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       Hmm. Okay. And in fact the person is receiving it on the other end. Even though consciousness is non local, the other person isn't even conscious. They're receiving it. If you want to look at it that way or cognizant

Speaker 5:          01:09:03       that would not fit help. Hey, let's put the experiment. Remember people already have data, extensive data up telepathy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:12       What's the most convincing data of telepathy that you've experienced?

Speaker 5:          01:09:17       I have myself experienced, uh, or, or that you know, again, it's subjective, so people up to object, but, uh, this, uh, these experiments called distant experiments have been done viewing remote viewing. It now done so accurately analyze by computers. You were looking at a town square at the statue. Your coordinated person coordinated by the international export export and metric is sitting in the closet in the laboratory. He's just drawing a picture of the structure that you're looking at it. Nobody knows what you're looking at. A computer has chosen who it will go to look at the statute at computer, unbeknownst to everyone connected with the experiment is analyzing the picture that with your coordinator friend, psychic is drawing of what you're looking at and then computer is bringing the two together, the picture of the statute that they are actually looking at and the picture that the person has drawn. Computer does the matching and computer says, Hey, there is 90 percent match between this. This could not be just a happenstance, this, this got to be a transfer of information. Got To be an example of telepathically.

Speaker 1:          01:10:36       What is some studies specifically have shown remote viewing tie to be that accurate? Is there anything that you could just for the folks listening?

Speaker 5:          01:10:44       Yeah. That day said Russell targeted Harold put off, started this kind of experiment. Uh, in 19 seventies.

Speaker 1:          01:10:53       Yeah. Russell Targ is actually coming on the podcast. He's, he's going to be on in April.

Speaker 5:          01:11:00       Yeah. I put, yeah, he was one of the pioneers. So distracted this and 19 slash 70, a 73, 74 if I remember it right. And he and her all put off his partner. They did a lot of this in Sri Stanford Research Institute. And um, what the new thing is that these are, the analysis is done much by very objectively. It's no longer subject, but even then materialist object to it because it's, it's still the mind, but in the experiment that I gave you, transport potential experiment of our Greenberg, nobody can object because it is not. Mine is not involve. Actually cognitive cognition got involved. People immediately start saying, well, it's subjective, but here they transfer. That actually isn't the objective domain material. Measurable Material in measurable electric potential here in material, in measurable electric potential there in between. No local connection and therefore the proof. Actually in this experiment, the transport potential experiment is the most accurate proof of nonlocality than you ever saw.

Speaker 1:          01:12:12       So that means that there's a connection that we don't know about that has always existed between human beings constantly. And the only thing that's missing is the intention and the focus on the two

Speaker 5:          01:12:28       right now it's stated it complete. Accurate

Speaker 1:          01:12:31       is. I'm sorry. Is this something that you think as we have evolved from lower primates to human beings, is this something that is beginning to show its potential in the human species is something that might improve and expand

Speaker 5:          01:12:47       if you'll believe other experimental data that people have been collecting since the early fifties or sixties. Like, um, the name of that fellow Baxter, I forget his first name. Clyde Baxter. That makes them make. Make A. I can look it up for you. Clyde Baxter, Baxter Baxter's, the last name that I know. He did some experiments with communication with plants, communication with plants. So no, that was, that was, that was one of the earliest experiments and there are others. So it's not just humans. Plants have that ability. Probably even Amoeba has that ability, but at a very rudimentary.

Speaker 1:          01:13:31       Yeah. His name was Claude. It's cleaved c l e

Speaker 5:          01:13:34       Baxter, Baxter. Okay. Lax for hell kind of name is that, but great experiment. You discarded that much, but now we understand that. No, because I could really be something in his experiments.

Speaker 1:          01:13:48       Yeah. That is absolutely fascinating that there's a perception between animals and he did it using a polygraph machine.

Speaker 5:          01:13:56       Yeah. Here's your. He was polygraphed is shit by Rupert. Sheldrake is the latest. One of the latest trends in this. He is showing that dogs communicate telepathically with their masters.

Speaker 1:          01:14:07       Yeah. I heard about this and I've also heard some other things. Rupert sheldrake has said recently, something about the speed of light varying, which a lot of people are coming down on him for that. It's a bad science and pseudoscience at best. I have that. Yeah. I haven't seen that either, but there are people in my message where we're going bananas about him because he's a very controversial character in the first place because if, if what he says is true, like the amazing randy is always offered, I think it's a million dollars for anybody can prove any sort of psychic connection. Why hasn't anybody taking that guy up on. Because he doesn't pay.

Speaker 5:          01:14:43       He doesn't pay and pitch because he always finds like, you know, it can always object. Notice the 70 percent times, but I 100 percent. Is that what he does? I don't know what he does, but he will not pay anybody looked at this kind of situation. You can always raised some objection to everything.

Speaker 1:          01:15:04       Has there ever been a study that you've seen on these dogs knowing that their masters are coming on this trip

Speaker 5:          01:15:10       movie after movie is made a movie of this and I saw the movie. It has to marketplace. I know him. I'm a good friend of his actually. So my wife and I went to his house and he showed us a movie of the dog and also the parrot parrots. He has shown also can communicate telepathically with their master's. Oh, it's amazing it dog movie. I remember very clearly. The dog is waiting in the house. He and his regular sitting place is the software. That's why as soon as the master lives, he loves her. He jumps on the Sofa and invest there. You know it. They love human warmth, warming up the sofa, the particular place where to master satin. They'll stay there, so is there and 5:00 comes right. Master is now getting up from her desk and the dog jumps and comes through the window.

Speaker 5:          01:16:11       It's time and time again. He has photograph the dog and photographs in muster, so dogs are becoming aware as soon as the master is ready to come home and that awareness is shown by the dog jumping down at that exact time, as master gets up from her desk, his guest to come home, it's amazing. He's done it multiple times, multiple times of it, and always using cameras in both places in synchrony and always exactly at that time. The dog will react and if they've mastered, does not get up from the desk dog will not get up from his sofa either. So it takes quite amazing responses. So what I said,

Speaker 1:          01:16:57       why doesn't just collect that million? No, I would say I feel like that's, you know, if you got that concept is called morphic resonance, is that not, this is,

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       he will not bring morphic resonance for discipline metrics. Part of transforming people's learning. That's a, that's a slightly different thing. You learned something. It's stored in the morphic morphic fields, morphogenetic fields. And then um, if I, I might be able to get this morphogenetic fields to communicate to.

Speaker 1:          01:17:33       Yeah. I, the, the, the, the concept I thought was kind of related because his uh, his, he deals in an interconnectivity sort of a way to with this. Well, he believes that if animals have animals, like every species have a certain sort of a database almost. And then if rats in St Paul learn how to get through a maze, the same rats in Florida, we'll be able to get through a quicker.

Speaker 2:          01:17:55       Yeah. But this kind of thing has to be taken with a grain of salt. That does. Yeah. And all the crazy shit we've talked about that has to be taken with a grain of salt.

Speaker 5:          01:18:03       Yeah. Because the transfer is occurring to this, this, this, this, this pills. The morphogenetic field. It, it, it, it may not transfer in exactly that form is what I'm. What I'm saying is that the. Originally what happened was people started this kind of thinking because an experiments seem to have done this experiment. Real experiment was that the, uh, in an island, uh, some monkeys learn a monkey model. That's how it started. And monkey mother learned to wash her sweet potato before eating. And she found that the test improves much. So she immediately talked to her offspring. So the baby monkeys are also learning that. And then the entire island of monkeys learn to sweet potatoes before eating. Somehow this was the data untopological data. I've looked at the paper and the original journal, but when somehow somebody reported on this data in a book that somebody invented an extension which never happened, which is that in monkeys in a nearby island without any connection picked up the same,

Speaker 2:          01:19:29       so it's a lie. It was based on next saturation. Very Fun motherfuckers researchers that exaggerate. That's a dangerous. That's a dangerous habit. Exaggerated. This is not a restructuring. Comedians exaggerated, but it's funny, Dan, unfortunately communicators exaggerate communicators, etc. Because we are used to attract attention. Yes. Anything for the sake of attention, so mayBe they just wanted to get funding for their research. Not that way. No researcher exaggerated. It's the only the communicators, they thing that the book will sell more. If I say something I understand. I would

Speaker 1:          01:20:07       assume that something like animals washing their food if human beings. I mean the word evolution is a very touchy subject amongst people when it comes to natural selection and the advancement of the species, but it's commonly knowledged scientifically that we were once primitive organisms and that's all that was on the planet. If that is the case, the intelligent animals like chimpanzees or monkeYs or whatever, they would, I would assume that much like people slowly all over the world figured out how to make tools with rocks, that monkeys would slowly figuring out new things. CAt

Speaker 5:          01:20:44       litter. Yeah. They themselves. no, I'm just saying that cats are born just knowing how to use the cat litter box. It's in there. Yeah, exactly. That's why they never get smart enough. Thank you for pointing that out. exactly. It's interesting because you are right and do it right, because it is true that lots of things don't get transferred. So in philly, and it is also true that there are this a case of instinct, right? There was some transparent stop, that kind of thing that universally everybody has picked up within. Then what's your feeling on epigenetics? The idea that that epigenetics are related to this morphogenic fields, so it is not very clear. Would you explain that to be sure belief was ever since darwin and after some verifications of darwin that came apart, the belief has been that genes are the only way that any heriditary characteristics learning can be transferred to subsequent generations.

Speaker 5:          01:21:44       That has been the belief right now. Now though, there are phenomena which showed that no, something else move. Very well be involved. One of the striking phenomenon is this phenomenon of morphogenesis or cell differentiation. We all begin as you and I both began as single celled embryos, right, and then that single cell divides itself divided itself, making replica itself, but it is still true that our toast cells and our brain cells behave very differently. Why? Because the proteins are very different. Proteins that are made in those cells are proteins. Proteins are made because of instructions written in the gene called the genetic code, but the genes ababa all of ourselves at the same. So the expansion is that some genes are activated in the tau proteins and other genes are activated in the brain making the brain proteins. This is why brain cells differ very much in their activity than the host cells.

Speaker 5:          01:22:54       Okay. So far? Yes. Alright, so then this. How does the cell different sessions take place? So people said there must be programs sub ditto sally's program differently than the genes of brain cells were sales and brand sauce that sand banks have different programs running the but where are these programs? Right. So initially the ability has the program must also be in the genes. Now people are seeing that no, the programs for cell different session, not in the genes, they are in the epigenetics outside of teaching. So sheldrick originally was suggesting very something very similar which is idea of morphogenetic field. And so if you assume that morphogenetic fields are they blueprints of biological form and they are non local, then there is no way, no difficulty in explaining why they tow cells behave very differently in brain cell. How does the cell know what to do in a different way when it is in the different parts of the body?

Speaker 5:          01:24:03       If it's in the in the toe, then those genes to be activated which can, which can make protein which can perform in the way if it's in the brain. Similarly those genes will be activated which can make protein which makes it behave to brain way, but how are they doing it in all in synchrony because of this nonlocal morphogenetic field that is involved, so in a way epigenetics is the first step of verification of shelter. Next idea. The next step is taken by a biologist like bruce lipton who are saying that well, quantum practice, certain balled in biology and safe quantum processes involved in our consciousness based quantum measurement theory is telling us that consciousness must be involved in this way. We can. We now can understand the whole gamut of ideas that leads to these things. And finally to connect up what you are just saying.

Speaker 5:          01:25:00       These instincts, so certain learning from the past to get passed on. So the belief is tech specific, some specific type of learning which involves emotions. My guess is that if the learning's involves emotional, has an emotional aspect, then probably the morphogenetic fields are easier to transfer the certain innate involving peers and similar emotions, egotism and suck even racism, racism, this kind of thing. But what if it is purely cerebral mental than it is probably harder to transfer through morphogenic field. That morphogenetic field transfer is a pretty fairly good idea and you have to find some explanation of the instincts that it did get transferred in windstream. Start universal. So we have a very peculiar situation. Instincts could not possibly be explained by genetics. Many people have written about this saturday, difficult to understand on the basis of genes. So if you'll bring morphogenetic field to understand the instinct, then you get the idea that yes, we can, we can today become a nicer person, have brain circuits of um, uh, love. ANd then a few generations later via the transference morphogenetic field, everybody will begin to have circuits of loving their pain.

Speaker 1:          01:26:31       Well, you bring up a really interesting point because, um, the, the chemical composition of a, of the mind, all the different serotonin and dopamine and neurotransmitters and all the different things that are going on inside the mind, it will alter those and one way or another, positive or negative and you get profound effects on how the person behaves and thinks and interfaces with their reality. How do you feel persoNally about the all the different pills that people are on and all the different pills that, that alter consciousness. It seems a very strange time when we are doing so much experimentation on a, on a daily basis, altering the way a person's mind is a, is interfacing with its reality and we're see profound effects. a lot of people don't know. NInety percent of school shooters either were on antidepressants, had been on them and we're on withdrawal. Ninety percent is a big number. I mean, it doesn't prove that that's what caused it because a lot of times these people are depressed and guess what? People were depressed. Getting on antidepressants. It doesn't mean that it caused them to be psychotic or to have psychotic breaks, but there is something to be, there's, there's, there's something to be studied for sure.

Speaker 5:          01:27:48       Well, it's very dangerous to put the natural brain under tracks of any kind, especially those drugs which are psychoactive because you don't ever know strategies there. So scanty, uh, you don't even know what the effects are and how the effects will be specialty longterm effects. And, and, and what we do know is that depression is now the third biggest epidemic disease. It's almost epidemic, but besides heart disease and cancer, depression is the third most common chronic disease who I. Is it because depression depends so much on these brain chemicals and of course so much also on how we process our stuff, emotions thinking. So something is basically going wrong in the, in the, in the new theory, um, wherever we talk in terms of chakras, because all the places where they're very much involved with our emotions, the emotion that is involved in the highest place in our body, the neocortex, emotions that are involved with specifically our, what we call satisfaction.

Speaker 5:          01:28:59       So If neocortex dIsplayed with certainly it will affect our level of satisfaction. By the same token, people might be using antIdepressant to better suit your level of satisfaction. You know what happens when you take prozac, you get sort of, you get temporarily, it will get to get, get to look at the world as okay, you're getting a feeling of, okay, they're satisfied so people are using things like that to give them a feeling of satisfaction because it's not there in the absence of taking this drug prozac, so in this way, but we don't know the consequence of taking prozac and a good brain longterm consequences of it. I am terribly, terribly upset about the drug culture because we're getting into stuff. Does every device that we need that is intimately connected with our consciousness, our brain that is no manifest consciousness. We have to recognize that to play with that vehicle, which gives us the basic way of cognition, basic way of experiencing everything that we know.

Speaker 1:          01:30:14       Conversely though, I have met people that have some sort of an imbalance, they have some sort of a chemical balance in the mind and I have personally seen people take medication and it's benefited them, greatly improved, but there's that, but then there's also people that just. They're not living a fulfilling life there. They don't have good friendships, relationships, job opportunities that they're not pursuing the career they really wanted to impress for good reason to be depressed and a lot of times with that depression is is in fact the world around you and how your body is perceiving it in the negative energy that you're getting and feeling about it. It's supposed to motivate you to change, supposed to motivate you to move away from it. The negative feelings that you have after any personal altercation with someone, those are supposed to be like, that's to let you know, hey, whatever you just did, don't fucking do that anymore. Okay, whatever. However you interacted with the person that created this terrible wave of bad feelings, it's not satisfying. It's not satisfying to you and you can't just take a pill executive to change that,

Speaker 5:          01:31:19       but the way to where to where to took kinds of situation involved here and the brain, the device itself may have wrong neurochemicals and therefore we get the satisfaction. We get depression or it can be that the psychological effect of stuff that's producing the depression. If it is the the latter psychological stuff that producing dissatisfaction. Then actually in a way it's easier because we can use psychological method. In fact, we should. I am not in favor of using brain chemicals like prozac to reestablish the balance. If the cost is psychological, if the call is coming from genetics or family history are, are clear brain dysfunction, brain imbalance, then it should be treated with what brain chemicals with, with, with madison. But If it is psychologically caused, it's better to try to improve the satisfaction level of the person and when we can, we can by bringing in the heart chakras, starting with the heart chakra where love resides. Then expression where, um, which decides and the throat chakra and then podcasting which resides in the tardive or in between the two brows, brow chakra, and then of course the crown chakra in the neocortex, which is the seat of satisfaction so we can improve satisfaction by concentrating not so much on the lord emotions, which is the lower chakras there. The emotions that you get are all those fear and sexuality and price.

Speaker 1:          01:33:03       Sexuality low

Speaker 5:          01:33:05       or know, I thought it was way up there. It's in a sense because it's a doorway to something where of have to love. So sex is actually a very special one because if used in moderation, sex is actually a very good one because it's the doorway to love. It's one doorway.

Speaker 1:          01:33:21       I've always thought that I always got pissed off at monks that don't have sex

Speaker 5:          01:33:25       coming sexist. This is why we call effing make love, right? Watching. It can. You can, you can do it the effort or you can do it. Making law. The cost point, is that what you. The way we use it, so sexist, kind of good and bad both. I mean all of this actually good and bad. Both fear is also good sometimes because it takes us away from danger. You go test. The movement is good sometimes because it gives us assurance. Self assurance, so used in moderation and negative emotions are okay. It's one day. Go out of control. Then there are problems. Positive emotions are good all the time, little or more. Love is not going to kill you. Love is only going to elevate you so you can never have too much love. So in this way, if we learn to concentrate more on this positive emotions, we could actually heal or psychological. He caused cases of depression

Speaker 1:          01:34:29       psychologically caused cases of depression and that's where you have to differentiate, correct. You have to differentiate between people who are depressed because they're in a bad state in life and people who are depressed because the mind's not working correctly and there are two, and this is not work. The real issue is the overdiagnosis than or at least the overprescription of prescribing psychologists tend to do because it's easy to treat the

Speaker 5:          01:34:53       brain chemicals. The chemical psychologist try to get away with just using drugs because the effect will be quicker. I think if we use an integration of both approaches, why they do quicker because it's. Have you ever lived with a mentally ill person is difficult. It's very difficult, so parents, of course one immediate cure, so best strategy probably is to use antidepressants immediately because that will give a temporary healing, but of course the psychological residents who will be president so it will come back, it will continue, and then they start the psychological treatment that I'm suggesting, which are already people are suggesting I shouldn't take the original credit for it, nothing like that, but this dealing with noble emotions, how are emotions? Positive emotions that healing will take time. Prozac can give us time for the prospect can buy us time so we can use a combination of both conventional and the new medicine mind body medicine suggestion. This is what I suggested is called mind body medicine because you're trying to heal the brain in balance with the effect of the mind. The health. I'll do mine.

Speaker 1:          01:36:15       There seems to be a real issue with modern humans too, and that the life that we live does not really satisfy all of our natural reward systems that we have in place. The hunter gatherer systems and sitting in a cubicle and and you know, and all of it, even monogamy is a struggle for a lot of people for, for that very reason is that we have a lot of genetics that are set up from a different time and they're still in our system

Speaker 5:          01:36:42       and we have not talked to. We have not taught very well. We don't been up and taught how to manage it. We're not being taught how to manage it correctly. Yeah. That's a very important, very important.

Speaker 1:          01:36:52       Why isn't that one of the most important things that you could teach a child is how to, how to manage them

Speaker 5:          01:36:56       back to, uh, you know, educational reform is so needed, so needed part. Another thing, you know, how do you, how do you bring this stuff to a child? You have to use creativity, obviously conditioning that. Their body is conditioned in a certain way since the days of hunter gatherers. Those conditioning are still present. Mine has moved onto restaurant wind. Look at the predicament of us learning today because some of our conditioning of the body, the remains the same as the hunter got that or nothing has changed, but the mind has moved onto purely dealing with mine. Mine does not even deal with the body.

Speaker 1:          01:37:34       Well, not only that, the environment has changed radically to the environment that your physical body's interfacing with has changed radically and those natural reward systems are not being fun,

Speaker 5:          01:37:43       not being fed. So we live in a world where we really need a new educational system which will bring this aspect stop and use creative creativity quite because these things require creative learning. What what has to happen is that the context of our thinking, which is thinking without the emotions, this has evolved so much. you know, it becomes very cerebral, tinkers, only involvement with neocortex. Instead we can. We can start involving some of what we left behind, some of the emotions that are intuitive. Some of the emotions that you have not dealt with and we have to read it tonight. It integrate how we think about emotions, reintegrate that into our present life system, which is more thinking rationally, who just thinking about thinking itself, not so much thinking emotional.

Speaker 2:          01:38:39       It's very frustrating to you as as a, as a professor for over 32 years, I believe. Right? Is it frustrating to you?

Speaker 5:          01:38:47       It was until I discovered new ways of teaching. I started putting things in an emotional way because it will get. you can reframe it. You don't have to. when we teach new physics, for example, quantum physics versus classical physics, classical physics is all study abroad, but quantum physics, because it has that aspect of choice I choose. Therefore something can happen already and emotional component can get in because whenever you say I chose, you'll find that you're a start chapter, naval chapter sort of body eagle is immediately alert.

Speaker 2:          01:39:26       Those were your ego's a body ego, not reminding the body. so that's why people are weirded out when you poked her belly button. Okay man, get off my ego.

Speaker 5:          01:39:37       There's a bit of that, uh, the, the, when, when you feel quite as quite assured of yourself, uh, do you find that navel chakra is find a quieter teeth? But yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:39:48       nice enabled massage cooler, but why do, are not feeling? So I shared butterflies in the stomach. Oh, that's interesting. Very common experience. That's interesting. And that's the connection where, where's the whole soccer thing come from? What is that from?

Speaker 5:          01:40:04       They, they did. There was no explanation for a long time. Then when the new science, they have an expedition because then the new science to introduce this morphogenetic fields as part of reality. What are morphogenic fields? they are the blueprints of biological origins, right? We went to the sell different fashion. And so neocortex has a blueprInt, the toes of a different blueprint. So there's blueprints is the, is the morphogenetic field. So in quantum physics we started that morphogenetic fields and they organs that then non-locally correlated through consciousness. Consciousness operates on one hand, the blueprints. On the other hand, the oregon's chakras are those places where the organs are present, the important part of the body. look at all the chakras. Every chapter is the site of a very important organ.

Speaker 2:          01:40:55       Is there a sexual bro? Yo, that's. What's that one called? Would that foreign is called sex chakra. It's called sex chakra. Thanks. Check. Did they work on that one in yoga too? Is that whether the girl is one of those tight pants. So that's all about the course. But you have golf course has a sanskrit name of it, the sanskrit name of it, but it's pretty complex. But there is a scientific sort of a correlation between the shock between the sex organs and the corresponding morphogenetic field. Do you practice yoga yourself? Yeah, every day.

Speaker 5:          01:41:24       It's a good thing. Not every day because of my travel schedule, but most days that I can. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:41:30       And how yoga has been around for thousands of years and some people will just dismiss it as simply stretching, but if you've never actually done it and I try to tell people, just go to one of those beat yoga classes. Just take one class or or whatever's in your neighborhood. Just take one class and then talk. Because until you do, you really don't know what that feeling is like. That feeling after yoga is your high, your high a little bit. You love people. You want to call people and apologize. You want to hug people. I'm telling you, brian, you need that shit in your life, son. We were definitely high.

Speaker 5:          01:42:03       What happened? Is that the best with of the ama

Speaker 2:          01:42:07       [inaudible] really nice.

Speaker 5:          01:42:08       Yes. The energy gets into the crown chakra satisfaction, right? Or in the higher chakras. Very definitely. so ground chapter is connected with, you know, chronic chapter satisfied. You get this endorphin molecules that the byproduct of yoga, the crown chakra. So no endorphin molecules are wonderful if that's the height, that's the high actually. So it's fairly simple explanation why we get decided and why it should not be trivialized you. There are many other ways to get high, but this is one of the best ways because at the same time your gating, getting an exercise of the muscles and joints.

Speaker 2:          01:42:47       Yes. And you're stretching and stretching like a lot of people don't think of you think of stretching. It's for athletic performance, but stretching is also for attention release. It's an amazing tension remains. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:42:58       and because that tension release now will in the future say you from february. Debilitating disease.

Speaker 2:          01:43:07       Yes, absolutely. So good. PreventIve medicine in a way and flexibility last is very difficult to repair, a difficult to. It's not that hard to maintain once you've attained

Speaker 5:          01:43:19       once you have attended and the key is not to never to completely discontinue it. Even if you can do once a week is better than not doing it at all.

Speaker 2:          01:43:27       You know what the problem with yogurt though? Fake yoga people. You know what I'm talking about. You do people that are claiming to be spiritual and showing up a yoga classes, but the really annoying. Do you know those people? You do. Right,

Speaker 5:          01:43:43       but, but the point is of course that you know, there will always be effect pupil.

Speaker 2:          01:43:47       There's always going to be bumper stickers. All there's

Speaker 5:          01:43:49       going to be bumper stickers. You cannot avoid. This thing is not the real thing because of the effect.

Speaker 1:          01:43:55       It's very true and in reality it's a small percentage of the yoga people that are fake. It's a tiny percentage and if you, and if you think about the general scammers in the population, there's always going to be issues with men in male ego and posturing and there's always going to be easy. I mean similar issues with women and women dealing with other women, but I, I've seen the fake yoga man and I've seen the fake yoga woman. I'll take the fake yoga woman everyday. Fake yoga man is trying to get laid. The fake yoga woman is just trying to be pretend to be a little more spiritual and not materialistic than she truly is, but the fake yoga man, it's just trying to get laid. He's annoying

Speaker 5:          01:44:39       and then maybe one out of 100, but that's enough that these things. I think that some people will get into the new age movement with the idea of finding relationship, which in a way of course is finding.

Speaker 1:          01:44:55       I love how you just put that, know what they're doing. they're trying to get some pussy. There's a big difference between find a relationship and just

Speaker 5:          01:45:03       sometimes they tend to be just finding a one night stand, which is of course their language is quite accurate.

Speaker 1:          01:45:11       Well, I think it's they're trying to appear desirable and one of the ways to appear desirable to women to be introduced, which is supposed to be spiritual. Yes. Yeah. That's a trick.

Speaker 5:          01:45:23       That is all true and I'm sure that as quantum physics, quantum fakers

Speaker 1:          01:45:32       fakers, and I'm not trying to focus entirely on the negative, but I'm trying to address what I know people in the general public, the issues that they have with, with folks that claim to be spiritual. It's like you'll run into a fake yoga person and you're like, oh my god, you know, either the typically unique guy with his beads and this is hemp sandals and you just want to punch them. Right. You know what I'm talking about?

Speaker 5:          01:45:55       Like didn't you have to wait? You have to be patient looking at the other side. Tell you a story, a typical hinduism teaching story. Okay. So if tiff comes to the master spiritual master and the at the end of the night, which are master of course stay with me. No problem. So the toughest stealing this stuff, all the whole thing. So the buster opens the eyes and says, do you remember, did you remember to take everything because you know, I really don't need that stuff over there either so you can take that tube. So tip is caught. But he's very surprised. Know master is not throwing him in jail or the police or anything like that. So he's become a little curious. So he lays things down the way or you not angry because I'm feeling your stuff right? I said for most of this stuff, look, I don't really need it.

Speaker 5:          01:46:54       I still have attachments so I keep them. So if you're taking notes, okay. So it beComes a littLe more curious and it says, well, since you don't mind me stealing it anytime, why should I have to steal it at the end of the night? Let me stay with you for a few days just watching your metrics and what you do. Then I'll take them awaY. At the end of the week, my son says, yeah, fine, just stay with me, so it just stays for a few days as he looks at the master and tries to do some of the stuff. He sTarts changing by faking. Initially he thought you'll just fake the monster because then he'll pick up the faking and then his stealing capacity will increase manifold because it will impress people by being a spiritual man. People will have. You will have more access to more houses and he will be able to steal more.

Speaker 5:          01:47:49       That was the origiNal idea. This is why you wanted to watch the master, but then as It did two things, meditate and sit and talk to people. After even a few days it started changing sodium so it can begin with the fake and ended up with something else and of course master knew it all the time. So at the end of the seven days, master says, okay, now you take this stuff and leave. Why are you belonging your stage and the and the and the fellow calls on the feed. That's an indian medium of saying surrender subsets that, no, I want to learn what makes it you. I'm not interested in stealing the small stuff anymore. I want to steal the stuff that you are made up so it's so where we can make even use sub this faith is. It's amazing by being patient with the people who are faking and just allowing them in the process because although the initial intention is superficial, but as you ruled them, consumption itself, consuming this very wonderful stuff, very wonderful behavior will begin to give the idea.

Speaker 5:          01:49:07       Or maybe I can become a producer. these energies that I faked by meditating, if I actualize them, then they will actually produce changes in meta profound and um, which should open the gates for that rather than closing it by saying, oh, you are just a fake instead. No, we're a little more tolerant about them. I am. I am kind of losing the quantum language. Although they have no idea what they're talking about. But then, but then you explain it one time and they'll become a little curious. And initially their curiosity will be, I can pick up a little more and impress people a little more medevac, covenantal, more curious, more curious. One day they'll ask, well, can I actually start doing this stuff? And really be creative. Wow. Didn't find in one, said, if you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics, uh, well, one of them now, many, many sayings.

Speaker 5:          01:50:13       This could come from niels bohr who said that if we will talk to you, understood quantum physics, then probably didn't understand it at all. So that many, many, many things about quantum physics, man said something like, nobody understands quantum physics. One time he did say something like that. So why do people say something like that? Because quantum physics at some level becomes so incredibly mysterious that India, first of matter consciousness can be involved. This is just such a inherent mystery. Many people are savvy, heart put to accept this kind of thing. So they would rather have nobody understands quantum mechanics then except that consciousness is needed to understand quantum mechanics. So these are the barriers of new thinking coming into the field of science. But you know what, because experimentally we are verifying the idea of nonlocal consciousness. We are verifying the idea that really eased at nonlocal connection between people or the way we got knowledge named the consciousness is actually nonlocal.

Speaker 5:          01:51:29       that verification will go a long way in changing the paradigm, changing the world. How did yoga get discovered? How did they figure out that these poses and stretches could open up your mind and, and, and, and change your consciousness. What, what is, what is the history behind that? Well, the original, if you read patanjali's yoga sutra, he just introduced us author yoga as a way of finding a comfortable place to meditate. Originally the idea was just to sit comfortably and in order to sit comfortably in meditation for a long period of time. Stretching helps, and then they discovered one very wonderful thing. As people meditated the bain job of meditation, they found this to create gap between tots. You slow down your mental process. So once they discovered that the idea of slowing down the mental process helps enormously, or creativity or spirituality. Once they found that out, then they realized the next wonderful thing is that isn't yoga also a way of slowing down. The body Is in front I a way of slowing down the breaths and therefore all the arguments, so the interest group at your eight self, I'll tell you a gauge self is not just stretching or just working on the joints. It's also weird to slow down the body and therefore the mind is alternately it indirectly slowing down the wind because if the body is slow, wind will also be slow

Speaker 2:          01:53:08       by focusing on the poses and your breath in your throat.

Speaker 5:          01:53:12       Not so much like bikram Yoga, fast yoga, but in the original way that you've done. That's quite slow. The slow yoga is actually even better than the first year, but not at the festival. Loses everything of yoga festival is also good, but they'd be even better because it slows down. The body slows down, the mind slows down. The vital energies slows down our emotions. It gives you a lot of breaths between your fast, fast, fast go, go, go mind, and especially important for developing creativity because creativity is enormously dependent on that unconscious processing, doing nothing, do and be so. If we do yoga regularly, we really don't differ. Need meditation or goodwill day, we can just do yoga and get the benefit on the mind from yoga, lower that that is goes a long way for our creativity.

Speaker 2:          01:54:10       There's a lot of ancient texts that connect yoga with cannabis, use yoga with how she shoes and and and even eating cannabis. Are you familiar with this? you're now familiar with. Oh, look aT you. Your slide devil with that smile on your face. Someone's got a reputation to maintain and no, I don't really know that. From that point of view. Do you have any experience at all in a psychedelic? I do. A little less certain tried. I've been in this faith if it's not against the law to what do you mean? Marijuana? Yes. You have to take a very mild or atlanta. So I was going to ask you about some mild in one time and one time what it's about samsung or something very familiar. I'll look at your old school devil. Exactly. So, so a friend of mine comes from Washington with the Washington, don't play games exact seattle's in the house. So, so, so, uh, we, we take this stuff with him and we put it in cookies, right? Oh yeah. And iT doesn't, it doesn't take effect for an hour and 20 minutes, 20 minutes, nothing is happening. So we said, well, let's go to dinner. This is a classic story.

Speaker 2:          01:55:32       We go to dinner and all of a sudden I'm just eating my first course. I'm looking at the, looking at the lights of the city from a window and it starts exploding.

Speaker 5:          01:55:46       Wonderful. So my wife was the third question on the table. She also starts feeling something and she has to go to the bathroom. So she goes on the way back from the bathroom, she passes out. Whoa. So I'd have to, I have to go and try that. Okay. This is my woman.

Speaker 4:          01:56:12       I will take her. I had to.

Speaker 5:          01:56:19       Anything. So probably she got weak and therefore best out, don't pay any attention to her. I'll take care of it. And this friend or people from Washington, they have to watch them. This friend doesn't know me. He doesn't know her. Just walks away completely. It doEsn't go anywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:56:37       It just left you guys there. Just left those guys there. Wow. What an asshole. That guy is. He caught up and apologize. Oh, eventually. Did he know that you guys had taken pot cookies? Cookie or a brownie? Wasn't he was taking. We're gonna go to jail. I didn't want to be a part of it. I still get caught up in that. In that difficult situation in the future. And for folks who have never heard me say this before, even though I've said it a million times, when you eat cannabis, that has a completely different psychoactive effect, right? When you're telling me,

Speaker 4:          01:57:08       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:57:12       When cannabis is processed by the liver produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite, which is a approximately four to five times more psychoactive than thc. So that's why It has that insane effect. It's not just insane. It's an alien effect that you don't get when you smoke pot eating. It is a very, very different experience and you could easily overdo it and it looks like maybe your wife just got so hot. She's like, I'm just going to pretend to be blacked out. It's way less stressful than walking around.

Speaker 5:          01:57:39       Well, she did say that she was faking interdental bit.

Speaker 4:          01:57:42       See,

Speaker 5:          01:57:48       she did have to lie down and they fed them anonymous. affect mine to be under it and then driving under it, you know, this is why I don't really like the idea of legalizing marijuana in a sense because driving with marijuana at least be oral kind. It's very, very difficult to. I mean I tell that driving experience was the most difficult power in my entire life. I've never had that. It just, it's impossible to gauge time. How time is going,

Speaker 4:          01:58:23       time. There's fast. Did it change? Did it change your ideas of the quantum world pot brownies. So like connected to. This was before the, before the discoveries

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       of quantum physics that I went through, but really those, this is pre quantum physics quantum era, the early eighties. So in the early eighties, you were a standard. A nuclear theorists are struggling. I already came out of bed, but I had not found. I discovered the new possibilities of quantum physics. Yeah, yeah. Before you discovered all this stuff, you weren't really a happy guy, were you?

Speaker 5:          01:59:05       No, that was a very unhappy guy. In fact, you know, my, my, uh, my change came only after I realized it. one day I was at a conference on nuclear physics giving a paper, erudite paper, of course, nothing to do with everyday life and I give this paper gusto. Nobody appreciates it at this. So I taught and I think that the other guys, although they are talking about equally esoteric nonsense, but they are much more appreciated by the audience and at the party, especially by the women. The first sex.

Speaker 2:          01:59:38       Oh, I'm jealous. I'm just jealous, jealous, jealous.

Speaker 5:          01:59:43       Sending that equipped. And that way, the whole party, the whole evening at 1:00, I get disgusted with myself because all my pumps are gone. You know, this,

Speaker 2:          01:59:53       tom's digestive hard buttons, pills you eat, a lot of times those days you weren't, you were upset.

Speaker 5:          02:00:02       I'm upSet, so I go outside this, this is that on the on the monterrey bay, rePlace Scott Russell. Omar and I have this ocean breeze hit my face and I thought, why do I live this way? They this happy with so I literally, I literally avowedly was the practitioner of happy physics since then. Of course I didn't find it immediately the way to be happy doing physics, but eventually found it is consciousness. Physics is happy, happiest years of physics that I ever hoped.

Speaker 2:          02:00:40       So what? What was this change though? You, you're sitting out there. The water hits your face. he's thinking and what? Think it's an intuitive thought to change one's life. This is the kind of thing that happens all of a sudden and you are not the same anymore, but you're not. You weren't like descartes was visited by an angel in his dreams. You know what I'm saying? Like your changes. Like I just went outside and I'm like, fuck this, you know, on mushrooms, not the. No, no drugs, nothing. It was a moment that intuition at moment of knowing yourself because I was ready to look at myself. You were ready to look at yourself because before you weren't

Speaker 5:          02:01:18       before I wasn't before. It didn't matter to me that the physics that I do has nothing to say about the life that I live and all of a sudden I wanted to really live a meaningful life. I wanted to do something that has meaning, not just in west to get ahead in my profession. So I wanted to integrate. I want to integrate my professional with my daily life, how to love my wife. I put up children how to get on with trends better, you know, live life, not just to physics formulas and publish papers and get promotions in the department.

Speaker 1:          02:01:52       Wow. So it was just one moment. You just had enough and that's when you went into the woo world.

Speaker 5:          02:01:58       Well, quantum mechanics, not immediate. Slowly, slowly and um, a lot of struggle, a lot of experimentation, a lot of steps in between. It took a lot of time too. This was 1973. I might discover a kevin 1985. So 12 years of quite a risky, adventurous path, but words came.

Speaker 1:          02:02:22       Now there's another thing that you said that I read that I found completely fascinating is that you don't believe in freewill.

Speaker 5:          02:02:31       Well, I do and I don't. You do it in the sense that yes, creativity has the component of favor. Well, it starts with the free will of the ego. Ego has one freewill, but she's very crucial element of creativity, which is bad. At some point they got to realize this, that it really does not know and therefore start saying no to all conditioning, nor to condition meanings. Now to condition habits, no to condition patterns, nor to condition behavior, and that's when we make room. That's when you have an open mind. We make room for learning new stuff and that's when creativity can come to us before then we start really thinking that we know it all with our reservoir of knowledge because I have a lot of expertise. Therefore I know that expert is don't bring us knowledge. Expertise just bring us a very special fraction of knowledge that is useful to solve certain problems that would given context because the context is known.

Speaker 5:          02:03:42       Therefore, the expertise always says, well, somewhere in my expertise there is an answer and it will develop a habit of finding that answer fairly quickly and people, people admire that. Of course you go ahead in your society because they are very efficient problem solver, but I they did sing that happens with an open mind. They start to realize that there is a real life. Problems are not given within contexts. The contexts are not given to you. You have to discover not only the new meaning, but also the new context of it. And this is what makes real life problems very difficult. This is why we're touching about this earlier. We don't learn that stuff, you know, they sent her brother are sitting in me how to integrate that with the abstract thinker of today. This is not given in any book. They said, not given within given context.

Speaker 5:          02:04:36       So how do you get into this kind of thing? Have To creativity. You have to become open first. That okay with this rational mind, which has only learned about abstract thinking. You're not going to integrate our, my emotions of the hunter gatherer days, uh, with the one that is today who is all the suppressed emotions. They're not going to integrate. We have to open up, we have to recognize our ignorance completely and invite creativity in our life. so that idea, that idea was the most important idea probably that eventually, you know, changed me as a person.

Speaker 1:          02:05:12       Wow. So the, the idea that is so insane. I'm sorry, this is hard, hard way to hurt a widow, wrap your head around it, but in saying that you have freewill and you don't have free will at the same time.

Speaker 5:          02:05:28       So this is, this is the freewill. This said this is the free world, but in other things with what is our, well, what choices, what flavor, what flavor of ice cream?

Speaker 1:          02:05:38       Well left or right, good or bad, on the basis of what you know already, right? Well, basis of what you know and what you've learned and what we admire in someone who's learned. Exactly. Someone who evolved. Exactly.

Speaker 5:          02:05:51       Okay. So on the basis of the known, all the answers are conditioned among the condition spectrum of knowledge and that that's really not, you know, it's sort of freedom, but there's nothing to kroger. It's freedom. I mean, nobody would give up that freedom if it tied and comes and says that, no, you don't have the. You don't have the choice to choose a flavor of ice cream even I have. You have to. You have to take only one flavor. Of course, all of us would object and immediately we know we don't want that will become rebellious, but it's that a different order of magnitude than what is needed to discover really new stuff. That freedom, that freedom, which takes us to, to really new and they're the ego's threewill is not very helpful. We have to open up to what means spiritual tradition is called god's will. Is that god separate from us? No. It's also our will in some sense, but coming from a higher consciousness, that's the difference coming from that nonlocal consciousness. So real freedom of choice is beyond egos, freewill to that freewill. That enables me to choose creative answer. Creativity, well,

Speaker 1:          02:07:08       okay, so real freewill only exist sort of in the base animalistic world and at the higher levels of consciousness, free will doesn't exist because you're connected to the collective consciousness.

Speaker 5:          02:07:25       No, no. Stay there a little bit inaccurate. There was some accurate in it. It it. It does not exist necessarily. Also in the non rational, the in the emotional, non rational experiences of the pre restaurant. Either it comes to the, comes from the intuition, the next level, so it really is the higher function except you're right. In one sense, if we go out outside of the irrational, rational is our biggest enemy in defense of free will, in the higher sense is a bigger enemy of intuition than already more sense.

Speaker 2:          02:08:06       Rationality is the restaurant, and so the idea that you can rationalize any evil or abusive behavior for the head of a corporation because it makes money for your

Speaker 5:          02:08:16       right, that that restaurant I fashion is our biggest enemy. Even bigger than emotions in defensive to include emotions, to improve positive emotions, positive emotions are very helpful too to intrusive.

Speaker 2:          02:08:28       So how would you describe what the rational thing is? The biggest enemy of what that sort of thinking can also be a friend. I don'T want to sound overly again. Can be rationalized. Everything you mean? Rationalization, stage, rational thinking, rational thinking is good generally.

Speaker 5:          02:08:47       But we don't do it all. Only with that we can, we can justify it. Like today, scientific materialists, they justify everything, all of their, uh, all of the. Even the worldview itself, right? But that's not as a way that could not be spiritual. It could not be god because everything has to be made up better. What else can it be? That's their, that's their argument. Basic argument just boils down to this. What else can it be? There is only this matters. A pastime matter. Muslim world. That's nothing else. If you started an assumption like that that's sort closed as you completely, that's not freedom anymore, he will lose freedom because you're not able to suspend your belief system. If you suspend your belief system, many other experiences immediately find meaning, but it has this kind of reciprocity picked clothes, emotions, intuition.

Speaker 2:          02:09:41       There's a problem with the definition. The word rational like you, like you're being irrational, you're not being right, have some rational thinking and then rationalizing, which is a negative. It's a very strange, but if the idea of taking it, taking it

Speaker 5:          02:09:55       too far, when is that rasterized? WhaT we are really saying is that you are using restful thinking to where it does not belong. That's rationalizing. We'd asked analyze the way where intuition belongs to rationalize the way her emotions belong. So in Australia, the new science, the new science does it admits it's the science of experience, not just a sensory experience. That material is, I'll agree with a new science says that our emotions, our thinking and already intuition. All three are valid ways of knowing and audition to sensitive. So we have four valid ways of knowing physical, vital, mental and super mental, deep intuition. And when we imply all four ways of knowing, we go beyond it as not being international being we go only the physical way of knowing and the mental rational, logical way of knowing.

Speaker 1:          02:10:56       Michael shermer has a great point, a great quote, rather than the only thing smart people are better at rationalizing their dumb ideas, which is a, that's a very funny thing when it comes to certain, uh, certain focuses, certain things people do rationalize, you know, whether it's a environmental disasters or you know, doing things in other countries that are unethical or immoral, you know, the, the, the ability to rationalize and especially the ability to rationalize on a large scale like as a corporation is a key problem with the civilization, isn't it?

Speaker 5:          02:11:32       Keep prompting, keep problem, and how to get out of it. I have a whole method of getting out of it. How do we do it? I call it spiritual economics. This same idea, like the earlier story that I told you this, he found the wise person. If it was that idea, if we feed people these spiritual stuff as consumer good, right? Suppose you could go out in the market and buy happiness in the company of a sage was very being makes you happy. I've met such people who were, are at, what do, I mean? Does that make you happy? You can, you can lead them a little bit difficult because they don't appear in every the marketplace and not, not, no, no, not like steven greer's, but we could manufacture these people. I think We now have the key. We know about creativity so much today that deep people are investing. I think we really can inspire a lot of very capable people in a lifestyle which will generate happy.

Speaker 1:          02:12:39       Well let me tell you something, what we're doing because this is not something we ever set out to do. When brian and I started this podcast three years ago, it was just on a laptop in my office and we were just trying to have some fun and we just doing it just to be silly. We had done previous things like that, webcasts where we had done them in hotel rooms and you know when we were on the road doing stand up, but over the course of three years, one of the things that's happened is people have told us that what they've gotten in this podcast and this communication is they've gotten an ability to interact or at least here people interact that are like no one they know, so they're, they're, they're, they're changing the way they think about life there. They're seeing that there's other ways to look at things and in fact a lot of your reality is shaped by the way you choose to view the world and that you can morph that and change that.

Speaker 1:          02:13:31       In this podcast, and again, we're not taking credit for it because I didn't know it was going to happen, has had an amazingly profound effect effect on people. Whereas I've talked to literally hundreds of people that say the podcast changed their life and that once they started listening, they started eating healthier. Exercising. They feel better. They think about things better. They try not to be a shitty person. They try to be positive and they understand and feel the effect of this positive thinking. Yeah, I, I agree with you, and again, we're not taking credit for this. This is something that just happened on its own. It just, is it a side effect of allowing people into your life and into your way of thinking,

Speaker 5:          02:14:11       openness, that openness that says that. Well, okay, we have this avid. Yes, and let's open it up. Even though it's only for a couple of hours. Switch to is that I should really make a call to my wife because I told her five. Five.

Speaker 1:          02:14:24       Yeah. Well we're going to wrap this thing up anyway. It's 5:30. I don't want to wear you out. Listen, this is a. This is a beautiful conversation. Fascinating. You're, you're a very, a really, really interesting and intelligent guy and it's hard to follow a lot of what you say. A two. I think a lot of people are gonna. Listen to this podcast. Three or four times.

Speaker 5:          02:14:42       I think you did good. Thank you. How, how the things are actually depends a lot on the language we use and it is the fact that we have a habit of using languages like mind and consciousness in an anonymous way that science cannot be done that way. What happens then is we don't understand each other anymore. So here you are not so much conversant with the new science vocabulary anD here I am without teaching you any recovery. Just get right into the discussion. And we had a discipline and some words.

Speaker 1:          02:15:19       What? I don't even think it was a dissonance quite honestly. I think, um, I was just trying to really, uh, ex. I was trying to play the part of the person that is listening to this for the first time. I'm aware of these concepts of I'm aware of your work and I really do appreciate you coming on the podcast, talk about it, but it's a, even for someone like me who's read at least a half a dozen books on this stuff, it's hard to wrap your head around.

Speaker 5:          02:15:44       It is hard and it is also simple, right? I often say that quantum physics is simpler than newtonian physics because newtonian physics, you've got very quickly the idea that science can solve everything and in, in, in, in, in quantum physics, because the choices brought into for it from the beginning. ImmeDiately start relating that, hey, I know about choice. I know about this stuff. Is sciences giving us this stuff immediately, mine mellows out a little and science become more humanistic.

Speaker 1:          02:16:16       The last thing I wanted to ask you about ken. Ken, let you go without this. Um, are you familiar with Dr. James Gates? No, he's a theoretical physicist. I'm a professor of physics at the university of Maryland. I'm with another guy named john. He's the john toll professor of physics at the university of Maryland. He found self-correcting computer code in the equations of string theory. Um, I don't know if you've, if you've heard about this. It was a really interesting, again, really hard to follow conversation that he had with neil degrasse tyson who we've had on the show. And I talked to neil about it and even he was trying to wrap his head around the what, what this meant, but they found double and even self dual linear, excuse me, doubly even self dual linear binary code error correcting block quote, which was first invented by claude shannon in the 19 forties has been discovered and embedded within the equations of superstring theory. You're laughing at this. It's almost like you.

Speaker 5:          02:17:24       No, I'm laughing because here we are talking mainly about quantum physics and consciousness sedentary. You go into such a sophisticated discussion of something that is remotely connected with quantum physics of course. But um, you know, it could very well be, but I'll tell you something, they lost interest in such details. this is fairly simple. String theory is a good example of what the idea that people propose when they say the word pseudoscience. Pseudoscience field of sciences that were theory and experiment are both not physical aspects. It's just to re. This is a good example of just theory because string theory can never be very far in our experience. We just cannot do it. It's talking about too high and energy that we cannot simulate in the quiet, in the laboratory, nor in the high energy cosmology. So in other words, it's really a very, very, very, very, very, very far out.

Speaker 5:          02:18:26       So you know, here we are at once the rational culture that we call scientific materialism that's intended date to talk about a string theory, which is highly abstract mathematical theory, not that they're not interesting as a mind game, certainly interesting. And then they'll object things like telepathy, which is very much human. Where the objection of course is that it may not be quiet our proper science because there may not be in a good theory. There may not be any good data. so it was very strange. We, we, we do because it has mathematics in it. We call science, which cannot be ever be verified. Quite doable. science

Speaker 1:          02:19:13       be science if it's not verified, but it yet it's mathematic. If it's math,

Speaker 5:          02:19:17       I agree you agree with me, but say this is what puzzles me, that, that the culture is so obtuse that they don't have, they will never collect. There are many concepts like that. You know, which because of that mathematical nature, they're accepted part of science because their mathematical, because mathematics is so vital, it just felt

Speaker 1:          02:19:41       so. You're not interested in this because there's literally no way to know whether it's correct or whether it's just daydreaming, right? So I have a crazy way to make a living

Speaker 5:          02:19:50       vaguely interested because the one thing there is something good, very good about theory because it does enable us to connect gravity to quantum physics and that that problem is not to be underestimated, but I don't want the solution to come in the form of a theory that can never be very far. Right? So people should recognize that science has two prongs. In fact, in my judgment, tree theory, edification, experiment, and then technology, there's never going to be any technological application of something like string theory. Never, never. IT's just too abstract. Taking place in places that are so remote from the human experience that technology, technological breakthroughs on the face of it is, you know, at least for high energy physics, you could always give it technological justifications for in the form of weapons technology. Not particularly good, but why technology at least is that feasible offshoot of high energy physics, but these kinds of stuff, you know, it, it, it, it's just been too far from my for my taste. We should concentrate instead of problems which can immediately be addressed, problems that has impact on who we are, what we are, what we are doing here, give us answers to real life questions like how to run our life, how to run our society, how to run our economy, and we have designs at hand. That's what the New science is trying to do. Instead we have too much emphasis on things that have not much to do with us. The human condition superstring theory, like super string theory.

Speaker 1:          02:21:43       Yeah, I, I've never been able to understand that and I'm glad that you couldn't understand it either or that it can't be understood or that it leads to camp

Speaker 5:          02:21:49       verify, but it doesn't need to be. It doesn't need to be understood because it can be very far. That's my simple proposition. Who needs to understand things, clutter up your rein up for things which has no consequence in my life, and cannot even be very fair and can never be built. Never give rise to any technology that I can relate.

Speaker 1:          02:22:10       There's so much crazy shit to concentrate on. That is actually real. Right on. Thank you sir. It's been an honor to talk to you. I really, truly appreciate it. Um, what could people with. What books do you have out that you recommend that people could pick up to learn more about, about some of your

Speaker 3:          02:22:25       work when they basic quantum physics stuff is best done in a book called the universe. God is not dead is another one. God is not dead is another one. And how quantum activism concepts civilization has some of the consequences of this theory to society.

Speaker 1:          02:22:41       do you have a twitter page? Yeah, of course you do. Yes, I didn't find it. I'm gonna. Go swami. See you're funny on twitter here. So I could send people to it. Um, yes. Um, nope. That's not you. It was some crazy. Dude is laid here is love but innocent here is knowledge. But creative, here's life, but that's not you. Right? That's whack. You wouldn't write something that whack. Who is that guy catches me? Is that you will find you. Do you. Do you know what your twitter name is? You don't know what it is and no to someone else do it for you. Yeah. Hmm. That's ridiculous. There's a lot of young there. Unfortunately. There's a lot of goswamis a shorten via a whole lot. How many? There's a bunch of different ones on twitter, belieVe it or not. yeah. You've probably got a lot of fakers. There's dudes who were, you know, what did you say? No, but I'm telling you there's a lot of fakers out there. Huh?

Speaker 6:          02:23:48       Can I ask a quick question on the, on you said earlier in the podcast that, you know now because of lasers and stuff like that, you can measure particles a lot more accurately and that's how you found that, you know, particles actually are moving. Do you, is the laser itself, uh, is that an accurate tool? Has that been proven to be 100 percent? Because what if it was just, you know, the laser saying that, but then down, you know, 20 years from now you find out, oh, it was just the laser.

Speaker 3:          02:24:15       NO, no, no, no measurement of distance. So I'm part of macro object like a, we're talking about tables and chairs at that time in between, you're looking at my looking. They moved so very little and it's very hard to observe with just ordinary way that we measured like triangulating and all that. But with the laser beam, because lasers traveling fairly, very close to a straight line, the diffraction effect is actually gone. Very good straight lines. So triangulation becomes very accurate because you really can go a long distance and even that small of a, even that, even that small measurement do contract for measuring.

Speaker 1:          02:24:59       I found you on twitter. Your twitter handle is quantum activists, quantum activist on twitter. So ladies and gentlemen, please follow him on twitter. I'm going to write that right now. Follow. Okay. And thank you very much. Really appreciate it. It's been a real, a true pleasure. Talk to you. I really, really enjoyed it and if you ever want to come back, if you have anything that you want to promote, please come back on. We would, would love to have you. We'd love to talk to you more. it's a real pleasure. have leftover. Thank you. Uh, if you go to audible.com forward slash joe, you will get one free audio book and 30 days off of audible, the premier audio resource as far as like audio books and podcasts and comedy albums. It's a beautiful company. And uh, they uh, had been supporting this podcast for awhile, so we appreciate them very much. A audible.com/joe. Go there. Get yourself a free audio book. Is any of her books on available on audio book?

Speaker 5:          02:25:56       Um, I don't think that they're all available as ebooks and kindle. Oh, they are. But nobody's done an audio version of it. I don't think anybody has done an audio version. In fact, if you can inspire some of these people to do it, I'd love it. I'm sure they would love to do, do they? it's on amazon. Um, see if there's an audio version of it.

Speaker 1:          02:26:21       Yeah. I'm sorry. That's an inside joke. Thank you sir. I really appreciate dr. Goswami. I'm at. I'm at my same right, right. Absolutely. Okay. Well, how do you pronounce it? Amit? Amit goswami, the quantum activist, just quantum activists on twitter. Thanks also to onnit.com. That's o and it go there. I use a codename brogan. Save yourself 10 percent off any and all supplements. I'm a thank you to death squad.tv. We got a big show or he's got a big show coming up this thursday. That's next week in. It's already past thursday, friday next thursday in san diego at the american comedy company. A fantastic little club in san diego. it's yoshi, obayashi billy bone now jason teebo, tony hinchcliffe and brian red band. It's a hell of a show. San diego. Go on down. And then tonight at the ice house in pasadena, 10:00 PM show bryan red band, tony hInchcliffe, maddie kirsch, who, who else

Speaker 5:          02:27:22       caught me off guard and sam tripoli. Josh fade. I'm tony hinchcliffe, johnny pemberton

Speaker 1:          02:27:28       and me subscribe to the desk squad on the podcast, a desk squad podcasts on itunes where you can listen to an excellent podcast like kevin pereira is. Where's he going? He had to make a phone call. Oh, there ain't nothing out there, man. I'm a kevin. Pereira was pointless. What is triple x squared mf said and live shows in the ice house tonight. Ian edwards. Right.

Speaker 5:          02:27:55       What is your posture is sessions. by the way, he was on conan wednesday, so I go to a conan's, a website and check has set out wednesday. Beautiful. Really good.

Speaker 1:          02:28:05       All right folks. We got a hell of a week coming next week. This podcast keeps rolling. You dirty bitches. We stopped for no man. We stopped for no quantum theory. We got monday. We've got bas rooted in the fucking house. A tuesday. Scott sigler who is a horror author, and then we're working on someone wednesday. hopefully I'm going to be able to get a justin wren. He's the white guy that's been working to save the pygmies in africa. I don't know if you see the video of the first time they ever saw a white guy and it touched me. It was a former mma fighter who's now living in the Congo trying to help pygmies fake photos. I heard this over fake photos. Oh no, this isn't a really recent. I think you're thinking of something different. Yeah, it wasn't a photo. It was a video and it was like staged. Apparently this is not. This is modern iphone footage of him in the Congo meeting. These pygmies and the little boys, the little kids like they had never seen a white guy before. A alright you fox. We love the shit out of here and keep it together, bitches and we'll see on monday.
