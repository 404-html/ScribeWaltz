Speaker 1:          00:00:25       Bob auditing, leaning. Dong, Dong Ding Dong. Ding, Ding Dong. Ding Dong. Ding Dong Ding Ding Dong

Speaker 2:          00:00:35       does that. The intro auditing, Dong Ding Dong gum kind of fucking intro is that, but I didn't think being being done, this is how relaxed they are. One year in. We have no idea what's going on. Like wait, was that an intro just starts. We've got to stop using music folks for legal purposes and all sorts of other shit. But when I got sued, so that's our music. Oh, what was that song I sing? I don't know. Yeah, we said copyright that sued them and they want to use it as fucking horse. We'll call it. Welcome to the podcast pitches. Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Ms. Dot. Ari Shaffir is joining us today. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Ari would be here to promote his shows in San Francisco, but unfortunately for cunts, they're all sold out. Sold out. I'm, I'm super happy about it. He's balling storyteller shows. So you going to promote subway instead?

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       Sandwiches. So where are these shows at? So people know where they can't go. The purple onion, they might release them that they have to show up. I don't really understand how that works. Well, what happens is sometimes people reserve them and they don't pick them up and they don't pay for him and they flake, which I'm sure happens at time, especially in San Francisco. He fuck it, flaky free. I buy second sentence raining. It's like, no, I'm not going anywhere. People just flake, dude. There's a certain amount of people that always flake. No matter how bad ass the concert is, pink Floyd's the wall, whatever the fuck it is. I think it was just going to flake. There's a certain amount. You just have to accept that if friend just had a birthday party and she was pissed because more people said they were going to show up and do it, and I was like, Oh, you've never tried to promote a show, nobody comes.

Speaker 2:          00:02:16       Yeah. And that's, that's ridiculous. Have unreasonable expectations. The worst is when you buy tickets and then you break up at the girl and then you're like, ah, I don't want to see fucking whoever block Morrissey and to uh, to Coachella. Well, first of all, you're dating some depressing bitches. If they want to go see Morrison, we might've found a problem. Morrissey, man, if you ever wanted to cry, Mexicans are under them. Them to and to Morris Morris in this mess. I have no idea why Mexicans are super into Morrissey. Wow. Maybe Mexicans totally wished they were whiny white people, right? Of a Mexican Sarah into flashlights. Oh, that's right. We're sponsored by the flashlight. Flashlight. Doctor Suck. The subtle segue, if you go Joe rogan.net, there's a link for a flashlight and click the link and enter in a the word rogue and you get 15% off. We're just trying to save you money. Bitches are just trying to save people money on flushed lights. I don't want any buddy beaten off for retail. Just don't think that's right

Speaker 3:          00:03:14       at his girl. Find my flesh language. Do you really use this? And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you want to watch? And she's just starts putting her fingers. And I'm like, you do know. I just said I, you could use it. She gets, I don't care. You washed it, right? I'm like, yeah, I guess. How often do you not wash it? This is the girl you were boning. Uh Huh. No, just uh, please touch her house or boning. Yeah. You're trying to vote on them? No, no, it's just my landlord. Oh, you're Atlanta was not playing with their fleshlight. Brian story is full of holes. I was coming up short last month in rent and feed off into the fleshlight for, no, not that. Nothing. It's like the scene when he's hurling, he's a toilet and she's talking about something, but you know, fuck. It makes you really want to take a shit. I love that. I want to see you hit their new movie and they have a new movie coming out where it's like about this guy that's married and he gets to take a week off of the marriage or something like that. Oh, it was from the same guys I believe. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:04:17       Yeah. They made some great shit. They made something about Mary too. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:04:21       I read this book. It was about being a comic. Oh really? About stand up? I think so. If I remember just living in like no apartment with his brother. I believed it been doing comedy. I remember

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       it's been so long. They're east coast guys. The comedy writer is what it's called. Do you got? Oh yeah. You've got to wash. Speaking of comedy, got to watch Denis Leary's new comedy central special. Oh is it? Must be that good. Wow. You're like, like didn't talk down to you like an actor who's never really done standup, has to write his own material and then play a standup in a movie. No, really just, is it just rusty? It's just death. There's just nothing funny there. It's just a missing. What's funny, would you ever have him on the podcast? A No, because I don't want them over my house and I would probably want to, you could always go to the desk squad to, he's the type of guy that would be like kind of threatened you and for talking the truth. He's not a good guy, you know, the, the whole, the whole scene is just ugly.

Speaker 2:          00:05:13       But it was fascinating watching it. You know, I, I've, I root for people, man. I wanted it to be good. You know, I would not get a work out and stuff beforehand. He's not in the same guy. He live in la? Yeah, I think so. I Dunno. I've never heard of been working on is actually, I think he lives in the east coast. Okay. I root for him, man. I swear to God, I root for everybody would be better and root for everybody to to get over their bullshit. You know everybody that's done shady shit in the past. If you even, you got to feel that this is shady. I root for, I swear to God, but fuck, fuck. It was just a void. It was a void. Know here's my favorite comic. When I first started, when I was an open microphone, like six months. Who's my favorite comic? Really? Oh, he was just killer. He was just Troyer and like so much more

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       aggressive than anybody I've ever seen on stage. So much more like my kind of comedy and like the type of people that I was hanging around with and like the, the shit that I was used to, I was, he's the hard people. You know, like the comedy that I was used to is all from mostly from boxing gems from my, my, my boxing coach, Joe Lake, the guy who had his finger bitten off a street fight and had a toe attached where his finger was and curled permanently so he could keep throwing right hooks. Not Kidding. He had his stroke. I had my belt put curled. I had it done like this, so I could fucking told her. Right. Yeah, he's crazy. He was on he, he's far fucking animal. I don't want to tell all the stories that I know because I don't know what he wants to get out there on the Internet, but these are the type of people I was hanging out with forms that kind of surgery.

Speaker 4:          00:06:41       There's bedroom, there's, did they do that finger back and he told the doctor what Craig or Dr Bunch, you know, he didn't want a straight finger. That would be terrible. It gets stuck in the boxing glove because I couldn't move. He couldn't articulate the finger anymore because the nerves are gone. Oh, they're all separate. Somebody bit his fucking finger off and it's true. Ah, how does it get to that move? Like at what point are you losing my friend Mike [inaudible] time? My friend Mike Blight was a bouncer at the rathskeller and he was a professional boxer and he wasn't, I mean he would drink occasionally, but we wasn't drinking when he was there and he didn't look like a killer. He looks like a very, he's a very smart guy too. And he's very well spoken, but he's a straight south Boston thug and he worked glasses and ship.

Speaker 4:          00:07:25       He's a pro boxer and so he would just totally get off on just lighting up drunk college dudes, you know, guides who would get stupid and guys that would get in his face and got and who would allow them to like literally almost pick on him before he would knock them unconscious. Yeah, it just, he would say, I'm a, I'm telling you this is, you guys are making a big mistake. You know, this is not the way to go. I don't know. I don't know how you're living your life. And then he would just turn on them whether you fucking figure you fucking pussy. Oh really? Oh, what, what the bank, it would just just tee off on him. He's a pro boxer who's fucking good ones. And then all their friends to be like, you got to knock out by a nerd. No, he was, he would knock them out.

Speaker 4:          00:08:03       So scary. They would all just slack jaw and wait for their animals, their animals. Nuke that whole era of us, I should knock it out and it's lost is the craziest place I've ever been. I've never, I mean in what I do shows there, like the last time I did a show there at that, uh, that, that theater and the, the, the what used to be the combat zone, I forgot the name of the theater. 10 action come. It used to be the common connection. Now it's a theater. The Wilbur, the Willard here. It's a beautiful theater. That was cool. I forgot that. But you realize they're savages. They're just wild. Or people, you know, they're more willing to fight. They're, they're more than, am I going to have complained about shit, they're less likely to deal with bullshit. Take your shit. You know, they're less likely to let you get away with anything. Like there's certain shit that people get away with in California that I didn't realize like when I came out here that people lived like this, that like act or talk, you know, like, you know when you eat here, people talking on the sad and just straight actor

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       talking. No one ever calls them on their bullshit and it's like, Ooh, when did you start sounding like that in Boston? Everybody calls everybody on everything. You don't ever get to put on airs. There's so many fights, but it's also why there's so many comedians come from that area. So many comics came from that spot, man. Whenever it happened to Dave Moore, Dell, I was thinking about him the other day. Is He still doing stand up? He's what? A show for awhile. Yeah. Funny. Had some sort of a comic standing for a little bit, right? Yeah. Good comment. A man. He's hilarious. I got to work with him in New York. I did a show with him in New York. He's really funny, man. He's, uh, he's, yeah, he's, he's like real, like solid professional, you know, really good timing. Good writing, good writing. What happened man? Yeah, there was a, I did stand up last night and it was an actress that was doing the, yeah, she was on the phone and she says like, yeah, I'm doing standup tonight.

Speaker 2:          00:09:50       It's my first time. It's going to be easy. He was doing it while she's gonna be so easy. Actually, I had just paid $15 and what it is, it's like 10 people go up in the audience votes and I'm going to fucking take this. It's, I mean it's, this is gonna be like, it's just never talking shit about how easy it's going to be. I wanted to stay, but that would be the worst comedy ever, so I'm not going to ever watch that. Yeah, that's fascinating. Know every talk you see someone you've never done, you're going to be awesome. Especially something that hard. Never done it jack. The owner was just out back around. They're just like, just cleaning at her, you know, like just laughing his ass off. There's people that think they're going to be awesome at everything before they ever do it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:29       Those are the Douche bags of the world because they've never really tested themselves and develop character where character comes from its failure and recognizing and being humble and you know and feeling the humility and knowing that, okay, you know what man that no one's perfect. This is crazy. Like all my Hubris of youth, that's all it a logical and it doesn't make any sense, but the people that keep it like forever and they have it in their thirties and shit and forties and they just, they think they could do anything. Richard Taylor of the old manager of the Congress remember? Yeah, at 39 he thought he could still play on some teams in the NFL and start a quarterback. I still got an arm for real. I've walked with be an all pro, but I can beat song guys out. We're like how cocky you have to be first of all, no, you've never been anything.

Speaker 2:          00:11:12       Second of all, you're 39 even if you were great, you still can't compete. Now, the only guys who can keep competing like when they're in their late thirties and forties and shit like the first of all, it's very, very recent. So you have to start thinking about chemicals. You have to start thinking about chemicals because we all want to think that everybody's doing everybody's natural and just doing squats. And I don't want to cast judgment on anyone, but when you look at like 40 year old athletes, there was no bread farms when I was a kid, they didn't exist. There's no 40 year old dudes playing professional football. What in the Super Bowl are you shitting me? That guy's got gray hair listening. Even register

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       like Bernard Hopkins, there's never been someone like Bernard Hopkins. See George Foreman when he won the title. He was 46 years old when he knocked out Michael Moore, but well that's kind of, he was getting his fucking ass kick before that and he hit him with like some legit old man strength. You know what I mean? Like the George Foreman was just an old strong tough dude. He never looked dug a young guy when he was older, he looked like a big ass strong old dude that could fuck you up. And he worked out real hard. You would push trucks and shit in his driveway and he was like one of the pioneers of like chopping logs. That was all like old, old, old school training shit. Back in the Joe Lewis days, he brought it all back. But if you look at like Bernard Hopkins, he's 46 man and he looks like he's 30 it's the craziest thing ever.

Speaker 4:          00:12:37       There's never been a professional boxer. I don't know. I can't, I can't say. But you're saying it's weird. It's fucking beyond weird. It doesn't make any sense. It's never existed before. Sugar Ray Leonard, when he got to his like late thirties it was a rap. You know everybody else. It's a wrap. Bernard Hopkins 46 not even 41 that even 40 almost 46 and he's out in super athletes. That means, what's the formatting like defendants title a few times. Yeah. Yeah. No, he really fought Tommy Marsy law said to Toni Morrison. So did he defend it? He might not have defended it. He knocked out my horse was a champion. Tommy Morrison had some wacky belt. He won, uh, from George Foreman. He beat George Foreman. I thought it was just a contender when he got, no, I'm pretty sure Tommy Marson won the title. I'm pretty sure. I know he'd beat George Foreman

Speaker 3:          00:13:28       decision. What were those belts that used to tie in and you're like, fold it around and then back of like as London fog coats, the belts, belts were on level. Fuck what are no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They were like the leather belts that like were really long and then you had to like kind of twirl it around. Oh, you got it on right now.

Speaker 4:          00:13:47       Yeah. Except this isn't that long. It's been that long. Wow. Yeah. I'm wearing it. I'm what citizen if becomes psychically more vacated. The title. That's bizarre. I don't even understand that. That's still where we're in the vacate a title, not retirement. I mean like I threw in the garbage can. Yeah. You know what the problem with boxing for real, super crooked. It's not just super crooked. There's so many organizations, there's not just one UFC style organization. You know a lot of people bitch about UFC beam and beat in a monopoly. But at least you know when you have a monopoly, at least you got white one clear world champion. There's a Wbo, the IBF, the WBA, the WBC, and a bunch of other ones that people weren't sure whether they should take seriously. Like there's a gang of the world champ and say somebody retires and make the belts open. It's like, well, who do we think is the most deserving of it? Yeah, they do that. They make guys fight, but they all make a decision on their own. Who would she be? Yeah, exactly. It's, I mean, that's how it is with the UFC and strike force too, because now we have, you know, strike forces, this big heavyweight

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       tournament that's coming up and they have failed over and over and we got a lot of good guys in their tournament, man. But it's, it's almost kind of annoying. You know, it's like, man, I want to see everyone fight everyone. I want it to be one big giant league. There's gotta be a way they can do that. They're pushing for that in baseball to have a Japanese versus American world champion really are we're real world or real world champion. That would be the shit that would be the one that would be dope. You know, it'd be dope. I hate to say it, but I would love if Japanese dudes came over here at kicked Americans, ask his son of a bitch, son of a bitch, communists tug. There you, there should be a, where were you? The problem is no one's going to be willing to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:15:26       I was going to say with UFC and strike force, no one's going to be willing to say, you know, then the guy rep or whoever the champion as he represents your organization and you know each guy fight it out for each weight class. Like that's like too much of a downside, you know? Then if you lose, you get that. You get our champions. And what if the UFC got all the champions then strike force. What they just go out of business then, you know, if that gets tricky, what are they going to, they can't have, it was just an new champion. I have a title. You can't have a title, you know, but it's weird. You know you got nick Diaz is a champion over there and George St Pierre was a champion over here. But I guess what? They're not fighting as long as they keep Nick Diaz happy and they keep paying them, you know, they're not going to fight.

Speaker 2:          00:16:04       Keep smoking. I was right in a way that 10 whites, a little wary of him too because he uh, he got in a fight with Joe rigs in the hospital after they were Africans. They argued when they were in the hospital and Nikki has jumped him in the hospital. They had IV bags on and shit and he's beating his ass in the hospital. Stockton guys out of their minds. It, him, him and his brother are there. Look how those guys are the real deal. They're not fucking around. Don't talk shit unless you want. You get your plan, your face bunch. We hung out in Stockton and we hung up that there was this chick at some bar were there and we had like a 45 minute drive to get back home. And the young guy and the tour and the monsters store was like, we were trying to get him some, the girl was like intuit, right?

Speaker 2:          00:16:42       So he was like, I don't know if I can get it. We were like, Hey, come on, you're gonna come back with us and shit. I was like, can you get back tomorrow? She goes, yeah, I'll find a ride. She just is weird girl at the bar. Let's go. You're coming. Let's go. So we got in the backseat and then he got really cold. Um, uh, she started rapping. Yeah, she started rapping randomly. He got really cold to where he goes, oh, I don't want to, I'm like, why? He goes, she told me she was autistic and I was like, what? I'm like, all right. Behavior. It makes complete sense now. I just thought she was weird and quirky. So autistic people are well aware that they have an issue. Yeah. And she was doing tons of blow. Oh my God, that sounds so owning it and then rapping 30 straight minutes, autistic and low and she's a wigger.

Speaker 2:          00:17:20       I drove her back to her. Um, I'm assuming it's not a black rooms at a black or white girl and what she rapping like a black girl. Yeah. Nice. That's what I assumed. All those things. It's kind of a painted for myself because that would be the most, this something very special about poor white people that act like poor black people. There's a weirdness to it man. Serious when like white dudes are like real serious about being street and acting pill. But like is it just a poor thing? No, no, not necessarily. I mean a little bit of it. Sure. I mean cause their

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       world interacts, you know that they're intertwined in other communities. The poor white and poor black communities. I mean poor people have to live where poor people live. And I'm like, and I lived in Jamaica Plain. There was a lot of poor white people and poor black people together. But it's just some weird, when a dude has a clear affectation, just takes it on and all sudden, you know, it's like he won't get crazy, you know, you won't get crazy. And yet like I've seen white guys talk like that and you're like, wow, okay. There's no part of the country where white people talk like that. You didn't see that on TV if this isn't like a rural Greensboro South Carolina thing and like, well everybody has his weird accent there. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're clearly urban, black, urban, black southern a little bit, you know, and then the, and due to New York do it too.

Speaker 4:          00:18:32       A lot of, a lot of white and from the north then. Okay. Yeah. Still talking like a southern. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Two Guy. I've seen guys do it, especially back in the, um, in the 90s, there was a lot of guys that would a especially involved in like when I was playing pool and I was going and watching guys gamble on pool, there was always a lot of like these sort of thug type characters who were white guys that talked like black guys that would even say nigger. They would say like this isn't a thing. You've got to come here and take all that shit. You're like, what's this Nigga think he going to come here and take out La Shit. Shut this motherfucker who's up. Shoulders are going to be like, wow, like this guys. It's like an alien personally. You're near not just saying these things.

Speaker 4:          00:19:09       You think then that guy's saying that line. Do you think he still feels it when he says the n word? You think he's still in charge at all? He's squirming a little and let, I mean he must be on Oxycontin's if he's hot, you know you're a white guy and you're, you're saying nigger and especially he's got like, he had like, you know, like a really shit short shaved head. Like almost like, like a almost like a skinhead but like little stubble on his head, you know, so it's like you were, you were just so much whiteness. There's whiteness everywhere. There's whiteness all over your head. You don't even have like a bunch of black hair. I look at you and it's curly hair and I'm like, man, this guy's like part black or something. No, no, nothing. He was like super white and I met Jason Kidd and he's doing these things with his fingers, you know, were guys like shake their hand in the air where they talk.

Speaker 4:          00:19:49       There's some weird thing like that when they hold their hand approximately forehead level and then they just shake it up and down like Paul, like knuckles out and certainly they shake their hand up and down. Yeah, it is almost like that. It's like a chip dad. His arms up in it's just progressed. Do you think there are black eyes like deep, deep in the hood who talks super upscale white? Yes, for sure. Yeah. There's a lot of black guys that would die to be white and a lot of white guys that would be die to be black. The most people in this world do not want to be who they are. I feel like everyone else has it so much easier. Cooler. We will let the easiness as an insult like, oh, your parents paid your worth through college. I know you're like, my parents worked hard to put me through college. Yeah. Is that bad? The people want us to leave. Everyone wanted me to be smoking. Having it harder as the way cooler way to be. Why? Yeah, you didn't get there for real. You ain't legit. You ain't just treat so it's like a stock and guys stuck with it for real. It's like even move he there. He gets a crazy place to live. You want to live where you can go to sleep and not worrying about fucking gunshots coming through your window.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       It's nice. It's one thing you might be into something like that idea of thrills out of nowhere. Some people like like living in Silver Lake and hearing sirens all the time. You know, there's people that like that they feel like they're in the heart of some sort of an artist's colony. Arrieta's yeah, I drove use of Homea Dave Silver Lake and there's some of those streets that look like straight Gatto yeah, just straight like what Rick talks walking over across the street with no tags at all. Pitbulls yeah, several weeks. Tricky man. It's cause you got a bunch of hipsters and they're living with a bunch of gang bangers, you know? And I think a lot of them must get robbed, right? Don't they? Probably. You've got to have bars. I always worried about Dunkin Cause Dunkin is like super into like living in those kind of areas. He lives in that was anyone even broken into any, but he's like the first guy to wet his pants. If someone, you know, he's never been broken. It's pretty crazy. The history of his theory. What's the neighborhood?

Speaker 2:          00:21:43       Yeah, what's some famous guy that bad day? I can't really tell the story. It's pretty famous. I don't know if he's talked about it and I know he has and he doesn't want anybody to know where he lives. I just saw that with his girl now and I just saw that documentary. That guy, that Guy Jim Jeff. Well, I'll tell you after the show show's over, you know, you really can't say because it will, everyone will know exactly where he lives. He lives in a weird house. It's a long story. You know that it got a Kool aid guy. Jim Jeffries. Is that his name was Jim Jefferies. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no, no. You're talking about the comedian? No, no, no. The guy that got Yana trategy, Jim Jones, Jim Jones. I was watching the documentary about that the other day and it mixes the ido in with the video and stuff with Gabby.

Speaker 2:          00:22:21       You guys seen this documentary? I highly recommend it. I think it was on Netflix or something like that and it showed videos and it talked to the guy's brother the whole time. He's like, yeah, my brother then told everybody to, you know, drink this and do that. No, it wasn't even cooler. Those poor Koolaid fucks. Right. It was like, couldn't even get grape drink. Right. There's like some drink. Yeah. And they were showing up there was shooting it in the kid's mouth with like tricky based or type things. Oh my God. And yeah, and the niche. I didn't know how many people also died from like NBC News, a senator or it was a senator died. All the got there. Got Shot. Killed, right? Yeah, yeah. They murdered them. A senator. We landed there. Yeah, a bunch of people. Well it got real tricky because you know, there was a lot of them and this guys, they basically were running sort of a paramilitary operation.

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       You had guns and shit and then guards and you know, whenever you get control of a group of people, the government is not going to let that happen. You get, you get a big group. Like what they tried to do in Waco, they had themselves fenced in and they basically started their own country. They started real a mini country and this we're going to talk to them and they just went in after him. The pro, they killed everybody. If you go look at rules of engagement, it's a documentary about the Waco tragedy where they just clearly show tanks blowing fire into buildings, tanks or knocking over buildings and blowing fire and the billings like a bunch of children and women died in this thing. He just, the dude, they sh apparently shots were exchanged, a few agents got hit and you know, and there's, there's video agents like getting

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       shot at and shooting people and jumping into buildings and shit and breaking into windows and one and one agent actually almost got shot and so friendly fire, use a video, you could watch it that where a guy, you know, it's craziness. They're breaking into windows and shit and trying to get, but at a certain point in time they got the go ahead use the tanks and so they are knocking over fucking buildings with these tanks and you see there these see the the gun, you know the, what is the gun turret? What does that part of the tank called? It's all going to turn to the barrel of the big long thing that looks at the bone Hakan death. It cock the cock of death is spraying fire into these buildings. Dude. It's gnarly. Gnarly. It's pretty gnarly because I mean it's clear cut, absolute unequivocal unequivocable evidence evidence that that fire was not an accidental fire that plays out.

Speaker 4:          00:24:35       That's how I remember they said it just caught fire. That's when we met up a tank or something. I mean, unless all this is completely fake footage. I mean I wasn't there. I don't know for sure, but it seems like that's what they did. I mean all those people died and burned to death, but it is fire happen all the time. How does fire happened? Just all of a sudden your house caught fire. Sorry. Oops. How rare is it that fucking, you know your got gigantic compound with filled with bullets. It's been around forever. Yeah. Where is it? Where is it? That shit just catches fire, you know, and there's videos of these tanks knocking over buildings, blowing fire. You can't be shooting at the government are the, they're Ruby Ridge Shit. Same Shit. They're gonna kill you man. I was in his room when that happened and I remember my uncle and I asked him, he looks, what's up with that?

Speaker 4:          00:25:14       What are the, I was like, I don't know, weird thing. I'm 18 I don't know anything you're supposed to know. Yeah. It represent your country. You're not allowed to do that, man. You're not allowed to start your own country inside our country. You can't just put up a fence and have a military vehicles and everyone's got, got like guns out in the open. They would walk around with like guns out rifles and shit. Nino because stock pile of weapons. They were just letting everybody know that they're are protected and that this is, you know, this is an arm community and this one guy, he's just banging everybody's wife. One guy who was, that's what it was all about. This one guy who would like play songs and it was to play the guitar and play music and he, he fucked everyone's wife like a different battle star Galactica.

Speaker 4:          00:25:53       He, it was basically a real sick, real similar that Balt is our guys. Is that what his name was? Who was his name? The the dark haired guy. I'm making it up his name. I might've made up his name. I forget what the British guy, yeah, the British guy was the real swarming guy, but this guy was a little bit more Jesus, like he was a little bit more, you know, Christ like, and he just fucking, everybody, just a brilliant guy who realized that he can manipulate people and he got a bunch of Dell people that were looking to find the way and he brought them all together and gave Balsam Dick. Oh, of course you want to fuck. That's what he did. Talk to my, you want to fuck him? It's just, it's a tricky thing, man. Where the government says, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 4:          00:26:29       You can't run that hustle, but what about your hustle? What about your crazy taxes and the Federal Reserve? Not really even being a federal institution and all privately owned and banks that control everything and Bilderberg group. What about your fucking hustle? All this guy's doing is getting some pussy. You know your hustling sees a lot worse than what they're doing. Oh, is it was just the guns. Was that, why are where they would want to do that? Yeah, because he's not for the guns and let them go ahead and do whatever. He got big. It got the compound was, you know, it was, they had resources, you know, people would leave the compound and come back. They would work in town and come back to the compound. It was like, it got tricky. It got to the point where, you know, hey, if they decided to just take over this community, who's going to be able to stop them?

Speaker 4:          00:27:11       You know, do, do we have to protect ourselves from this like armed group? It gets tricky. I don't know what the exact, you know what, what they used. I think probably they probably use like child abuse, which may or may not have been true because it's cool or something. That could have been that. It could have been sexual abuse. It could have been any, I mean it might have been true. I mean my own teasing. I'm not saying that this guy for sure you know, was a great guy and the government should have left them alone, you know? But if we're really going to go after people for child, why the fuck are we not going after the Catholic Church? Why is that not? Why aren't they arresting the pope? Why are they not going in to like guns drawn to these organizations to finding out, okay, how many of you have fuck kids?

Speaker 4:          00:27:50       How many of you are fucking kids? There was a document that got released that we were talking about before the podcast started from 1997 that said, the Vatican sent a letter out telling these churches to not report cases of child abuse to the police. That is some nasty shit, man. I mean if that was the case was like anyone who covered up and didn't report it when they knew it, like they should be arrested. Yeah. They'll be like, hey, you can't, you can't do that. You can't give up stuff like that. Exactly. Anyway, if it was anywhere else, if it was, if it was like, you know, any other business, any other, exactly. Let me tell my boss and then I won't say anything to the place. Let me ask my boss when he wants to do and the boss like, no, no, you can't just check it out loud.

Speaker 4:          00:28:27       If your boss is business was fucking kids, like that was their number one hobby. We're going to go play golf and they would say, go play golf with the finger quotes in the air and that meant they were going to go bang kids. I mean that's really almost what it's like. It seems for some of these, these priests, if you watch that, there's a terrible documentary about a guy, but he shipped them all over the place. Uh, I think it's called deliver us from evil. Let me tell you exactly what it's called. I like coloring and I like watching cartoons. I'm starting to think my age group is a kid. Deliver us from evil. That's what it is. It was that it don't watch it if you don't want to get depressed because if you want to get depressed it will get you depressed. It's fucking, it's gnarly shit man.

Speaker 4:          00:29:02       You know, you find out like their, their strategy of like keeping these guys from getting in trouble and how they could just move them instead of like strategy talk written out man. They're good. Praise. Let's, let's uh, yeah, let's just try to move around. That's what rats, the new guy. What does the name Raskin or what the fuck is his name? Poke poke county. Fuck. The fifth where a former Nazi. Yeah, the creepy guy was in the Hitler youth group. That guy literally like actively, like they know for sure he tried to shield child molesters like you know that the he did, they still move on to the top. There's, it's, it's an it's outstanding. No, no

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       debate, no debate about it. There's papers out there showing that they are actively trying to shield charm monsters and protect the church from lawsuits and litigation and, and just try to squash these claims. I mean they must have, it must be just an overwhelming amount of kid fuckers. I mean it must be like impossible. The man was there. No one else to promote to the top. I don't think so. When someone in the former heavily you have, they're all fucked up. I think if you, he's probably the one that can sit in his pants the best. I bet if you went digging into some of those other guys, he'd find he didn't fucking anyway, but he knew about a bunch of people who are good. Maybe flux him every now and then and the rest of them. It's a, it's a weekend party. Do you guys think it's most of those people do it or most not because I think it's like 99% was dump. Most dumb people are child molesters. Right? Like can you look at child molesters and has nothing to do with intelligence? You don't think like that's kind of retired.

Speaker 2:          00:30:31       No, no. Flip the baby. Most of most of what it is is from being abused yourself. That's what it is. They, they, they sort of replay what really fucked up and damaged them when they were young and then it just keeps going back and they did it because someone else had vampires. Yeah, exactly. It's a re recurring a problem. It's a killer. Had charm authored. Yeah. It's, it's really, it's really a crazy phenomenon. People that get sexually attracted to children and sexually attracted to the idea of raping and you know, and holding someone down against their will and that's where they get their rocks off. It's very, very tricky. It's really tricky than it happens to them and then for some reason they wanted to do it to other people, but there's been so many cases of that. Yeah. The best is that guy and I have to catch a predator.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       They call it was like a second time or no, it wasn't that time. It was, they caught him and as soon as they call them they were like, he was like, can you just send the cops in here and have them execute me already? Oh yeah. Yeah. He was like, I don't want to do this, but this is all I want to do. Imagine that's all you wanted to do and I can't help myself just fuck. I know it's gross. Yeah. That's what I'm into. It's fucked. It's fucked. Yeah. He's, his brain was wired fucked up. No. Could you imagine if your brain was wired great in every other way except for this whole, except yeah. And so you're smart enough to be aware this is frowned upon. So it had to be some kind of therapy. Like they could have made like a fleshlight baby for them.

Speaker 2:          00:31:49       And then just, I tried this sink that's helping. I think that if it, if it helped them not fuck a kid and like get into this flashlight, real doll baby, there's pills you can take. Right? Give it a cute face. They give them pills to like, I don't have no, what they do. I don't know. I don't know. What's the, I mean how the and libido little comb, depress the Harrison. It's different for every person. What was trading at one dude, he's not going to treat down another dude does have lots. How much resources are going to do and straightening up pedophiles. You got to kill him. There's too many people in the world as it is. We know. We know that we, we just, that's sort of what I think in the grand scheme of things. Just a couple of numbers. You Shit you supposed to call it all agree. We don't want them around the dogs that do the same shit. When dogs go to bite people, man, I firmly believe that those dogs should be put down and I put down dogs that were aggressive to people. I've had dogs in my past that bit people and we had to put the dog down. It happened more

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       than once. Yeah. And uh, I think that's what you have to do. I really don't think if you train a dog and you, you know, you love them and you're around them, but something's still wrong with that dog. And that dog wants a bite. People like, what's going on? Why is this dog even associating people with danger and people with wanting to attack them. No one's been fucking with this dog. You've had it since he was a puppy. Every now and then, man, you get a nutty dog and you've got to kill him. You've got to kill those nuts. Yeah, because so look man, what the fuck I had the dog with this temporary, your dog had a doberman with to Stanford. He tried to bite me once and it was just, I didn't know he had to stand up.

Speaker 2:          00:33:11       My dog has an oral fixation that won't stop licking and biting and eating and on dogs. Dude, you got to give him Roger. I do, but it's nonstop. Like now it's like he, she self-medicating, he's like, she has this thing that like a squeaker toy that she just keeps her mouth 90% of the day. Like she knows like if I take this out, the rubber dog, Dick. Yeah, call the fleshlight people. You have to make a very firm rubber dog eat dog dick that has like a meat flavor to it. A fleshlight baby. Yeah, that'd be great. Flashlight babies for my dog.

Speaker 4:          00:33:43       Dogs are awesome when they're awesome. But the bottom line about dogs is that there are animals, man. We were just sort of have this weird trust and a bunch of animals that can kill us and we keep them in our yards and shit and people also put like emotional attachments on them. But then if you look back on 50 years on, you're killing your dog because he was biting people. They'd be like, this amount percentage, they don't know your attachment. They'll just be like, this percentage of dog was killed because they bought somebody. Here's a crazy story. There's two people that I know that have had a pit bull fights in the yard where they had dogs and the pitbull wind up killing another dog and they're killing another pit bull or killing a dog and both of them tried to blame it on some other shit. Like what? One of them blamed it on a mountain lion. One of them thought that a mountain lion came in and killed a dog. That's what everyone was saying. But then my friend Bud said, listen, I know those dogs and those dogs used to fight and they, that fucking idiot had two females in his yard trapped up together and they fought in one killed the other one and he wanted to blame it on a mountain lion and I went,

Speaker 2:          00:34:36       ah, okay, that makes sense because why would a mountain lion coming to a house full of pit bulls like Jesus? Isn't there like a better way to eat? You know how fucking id you have to be you guys with your mountain lions? I wouldn't have a mountain lion story. Like I was at the grocery store in a mountain lion jumped on my face where I was living in Colorado because where I was living in Colorado, man there they lost 160 plus houses. I think it was like 170 total, 179 maybe fire. They had a horrible fire. The worst fire in Colorado history because if you think about 170 houses in this area, this is extremely rural. This is a mountain community. So it's all houses in the mountains and 170 of them are gone. So a huge amount of forest was burned down thousands and thousands of acres. So now mountain lions have less territory where there's woods and there, you know the, they're already like, they are in an area around people and they do kill people's dogs. They want to like, they want to keep that open as an option and they know that there's a lot of around where

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       people are because of the fact that people aren't killing the deer because people are killing the deer in boulder. Deer everywhere. So that brings in mountain lions. So now they have like more and more mountain line signings there. Wow. But coming in, so then the other one about the dog, the other dog story with a dog killed another dog or this guy blamed it on someone I know this dude who sells weed and uh, he, uh, was growing plants in his background. He told me this crazy story where someone broke into his house and, and stabbed his dog and killed his dog and then, and then to run it ran away with his plants and I was like, Whoa, that is fucked up. Like you came home and your dog was dead and then you know, you cut your plants. Uh, well in time this story has morphed and now what I've learned is one of the dogs was a bulldog of female bulldog and the other dog was a pit bull and the pit bull more than likely killed the female dog.

Speaker 4:          00:36:29       And he's like blaming it on like what about the plants that are going well, when he took the dog to the hospital, because if dog was fucked up, his neighbor who had been eyeballing is plants, hopped over his fence and chop to shit down, stole his weed. Every time somebody tells me sort of crazy, unbelievable story, I'm like, it's this reason. There's an unbelievable, it's just not true. Well, there's some good stories that are legit, but that ain't one of them that I was a mad at this guy like, man, you made me feel like your dog got stabbed. You know, and then that felt for that poor dog getting murdered by some, you know, some fucking asshole just wants to steal a plant. And then I realized that this idiot's got two female dogs. I was willing to accept that if it was two beta fish oil to females, female dogs, man, female dogs do not deal well with female dogs.

Speaker 4:          00:37:13       It's one of the things you like, you know, you can really learn a lot from about nature, from watching female dogs interact because female dogs never choose an Alpha. They don't, they don't give up. Like if you beat it like squeaky and Lucy where my two dogs, they're both sweet, sweet dogs to people. But both, he would fight you for attention. Like if you were petting one of them, the other one would come over and grout or like pitch. But I get the fuck out of here. That's my hand. I'm gonna get this pet. And they hated each other because this and they would never give up no matter how much they fought, no matter how many times they would, I would have to separate them with hoses. Sometimes they would bite each other and Claude each other and go crazy. And in the middle of a fucking picnic, right.

Speaker 4:          00:37:50       Everybody would be just chilling. And then once you know, someone would give one dog a bone and the other dog would get fucking crazy. And before you know it, it's on check thing. Like it is like your dog should get a podcast. It is like, and you, you realize like that's just a nature thing. Like there is a natural predisposition to not want other women around you. The other, especially other women that are competing for affection. Attention. That's why those women who hate their daughters when they're too hot and they can no longer hot. Yes dude, that's dark. That is some dark scary shit. When you got an old lady, he was hating on her pre young daughter. She's 37 daughters, 17 and looking good and I've seen it man. I've seen it happen many, many times on her daughter in public. Take the legs out, every guys who their fucking girlfriends mom comes

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       on to them. Wow. How about that? Yeah, my mom's still sorta got it. She's like 46 and kind of clinging on there and I knew that this girl from Texas who uh, her mom in her is like, like she's a slant to grind in from Texas. You actually know her too. I and the mom is a slut, like an older version of her and like they'll come over and have parties like in high school and college and like her mom would come out in like short tits and fucking like, it was just like, like hanging out. Like she acted like she was one of the kids. Whoa. And she still does it today though with with her, her Margaret. It doesn't, but doesn't she get like super rational and irrational fights too? No, she's actually, I mean she works for an airline and stuff like that, so she works, I'm thinking of a different girl.

Speaker 2:          00:39:17       Yeah. Oh yeah. We still have to talk about this so I'll know exactly what the file often do you guys bring up stories and you're like, and this said, said person went, we always try to edit around them as much as they're particularly embarrassing about a close friend. Very difficult. Yeah. You don't want to throw people under the bus. That bugs the shit out of me, man. When I watch TV shows or listen to a radio shows and people throw their friends under the bus too, probably she was doing heroin with, uh, some dudes. You could just talk about anything like Joey Diaz, like you, you don't have, you don't even have restrictions. He doesn't give a fuck. Yeah, I can tell that story. It doesn't care. I mean, he'll tell you stories about me. I was fucking Facebook east. He wrote that he invited the, uh, the guy he kidnapped 23 years ago to be friends with them on Facebook. And then we got accepted his request. Diddy, diddy. I Dunno. I Dunno. We need to find out. He's probably getting it. Getting harassment charges filed against Joey does, right. It's been 30 years.

Speaker 2:          00:40:14       I was kidnapped. She wasn't kidnapped. He was held at gunpoint to a new house to be like, where's your, where's your, as the drugs? Yeah. Yeah. We took it from one house to another. And you've got to think that. No, he tied that guy up, bro. Oh really? Yeah. He tied that guy up and he had a machine gun. It wasn't like a light crime. Wasn't like he was jaywalking and they got out of control. It's pretty intense. It was already doing some shit. Yeah. And on top of that, the, uh, well, the guy was selling drugs and you've got to think, anybody who's selling drugs, who's selling drugs back then was in the 80s. It was like the 80s. This is how drugs are real. Yeah. He can't that can't assume that guy's still alive. I'll be that guy. Be a lot. That's someone else at the same name.

Speaker 2:          00:40:51       I live, I grew up totally different than mountain lions and muggings from Columbus, Ohio. I was upper middle class. You never ran out of milk and Columbus. It's everywhere. People make their own milk. Holy Cow. Tipping. But was it like growing up in Columbus and then you know, eventually realizing that the rest of the world wasn't like that? You know, I was thinking about this last night, how weird it is that like my high school in my school growing up, there was only like two Asians. All right. There was one girl, one guy, the girl was named [inaudible], which was a video game that was popular or a company at that time. So she was like, who is this Asian girl? And she has the coolest name ever. Kidnap me. Wow. And the guy, I was his friend and we grew up together and my only

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       Asian thing was like, I was like in love with this Asian girl. Like she was like the only person like her of the kind. And that's where I think I got like Asian fetishes from one girl. That one girl. So did someone else date this one girl? Uh, no. She wished very shy. You know, I would buy her and those pencils that used to take out the end and and put it in the back by bottom. They have like little cartridges now. Oh yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah. It was a big Japanese girl thing anyways, like she would give me like a pencil and then I'd go, oh, this is nice. And you know, no, no. And then I had, I had Asian several years later and it was like, you know, it was just regular sex and totally broke down those walls. And now my, the Asian fetish was gone.

Speaker 3:          00:42:18       But it doesn't, Nick Adams stories talks about having sex with an Indian for the first time and then no girl would ever compete without brown skin. Like plump woman from India or from America, American native American. Those bitches are probably wild. Those are crazy jungle bitches. It was weird about Mexicans. It's like out here, you're pretty much 50% 50 and Mexican and white almost, you know, short most everyone in Columbus, Ohio, there was like, I don't even remember any Mexicans. Like I remember there was like when the Mexican race started coming to Columbus and everyone's like, oh my God, sell your house, sell your house, you know, type thing. Yeah, yeah. I pretty much lived, had a house, a three bedroom house that my mom gave me. Yeah, I grew up, she got remarried and she was like going to sell and she's like, Yup, you want, you just have it, you know, you know, I do not have it but you, I mean he, she owned it so just live there.

Speaker 3:          00:43:07       And uh, I was living there for like three or four years and I just remembered the neighborhood slowly starting to see more Mexicans and to us they were like, so what was the problem? People would freak out. No, it was just that you can tell the neighborhood crime. Like my car started getting broken into, it's during the Mexicans from, no, no, no, no. I'm just saying at this time period, this is the facts that happened. And then, uh, my told my mom, I'm like, mom, I love this house but I think you should sell the house pretty quick. And so she's like, all right. So she sold it and then like two years later, that neighborhood is fucking destroyed. It looks like straight out of Mad Max. Like the apartment sign is like, she crumbled down and do your mic is like really hot? Is it, is it harder than everybody else's? Are you doing on top of it? You know, I'm just probably just on top of it. Um, did, um, so did this, was this engineer, cause they do that, you know, they, they do what's called blockbusting but right. Real estate agents will go door to door and they say, hey Mike guns are moving in. Yeah. You saw your shit now. Well I think they actually did move in now. That's the difference.

Speaker 3:          00:44:10       It would actually be like the British are coming the legs of Paul Revere Shit. But it's weird how like in Columbus, like you said, like we only had like the mix mud, the puppy, you know, like the mud. I didn't grow up with different races and the only racist we knew like Italians were all Italian. You know, they're were just like, that's weed through it. And three Italians, they all exactly the same. That's how that race acts. But

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       Armenian, see, they still wear gold chains. Gold chains

Speaker 3:          00:44:35       eat a lot. They're very friendly. You know, they're when Lasagna away from having sex with each other, you know, it was just

Speaker 4:          00:44:41       crime went up when the Mexicans moved in. It was clearly the Mexicans were causing the crime. Right. Well it seems like, but it seemed like the poverty caused it. But if, if, if the Mexicans moved in, you got to think that you're talking about lower echelon or class four ports were different team, different Mexicans and the ones out here, something happened to a new job, open up a new factory or some shit

Speaker 3:          00:45:01       started migrating. I think you know, lately, I mean I noticed from zero Mexican too, like a lot of Mexicans in Columbus, Ohio within five years.

Speaker 4:          00:45:09       Yeah. But isn't there something that draws them? They're like, don't they must have jobs. There must be something. I think there's been a migration, Marilyn. There weren't very many when I was growing up, but now there are more

Speaker 3:          00:45:19       pull man. It's just diluting out everywhere, you know? And I think they're just slowly, it's starting like, seems like it's, they told her

Speaker 4:          00:45:25       want to move into a platelet. I know there's a lot in Colorado, man. A lot of Mexican Martinez was there. Fantastic Mexican food. There's a place called pop who says in Boulder, Holy Shit, you got to get the maneuver noodle. It's the real deal man. Oregon's in there and bones and shit. Menudo and there's fucking spectacular. That's what minuto is. Oh really? Udo is, it's not a bank. I was a gay man and he was a band, but it's, it's also a soup. It's this crazy like beef and pork soup. Um, and I don't even know what the fuck the ingredients are cause they're different. Everywhere you go, everybody's got their own different way and make them a noodle. But what it is is some disgusting, fantastic, beautiful creation of where someone's not even worried about what something looks like. There's bones in there and literally stomach tripe and there's pieces of Oregon's like pieces of liver. It's delicious. It's fucking fantastic. And it just looks like how it looks like, how it's so good. It's supposed to be really good after hangovers too. And if anybody knows anything about hangovers, it's Mexicans. They know what the fuck to do. They've got it down to a science, throw a bunch of organs and bones into a bowl and fucking keep that shit up.

Speaker 3:          00:46:31       Mexican women are so horny. Are they? Yeah, no, no. My friend has this Mexican girl. Every time I see him together with her, it's just nonstop. She's on a grinding, she's moaning. She's like kissing his neck. She has three kids. Two, three separate. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:46:47       No, just 20 line. But she is fucking so high and that's all she does. She has one drink. She has just, Whoa, what a good kid. Yeah. Well, there's a reason why there's a lot of Mexicans. Okay. It's just a fact. They're debriefing. Yeah. So the Mexican girl and you know, it's fine. The Mexican guys are awesome. Rapist. Yeah. The Mexican girls must be horny. There's just no other way around it. Even though a lot of Holocaust, why would they love babies? You know the problem, I know if I hung out with a girl, I got Super Hot Latino's 21 and she had three babies and there was no condom around, I'd still be like, ah, fuck. Okay. Right. Let's just chance it. Yeah, you would probably fucker. And then later I'd be like, what was I do? Well, in the poorer communities, man, it's a problem having kids, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       It's like in, in, when you get older, the real issue is the reason why people want abortions because they don't want a kid ruining their life, quote unquote, you know? But in poor communities, like, oh my gosh, she's got to have a baby. She's only 16 months of crazy know, like they don't, they, you know. Oh yeah, your Mama. She was only 16 too. It's crazy. The both got the same shit, you know, and like it's okay and everyone's living together so it's all right. And they all help take care of the baby and it's all family. You know, poorer communities. What they do is there's more of them in smaller places and they have like a tighter knit sense of family. You get a big ass place with a, a family that's like spread out where you either, mom's never over the house and grandma's never over.

Speaker 4:          00:48:11       It's like you see them on rare occasions and holidays and shit. That's not all Mexicans rocket. They stack everybody together. Let's all get in a house together. That's really a better way to [inaudible] family's cool. My friend's fiance, she is big into like rescuing dogs and stuff. She hates Mexicans because of the way they just like, they take puppies and then they're just, yeah, they're adults now. Let them go and they just wander around aimlessly in those neighborhoods. The Mexican sign them when you're really poor, you don't fucking give a shit about dog. You're on team people and you know, that's just how it goes. Yeah, I could see that too. If I was Mexican or if I was poor and I was living in some communities, probably loved dogs and everything, but there's only so many things you can think of. No thing number one is you gotta get the fuck out of this crazy neighborhood then worry about dogs.

Speaker 4:          00:48:59       So did you see the vice guide to North Korea? Yes. That one is crazy. How they like the food they don't have, they have really shitty, crappy food and they have this whole display that tricks you into thinking that they have a budget. Well, we're not doing a good description description. First of all gets vbs.tv and there's a show called the vice guide to travel and they go all over the place. The scariest one, my favorite ones, Liberia. But the North Korea one was interesting too. And what Brian is trying to say is that what they did is they set up the whole situation because they knew that these guys were journalists to try to trick people into thinking that they have this luxurious way of living. Then it's just like the Western world and even though they are a communist society and they're run by a dictator that you know how we can go get something to eat, but all these things they realize we're just set up for them.

Speaker 4:          00:49:44       Right. When they went to [inaudible], there was no other patrons. Tables were set up. There was waiters and waitresses, but there was no one else. There were just some things like house or so it wasn't, yeah, they weren't real restaurants. They literally set up food for these people and set up like a servers so that they would have good propaganda. So they would, and they would bring out really good looking food and put it on all the other tables. Almost like if it was like a lax Turkey, you know, so like it looked like, wow, look at all that really good food and then he would get served. What he said was like, you know, over fried crap. You know, like it was horrible food. They weren't really a restaurant. I'd love to. So it was like a trick. The whole thing was like a tree. And what's crazy is that, that's almost like the whole country Oman is, are they just as huge chick? Yeah. They have nuclear weapons, you know, they do. Yeah. They do have nuclear weapons on. It's too late. I mean, the, the real issue is stuck now. It did. So that's an old school dictatorship. There's one guy who's running shit and he's got nuclear weapons. I mean, that is a, that's a rare situation where you have one guy who's, you know, essentially running a whole country and the military is gigantic. They have like a million people in their military military shoot.

Speaker 3:          00:50:50       You would suck those that, that, that host guy, I don't know if you remember this part at all, where he got drunk and he was hanging out with like a soldier doing karaoke singing and he had assaulted them somehow. It was that drunk. He was just being a drunk dude. Like he was just a Bajic. The host is when I'm saying, oh the fat guy. Yeah. He, that guy annoys the fuck out of me. Not host. I'm sorry if he listens or anything. But that guy was kind of annoying and kind of Douchey had assholey. Yeah, I dunno.

Speaker 4:          00:51:14       Well you know, I mean I think he felt like that guy was playing them to them and that guy was his like, you know, the guy was like a, a personal propaganda agent. He's probably trying to fuck with the guy just even for the film to make the film more interesting. You know, try to get it. But he said something if it was really mild, so whatever he said and insulted the sky, what does that got really crazy? Where he wanted to kill him now was for vice guide. Yeah. It's, well it's a, it's a web show. You could watch it on the web. vbs.tv. It's fucking fantastic, man. There's so much shit there. I have problems with meet with, like for me it's like one o'clock in the morning. I have to decide, okay, I'm, I can't watch documentary now because if I do, I'm not going to sleep for like five hours, so I'm just going to stay up and I'm just a good cause I'll go one to the other to the other. Then I start writing and start writing things down about these different documentaries and the VBS places, the worst website to go to at one o'clock in the morning for me. Cause that's just doom. I just go right off the deep end and then you go and start looking at the Internet and I start, yeah, read the research and other sources and writing things down and make sure we're talking about this on the podcast and you know, write a bit about that and how the fuck is this still going on in 2011 blah, blah blah.

Speaker 3:          00:52:21       Did you hear what Trent Reznor did the other day? I mean, this is what's so fucking cool about Trent Reznor. He, he just released a website that has every single tour date that he's ever done, you know, and like the last back past 20 years or whatever. And you know, they have all the tours aren't, you know, and then they're adding soundboard audio from each tour and you could download it for free. So I um, I went back and found like the dates that uh, I went to see him and I'm going to like as much the ones I wanted, I went only a couple of a half the whole concert. Yeah. And you can have a whole concept of free, the one that you went to like fucking 15 years ago. This is going to be a trip for me. Hoarded every concert he ever, I guess so like only, I mean there's a lot of them that are up yet, you know, but there's a lot of them that are, you know, that's going to crush it.

Speaker 3:          00:53:06       So, oh, it was so crushed when I got it yesterday. Right when he announced it and it was like five minutes. I was, you couldn't even get on it. Yeah. I was downloading one and it said, you're like a estimated down like three days. I would like to find my guys is bandwidth fees are going to be for this. How does he pay for the longest? He's got money, he's balling. He's all like yolked out now. Trent Reznor is like a kid and it's a big meathead. He's got like a big thick neck and shit. She would come on the podcast, he would be the most interesting podcast. You make. Nice. Nice with him. A long time ago you met him backstage and you know, you proposed us ever talking about this quarter? No. Great Story. Cool story. You know, so like before the Internet was like big at all.

Speaker 3:          00:53:47       I don't even think it existed or just, you know, me like schools had it or whatever. Um, what you were talking about. Oh, this is like 93 maybe. I don't know. Internet wasn't much. It wasn't much. Um, I was a manager of a record store and, uh, I used to always have free cds and stuff like that and I'm just sitting at my home. What's going, man, I wish I could meet Trent Reznor and he was like my hero, you know? And, um, so I looked at the back of the CD and there was an address I said like a whatever, nothing records Cleveland, Ohio and had like a zip code or you know, and had the whole address. So I wrote this thing saying, Hey, I'm a manager of a record store. I have like a nine inch nail fan club that it's about 100 people read this newsletter I do and stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:54:26       And I was wondering if there's any way I can interview them or take photos, you know, and stuff. And they're like, of course, as soon as a copy of it. So I was like, Oh fuck, now I have to make a copy. So I did like issue seven and it had like letters to the editor or where it was like sound, what's Trent, you know, favorite food. And I would like make shit up. He built a fake news letter with the fake news letter. I have it somewhere in my house and then, and then, uh, had like fake articles, take that thing and scan it. I know it's somewhere a great story. You should tell him to tell that story and put the scan that, that newsletter and put it online. Right. I should cancel it. And so then you know, a couple of, was it eight by ten eight by 10 it was about five pages long.

Speaker 3:          00:55:05       And so then this person called me actually back and goes, dude, we love this newsletter. You can have any concert on track record label, any Marilyn Manson concert. It's any, you know, anything on his regular, you get full access backstage, you get full photo passes to anything you want to. And so welcome aboard, Brian. This is awesome. Whoa. And so then I just started going to every single concert possible. I got to hang backstage. I mean, I was talking to Trent and taking photos. I was the thing that made me the worst people are back there. I don't know. Not many. I mean 2030 at a time. At one of 20 and 30 how many other ones were quote unquote journalists? I think I was the only one. I mean, yeah. What was kind of crazy? It's being imagined. This if you, if you grew up loving nine inch nails, um, maybe 18, 19, something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:55:58       And actually I was younger than that. It's like 17. Yeah. And so imagine going from your, like your idol. I mean, Trent was my idol. He was the only musician I like. Then going to hear like here's the stage Trent's right here. I'm taking photos. He sees me and starts singing right into the, into the camera. So I have all these photos where he's just screaming right into my camera and I'm going to have a real camera. I used my dad's old camera. I was trying to learn how to use in a manual film camera. And so half the photos are blurry, but it's probably cool that they're blurred. Some of them are crazy, like really cool thing that makes me mad that they are aligned. They've been online, a nine inch nail, red ban on Google. Uh, I'll find it. But, and then, um, so then I used to, you know, go to Marilyn Manson's.

Speaker 3:          00:56:42       I did it with Marilyn Manson. And one time I was hanging out backstage with Marilyn Manson, this is when Marilyn Manson first came out and he was like, you know, people, you know and stuff like that. And he goes, Brian, go, Ugh, do you live around here? Around here? Right? And I'm like, yeah, I live across the street. And he goes, go get me a razor. And I'm like, really? Okay. Marilyn Manson, Marilyn Manson, Marilyn Manson told you, go get a razor. Yeah, yeah. Well, and there was all these fans around him, like what chicks and shit like that. There was women, uh, block, like the tour bus, they were laying on the street in front of the wheels so they couldn't drive away what blog that's on Flickr. But if you just Google red band nine inch nail photos or something like that. Or in I n photos, um, so, so, so, so, so Merrill man, so he taught, tells me to get a rage.

Speaker 3:          00:57:26       So I go inside running crappy razors, run back and he's like, thanks, watch this Bryan, this is fucked up. Hey, who wants me to shave a circle on the top of their head? And then these girls like, so just this beautiful woman comes up and she's like, I want you to do it. And he goes, he starts to shaving it. A little bald spot on the top or here like a month. Wow. Whoa. Like a ballpark. Yeah. Wow. And they were into it. They were like, those photos are, you look at that. And you know what's also crazy is a hanging out with Jim rose circus, uh, member, those guys. Jim Rose Circus. Yeah. Behind them. That's all. Back in the day I used to, you know, hang out with them too because they used to open up for nine inch nails and you just being backstage with like the puzzles, peep guy

Speaker 2:          00:58:08       guys. Great photos. Yeah. That was like, I mean, I didn't know. I have no idea what I was doing. Folks, if you just Google, go to flicker, F L I C K r.com. And uh, you just Google red band n I n photos and I'll take you to the website. Yeah, they're fucking great photos and I wish, I wish Trent Reznor would come on this podcast. You know him? No, no. I mean, I'm back in the day, it was like he was just blowing. That was during the, you know, when he was just becoming big, you know, like fuck me, like an animal and all that crap. That was a huge song and people, and so I also did, I also did a remake of that. Did he really did know? He did hurt. Oh, that's the, yeah. Yeah. Imagine if you did fuck you like an animal. That gravelly old man voice.

Speaker 3:          00:59:00       I was talking to this girl the other day about that and they were like, she goes, I love this song. It was hurt. And then I was like, yeah, I like the original better though. Accident. She goes, she goes, oh, what are you talking about? This is the original. I'm like, no, nine inch nails. And she had no idea. He wouldn't really use those words,

Speaker 2:          00:59:16       hey songs to really be up on all of them. There's no way.

Speaker 3:          00:59:19       What's it? It's, it's weird because I've done that a times where I'm like, this is an awesome song. Not Realizing I wasn't even the original song. I heard buffalo soldiers.

Speaker 4:          00:59:25       I mean it was a buffalo who did, um, what's the name? It was Neil Young. Right. And Bob Marley. Bob Marley. Somebody. You know who's the guy who we did one of his songs. Oh, I shot the sheriff. Who did, who did we did that. Eric Clapton. Yeah. I'd only heard that. And I heard Bob Marley's version and I was like, what is this? Who is that girl sweet seam in the middle of sucks. Yeah. It's Kinda weird that people can do that. Just kind of like Redo your shit. Yeah. That most people don't know. It's weird. And you don't have to try to get our mission right. I don't know. If you get permission, you have to pay them by the moral duty. Yeah. But it's weird. You know, like sometimes I think it should be better if it was like this, I don't think it would be better if it was like that. Like, man, go write your own fucking song every now and then. Then it comes out bad ass though.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       There's a few ones. There is a kid cutty song that I forget the name of the female that re did it. Uh, one of his songs hundred times better at sort of girls singing it. Then came up with the version of smells like teen spirit. It's pretty great.

Speaker 4:          01:00:18       Yeah. Tori Amos, that bitch you stole wail on that fucking piano. She's one of the weirdest singers ever, man. It was something like super hyper sexual, fucking creepy Weirdo about Ryanair. Everything singing, screaming into the piano when she's fucking slamming. Now you can barely understand the words, but brilliant piano playing an incredible voice. I was a preacher. Wasn't that one of molestation son. Oh Wow. Girls. Some girls saying grammy winning artists. Yeah. Boy, you best pray that I bleed real real soon. How's that thought for you? That was one of her lines. Remember that boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon. I'm like fucked up. That's fucked up and shot a load in me sparky. And that's already should have come. But I hope the next couple of days where I didn't make people, oh that's curious. How's that for what? How the line is boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon.

Speaker 4:          01:01:16       How's that thought for you? Wow. Cause you know I still found a girl thinks really deep thoughts. That's the words. What's so amazing about really deep thoughts. Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon. How's that thought for you? Like fuck real thoughts. Fucking these amazing deep here's reality deep girls. I just want to, you know, wonder. It's amazing. Come back to reality. And I sewed on thoughts from, from girls. You know, George Harrison said this once and it's brilliant quote and I use it all the time. All I need from a girl is to be attracted to her. Everything else I get from a man. And it's really true. I mean, you know, you should have women in your life that you have good conversations with and that you enjoy their company and you know, you know, share a lot of interest. So that's all good.

Speaker 4:          01:02:05       There's nothing wrong with that, but if you don't, you're going to be okay. You know, as long as you have friends and you have chicks or you're attracted to, you know there's guys who live happy lives contrary to popular belief where they just have girls that they have sex with and they're attracted to them and they have all their interesting time and fun with their friends. The bachelor culture for a lot of guys, man, that bachelor culture is so fucking like the idea of being like a bachelor forever and it's so tempting dudes that are roped down and terrible marriages and their wives scream at him and telecom. Think of her now. I was like, I'm just enjoying single. I don't want to deal with any sort of responsibility. It's anything that comes attached to that. Very tricky. It's very tricky. I am happy, but I realized that I don't have to be, I could very well be with some crazy bet.

Speaker 4:          01:02:51       She doesn't like kids, you know, or she know. She has some unfulfilled dreams that she feels like these children are holding her back from. That's, that's a, that's an issue with a lot of girls, you know. And then all of a sudden there's some weird resentment because they, you know, they have to take care of the children more than the father does cause of dentist at work. I have a few friends that had kids that they did have that issue with. The wife would be mad at them that they didn't have to deal with the kids all day and she would like immediately give them the kids as soon as they get home and the wife were just lock herself in the bathroom and you know, fill the tub up and wouldn't answer questions and leave me alone. Like he'll just as a weird chaos inside your, your house and your family.

Speaker 4:          01:03:27       So for guys like that man, and they have a friend who's like just guessing. I grew up around a lot of pool players and a lot of pool players, our whole lifelong bachelors. Some of them wind up having kids here and there. Some of them even get married for a little bit. [inaudible] are playing pool till five o'clock in the morning every fucking day. And they're gambling, they're going on the road and they're going a tournament's that traveling all over the country and it's just a wild life. And in like the 1940s and the fifties in America, there was this big bachelor culture of pool halls. That's why pool halls were always associated with like deadbeats and well, people doing the wrong thing and you know, bad, bad people hanging out in places. It's because those are the guys that didn't get wives and kids and didn't get regular jobs and just said, I don't want to be a fucking slave.

Speaker 4:          01:04:11       I don't want to live a shit life. I want to have fun. I want to, I want to pay $10,000 sets at three o'clock in the morning. You know, they, it's, it's just a, they just decided that it would be more fun that way. I think a lot of it has to do with divorces. Yeah. Fucking divorce is terrible. Man. Crushes people as what it is. He goes through one divorce, man. It ain't like a breakup man. I have friends. I have, I have one friend that's been divorced twice this fucking dumb. He is in his third marriage now. He's been divorced twice a week. Most of those batches are saying we're had been divorced. No, I mean I made a divorced family like mom and dad was divorced. I don't want any, that's why he was going to be a bachelor because I know.

Speaker 4:          01:04:45       I don't know. I got that. A lot of it is bad relationships, man. It's hard. It's hard to be happy. I know a few people like that. That's their version of relationship was bad. The mom download spot and they're like, I just don't want to do that. Right. There's that. Yeah, there's, they don't wanna get married, but they don't mind staying with a buddy. There's that, but there's also, it's fucking very difficult. Especially I feel like on the east coast and the east coast, I found it much harder because a lot of the women were harder. They did have this like a lot of like, like hard edge sort of, you know, brassy, tough girl kind of shit, which I don't find attractive at all. I find repulsive. Yeah. Like girls, like their hands on their hips and they want to talk shit and getting like insult battles with you, you know, good luck hooker, you know, take care of him.

Speaker 4:          01:05:25       And I'm so not into that like getting in arguments and chicks. I mean, how many times have you dated girls like that? Yeah, most of the time I'm not into that man. You can't talk shit to me. You can't talk shit to me. If you're my friend and you can't talk to shit. To me, if you're dating, if you wanna start insulting me and getting stupid reasons because they want to because they're frustrated or they want to pick on something about you. And you know, God forbid if you're not the most successful guy, you know, God forbid if you know you're, you're in the middle of trying to put something together and then they start criticizing you. And I've had, I've had relationships with girls where they are like, you know, would critique what I'm doing and you know what, what, what's going to happen if that doesn't pan out for you and talk all kinds of crazy shit and you're like, I don't know what's going on but if you don't pan out for you, what?

Speaker 4:          01:06:09       I'm like, Bitch, I'm 21 or why? Why are you getting so crazy? Like what am I doing? We can settle down. I was trying to blow loads. Okay. And that's the only reason why we're hanging around your my pussy dealer. You know, you're my God damn vagina deal and you're insulting me while I tried to get my fix. I'm going to have to get it somewhere else. Black chick, it's cheaper. That's what it is. Bad. It's like, it becomes like some sort of a fucking sex barter system. You're willing to tolerate nonsense until you get older. And then when you get older you kind of understand who you are and you attract people that are a little smarter, a little more experienced in life, and then you can have real relationships with people that you actually find interesting. When I started going on dates, I was just trying to make the girl feel happy, you know what I mean? Like I was just like, just have her keep talking Fart crotch shot, which is have her keep talking, I'll be fine. Just make sure she's having a good time. And then later it's like, oh, I want to have a good time to just talk about stuff. For both of them too.

Speaker 3:          01:07:04       You do an I like, I like finding a girl that's like really young, like 22 and then have them having complete like, all right, I trust you. You know, like in here, let me teach you about this. Let me teach you about this. And they listen, you know? So if somebody came to me when I was 22 years old and gave me guidance, creep gave me guidance, that would be nice. From who though? Man. Maybe you shouldn't be giving guidance. They're looking for a father like little things like just go rejoin. Yeah, I guess so. How not to get too high. Got It. Know when to back off exactly what your father pay. You know you don't know when to stop. You think you're getting drunk as great. Just take you know, three drinks and then take a water. I said, oh, that makes sense. I can do that. It's like little things like that. Management,

Speaker 4:          01:07:51       art. That is very important because I've been out so many times with people and they just want to keep going. Come on. We know the drug Nugent. It's like, I don't need another drink. Why do you need me to have another drink? I'm happy right now. We don't all need to go to a Bolivian together. If you want to go to oblivion, I'll be right here and I'll tell you what really for, and I'll show you where your room is. I don't have to go to oblivion to stupid enablers. They're looking for someone to make them feel better about it. They're looking for someone to dive with them. Let's go into this crazy pool. Come on man. I'm going to the crazy Paul. Don't you want to go on a crazy book? You're like, I'll be right here. Sunbathing right next to the crazy. Cool.

Speaker 4:          01:08:23       So Brian, even having a lot of issues with girls, man in your life, I think, I think we need to write a book. Just changed the names to protect the NSA because this shit is just too good to waste too much good stuff going on. A soap opera, Twix, he vixen. He's, Look Brian, I think it cannot be disputed that you are in fact a pimp now. You've got bitches. If I, if I were all at camp, I didn't, we wouldn't want to murder so many bitches. Well, no pimps loved her murder bitches. No, I'm not going to murdering lynch. Are you concerned to think that I would exiting ready? Oh, you mean like if somebody else murders her, that could be happening. The podcast. Oh see we don't do this like a lot of those other guys, Bro. This is live. Okay. This shit is going to get out on the Internet no matter what.

Speaker 4:          01:09:02       It's on the Internet right now already. They're probably chopping this thing up and making, making a video of that as we speak. So you should be careful. You should be very careful what you say. You're paranoid. No, not you. I'm shit. Seriously. We shouldn't, we should change the names to protect the innocent and you write a book days of your lives too. Cause it's fabulous. The story is fabulous. You what you should do, you really should do what you really should do is start experiments. What do you mean like with them? Yeah, it start life as an experiment show just like yours. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. We're in the labs. We are in the labs. What are you going to talk about you? We're talking about gardening. Um, there was a few people when I used to, when I first moved to California. One of the weird things is when you meet people that are like, I'm sure you've met a ton of these people that are in a open Mike nights that have no chance.

Speaker 4:          01:09:52       There's zero chance. Yeah. Yeah. What does that, how weird is that feeling? That's why you staying with this. You've been in this more than like three times. Like why? Yeah, there's something absolutely wrong with them there for a couple of years and you're like, you're not getting any response. So they would become my science projects and I would, uh, I would literally like make notes. I'll be like, okay, now I see some, some resentment starting to show up. We didn't have resentment before, but now there's some resentment. We're about five years into this thing and now they see that other people are actually making a living and going out and getting gigs. And I would like be in the back of the comedy store and people would be pissed that no one would take them on the road with them. And I'm like, whoa. Like you don't even see your own sense of why do you think you should, like you're not good, you don't do well.

Speaker 4:          01:10:35       Those are the weirdest nights. When someone would go up, like Damon Wayans would show up and uh, you know, out of the, in the middle of like Sunday night, you know, they'd be a lineup and you know, a bunch of comics like maybe get on, maybe you don't. And then Damon Wayans would show up and some guys put fucking Bull Shit, man. What the fuck man, he's taking my fucking stage time. And you're like, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, Whoa, dude, you really shouldn't be on stage at all on Sunday and it's probably going to get up there. Let's be honest. You were only going to get up there and show off. Yeah, exactly. That's the other problem. They would do the same stuff. It's all or the commerce store. I hate it when people come in, like on Sundays, on Monday nights, the pop pop a night and they go on like during the employee section.

Speaker 4:          01:11:10       Uh, but they hate it more if it just doing the material. They've all a thousand times. Like, why did you come here during our sets to come to the same crap you've been doing? The only reason why I could see anyone wanting to do that as if you're just looking for a tuneup set, you know, it's like you, yeah, that'd be fine in a while. And you want to just kind of align some, showcase something loosen up. You don't wanna do that on Friday night at the comedy store was the most the at, I've never been to a place where people like felt like you're taking away from their time. It's cause you're all junkies and you're taking away their fucking juice. Yeah. That's all it is. Stephanie. Ask her, Hey, don't want David tell came in. It was like his first time coming in for like years that I'd seen.

Speaker 4:          01:11:46       And uh, she was like, you gonna go on and like, we're all like, oh cool, we get to see David Toe. And he's like, Nah, I don't want to bump buddy buddy. And she was like, I'm sure no one will mind. It was like, what are you talking about? Of course the mind, the letters stand, but they don't want it to happen. They'll mind if red Fox came out of the grave and was like, I want to go on there. It's like right after me. It would be the best time to go on. People would get pissed. Yeah. Yeah. It's a tricky thing man. That the bumping comedians thing and it gets real tricky when guys use it as like a douchebag move when they purposefully do it and they don't want to call in, they don't want to, they don't want to schedule it in advance. They want that cloud of being able to just walk in and go onstage. Like, look at me, I'm here. Forget what you were doing. Look at me. I'm here. I have that problem all the term to you jumping in like teachers go in there and just get that love. Yeah. What do you do with it when you get the love? Give it to somebody. Oh, you're so sweet. Some behind. So, um, do you think this is going to have a happy ending? Your scenario?

Speaker 3:          01:12:44       It's pretty crazy right now. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:12:47       Can you give two hours too much within a year or you won't get one bite at all within like a year one?

Speaker 3:          01:12:53       Yeah. The summary is in a year. The other two will both be pregnant with his baby summary is ex-girlfriend's all seem to be knowing each other and combining to form Voltron's of let's work together to keep each other. You get him back, but they know what they're trying to do. All using each other to, to get each other, but to get each other back and I'll stay in my life. Here's the deal, dude. As long as you keep smiling, you win. Okay. As long as you keep smiling, you always went, no matter what they do, if it doesn't hurt your it was when they're all because, exactly. Exactly. They become parts of Iraq building my own material. And if they're not your act motherfucker, they're going to be my act. Cause I'm thinking about talking about it. Oh they're in my act.

Speaker 4:          01:13:32       Cause I got a whole a whole bit I've been working on for years that you pay, you pay brow, you pattern, no matter what you pay. It's a fucking, you know. Yeah. You can't, first of all, you can't fuck over your head. Don't try. Don't do it. Don't do it. Fuck. Fuck. People that are actually attracted to you. You're your speed. Don't go crazy when you start fucking over your head.

Speaker 3:          01:13:52       Once you in the deep water every time, sometimes that's just fucking over your head is just a title. Like, wow, you won this title. If you didn't have this title, you'd be a little bit, go ahead. As being above your head. You know the fuck did you just say, I'm trying to, I'm trying to tip toe around things. Joe, I know what you're trying to do, buddy. If you're, what you're saying is

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       that I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll preface. I'll make it briefer. What you're saying is that it seems like they're above your head, but it's only because they have this label when in reality they're not, if they did not have that label of that one certain award. Right, right. You are just a crazy fucking person. That's right. But, but that's the only reason why I'm not above my head. That's that. You know if she's hot as shit. So sort of is above your head. Well, see, you guys don't see anything except the photo shopped version or what don up to be that character or hanging out up to be that character. If the, you know how much makeup would be so popular if that was the case, if we looked at completely bitches could just throw something like that. Pixie dust on their face. We're not saying you're an ugly guy, bro.

Speaker 2:          01:15:00       Don't get me wrong. You're a very handsome young man, young, beautiful features, especially when you're clean shaven. Why it takes years. I've dated some beautiful women and that's them. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying goes, yeah, I know what you're in ones, which we shouldn't even really talk about you. I have a better story. There's a, there's a guy that I know that was actually a rockstar and he was living with his check and he eventually got married to her and she was way harder than him and everyone knew that it was just a matter of time. She was just literally, she just was waiting to stick a needle in them yet, not yet. Not yet

Speaker 4:          01:15:34       married. See if I can do a year, I'm at a year. If I could do two years, I want to make more money. Let's see if I can make three years. She made it about three years. That's not that fucking needle in there and just talking socking money and blood out of them and just vanished and change. It became a totally different person and hired lawyers who attacked them. No prenuptial of course. So she just raping and pillaging like a fucking monster. Just tore through his life. Like all of a sudden she pulls off her mask and she shows what happened. He robbed, he got robbed, she robbed him, she fucked him. She sucked his dick. She did it all for like three or four years and then she robbed him. She literally robbed him. She made millions and millions of dollars and he was, he's a really unattractive guy and he's small and he's got like little hands and he's not, he's nothing manly about it.

Speaker 4:          01:16:18       And this girl is like, she's like an Alpha, she's the Alpha female, she's got a hot body, you know, she's like in shape and young and the like and, and, and she came from, she will like other relationships where she was dating pro athletes and a bunch. So she had been like targeting people like for a while and she just went after this guy and robbed a man and that was a clear example of fucking over your head for this poor fuck. And he was just, he was just bonkers over just bonkers man. He took her everywhere on the road with them. Yeah, I helped letter designed the house. They built a house. I said, you got your asshole looked right just one time and you're fucking hope forever. Amen. If you're some little weasley dude with terrible genetics and you know, just, you know, just happened to be like really good at a certain area of music and you know, you start making, you know, you know people like cheer when they see you on stage and you know, this bitch just started racking up dollar signs in their head.

Speaker 4:          01:17:06       But the scary thing from all his friends was how it changed. Like overnight, like when she decided to sync the needle in, it was like, all right, game's over, game's over, game's over. It's all different. Yeah. And I'll look, I'm not attracted to you. I'm not into, I don't love you. And this poor fuck tried to bring her back. He tried, he didn't understand. He didn't get it. He is, something must be wrong. What did I do wrong? We can make it work out. I don't like you just got, she got crazy and angry. It's so pathetic. I really, I thought, I mean, this is the most pathetic I've ever seen. You just attacking him and abusing him and his poor fuck. Tried to keep her around, you know, just like, I'm not going to make this marriage hard. I'm not going to divorce her.

Speaker 4:          01:17:42       I just want you to be happy. Could I want to be happy to like just anger, just no love and just sock the money from him. Socked it. Yeah. I got the, I got the, you know, if we break up, you'll come walk crawling back to me. Yeah. I said again again, and you will, won't you if you will. I mean, if she be fucking Hook you, dude, I get it. They fucking hook you. If it's three o'clock in the morning and you're standing there like sort of halfway committed to masturbating while you're watching television, you know, you're like playing with your underwear while you're watching TV. Like should I beat off? You know that that foggy thing for most moment, don't know this, but most men, while we're watching TV alone, we're in a constant state of semi masturbation where your hand is always on your deck and you're always adjusting your balls or you're rubbing your deck just to see if Dick would get hard.

Speaker 4:          01:18:32       Right now I'm watching a documentary on killer whales. Let's see if my dick gets hard. That would be crazy. If my dictus guard hard right here while I'm watching these killer whales. The thumb comes out of your mouth and onto your, no, don't do that stuff, but if that was going on, I mean like you start off, you're born with your thumb in your mouth and then you grow older. It goes to your Dick. Okay. Anyway, if all this is going on and you're in your underwear watching TV three o'clock in the morning and you open up the door and she was there, you would go, come on in. Of course, you know mouth.

Speaker 4:          01:19:03       No, I wouldn't say that, but if she was, if she showed up in a fur coat, she opens a fur coat and she said, shut your mouth. If you don't, if you don't call me at three o'clock in the morning and I'll come over and slap you that I'll put a camera on it so I could have the most mediocre sex I've ever had. All right, sure. That's not true. No, it is true. You just got to get better at making noises. What's that about? What kind of, I guess you could say that or I can go through the, you know, no. Dot, dot dot, dot. Be Nice. But yeah, no, I'm just saying what you're saying. I don't know what you're saying, but you don't need to. I know what I'm saying. You don't want to do that. Yeah. Well, you know what, man?

Speaker 4:          01:19:41       A lot of people that moments of weakness when I cover headsets. Yeah. Moments of weakness, especially with my, even the ugly ones that are like jewelry with like four kids did. I liked when I was like 15 I was still like, all right, let's do it. I'm very calm, very little confidence in myself and my Dick is hard and make smart choices, especially if I was alone in my house and halfway masturbating were so mad at the true trick our first and think about it as legitimate advice. It works. This is legit advice. I used to be.

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       We used to say that me and my friend Jimmy to Telia when we lived together in Waltham, Massachusetts, we would go out to avoid making fucking big mistakes. We used to like actively say that and do it like, all right, remember you got to beat off first before you leave the house or you're fucking, you'll chase after bad dreams and I would fucking make sure I just, as a rule, you know, we'd live together. We had a stack of Pornos, most of them that I stole from my stepfather. I stop fucking cases of fucking VHS tapes of porn. I stole some of them bitches when you can kind of say shit. And he's a mine. Just turned 12 when I moved out or when I came back home that I felt terrible. Two's dad. Yeah, my Stepdad. That's so great. Oh my God. My playboys.

Speaker 2:          01:20:48       Always just make sure that you know, always gotta make sure you peed off first before you leave the house. One time I walked in on him PTEN off in the living room. So impaired or your dad? No, no, no, no. My friend Jimmy. Oh, not my stepdad. Did he jump out? No. No. He's laughing. He's laughing. He just stopped. He stopped. He grabbed turn sideways. I couldn't see his deck. And he was naked in the living room. Huh? Well, you fucking free. We lived a little bit [inaudible] apartment. Yeah. It was a tiny apartment. It was just the living room and two bedrooms. He went there. And you had two bedrooms. Well, you know the, the TV in his room. He didn't have a TV in his room at the time. It took me on a TV in the living room. That's what it was. Was He watching porn?

Speaker 2:          01:21:23       Do what you gotta do it? Yeah, he's watching. Oh, okay. So you had to be there. I'm like, what? There's gotta be a reason to do it there. I said every retired I went to a big, I think I went to a Gig and I was just home earlier than he thought. Yeah. That was the salad days. Back in the day was Waltham, Massachusetts. Right in front of Burger King. You have ever Ingram telling you about? Um, about when he walked in and his girlfriend and fucking his best friend. Whoa. He got home early from Chili's one day. Oh my God. Held him off early and he came home. I was like, whoa. Wow. That's fucking crazy. That's nuts man. I'm glad that never happened in the ad. It would not know how to, that's such a different trail. It's one thing if she's fucking some other dudes, he was letting me stay there. Like, he was like, all right, you can stay here while you're, and then shoes are crazy, man. Some pitches just can't help themselves when they're around a man to want to fuck them and it'll get real close and they don't mean to do it. But once their pussy gets wet and that got touches it and then his dick is hard, all of a sudden, oops.

Speaker 5:          01:22:15       It's in there. It's in there.

Speaker 2:          01:22:17       And the friends who's not thinking, you can't think clearly, man. Hard dicks or monsters. They are monsters hard. Dick's have minds of their own hard. What'd you think? Oh, sorry. Heart. Dick's. Yeah, it was like, what the fuck is that? That's my new baby. The most romantic emotional self help books called Heart Dick. Well, I'm trying to do is combine men and woman together. I mean amount of basically Dixon women at heart, you know, and together we're all happy. We need heart Dick. It's like, uh, like goop. Like the Gwyneth Paltrow website. I'll start a website called heart dick. It's probably already registered and there's probably some, some dork out there in Australia right now to slam my keyboards too late heart pig doc. I can see the graphic. The top would be the head and then we'll come down to Sioux balls and come under. Yeah, look like I like it. Yeah. That's cool. Or any designer there and make a heart deck

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       and you can make the bottom of like fades to pink and with a little hairs. Unless you're black, you can get a black version two. We're hard. Dick is a fucking big giant chimpanzee. Black balls. This, we have the biggest balls ever. Yeah. If I, if my balls were black, if I was a black car, I would want like chimps size balls to have over micro do a really good joke about when and he said, uh, you think I have small shoes? You think small shoes means Oh, it was a fucking puppet comic. A black guy with an old white guy puppet. That's who told the joke. But he goes, oh, I know what the girls are. They could, you must have, I must have a small dick cause my small shoes. Well you know who else had small shoes? Horses.

Speaker 4:          01:23:47       That is funny. That old man, Donny. That's very good because a horse shoe is only like as big as yeah. And those decks aren't that passive. That's, that's actually very funny man. Horses don't have such big balls. I don't know. It tastes the same. Duly grills have a little tiny ass balls. Really animated. No, it's true though. Actually going over this in the podcast before, but I'll do it just for the point of this. This particular discussion for people who don't want listen to every fucking episode or observe the um, the, the size of your balls is directly related to how many female sluts there are and your community. Why am I ball so much bigger? This is why you grew up with a horse, or at least my ancestors did horse for real. It's true when your body is producing sperm, a huge amount of their sperm, like a great percentage of it, our attack sperm that are there only around to kill other sperm.

Speaker 4:          01:24:42       So if a of a guy shoots a load in some chicken, then you come in and you get sloppy seconds, your lows will go and kill his loads. Wow. Yeah. That's why chimps have big balls because chimp girls or are whores like there's that bit that I used to do in my act about a chimpanzees. It's a true story about fucking, they did studies on Champs when they taught them that if they gave them, they taught them the value of money and they taught the chimps that they would give them coins and if they gave the coins back, they give him food. So they realize these coins represent food and they would do things to earn the coins and then they would get food from it. The first thing that champs did was give the coins, the female champs and fuck them. There was the first thing they did.

Speaker 4:          01:25:19       They went right up to him and they were like, look, I got this. This is for food. And the the female chimps would go, they would get their food, they would eat their food and they would just like stick their pussy out him in the mail chimp because they wanted to fuck anyway. Well, they wanted to fuck anyway and they would allow it like whenever the mail chimp wanted it right away, there would have to be him chasing her around the fucking cage all day. And then finally she says, okay, fine. That's what most of it is a human equivalent to the sympathy handjob. Exactly. You know, it's just like in, in the chimp world, the chimp pimps, you know, they can just kick back and relax and then they're more attractive because they're, they're not constantly chasing after it. The ones that are on needy, just like in real life, if you're all needy, chasing after grow over and over and over again, I'll, she's like, all right, fine, you could fuck me, but if you don't even hardly talk to her and all the other girls are talking to you.

Speaker 4:          01:26:03       And then she's like, why is he with them? I'm surprised at how often girls were when you were like, I don't really want to, you know, a girlfriend. They're like, well that's, that's what I want. And then how many of them like, all right, that's fine. We'll do it on your terms. Yeah. But how many of them do it and try to trick you? They're like, oh, I want a boyfriend either. Yeah. It was a few of those. They give you just because you're interested. They're lying to themselves to the reason why you can keep these non monogamous relationships. It's just because you're an exceptional person. Mr [inaudible] everyone, she's not dating you. She's going to be dating some boring motherfucker. Yeah, an accountant or something who works all day and is exhausted at night and I always get gout getting fucking hyper hypertension because he's fucking stressed at work cause he needs to be talking to his boss about some sort of a promotion and he feels like there's a glass ceiling and you know you're dealing with nonsense man. At least your fun. You'd take a check to a comedy show and she's like, look at this guy. He gets up on stage. It makes people laugh. Yeah. So you're allowed to pull off this. I don't want a girlfriend shit for a little way I'm a Dick because if you wake me up before noon, that's new. Let me sleep.

Speaker 2:          01:27:04       It's like we'll have no problem. I hate that. Why did they have to all wake up early? Why go wake up? Just go do it. Do they really? Oh Man. It's all see it. Not the girls. I did. Well, people with regular jobs to wake up early cause I used to it. That's true. Yeah. You gotta be careful with a girl has a regular job or girls that are like hyper ambitious. C'Mon, let's go hiking. A hate died. I've never went skydiving. I want to try skydiving and you're going to go with me, bitch. I am not dying on a fucking farm rooftop. I'm not gonna. That's not gonna be the last thing I see as I go through the fucking roof of the barn. They never go on vacations. We never go hiking. We never got to Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara is amazing this time of year. Come on, let's go. You weren't around. I would never even think of doing that.

Speaker 4:          01:27:46       Yeah. I mean there's some fun shit you can do, you know as a couple that you really can't do with your buddies. Like I guess you could go wine tasting or something. It might be a fun,

Speaker 2:          01:27:54       cool. Go for a drive. Great to black out and get drunk. It's well, it's cool to just do different things, man. And he hurting. You're hurting inside. You know, I went to Santa Barbara and that's what happening with, there was like five wineries on a row and he just like walked from each one. It's so expensive. Getting a hotel in Santa Barbara, we can only afford one night, which was like $350 a lot of wineries too. Oh yeah. It starts there and it was like $350 a night. So we've got this really nice or actually it was a pretty shitty, you know, room. Me and Katie and uh, we went to like five wineries and then that's when you walk to them? Yeah. You just walk a little winery. What, what they were, they were fronts where like, you know, like store presence, but you do wine tastings there and it was like, you know, down the street or whatever. But basically drive just to drink wine. Exactly. But not even seeing the grapes. Like I thought that was part of the charm. You pull over on the side here, next five miles, it'll be this place. Go to the grocery store, graft and grief and look at them. And named go get to the wine, go to

Speaker 4:          01:28:52       Maynard's grape vineyards. How cool is that? Maynard from tool [inaudible] vineyards. Yeah. He's a fascinating guy. My buddy, Dustin is a sound guy.

When we were there that that night after we went to five wineries puking all night, like laying on floor, can't try to drag her into bed and she wouldn't go. So she slept in the toilet.

Speaker 4:          01:29:42       Wine is so awesome when it's good. You know, I never traveled like when I'm, I'm never traveling happier at like when I'm going through the wine menu, they'll want, when I'm with Lichtenberg Lichtenberger you can, you give that guy the wine menu.

He has not fucking around. I go over his house, Bro. He's got this giant in wine cellar. It's all temperature controlled. He's got all these bottles on the walls and he's got them all like segregated. These are from France. So these are California Cath, his hobby. Oh yeah, he's, well he's a master. I mean he really knows his shit. I went to his birthday and it was a wine tasting party.

Speaker 4:          01:30:24       I tried writing a bit about it and I started telling him on stage, but no one could relate. It was like so off the charts weird. So I'm there. Right. And you know, I, I enjoy wine. It's really good. But everyone else at the party is a wine connoisseur. And so we have this tasting menu with, they're bringing over these little tiny plates of food, like different hors d'oeuvres and stuff. And then they'll bring over a, a selection of wines to go with it. Often two or three different wines to go with it. And everyone will go over the selection and then they'll all talk about it. So I had a recorder with me and a recording. I wish I could find it because it was so ridiculous. It's like this one has a, a woody finish this. Yeah. It's like, okay. And the tannins and, and then this one is corked. And what someone would say, I think this one, it's cork and everyone else had joined. And I'd be like, this is my favorite one. The one that you're saying is bad. It's like my favorite one. Like how do we, I don't, I don't understand. Oh, I was all loose. I mean they have an educated palate and I'm like, why would you want your sense of taste to be that educated? Why would you want to be so goddamn specific about wine?

Speaker 3:          01:31:24       Well, well, what it is kind of cool about that is there, there's one I went to where the winery is next to, or like a rose garden or something. And so they were like, you can taste the roses in it because it's in the dirt. Oh, from Tony left a joint next to Tony. Tony Harris fluff had joint next to a box in a bag, in a sealed bag next to a box of um, uh, those dryer sheets and the joint tastes like, yeah, it tastes like dryer sheets. Oh my God. Do you exhale only? Yeah. So this is why is he threw a sheet zip lock bag. That's crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       That just wine though. A free said taste the roses and like you drink it and you just have this slight tit. It's kind of cool being right next to where the air would get into it. Wow. That's Kinda freaking, yeah. Wow. It's two Buck Chuck Berry. You ever drink two buck chuck? Delicious. What is that? Is it particles from the fucking rose? The sort of what? What is it? It's private just from over the years, you know, I've just, I don't do they really know. Is that like there's, these are science guesses, right? This is wineries talking about their product. It's the same thing as a joint. The touching thing too, I don't know what is it fair? But what, what happens in the air? It's like what's traveling over there? Smells, smell. That was a little tiny particles gets in at, that's why my friends say when you smell a Fart, it's little pieces of shit.

Speaker 4:          01:32:46       It is. No, no. That's why it's so offensive. Well that's one of the reasons why grilling over wood is so delicious. It gets it in the flavor. Gets it. That I have is I know how to cook a steak over mesquite. I always get mesquite hardwood. Like if you go to like a whole foods, they don't sell bearcats bearcats are all like, you know, if he bought like Kingsford all and that Shit, a lot of them, they're, they're jammed full of lighter fluid. You know, the way that the re, the best way to cook is you don't use, you don't use any lighter fluid. You just use paper and one of those cones, you know, they have those like, they're like a volcano. It looks like a chimney. That's it all up. So you pour all the coals in the chimney. At the bottom there's an area where you stuff paper.

Speaker 4:          01:33:25       So you light the paper on fire and the paper, the, the flames go up. He catches the mesquite wood, you lay it down and then, you know, once it gets to a certain temperature, when it's like really red, hot and steamy, then you sear it on each side for two and a half minutes and you finish it on the top and it just smells like the wood and the fucking meat is so delicious. You're used one of those chimney sweep logs. Uh, you know where you put it in and cleans your chimney out. Those, I guess it's a chimney out the fuck are you talking about? There's a log that clean. Yeah. You never know that. Oh, that guy that can't be good can, can imagine that just killing it. Killing birds. That's where all those birds are falling from. The fucking, somebody did one of those.

Speaker 4:          01:34:00       Right. How about this matter? I was just thinking about this, speaking of birds a fall from the sky because this, this, this really is kind of bizarre. You know, you know, when people think about the apocalypse, you know, people think about, you know, the end of days and shit like that. Stuff like that happen. This is the kind of shit they talk about, right? Biblical. Yeah. Yeah. Like dying fish and dying birds and all these things happening and every dog's following what is going on with the birds. They don't, while they're still good autopsies, but they're saying all kinds of crazy shit. Like some of them say that the, the birds like got scared by sound and slammed into, into a houses. Yes. Yesterday. Where's Chicago? They're lying for sure. But here's the thing. They, they're guessing and they're trying to come up with some sort of an answer cause I don't think they're really know.

Speaker 4:          01:34:40       You know, they're saying that these, these birds have a, uh, have their showing trauma on their body, of course, are shown the trauma. They fell from the fucking sky. Retard, like the idea that they ran into houses and that's how they died at stupid because there's not broken houses. I mean weren't all around. Yeah, exactly. And there's, there's no way they would all be like near the house if they're all slamming in the houses, they would all be right there up inhale eventually melted when it came down lower stacker hilltop. It could be it, that definitely can be or it could be some poisoned shit. Yeah. You know, we talked about that John Wheeler Guy, that guy that was assassinated, he was a chemical weapons expert and uh, you know, he was a chemical weapons expert under George Bush's father and he was involved somehow in other with the current administration, they found this guy tortured and murdered in a landfill.

Speaker 4:          01:35:24       And this was like right along the time that all this shit was going down, you know, with these birds falling from the sky and these hundred thousand fish turning up dead, you know, and massive fish kills. Sometimes that should happen. Sometimes you know, sometimes things go wrong or pollutants getting the water or you know what? If it's just government testing, it could be more, it could be them testing chemicals. Receiver theorist won. Yeah, well you know fucking the problem with conspiracy theories is some of this shit is really going on. The primary conspiracy theories is people want to come up with a theory for everything. A lot of their ideas are completely ridiculous and it they're hoping that these theories are right and I want the most sexy and ridiculous option to be real. Has there been any video of or witnesses showing of the birds falling like, hey, why are all these birds?

Speaker 4:          01:36:10       I do not think so. I don't think anybody, just some kind of graffiti prank that p kids or never even having them on over miles there you don't understand. These are like thousands of birds over miles, that very same species over and over again. Something happened. He's birds in the air and it was either they were poisoned or they're hit by hail. Hail is possibility. Some people saw fireworks, scared them and they slammed into things. But that doesn't make any dead birds is the next crop circle. We just don't know yet. But what I was saying is look at all the different shit that's going down. All these birds done, all these fish dying, all the water leaking of the oil leaking into the ocean, all the, uh, the, the, the floods that are going on right now in, in Australia. I mean, they're like, it's like the size of Europe is underwater in Australia.

Speaker 4:          01:36:50       I mean, it's incredible. And now the latest thing is the scientists are saying that there's a possibility of some gigantic superstorm that could hit Los Angeles or get to hit California. And that literally 25% of all the houses are going to be flooded in room. They don't know. They're trying to figure it out, but they're saying because of all the hot weather that, well, this is what it says con cal guess is that it will never happen. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good guess. But apparently it's happened. US Geological Survey. Uh, they, they've, they've, they've studied that the dates to 12, four, four 46, you know, when they'd done like core samples and the earth, uh, 1029, 14, 18, 16, oh five was the last time it happened. So it happens every few hundred years. They have these, you know, you know, it could be 800 years. They have these gigantic superstorms and what they're talking about, the superstorms raining for 40 days, dumping 10 feet of water and this is all possible and they're saying the storm would be goaded on by an atmospheric river that would move water at the same time rate as 50 Mississippi's discharging water into the Gulf of Mexico, into the clouds coming through us.

Speaker 4:          01:37:51       It just would be just a massive amount of water pouring notion. Let it go inland. Shit that we couldn't even wrap our head around there saying that literally it would be like, you know, it would be like the same category as a gigantic earthquake. I want a boat on a boat. I don't think a boat we'll help you do if you're way up here. But Dude, a boat is going to, the water's gonna come over the top, but smash on top of you and crush your head. I don't think a boat's going to help pour down. I Dunno. I mean, I'm [inaudible]. We talked to me. Obviously this never happened in recorded human history that we know of. You know, that we don't have any representations of what it was like, but I think that it's, I mean, if they're, they're really telling you that it's going to come in 40 days in dump 10 feet of water and that's insane.

Speaker 4:          01:38:35       The rate of 50 Mississippi rivers discharging water into the Gulf of Mexico, pouring down on the state. That's incredible. They're talking about 125 mile an hour winds, landslides. Think about all those guns. Goofy houses are all gone about, happens. All those Laurel Canyon houses that are on still early days of rain. Yeah, that's a wrap. Bitches. Like a few years ago, a bunch of them, too much rain. Right? And then like six houses fell down. Remember Malibu Laurel too. Mad mealtime, multibillion dollar houses at mill million. Excuse me. It looks seven, $8 million houses in Malibu. Just sinking big chunks of the hill. Broke off away from their pipes were sticking out, electricity sparks and shit. And then, I mean they had all this video of these things sliding down the hills like you do your, you can't make a house on the side of a fucking hill like that. That ain't cool. I know you want a nice view, but you're being ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          01:39:23       Like you just totally rolling the dice with Mother Nature. How fucking awesome is this? Whether it was 84 here in short, five fucking love. Twitter's from people in Calgary. Yesterday was 30 below with the windchill factor use or just got back from Chicago, said hadn't see daylight in four days. Yeah, it was snowing and overcast. Yeah, it gets gray and then you've got to take your jacket off here. Yeah. See seasonal affective disorder. That's a real shit. You know, you're, you're not happy when it's gray all the time. That's care. What you say about California still shit. This weather is good the most. The best thing about California is the sun and that's why they have those lights that you didn't even have this nightstand lights where it just gives you a simulation of the sun will do. That's why. That's why Colorado so fucking dope.

Speaker 4:          01:40:06       Colorado has sun 250 to 300 days a year, like they have very few overcast days, so even though it's cold, it's sunny. That's what we need, man. It's not the cold. It's so bad because when it's cold out yet sucks to drive. But you know what man, you put some fucking clothes on. You put a warm coat on gloves. When it's sunny out and it's cold, it's like, whoa, it's cold out here. But you're still smiling. You can go out with your friends and go snowboarding and shit and go fuck around. When it's Boston, Boston winters brow, they would just be like, God, when is it going to end? It's like you were being pissed on so you've been held down and pissed on it. You just have to deal with it. Okay. When are you gonna let me up. Still sucks dealing with snow in general though.

Speaker 4:          01:40:45       I hate fucking snow. I want to punch it smells bad. Ice is worse. Icy Rain is the worst. The worst is when it's like 31 degrees. That's scary shit cause it rains and it turns to ice the next morning and the rains on top three in the morning. It's so bad. When I was in high school, me and my buddy, uh, my sister's boyfriend sat on top of the garage and just watch these cars slamming, knew each other because our whole street was covered in ice and we lived on a hill. So we just sat, we drank beer and we sat on the roof and it was a show. We were just watching guys slide down and the cop cars to cop car came down slight. We told him he called the cops. Yeah, yeah, we'll be right there. You know, they came, they came. Dummies didn't listen.

Speaker 4:          01:41:23       Came Downhill. I tell him, you better go uphill because if you do, if you go downhill, you're not gonna be able to stop. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking don't tell me what to do. Fucking queer attacking each other, but no one's ever learning and changing their behavior. Well, it's still dull. They're not introspective at all. Talk Shit on Boston, but still one of the best places to have fun. It's one of the best places to do shows. It's a fucking, it's a great town. I just don't want to live there anymore. I can't deal with the winters, but the people are fucking phenomenal. They're fun. There's like a certain energy that they have. There's a certain like they're like a zest for life. You know when you, when you, you have to fucking walk home in the cold and you have to deal with that kind of shit.

Speaker 4:          01:41:57       You deal with those kinds of, that kind of weather, if any, having donors go there. Yeah. It's not the best way to describe it. I imagine it as like the downstairs in titanic, people dancing and having a great old time, like a poverty thing. There's a lot of rich people in Boston. It's just that there's a certain amount of no nonsense in a place where it gets zero degrees for a month. You know? It's that wicked, but it's different than like Montreal. It's like, why is no one from Vermont, so like assholes? Who you, well, Vermont is like Super Hippie, liberal, grateful dead California to Ben and Jerry's ice cream. It's a beautiful state to man. God, I, I used to do gigs in Vermont. I would drive up to Burlington and just be driving and I would just be trying to think of how I can live here.

Speaker 4:          01:42:41       I'd be like 21 years old and I would be in my car going, is there a way that I could figure out how to live here? Because this is how I want to live, man. I want to live where there's like a river by my house and it's like green grass and there's woods and it's like it's healthy. When I, when I drive around La as like, all right, this is where I have to live, right? I'm in my car, I'm on this fucking monstrous freeway that's six lanes on each side and every one of those jams solid. No one can move. I don't want to live like that. You want to take a dirt road and pass somebody on the left? I want to beat, I want peace. I just went to bathrooms are tired of how my parents tried to send it to Vermont.

Speaker 4:          01:43:18       A camp, learning retards for learning disabilities. What was wrong with you? Learning disability? What kind of learning disabilities? Uh, underachieving, uh, son of a middle class family, but it's not read a really up, you don't have a learning disability. You were probably just bored, Huh? Um, yeah, they say that. But that's why I think we've learned that there was a psychological block, probably something like that where it wouldn't let you get into what you're doing. It's so hard when you have a troubled childhood to be good at school because you know, I had a troubled childhood and you just don't want to concentrate on what they're teaching you. You're, you're just trying to figure out the whole world around you and how to, how to navigate through it. Cool people and yeah, just trying figure out how to not get picked on and how to fucking get home without, you know, having no fear for your life.

Speaker 4:          01:43:55       Like, which, what your kids do I have to avoid, where do I have to go and all that shit. It's, they're very difficult to concentrate on us history. Like how was this? The shit ain't affecting me. You know? I just like watching TV. I was kind of lucky because I hung out with the Asian kid and I went thought he knew karate. So really trying to fuck his sister, his sister, just the Asian girl. It was an Asian girl that wasn't related. Yeah, they weren't two different families and different families. They try to hook up. No, I think they hated each other cause I think one was Japanese and moment or with Korean, Koreans and Japanese. The Japanese, because of all the robots do the rape and Nam King. There's a, there's a crazy documentary that I watched is very disturbing. Some of the sheets the Japanese did to the Chinese, like genocidal gave in Cardinia potholes in babies and fucked them.

Speaker 4:          01:44:40       Ah, yeah, like really dark, dark, dark shit or just they just didn't respect them as as people. No, they killed systematically tortured them and did all kinds of crazy shit man. It's a, it's a really, really disturbing documentary. It was a documented this. I have it. If you want to watch it we can watch it. It's not, um, it wasn't released like I had to buy it from some, some a library somewhere actually had like rented and then not bring it back to you. One of those things. Yeah, just pay the fine so that you can get it. I couldn't get it anywhere else and it's a really creepy and there's, there's a bunch of shit on it online. If you could read about it. I don't know the, it's like this is all like my friend Rupert who was a director of your factor.

Speaker 4:          01:45:16       He, he turned me onto this many, many years ago and I got into it back then and it was so disturbing that I forgot a lot of the particulars, so I'm not going to, you know, I can't quote it, but if you, if you're into genocide and into reading up about how fucking cruel people can pay, it's the genocide dude. I mean, a lot of people are into finding out how deep, how long walks in the park. They were talking about this a few weeks ago at, somebody found it in his own lawn and is a yard sale. They found a human skin lamp from the Holocaust and he sold it for 30 bucks is right, bought it, and then took it to his friend, get thousand dollars got tested there like it is humans can dish. It was so old, they couldn't tell what race it had come from. Wow. That's true.

Speaker 4:          01:45:55       The Holocaust. Holy Shit. Like this had been someone's skin and now it's adorning a lamp. Uh, it's crazy. The judge, that was not that long ago. No, there are people still alive. Yeah. A lot of them. Lot of people, you know, there was, I watched the documentary on the moon landing, Swanson, there was this guy who was a, uh, a consequent cost Treatian camp survivor, and he had his tattoos and he was talking about Wernher von Braun that Wernher von Braun ran a rocket factory in Brazil, or excuse me, in Berlin. What a lot of people don't realize that the guy was the head of NASA, Wernher von Braun was a serious Nazi because that guy was alive today. He would be the Simon Wiesenthal Center said they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity. He used to hang the five slowest Jews in front of his factory in Berlin. Anytime, you know, people are slow, hang them, hang them in front of everybody else.

Speaker 4:          01:46:42       So everybody would walk through and see what the fuck was going on. Look, look, these are these guys you used to work with. Now they're hanging in front of the fucking door, slow go to work. I mean, it's dark, dark, dark shit. And this guy with his tattoo from the Holocaust was talking about how he remembers very clearly seeing Wernher von Braun. They would come in with suits and they know I'll be working and they would come in and inspect the work and walk around people and he'd fucking hang people hanging right in front of people. You know? And this was a, there's a thing called operation paperclip. They were all brought over here. All the Nazi scientists. Yeah, that's what it's called. They were all brought over here to run NASA in the United States had like dog shit for a rocket program before Wernher von Braun came over.

Speaker 4:          01:47:20       He was a super genius. I feel like it's easy to like dehumanize that moment when you say like, oh, he used to hang people. But if you imagine it from the person's point of view, like you're just taking a ranch or something and someone grabs you and you're just screaming to like, please don't, don't. And they didn't put it around your neck. All right. And how many people do we know that are just lazy as fuck and would slack off and not, not made workers. Yeah, me too. You know? I mean until someone died and then I was like, all right, I'm going to need to get through this. You know, and then you know the of children and your children are being held captive to your whole family is being held captive. I mean, it's really, really scary to think that that was not that long ago and that while this is going on, it was so much more important for us to win the space race.

Speaker 4:          01:47:57       They were like, yeah, Wernher von Braun, Mr Nancy, come on over here. Get on over here buddy. Don't worry about all that other shit. You get over the and whatever, whatever, whatever, up race or race. No one's going to know. They're not going to know your Wernher von Braun from NASA. Don't sweat it, buddy. We're all good now. It's all groovy. That's like what your friend is like really douchey. Didn't like just look, just don't bring it up. Let's just go. Just leave this fucking guy though. Man. This documentary was so intense when he would chose Tattoo and he would talk about seeing Wernher von Braun and talk about, you know, the, you know, how they would hang people in the front of the factory. Like this shit is never leaving that guy's brain. You know, that guy was a slave for a while and here now he was living in Miami and you know, relaxing his entire retirement years away.

Speaker 4:          01:48:39       But there was a point in that guy's life where he lived in utter terror surrounded by monsters. Like the goddamned star wars episode. The storm troopers would come in and they would just, you know, a lot of people he knew were dead. That's some scary shit. Think that people are willing to go that and they go that, you know, relatively easily. You know, it's not, it's not like, you know, that's hard to get people to do. It's happened many times. I mean, it is hard, but it's happened many, many times throughout history of Pol Pot with, you know, so many different cases of genocide. The Stalin, I mean all these different examples all around the world. Liberia, yeah. So many all around the world. I mean, look what's going on in Iraq. I mean, if you talk about the numbers in Iraq, supposedly, uh, according to many credible sources, a million civilians have died since 2002 or 2003, whenever we invaded.

Speaker 4:          01:49:25       I'm not doing it in a million a million. Wrap your brain around that, you know, wrap your brain around that. That's some crazy shit. Do you remember that old footage of the, um, the guys on tanks and they were listening to death metal and they were fucking, they were shooting, they showed like what it's like to be over there in Iraq. Remember that's just the x's eliminate them. Yeah. These guys, they were listening to music. They were listening to like crazy, like metal music while they were shooting people in Iraq. And I remember it was a, it was a video and you know, they were interviewing these guys and what's it like? It was, you know, they're smoking cigarettes in their real young and it's like so surreal to them. Yeah. But it doesn't even seem real. Apparently. This is all, um, the wiki leaks put that out too.

Speaker 4:          01:50:02       Oh yeah. That was the first one. We're missing something. I didn't know that man. Yeah, I did not know that was the first thing when they got some friendly fire situation. See somebody kill talking about, it's called collateral murder. That's a video that they released. That was the start of all this wiki leaks. This shit was way before that. A few years before that. Yeah. They've been involved for a long time release and shit. I did. I didn't know that they had been around as long as it had been around that a sandwich dude. It's so fucking interesting. It's fascinating. But seems so douchey. Like when you read, did you read his online dating profile? No. Oh my God. He's just, just so douchey. Just like it comes through the screen and gets your fingers greasy. Really. Like, you know what he's talking about? Like you know, who does it, what does he want to meet people for Friendship for, you know, whatever.

Speaker 4:          01:50:46       And it's like, it's just like, it's the, first of all, literally it is impossible to make an online dating profile and not come off Douchey. It's not possible. It is not talk yourself up. Right. You have to talk yourself up and you have to lie about what you're looking for. What are you looking for? I'm looking for some really easy pussy from a hot girl is not going to ask too many questions where it's not going to get crazy and you're never going to be mad at me cause I don't want to be with you anymore. Can I get that? No, no. And so everybody's got this whole thing. I'm looking for romance. I mean even if you're not, you know, so it's impossible to, you know, I'm outgoing but I, you know, I'm, I'm friendly to a fault and look for the real me.

Speaker 4:          01:51:22       You'll be pleasantly surprised. Oh good. Like what you find is someone, she should make a profile and just overdo. Sure. We're doing almost like Brody Stevens that where it's like, like a becomes a comedy set. Scott, I have a couple out there somewhere. Do you have dating? Probably hilarious. Big will after a fiance, the seven year relationship ended. I went through a, like a or I have been single in eight years or so, seven years. I have no idea what to do, so I got into the online thing because it was before Facebook and Myspace, you know? Really, so it's just making a my space profile pretty much just the craziest thing. What you did is you want in the last like fucking 70 pounds or something. What did you lose? How much do you lose? I got 70 70 pounds, 70 pounds. I remember when you got super giant like Smurf, like yeah dude, you couldn't walk straight. Your legs would rub in the middle. You'd have to, you'd have to, Ralphie may at. You'd have to circle your legs on the outside and then bring them back in the front or it's impression, a good impression. He's got the worst impressions of anyone I've ever heard of. Yeah.

Hey, I would go for it, but it has to be a certain kind of a certain kind of black check. Not a big one. Not the one that like if you just don't squint your eyes and imagine them with short hair that they're a guy. Oh, by the way, have you seen pictures of Little Kim? Yeah. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          01:55:22       that's a football player, I think. Isn't it weird how the doctors come out in scrubs as if they just came from the hospital? That guy. Why don't you just Google the actual image? It's on the second page.

Speaker 7:          01:55:32       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:55:33       it's really crazy. You got to see it. They don't just have it. Can you just Google images? What do you do when you're scrolling? Like my mom, this is how my mind, Dark Ages. I'll find you. Mine. You're just always in a hurry. Why are you always in a hurry? My mother became Jewish chickson name. It's the most annoying impression you could do. Have a mother, little Kim, little Kim, l I. L little Kim photos, plastic surgery. What the fuck? Type all that out and here we go. Bam. Look at her on the right kind of crazy. It kind of looks like it might be makeup. She was on Jackson. I don't know Bro. That's coming off. What? She has the cat eye. I look at her nose man. Other ones, their before and after. She looks a little like Janet Jackson. If there's a way worse, Bro. I think way worse. Janet Jackson. Well, I haven't seen Janet Jackson recently, but for the longest time she kept it together. See before and after. Let's see that one on the top was it? That's her. Look at that dude. She's hot there. It's already a little Asian. Huh? Whoa. Look at the difference that is monstrous. That it's terrifying. And then it was kind of looks the same though. You said about

Speaker 4:          01:56:46       people, man, where they, they just start fucking changing their face. That's so scary. Well, I can, I can totally relate to that. Like having to, haven't done, not what tattoos but with having done, um, hair transplants because a dunk doing hair transplants, like I was losing my hair and I was like, well, how do I stop this man? Is there a way to stop it? I don't want to wear a fucking wig and I want to be bald. Like, how do I stop this? So then a friend of mine had gotten hair transplants and he had me convinced, he's like, dude, just getting her to transfer the team. They take it from the back. They put it the front, like you do it as you're losing your hair and you can keep your hair. I'm like, oh, okay, cool. And so I did it and right after I did it I felt like, oh, now you have this stupid scar in the back of your head.

Speaker 4:          01:57:23       Didn't they tell you about the scar? That all I knew about the stupid scar but I didn't think about it. You don't need to think about ads in the back of the head was going to notice, you know, you think everything's going to turn out normal and be fine. And then I wanted to do another one to correct it. So I did another one and it looks still looks like shit now the scar in the back of my head is bigger and after a while, you know, it's like you can get roped into like I know a guy who um, uh, he does, he's, he passed away a few years ago, but he was obsessed with plastic surgery and he was a nice guy and he's in show business and he had done a bunch of different things to the point where his face look weird and his, he had peck implants and he had a bunch of hair transplants.

Speaker 4:          01:57:57       You just start, you start fucking with your appearance like that and it becomes like a up, it becomes like a pathology. Yeah. You like, you get sick like [inaudible] who have issues that two people do the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. Two, three, four. Well, I shouldn't say that. I mean both of my arms or sleeved, but I'm stopping. I mean, I don't have a problem. I just felt like when I did the one, I felt like I was on balanced and then I really had an idea for the second one that I wanted to do and I'm like, I don't mind having two sleeves of tattoos. It's not like I'm getting them on my fucking face or anything crazy. Which speaking of does something like, there's a line where you're not supposed to tattoo and your face is that line above you see the Kushi Lane. Have you seen Gucci Mane?

Speaker 4:          01:58:35       Have you seen it? You haven't seen Gucci Mane. Gucci. You type up Gucci Mane. Face Tattoo, get ready for this. Gucci Mane is a rapper. Okay. And he got a face tattoo and his face tattoo is an ice cream. Cassava, I saw the, it says three scoops of ice cream on it and it says burr. That's it. I'm thought, I know it's top left. Top Top. That's not that. There we go. Yeah, that's the image. Click on that. Folks online. You, you, you, you have to see this if you haven't already, most of the Internet already has seen it, but it's like, it's clear madness. I mean, he gets released from a mental institution and then he has an ice cream cone tattooed on his face. This guy out of war, if you,

Speaker 3:          01:59:18       it's like it's live like clinger, right? It's my horrible, I'll just keep saying I'm a cross dresser until they let me out and me more. It was, I can't match. Goes on forever. Check Brian's tattooed or Brian's tattoo. He got it from a guy who was learning how to Tattoo, so we talked to them for [inaudible] school. No good cheap shit. This chick that w that worked for me when I was a manager of movie theater. She's like, I want to be a tattoo artist. My Ha, my boyfriend owns a tattoo studio. He's been trying to teach me on cantaloupes. Would you like to be my first person? It will be free. I was like, sure, why not cantaloupes? You know you're supposed to practice on pig ears and shit. That's just relax on pigskin similar to humans scam, but it's an art form man. Like, you know my boy Aaron Dellavedova, my buddy from a crew tattoo who does my stuff, he totally offered to to fix it.

Speaker 3:          02:00:07       It's kind of funny story now. Like I was the other day, I was just laying in bed and I worked on this movie called a better way to die a long time ago and my job was to do like, all right this, you need to make this a tag, this whole area, like all these cars, all these walls, you need to make it little at graffiti. Like it's a gang ridden a alley in Chicago. Yeah, I was doing said what? Fuck you become so interested in this. So that was a chick I'd be showing to you right now. How fast it was done so many things. It was like three days after I got this tattoo and I'm like, dude, I'm just going to put my fucking tattoo everywhere. So I just sprayed my tattoo on the walls, on the cars and that put nine inch nails and a couple of places.

Speaker 3:          02:00:47       But then I did all these like my tattoos and so the other day I'm just sitting there watching it and then it was like, good. I'm like, Oh, this is a movie I worked on. And it was like, wow, there's my waterfall tattoo everywhere. I was like, that's, I just changed that scene into like the faggy ass gang scene everywhere by the way. You explain to people what waterfall tattoo ones cause they don't, well I got, I went and got this free tattoo or whatever and I looked in the book and then the couple of things I liked were like Egyptian turtles and, and I saw it. I was like into Asian girls at that time or whatever. So I got an are in Chinese and they put it together and I said I also like Spiderman. So they mixed the three up and it's like Spiderman logo with a Chinese letter in the middle. Hey, I'm, you know that I have it as a new hire primate tee shirts coming out yet. Yeah. For folks who don't know, if you go to higher primate, higher-primate.com that's my clothing line. I actually have a clothing line now called higher primate and it's real

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       low key. I'm just kinda trying to figure it out before I going to go commercial with it. Yeah. That's all just t shirts. I'm going to have fanny packs to stay strong. Faggy pack date. Truong bitches love annual packs coming back, son. I've traveled a fair. Any artist fears? Seen it. Brian seen it. I'm not fucking around with his fanny pack would be cool if you renamed it baggy pack pack faggy packs. That's not bad. That's a good idea, right? Why not, right, right. It's not fancy. It's not fag hag enough though. Pat, any pack. Anyway, the point is, my point is with these new t shirts, we could, uh, I want to make that red band logo with the, the explosion. The, the suicide kitty suicide kitty. Yeah. Let's turn that into a shirt. I've got to do that. We'll sell it. You know, we could just, I'll have these guys make it for you.

Speaker 4:          02:02:23       You already have the thing. So we have the company to make sure it's now and we'll, uh, we'll sell it on. We know what, we'll just sit on red button, red band.com because I know a lot of people on the board asked about it. I would wear that shit. Yeah, I like it. It's kind of an inside thing, like no one would even know what the fuck that means. You know, it's so funny as a, uh, I, those other podcasts I did the death squad podcasts, stitcher, just put them on the radio and they kind of like make a local thing like welcome to the United States has like, did they, they know that that's like a Hitler cat, that Hitler who's covered with explosive, explosive, no suicide in his hand for people don't know, like what does his death squad thing. This all happened when we were on a opie and Anthony, and this is like fucking many years ago.

Speaker 4:          02:03:03       Uh, we, I came on to Opie and Anthony and uh, I brought with me Eddie Bravo, uh, Tait Fletcher. And this was like right after Tate had done the ultimate fighter and Tate was a traveled on the road with us. And Brian, you came on to write and who else was already, did you go, you can walk about another time. He came on a different time. You came out of the time when we roasted Jamie, uh, saw that as a baby and the baby bird that was that far off in another minute. So we've done many, many times. Anyway, we'd come in and you know, Tate is such an imposing figure taters this gigantic fucking hunk of a man and a we'd walk in the room with, you know, everybody knows Eddie Bravo is his Jujitsu master. He just choked out horror Gracie. And then, you know, it's like so oop goes looking at Joe Rogan's with the death squad and then it became weeks, you know, just thought it was so silly.

Speaker 4:          02:03:47       You know, death squad. We started calling ourselves dusk squad. Yeah, I started, actually, this is kind of, it's kind of interesting. Back in the day when podcasts were first made, I started making little short Joe show videos and then call them death squad. And they were only available on iTunes as a podcast video podcast. I had had 12 of them or something like that. Yeah. Those fucking old videos do. Some of those were brilliant. I went back and watched a couple of those old desk squads that you did. Some of those were fucking funny as shit and some of the moments we captured were so ridiculous. Getting mad at you for about Ari Shaffir becoming a lawyer. Okay. There was a guy who was insane and he said he was the Holy Spirit and he needed help and he wanted to somehow or another, he wanted me to help him and, and then Ari got involved, you know, you call a call. I got her home. I was, I didn't have a spot. It's like 1230 or something at the store. So you, you had having this

Speaker 2:          02:04:37       whole argument. I had no idea. You're just calling me like, hey listen, I need you to be my lawyer. I'm like, what? What do you mean if you're my lawyer? He's like, someone's gonna call you and you got to be my Lord. I'm like, what should I say? I'm like, Hey, I've got another call here. Your mother, goodbye. [inaudible] one of those dudes who, you know, if you got a friend who was a standup comedian, but he has got a wife and he's got kids and he's got a day job, he's got a lot of, you can't count on that motherfucker. He's not always down for the fund. But I could call Ra should fear at three o'clock in the morning. Ari, I need you to represent me as my lawyer. Are you comfortable with this? Uh, because the background is pretty high right now, but, so anyway, go ahead.

Speaker 2:          02:05:13       It's got called me so he can take down the footage of you. You said you have to call my lawyer to take on this footage. It's very important. If you want to take down the footage, you're going to have to call my lawyer, my lawyer, because this crazy guy, he was completely nuts. And in retrospect and you thought was the Holy Spirit. Yeah, I thought it was the Holy Spirit. I forget a lot of other shit that he said he was trying. He was gonna Sue, John Edwards psychic for being a false prophet. And I remember going like, why should we sue him? Like, why would you sue him? He's like, this is a false prophet. He was going to, but why you, you know? He had a lot of interesting things to say. Yeah, great. Back massage too. I got him to give me power of attorney over all his affairs verbally recorded it.

Speaker 2:          02:05:50       I don't know what I do. I can get the recording. Yeah, I did it and then he disappeared for a while and then he came back. Right. Sued me. How long ago did he go to court court and sued me? I forgot about that. He sued me for millions of $18 million. We get nervous at all. Where you even a little bit, well first I wrote this guy on for like six months to a year. Just kept until they got too annoying and I was like, I'm bored. But yeah, he sued me for big fig, a bad attorney. I'm like, I represented you pro bono. How many people are out there right now who are looking to get mad at something like, that's real good fucking Dick. Text somebody with mental illness and make fun of them. It's really funny fucking Shit. Hope you drowned in a river of age that's like obviously it's not a nice thing to do, but it was fun anyway.

Speaker 2:          02:06:33       There's a guy was annoying. He was annoying from the get go, which is why we did this in the first place. We couldn't get rid of them. It's amazing. How bad is it if you actually eat toothpaste? Terrible for in Florida. Really awful. Yeah. I mean it's not going to kill you because like do you real toxic levels of Florida. I bet if you ate a whole tube of toothpaste you could probably get really sucked up. Even like one drop to go to the emergency room. No names to faces or something like that. They might say that just to cover their ass cause I used to that we, that was my go to thing and you know, keep a tube of toothpaste and my car, you know and just like eat it [inaudible] something bad. Don't do that man. Well, that was like when I was 16 about fluoride in the drinking water and everybody claims to know exactly. By the way that sound you're hearing is a shot at the volcano you ever comes to. No, but where are the people dying? Where is it happening? Interesting. Where the interesting part about it is that that is all a, supposedly if you go online and read the websites, communists based on a Nazi shit, the idea of keeping the people a passive and keeping people

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       in their place and making sure they're docile and easy to control, and that was the idea of putting fluoride in the water supply. I highly doubt that's why it helps your toy. Yeah, I think it's probably, I don't know if it does help your t's. I don't really know cause there's a lot of things that say this. No, that's not the case. What helps your teeth is fucking cleaning him. You fucking pigs now. That's what's good for your teeth. I use Tom's of Maine toothpaste and it doesn't have fluoride in it for that shit. There certain types of sweet berry taste taste like you're eating chocolate tastes like the shit I used when I lift weights and I put chalk on my hands.

Speaker 3:          02:08:04       Do you think that maybe that toothpaste is PR missing some thing that you,

Speaker 4:          02:08:09       no cavities. I haven't had cavities in a law. Really. I'm, I'm pretty good at brushing. That's going the last time I went to the, um, to the eye, first of all I went like years without any teeth cleaning and then I went to the dentist and I didn't have any cabinet has really surprised you got to do it dude. If you fuck up like yeah, learn, learn from my mistake. I eat so many gummy bears. Don't, I definitely have cavities and you go to sleep right? You just crash. That's not good. Good morning. And you got to clean your teeth because your gums will receive to which, which did happen to me. There was an area where I had a a cap and um, if you got a really clean around those things, cause it's not like natural, you know, you can get a lot of plaque and then my gum is receding a little bit.

Speaker 4:          02:08:50       So then I had to get it really they take gum from the back and put it in the fall. It wasn't like that. It does. They do do that though. It's really bad. Or is there this great bit of a hair transplant now because get them now, not 25 years ago when they were terrible. Now is when you get the procedure. Even now, don't get it a ticket from me folks. This is the way I describe it. This is how stupid the idea of hair transplants are. You're taking, it's like taking people who are really healthy and moving him to a neighborhood where everyone's dying. Cause that's what it's like. Cause they, the hair that you have up on the top of your head after you've transplant Harris, the other hair's gonna fall out too. So even though it looks okay at first, like when I was on like news radio is when I first got it done, my hair looked fucking sport. He just started Rogan. Did you look at Rogan for a picture?

Speaker 3:          02:09:32       No, I was, I was thinking about doing it. I don't really need it too bad because I've always had high. We're now, but the problem is is if you look at Rogaine, it only does the middle.

Speaker 4:          02:09:42       No, no, no. Broken. Does the back corner. Oh No, no, no, no. It does everything. It was a study that they did in the study they did was on the vertex of the scalp and the idea was that you can't prove you'd have to, it would have to go and spend millions and millions of dollars and I studied to show the reason why it works on this, the reason why it works at all is it increases circulation to the area so it makes your hair grow. It will work everywhere in your scalp. It doesn't just work in the back of your head. Yes, especially Propecia and Rogaine. Same thing, but most people have bald spots. In the back of the head and he had a concentrate on one area of the head cause they needed like a patch, you know that they would prove that it worked there. So they proved that it worked in the back of your head and so they just went with it. It proven to grow hair good enough. They don't have to show you that it works. It's not flowing to grow in the front. But it's not just writer. But he died. No, it does. It's, it's the way it works. Shift Minoxidil Minoxidil when they first made it was a high blood pressure medication.

Speaker 3:          02:10:28       See, I swear to God, even like on Amazon or on their own advertising, it says this is the area. Exactly. They have

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       to because that was the study scientifically proven to wow. Yeah. See they made the study. Right. I see what I'm saying. That's kind of weird that they have to do that though. And they couldn't say and it might work on the other side. Yeah, no, they don't want to do that. They want to, you can't say anything by that ghost. This is, we don't look good here. Sucking out of plastic bags, sucking missed out of bags. You know, this does not look like a, like something a healthy person. When did your thing it's done. I've got to go soon.

Speaker 4:          02:10:58       Okay, well let's end this fucking crazy thing. You put a couple shows. Yeah. Vegas February 4th yeah. We're doing a bunch of shows together. Ari.

It's like 2000 and this would be the biggest show I've ever done. Yeah, it's pretty well, I think in Canada we did some bigger than that. Everybody was behind us. That was, that was a few thousand. That was nuts. That was a Calgary.

Speaker 4:          02:11:47       Calgary was crazy. We did a bunch of shows up that you missed the Toronto. Toronto was shit. I'm trying to do my special in Toronto, but I'm having a hard time getting a venue. It's in April and a lot of these things are booked in advance. But if I get a get a venue, a good venue, I want to do this special in April in Toronto, Toronto. I recorded myself that a, a couple of different places and I've got an hour and 15 minutes a new shit. So that's a enough where I can widdle it down to what I want for like a 44 minute. What are you playing music for? Prime. We told you you can't play music unless I made this song and you make a song. You're so multitalented wait a minute. You make newsletters and, and you're a stalker and bang hot chicks and you, you do set design. And I hear you're doing standup comedy when you perform it again,

Speaker 4:          02:13:19       And what it is is he does like a standup show but it's not, they don't talk about, because they don't do like set up punchline set up punchline. It's mostly like really funny stories because a lot of sort of like, you know like podcast stories. I've got a lot of the, the funnier podcast stories, you know, and Adam Carolla show or in any of the other ones. It's like, it's, they're not like a setup punchline. It's can't like do home in front of a comedy audience where they expect a certain like rhythm but it's, it can be slower. It's more like Annie Hall as a comedy where it's like, it was good right now as huge laugh, more involved, you know, and you're going to see a comedy movie, right? If you're going to see a comedy movie, it's not like always funny. Always funny. Like they have to set up a lot of what's funny.

Speaker 4:          02:13:58       And it was like just a lot of spots where there's, you know, you're not laughing for 10 15 minutes but on stage it's got to be set up. Punchline, punchline, set up punchline. But the what you're doing is like you, you're, you're making these guys, you're giving them like a in a picture to venue. Yeah. Jellies were fucking spectacular man. Your story of when you went to a strip club in Alabama with, what's his name? Mark Coleman. Yeah. That's like a perfect like crazy story. Yeah, that's a PR. Yeah. Yeah, there's exactly, I tried to do that one for with comedy, like do it on stage, but I had to punch it up too much. I had to add a bunch of shit to it and like shorter. Yeah. I added combined two different scenarios for crushers. Tells the best story of all time. The Tracy Morgan style.

Speaker 4:          02:14:36       He's supposed to come on tomorrow. I got to, he lands today though. I got a fucking good, yeah, it's Tracy Morgan. Is that the heart of a million great stories. It's good to know. There's dudes like that out there man. When I see a guy like Joe Diaz or a garlic, Tracy Morgan, I just want to just shake their hand and say thank you. Thank you for, thank you for rocking it. Mason just going out there and realizing, man ain't know, nobody knows how the fuck this thing works. Just go crazy. You know, having a guy like Joe d as in your life do well, do you wonders? You know? I think he's Comedians for real. He's like having him around you, it like makes you funnier. I really believe you're in a relaxed when you kidnap someone. All right. Yeah. Not only that, he's just, he's show, I don't give a fuck that he makes things more Cheley and more fun.

Speaker 4:          02:15:20       It just, it's more fun. Like Joe, I always tell Joey like whenever every special I've done, and this is one of the things that I, one of the reasons why I've thought about not doing it in Toronto, the number one reason is I can't get Joey up. Can't get up there with him with aggravated kidnapping and the Columbus that places the bomb. It was the bomb. But what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to do somewhere that I haven't done and I really love Toronto. And uh, my, my last show in Toronto sold out like months in advance. It was crazy. Like I got so much love and Toronto and if the show was so much fun, I was like, this would be a great place to do my shit. And it's not like I've done it a bunch of times where they've seen my material over and over again.

Speaker 4:          02:15:56       It's oversaturated and you know, pretty much everything on, I mean, everything I'm doing in my sets these days is all shit that wasn't on my old stuff and saw all that stuff has been phased out and it's all straight new stuff. So most people that I'm running into on the road, unless they get on youtube all the time, they don't know the material. So to me, Toronto is like the perfect spot. You know, it's like they're, they're cool, they're smart or enthusiastic. It's a fun city. But I don't know if I could do it. I'm going to have to find out. We still haven't figured out if they get the venue, you know, and then you know, there's also a can't bring Joey. Oh yeah. So I wonder if you can get them, eh, maybe, maybe not getting up there. He, he told me he was going to do, we had some gigs in my truck was Joe Rogan was the one I'm gonna do.

Speaker 4:          02:16:35       I'm flying to buffalo from Buffalo. My friend Mikey statue. Yoni. He's going to fucking drive me up there. He goes. He's going to drop off some heroin. Halfway on the web is a drop by the bridge. It's a perfect time. Yeah. He would always have some fucking crazy plan. He had some crazy plan to sneak in to do gigs. Wow. Yeah. He wasn't fucking around either. He was dead serious and he would do it. He, those crazy stories are really, they're all fucking happen. Yeah. They're all real. They're all real. When you've hung around with Joey, as long as we have, and still Joey to this day, still completely unpredictable. Like he was supposed to do Brian show last Sunday at south and gone. He just disappeared. It was watching the mechanic earlier, the old one, Charles Bronson, Bronson, he's upset and new ones coming out this fucking Jason Dayton.

Speaker 4:          02:17:20       What the fuck's his name? Get the fuck Outta here. Charles Bronson Cock sucker. He's like angry or fuck you want man. And who was the dude that played Charles Bronson's protege? I don't the real one. Who's the, yeah, the famous guy that became a really nutty, uh, he, he became like the biggest drunk in Hollywood. He was like super handsome and young and devastating or no, no, no, no. He's, you know, he's on celebrity rehab right now and he's a source of awesome entertainment. If you haven't been watching your work, I don't remember the guy's name. It's like a three word name hold on. And the mechanic dog Ronson. That's the new ones coming out real soon. Yeah. That's just coming up. It's the Cap Jan Michael, Vince is not ever hearing about, and he was like this, you know, this fucking studly looking all American super handsome actor movie star character.

Speaker 4:          02:18:08       And he, um, he went and lost his fucking marbles and became a huge drop just second right there. Yeah, yeah. I remember we've done these interviews with them now and he's just a stuttering fucking retard. I love that. Isn't it weird math it when you, you know when you run into people like at the store or something like that that have hit the rocks to Kravitz has gone completely down. It's like he's burned out. What happened? He's just like, it's like the, the drugs, whatever it just to something was in his brain is fucked up. He just, he can't talk to me. A normal human being and just fills you with sadness. Being around him. He's just like, you can't carry a normal conversation. He starts midway through a conversation. You can't leave. He wasn't always like, no. I remember her like seven, eight years ago.

Speaker 4:          02:18:46       It was like a normal guy. Normal little beaten down, but still fall. It'll beaten down. But I had some fun conversations with him. So friendly and nice and now it's like, so what happened? I think the stuff caught up, drugs or whatever he was doing, that's my guess is it doesn't get done eventually caught up. I don't think it does anymore, but I think it eventually, I don't know that many people that have totally cooked their brain with drugs. Huh. Do you know how many people do you know that have cooked their brand with drugs? Do you know anybody? I know I know a couple of you right now that, uh, yeah. So how many people would you guess you know that like, absolutely like started, that's what I would guess that they looked, they looked like you had done that. Uh, at least one and two and probably, I don't know, there's probably another one, but I know to have that could think of right now.

Speaker 4:          02:19:26       Did I have to tell you Brian Cowen story about the girl who used to date, listen to this shit up burned out. There was a girl that Brian Count dated and uh, she was Khorasan the moment I met her, I go, dude, I go listen to me. I know you don't like to believe this. I can smell crazy people. Okay, I go in, this bitch stinks. This bitch is nuts. Like all I is, meet her. I keep right. It's ridiculous assumption on my part just to be able to take this chance. But all my spidey senses was like, Whoa, what's going on here? Oh, she didn't say. I said, uh, you know, hi, my name's Joe. Nice to meet you. And you know, she said Hi. And she shook my hand and he goes, no, no, no. People get nervous when they're around you. They've seen you in fear factor.

Speaker 4:          02:20:02       I go, that is not nervousness. I go, this is a crazy person. I'm telling you, Bro, you're dating a crazy girl. It turned out the whole time he was dating her, he had no idea she was a meth addict, like a severe metastatic. And she also had like some boyfriend who was like an ex boyfriend is still picture to while she was living at Brian's playing, she was like hooking up with this guy to get math craziness. So anyway, Brian gets rid of her long, drawn out, tries to save her, can't do it. I mean, just a devastating shit. Him. He would always, he would always get himself hooked up with these really crazy bitches. It's when I was, when I met him, when he was really young, he was like trying to fix himself through fixing other people. It was very strange. He got over it.

Speaker 4:          02:20:37       But the point is years later he's walking by. Remember that bar that Stan hope used to go to the cat and the fiddle? Yeah. You know, that's like a stripper or a hooker walk right there. That's what, what's his face? The English guy got busted. What is his name? Grant. Hugh grant got busted down there. I was there. He picked up a hooker there. It's grody. It's totally grody by the way. That's my two year old's favorite word. Grody grody. Anyway, um, uh, so he's a walking to the cat and the fiddle and as he's walking there, he sees a hooker come his way and he stops and he realizes it's his ex girlfriend. Oh. And she's got scabs on her face and shit. They go get tested after. No, this is years later and he looks at, it goes, uh, hey, how you doing? She goes, I sounded like you can guess that was my life and accepted it all.

Speaker 4:          02:21:28       They said, wow, that's all they said to each other. And he, he went into the bar and it was just like, why the fuck the girl lived with him. She lived with him, she was dating him and now here she is with scabs. Anyway, folks will be at Mandalay Bay, Mandalay Bay theater, you worry forth. Um, were we at, um, I want to be the Ontario Improv tomorrow night. It might be sold out. It's a Korean Chad's show and I'm a storyteller shell third in the pink, purple onion and fourth February, third year in La. Oh, there's another one. February 3rd, Jeff Garlin and powerful is that the Improv lab improv back of the room. They moved the regular room so it was too big for that little fucking tiny ass. But I'm doing my best to keep the shows if $5, like I'm still trying to, what are they trying to jack up the price.

Speaker 4:          02:22:13       What are they trying to make it 10 at least 10 tens not bad though. It's reasonable. It's a reasonable, reasonable, I think that's all. It's all good. They're good. They're very entertaining shows. Yeah. I liked the idea of keeping a cheap, cause it's kind of experimental, but it's a reasonable, I mean, they're all very entertaining. It's well worth it. Bert Kreischer. No burr Bill Burr a boulevard. Yeah. Yeah. Bill bursal areas. He's got great stories too. Um, so anyway, February 4th Mandalay Bay theater. February, January 28th, 29th and 30th West Palm Beach Improv. Brian, you can catch him at Sal's comedy whole on Melrose all the time. Right? What nights?

Somebody put a link yesterday for the tickets on every tweet. Yeah. Cool. What are called Rudy Hill? That's the name of the place. It's in Australia. If you go on Joe rogan.net I believe it has more information. Are you going to have to use your brain? And that's the only gay guy could get in Australia. Cause these UFC things, what happens is they book the UFC like a couple of months out, like three months out and say, hey, the UFC is going to be in Australia and I immediately start looking for any more big. But the problem is a lot of these banned like these venues, they book up with bands like six, seven months in advance.
