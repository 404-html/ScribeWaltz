Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello

Speaker 2:          00:02          bitches. Um, I could ice skate incredibly man. I'm fucking again. Ice Skating. 85. Yeah. Have a good day. First of all, I can't find it. Shoot when I don't have my own ice caves, so I have to rent ice skates. It's for the same reason why I couldn't a no go or years. I can rent. Those are fucking shitty. Well it's just that my feet are too wide. So if I had a regular size 11 my feet, I have someone in my background fucked a monkey when it was big fucking big foot long time ago. Like when you shouldn't be able to fuck monkeys anymore. Someone just went back in for one more shot, fucked a monkey guaranteed. It was like the last like last call evolution last car and one of my ancestors just snuck back in and got one more nut off. Um, but my feet are just too wide, so I get in those things.

Speaker 2:          00:50          I'm just in agony and it just never learned how, and I'm not going to, I'm just not interesting enough for me to go out and buy ice skates. You know, it feels like this is it. It's just something I have to conquer than it would have to learn how to ice skate as much more satting as a youth. Yeah. Fucking roller. Not Roller blading. Fucking ice skating to green day shit like that. You know what I mean? That's right. They play loud music and you spin around the ice. Yeah. See, I guess hockey would be the reason to do it. Like if you wanted to learn how to play hockey, you say you pretend you're, you're doing hockey moves, you know, like you're on the ice, snowing when you stop and you just throw the snow at people, you know the show. Right. That's, that's a cool move.

Speaker 2:          01:35          Yeah, exactly. So it's like you were the hockey skates. You definitely don't wear the figure skating ones. Mm. No chance. No, you don't. What's the difference? Well, they have the spikes in the front, so you could do the trip will tell lunch. You don't want anybody to let you, you don't want anybody seeing your spikes. You're gonna. When you go straight, you have to lift it a little bit and you're going to fall on your face to hockey is a little curvature. Or like a running shoe just allows you to maneuver to dies. So it allows you to maneuver better, but it doesn't allow you to do tricks. Can't do, you can't do a stop and then triple til lunch. So let go Scott Hamilton flip. So are they doing flips and when they do those spins on the ice, they doing them with like special skates? Is that what the deal is? So sure. Brian Boitano. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:23          And I've noticed with archery, my ego, even when I will have me shoot the on the exact same way, even though I'm still off the fucking target, you know, like you say, no, no, no, you were right through Arrow was wrong. That's how the brain works. Like it fell right. Just keep doing it. So, so, so you've got to, even though the feedback from the universe is like, nope, wrong, don't take that approach to bud fucking ever. Wow, you hurt somebody or hurt somebody. Stop screaming. I'm doing it. Right. Yeah, right. Exactly. But think of it, man. So I certainly am in my life have erred by choosing my instinct over the feedback I'm getting from the universe. Well, this is like that book that you introduced me to, which I war of art. Now the book of five rings. Oh, the real ones and the one that talks about how uh, you should just learn anything like get good at anything.

Speaker 1:          03:18          It doesn't matter what the thing is that you're getting good at. Because if you understand how to get good at this one thing, you can extrapolate from that how to get good at almost anything. There's these recurring patterns that happen. And so with archery it's really cool because you have to find these, you have to keep all these variables the same no matter what your environment, if you can learn to keep these variables the same if you're on a hill, the distance when, whatever, if you can learn how to hold these variables the same, which is the anchor point, the way your arm holds the bow, the way you pull the Arrow back, the way you release the arrow. There's all these pieces in there and if you can keep all of those the same or close to the same with adjustments based on whatever your target app is to be, then you're going to improve in your accurate accuracy.

Speaker 1:          04:07          If you keep changing your variable, if you keep moving your arm up or down or like releasing in a different way or whatever, if any of these things are always changing, you won't be as accurate over time. So from that you can grab that and look at your life and realize like, Oh shit man, my wife, I've just been readjusting all these stupid variables over and over and over again without just for at least a month attempting some rhythmic patterns, some similar thing, you know, and when you start doing that, it's really interesting because you begin to, um, improve and a lot of an in everything in general.

Speaker 2:          04:46          I mean there's, there's arguments in anthropology that actually there were lots of societies that had a lot more leisure time than we do, you know, the hunting, gathering societies and spend, you know, four to five hours a day, quote unquote working hunting, gathering. And had lots of time for, you know, ceremonies and all kinds of other things. It depends on where you are in the world and how harsh to conditions were, but, but the, you know, sort of the original leisure society May, it may have predated a, did agriculture. Certainly they had no i-phones and maybe, maybe that was a blessing, who knows. But four or five hours of hunting and gathering is exhausting, you know, and you really don't have enough time to develop a car. No, no cars. Yeah. After you figured that out, after you've gotten done, you're hunting and gathering, then it's about cooking and, but also there's no days off because you don't have any refrigeration. Right. Depending on, you know, depending on your climate. I mean, they could, they could try things and do certain things, but clearly, clearly not a, not a frigidaire. I'm around the corner. Oh. But you know what you're talking about about whether it's cities or just modern society, that high tech, high speed world that most of us live in, where many of us don't feel like we have much free time and we're running around and doing all these things in cities. Usually, uh, when I talked to people who become hunters as adults

Speaker 2:          06:04          by and large, that's part of why they did it. They want it to reconnect. Yeah. It's part of why they garden. It's part of why they raised chickens. It's part of why they do all sorts of other things that you understand and, and value to. They want to get back in touch with those. Not only the hands on skills but just the world they inhabit. You know, beyond the domesticated concretized city conquered types, you know, you know, the pavement, you know, beyond the payment into nature and whether it's a little garden patch in your backyard or you know, hunting around the Missouri breaks, you know, there's a sense of wanting to reconnect so that all of these practices, hunting, gardening, raising chickens in part are like an antidote,

Speaker 3:          06:59          modern life. So do you want to, you want me to tell you a bit about the evolutionary roots of religion, how you would study religion as an evolutionist? Okay. You Ready? Yeah. So one argument is based on, it's an adaptive argument, right? So the idea is if religion exists, does it confer an adaptive advantage to people? And so there is some work done by a good friend of mine, Dave Wilson, Wilson and evolutionary biologists who are, he argues using a groups selectionists argument that that groups that are religious out survive groups that are not by virtue of them being more communal, more cohesive, more abandoned. So that argument is an adaptive argument for why religion exists. There is another argument by other evolutionists that is based on an exaltation argument. Have you ever heard that term? Exactly. Exactly. What does that mean? So that's a byproduct of evolution.

Speaker 3:          07:51          In other words, it's something that evolved, not because itself, it confers an adaptive advantage, but rather it's piggy backing. So for example, the fact that your skeletal system, is it the color that it is, that itself is not adaptive. It is a byproduct of other evolutionary processes. So from that perspective, religion piggy backs on computational systems in our brains that evolved for other things, if all what I mean. So for example, coalitional thinking the idea of viewing the world as us versus them, the team versus red team, that is an innate part of our psychology now. Now religion piggybacks on that, right? It takes that computational system that already exists in us and it, it puts it on steroids, right? So you thinking about the Abrahamic religions, right? Every one of them has us versus them. They are the Jews, the gentiles, the believers, the Kuffar, right?

Speaker 3:          08:40          Uh, and so, uh, agency detection detecting agency and things is something that is innate to us. Religion plays on that. The agent becomes God. And s. So that's an argument that was proposed by Pascal boy where he's basically saying that religion did not specifically evolve because itself, it is adaptive, but it's piggy backs on other things that have evolved. And then a third way to study religion is to just do a content analysis of the, the, the narratives within religion. So there's a great study done by a Darwinian historian where she looked at in the old testament how many women are ascribed to a different male and the old and the Old Testament as a function of a status. So the higher the status of the male, the more sexual partners he had, which is exactly what you would predict from an evolutionary perspective. High status to men confers reproductive success. So there are different ways that evolution is, and there are several other ways that can study religion from an evolutionary perspective.
