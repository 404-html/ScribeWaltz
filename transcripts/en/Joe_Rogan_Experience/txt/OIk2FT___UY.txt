Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello

Speaker 2:          00:02          Bitches, I'm, I can, I just get incredibly man. I'm fucking again. I waiting a good day. First of all, I can't find it. Shoot when I don't have my own ice skates. So I have to rent. Ice Skates is for the same reason why I couldn't for years. I can rent. Those are fucking shitty. Well it's not even just that my feet are too wide. So if I had a regular size 11, my feet, I have someone in my background fucked a monkey when it was big fucking big foot one time ago. Like when you shouldn't be able to fuck monkeys anymore. Someone just went back in for one more shot, fucked a monkey. Guaranteed. It was like the last, like last call evolution last car and one of my ancestors just snuck back in and got one more nut off. Um, but my feet are just too wide so I get in those things.

Speaker 2:          00:50          I'm just in agony and I just never learned how. And I'm not gonna I'm not interesting enough for me to go out and buy ice skates. Know it felt like this is it. It's just something I have to conquer. Then I would have to learn how to ice skate. It was much more exciting as a youth. Yeah, fucking roller. Not Roller blading. Fucking ice skating to green day shit like that. You know what I mean? That's right. They play loud music and you spin around the ice. See, I guess hockey would be the reason to do it. Like if you wanted to learn how to play hockey, you pretend you're. You're doing hockey moves and like you're on the ice. Snowing. When you stop and you throw the snow of people know the right. That's a cool move. Yeah, exactly. So you were the hockey skates.

Speaker 2:          01:38          You definitely don't wear the figure skating ones. No chance. No, you don't. What's the difference? Well, they had the spikes in the front, so you could do the triple toe Lutz. You don't want anybody to know what you don't want anybody seeing your spikes. Definitely. Well, you're going to. When you go straight you have to lift it a little bit and you're going to fall on your face. The hockey is a little curvature, like a running shoe. It just allows you to maneuver, to dice so it allows you to maneuver better, but it doesn't allow you to do tricks. Can't do. You can't do a stop. And then triple toe alerts or Lego Scott Hamilton flip. So are they doing flips and when they do those spins on the ice they do on them with like special skates? Is that what the deal is? Sure.

Speaker 1:          02:23          and I've noticed with archery my ego, even when I will have me shoot the Arrow and the exact same way, even though I'm still off the fucking target, you know, I, you say no, no, no, you were right or wrong. That's how the brain works. Like it felt right. Just keep doing it. So, so, so you've got to. Even though the feedback from the universe like, nope, wrong, don't take that approach to bud fucking ever hurt somebody or hurt somebody. Stops screaming. I'm doing it right. Yeah. Right, exactly. But think of it man. So I certainly am in my life, have erred by choosing my instinct over the feedback I'm getting from the universe. Well, this is like that book that you introduced me to, which I war of art. Now, the book of five rings. Oh, the real one. And the one that talks about how uh, you should just learn anything like, get good at anything.

Speaker 1:          03:18          It doesn't matter what the thing is that you're getting good at it because if you understand how to get good at this one thing, you can extrapolate from that how to get good at almost anything. There's these recurring patterns that happen. And so with archery it's really cool because you have to find these. You have to keep all these variables the same no matter what your environment, if you can learn to keep these variables the same. If you're on a hill, the distance in wind, whatever. If you can learn how to hold these variables the same, which is the anchor point, the way your arm holds the bow, the way you pull the Arrow back, the way you release the air, there's all these pieces in there. And if you can keep all of those the same or close to the same with adjustments based on whatever your target app is to be, then you're going to improve in your accurate accuracy.

Speaker 1:          04:07          If you keep changing your variable, if you keep moving your arm up or down or like releasing in a different way or whatever. If any of these things are always changing, you won't be as accurate over time. So from that you can grab that and look at your life and realize like, Oh shit man, my wife, I've just been readjusting all these stupid variables over and over and over again without just for at least a month attempting some rhythmic pattern. Some similar thing, you know. And when you start doing that, it's really interesting because you begin to improve in a lot of, in everything in general.

Speaker 2:          04:46          I mean there's, there's arguments to anthropology that actually they were lots of societies that had a lot more leisure time than we do, you know, hunting, gathering societies and spending four to five hours a day, quote unquote working hunting, gathering and had lots of time for ceremonies and all kinds of other things. It depends on where you are in the world and how harsh the conditions were, but, but the, you know, sort of the original leisure society May, it may have predated, predated agriculture, something they had no iphones and maybe that was a blessing, who knows, but for five hours of hunting and gathering is exhausting, you know, and you really don't have enough time to develop a car. No, no cars. Yeah. After you figured that out, after you've done your hunting and gathering, then it's about cooking and. But also there's no days off because you don't have any refrigeration, right? Depending on, depending on your climate. And I mean they could, they could try things and do certain things, but clearly, clearly not a, not a frigidaire around the corner. Oh, but you know what you're talking about about whether it's cities or just modern society, that high tech, high speed world that most of us live in, where many of us don't feel like we have much free time and we're running around and doing all these things in cities. Usually when I talk to people who become hunters as adults,

Speaker 2:          06:04          by and large, that's part of why they did it. They wanted to reconnect. Yeah. You know, it's part of why they garden is part of why they raise chickens. It's part of why they do all sorts of other things that you understand and value to. They want to get back in touch with those. Not only the hands on skills, but just the world they inhabit. You know, beyond the domesticated concretized city. Concretize the pavement, you know, beyond the pavement into nature and whether it's a little garden patch in your backyard or you hunting around the Missouri breaks, you know, there's a sense of wanting to reconnect so that all these practices, hunting, gardening, raising chickens in part are like an antidote

Speaker 3:          06:59          to modern life. So do you want to. You want me to tell you a bit about the evolutionary roots of religion, how, how you would study religion as an evolutionist. Okay. You Ready? Yeah. So one argument is based on. It's an adaptive argument, right? So the idea is if religion exists, does it confer an adaptive advantage to people? And so there was some work done by a good friend of mine, David Sloan Wilson and evolutionary biologist where he argues using the groups selectionists argument that that groups that are religious out survive groups that are not by virtue of them being more communal, more cohesive, more abandoned. So that argument is an adaptive argument for why religion exists. There is another argument by other evolutionists that is based on an exaltation arguing. Have you ever heard that term? Exactly. What does that mean? So that's a byproduct of evolution.

Speaker 3:          07:51          In other words, it's something that evolved not because itself, it confers an adaptive advantage, but rather it's piggybacking. So for example, the fact that your skeletal system is the color that it is, that itself is not adaptive. It is a byproduct of other evolutionary processes. So from that perspective, religion piggybacks on computational systems in our brains that evolved for other things. You follow me, for example, coalitional thinking, the idea of viewing the world as US versus them, blue team versus team. That is an innate part of our psychology now. Now religion piggybacks on that, right? It takes that computational system that already exists in us and it, it puts it on steroids, right? So you think about the Abrahamic religions, right? Every one of them has us versus them. They are the Jews, the gentiles, the believers, the preferred, right? And so at agency detection detecting agency and things is something that is innate to us.

Speaker 3:          08:47          Religion plays on that. The agent becomes God, and so that's an argument that was proposed by Pascal where he's basically saying that religion not specifically evolve because itself, it is adaptive, but it piggybacks on other things that have evolved. And then a third way to study a religion is to just do a content analysis of the the, the narratives within religions. So there's a great study done by a Darwinian historian where she looked at in the old testament how many women are ascribed to a different male and the in the Old Testament as a function of a status. So the higher the status of the male, the more sexual partners you had, which is exactly what you would predict from an evolutionary perspective. High status to men confers reproductive success. So there are different ways that evolution is. And there are several other ways that can study religion from an evolutionary perspective.
