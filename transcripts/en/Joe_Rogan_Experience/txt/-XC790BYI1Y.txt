Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. He's very strong on the ground, which is one of the reasons why it was so impressive that he took his back and choked him like that. Yeah, I mean I think I have a different style than, than uh, a lot of people can see, you know, you, you, you go back to [inaudible] and all this, like his style is, it's good. It's obviously very good, but I can see a lot of holes in it. And I saw those holes many years ago. I've been called how big could beat for years I've been wanting to fight them just because people got those questions. I've got those questions too. So I'm like, let's see what this mother fucker got. Like, cause I see it, I see them hoes, you know, I don't really focus on too much of the good. I'm like, what holes? I got that boy number.

Speaker 1:          00:38          No telly you. What are the holes? What do you see it, you know, even on some of his take on a lot of his takedowns, he, he misses a lot of them. You know, he's very square. He kinda just bum rushes. You know, people were talking about the Barboza fight before and they're like, are you looking at that fighter and you're going to try and build off that when I'm like, yeah, I mean he did. Okay. The fight was good. He beat the hell out of Barboza, but I saw the holes in it. You know, he's just running square forward. Adam, you know, he's, he got hit with a lot of shots. I didn't see it for, for people in the outside watching him because the way he just came forward on Barboza was like, he was indestructible. I mean just, it didn't matter. I'm just going to get you, it's just a matter of time. Keep throwing your kicks. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I got you. You got those guys. But the body gives up. You know, you got Justin Gait, she has the same way the body will give up and the rest of it,

Speaker 2:          01:24          hey, I just felt like shaky and just weird. And then I realized, oh, this is like a, almost like a cocaine type thing. Like, do you know why we have wider cane because of cocaine or, yeah, that's a guy named William Stewart Halston who was uh, so near and dear to my heart because he was the original, he was the founding surgeon at Johns Hopkins and one of the original four horsemen. So the four main physicians that basically have shaped medicine in this country all started out at Hopkins. Uh Oh, slur in medicine, Hopkins in surgery and two other guys, Walsh. And I'm blanking on the, Kelly was the third one. Um, and he basically figured out, cause you got to remember like there was a day when surgery was staggeringly barbaric. Like prior to ether surgery was like, all right, can you hold him down? Like gag, um, get them drunk, gag him and like we're going to do our thing.

Speaker 2:          02:20          It's fucking crazy. So God, I used to know all of this shit. I don't remember any of the exact dates anymore, but it was like kind of like mid 18 hundreds to late 18 hundreds when up at Massachusetts General Hospital. I forget the name of who it was, but someone basically came up with ether. So ether became the first form of anesthetic. But you know, you were sort of knocking people out. Well it was, you know, fast forward probably 20, 30 years when Halstad figured out that this thing called cocaine could provide local anesthetic. So he began experimenting with like crazy and of course in the process became like patently addicted to it. So you have this entire generation of surgeons at Hopkins from that early era that were completely coke addicted, so halstead and all of his first generation of residents.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Um, and then of course from that we got Lidacain, Bupivacaine, all of these things that don't have the same properties. But to this day, cocaine is still used and, and most people don't realize it, but cocaine's a schedule two drug meaning it actually has a medical application. I'm like heroin, which has scheduled one and the dea and marijuana. That's right. Today both you and I have produced cancer cells in all buddy. What prevents those kinds of cells from becoming the disease that we call cancer is impart these natural killer cells and after one night of four as of sleep, that is a remarkable state of immune deficiency and that's one of the reasons why insufficient sleep predicts cancer. Wow. I could also speak about your cardiovascular system and all it takes is one hour because there is a global experiment that's performed on 1.6 billion people across 70 countries twice a year, and it's called daylight savings time.

Speaker 1:          04:02          Now in the spring when we lose an hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24% increase in heart attacks. What in the fall and the autumn, when we gain an hour sleep, there's a 21% decrease in heart attacks. So it's bi-directional. That's how fragile and vulnerable your body is to even just the smallest perturbation of sleep. One hour is all it takes. Yeah. Wow. That is, you're blowing my fucking mind. It's frightening. I mean, you can go even further by the way, you know? Wow. Insufficient sleep will even erode the very fabric of biological life itself, your DNA code. So in one study they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them to six hours of sleep for one week and they compared the profile of gene activity relative to when those same people were getting eight hours of sleep and there were two critical results. The first was that a sizable 711 genes were distorted in their activity caused by one week of six hours of sleep, which is highly relevant by the way, because we know that many people are trying to survive on six hours of sleep during the week.

Speaker 1:          05:12          Wow. The second, sorry. No, please go. I was going to say the second sort of perhaps more interesting result was that about half of those genes were actually increasing their activity. The other half were actually suppressed. Those genes that were switched off by six hours of sleep for one week with genes related to your immune response, many of them, so you become immune deficient. Those genes that were increased or what we call overexpressed were genes that were related to the promotion of tumors, genes that were related to longterm chronic inflammation within the body and genes that were associated with stress. And as a consequence, cardiovascular disease,

Speaker 2:          05:51          I would say the most efficient hundred miler I've done is, uh, when I, I ran 11 hours and 40 minutes, 55 seconds at a race in 2015 called Holy Shit. You Ran, you ran a hundred miles in 11 hours. Yeah, that was, that was on a trip. That was one on the track in the SPEC of a fuck. That's crazy. Ran 11 hours. You were at a hundred miles. Yeah. So I think the thing that, how long does it take to drive a hundred miles? Okay. Takes it. I mean, if you go a hundred miles an hour, it takes an hour or longer to get to the airport. If the traffic on the phone, how's Zach that are broke? The US 100 mile record. You averaged seven fucking minutes per mile for almost 12 hours. Dude, that is insane. That is fucking insane. Bert Kreischer. He brags when he runs seven minute miles for like three miles. What is burdened up running that the La Marathon in six and a half, six and a half.

Speaker 2:          06:52          I think it was shorter than that. I think it was five, five or something. Yeah. No, no, no. Ours Dad. Yeah, he's fucking JV triggers. Well, I'll say, I'll say, I'll say this here, bird, if you're listening, contact me. I'll get you to four and a half in six months. You write up your challenge. Zach fucking man, if he tells you can do it too. That is, that is an incredible number that you broke the u s 100 mile record by running seven fucking minutes per mile. It's, it's, it's crazy. I talk about something and I don't type it in. I don't write a message. I don't write an email and I'll see an ad. So it's fine on us all the time. That doesn't happen to you. I, it hasn't happened to me, but it's happened to enough people that I believe you. It's insane.

Speaker 2:          07:37          Well, I believe you know what? No matter what, but really crazy. I've talked to so many people that have had that happen. Somebody sent me a tweet yesterday that said they were listening to a podcast that we were doing. We were talking about something and then that's something appeared in their Google ads and he's like, I never looked up this. And oh no. It wasn't a google ad. It was a youtube search. It was a youtube suggested. He's like my fucking computers listening. Yep. Cuter. And what APP is doing this? I mean, I'm about to just go to a flip phone because I don't want to, it's, it's bullshit. We know that youtube audio is being listened to because they're mining it to for ad ad stuff already. It's not even real. It's not a spy thing that's just out there. That's how they do it.

Speaker 2:          08:17          Right, but is that if you're playing things? Yeah, so when we're playing, so if he's playing a podcasts on Youtube, youtube, listening to that and that's how they suggest it's just happening in their ads. What I think might be happening with people are noticing now is not just that it's happening within the software. It's that your actual device, the microphone is on and the laptop camera on. Some people block the camera with tape. They're not blocking the microphone. Exactly. How the hell do you block the microphone? You don't even know where it is. How do I, how can we have like some sort of tutorial about like how we can prevent all of our shit from being collected? Like that whole, the facebook, Cambridge analytica thing. I feel like everyone missed the boat of what that

Speaker 3:          08:56          story was. You heard about that right? At the Cambridge Analytica. They're data mining all your shit. It's like, yeah, if you're on facebook, everything's being taken in data mind that's very obvious, but what wasn't really investigated, I think channel four did this crazy investigation where they pretended like they were a patron trying to hire Cambridge Analytica, some billionaire dude and they put them on camera. It's all recorded. The guys are basically like, it's basically like a private intelligence from almost like a black water where you can hire mercenaries to set up honeypots with prostitutes, take down politicians, spy on them. They set up shell companies with mis six, um, massaad um, it's all just untraceable shit. They just go stout. They said they can ghost in out of countries. They literally said that they stage the entire Kenyan election. They were like, we staged the whole thing. We wrote all the speeches. Yeah. Ken, this, yeah. This is, this is backed by a billionaire. Robert Mercer, the same guy who can behind channel four did a crazy investigation about it.

Speaker 4:          09:54          [inaudible].
