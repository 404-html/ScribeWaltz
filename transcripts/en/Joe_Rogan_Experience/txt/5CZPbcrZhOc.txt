Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't what happened. But this was a heterosexual top 40 song and then all of a sudden who said my Dick, who said that? What happened? I apologize that just popped out. No Pun intended. You fuck you feel if the animals, he's back from Italy. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm back from the south of France. Man. We both went to Europe. Very cultured, very close. Drink wine over there. Of course I did. Did you what you did you contact the symbol? Yay. And then just let him know how much you know. No, I didn't need to, cause I was with a very rich friends. It, we just, I just throw a dart at a cellar and I took how insanely good wines.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       I like one of those, Oh forget it. I was like, I was saying shit like this. I was like, oh I smelled nutmeg and pencil cause that's what I've heard people say. They get mad at you and you. Of course, they came after me and then I took a, then I sit some white wine. I went, whoa. I feel like I just got hit in the head with by a farmer. I love saying dumb shit like that to try and do a wine tasting bars, like one of those, those parties where they all get around and they all talk about it. How, you know what I heard Smia say you trust me on this one. I said, why? Because he, I was going to order our white whining. It's unique. I said, well, describe it. He goes, it's like biting into a wet dog. I'll say, hey, that's exactly what I feel like he was telling you that it's good.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       Yeah. Yeah. It's like getting, getting biting into a wet dog. People. He's done. Shane. I'd like good wine. It tastes good. I like that. Yeah. There's a part of me that rejects the fucking, the nonsense so hard. Well, it shouldn't anything as well. It should. You should always reject that horse shit, but it sits. It's so fucking pretentious. Of course, it's pretentious. Think most pretentious here, these, the here, the way they describe it, it really holds you a pallet prison. It holds your palate prisoner. But here's the good news in a velvet casing. Oh, speaking of velvet casings, I was at a restaurant once, a very fun restaurant and fairphone Italian restaurant, and a gentleman walked in with a briefcase with two bottles of wine and velvet in the briefcase. I had to resist the chimpanzee urge to over the table and smashed him in his fucking head with that case.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       But here's the thing, here's the thing about that. Here's the thing, and here's the reason I support him because I'm such a freak for one. You cannot send $1,000 bottle of wine. Uh, you can't ship it because a lot of times they put it in the hall of a ship and it comes through, say the Suez Canal gets hyper. Yeah, it might be 150 degrees in that hall. Not Good. And it's below or above the waterline. You're in trouble. So they fly that wine, you can be fucked. Yeah, you it. But this guy, he just was bringing it to a restaurant, kind of a dick. This is kind of, it's kind of a weird move. And You bring your own food to a restaurant. I mean, I guess it's a drink, but it's not like you bring your own tomatoes. Excuse me. Could you tell the chef to chop these tomatoes?

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       Yeah, a parallel with the floor. I've never brought my own one. I tell him it's, it's obnoxious. The establishment. Yeah, it's weird. Yeah, it is weird. And then they have a corkage fee. They charge you to open your won $35 that's fairly reasonable. Well, it's just if you're bringing $1,000 bottle of wine, you know, but I don't understand why one wine, I do understand, but I don't understand why someone is willing to pay. But I do understand it. I do. Because you want to be a part of that fuck head club. Well, if you're, and if you're a freak, like man, you like wine on that level when you really pay attention it for me, I actually, it's, I didn't even know how to describe it. It's literally an experience, right? I tell you. So my buddy, I went to see who's made more money than God and this is why he's, I don't know if I told you this, so all the money, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       He has as much money as bruce springsteen almost and a probably. And uh, he, uh, super rich and he, I told you that he said, we're going to open this, this wine that Robert Parker gave a hundred out of a hundred and called it one of the wines of the century. Who is Robert Park? Robert Parker is the critic who sets the standard. There are a lot of eat that, you know that, yeah, I know. I'm terrible. Really bothers me. I know, but when you see an RP Robert Parker and it has a 93, 94, five, you're paying a lot of money. I want to hang out with Robert Parker. Well, he's a guy, I think he's from Maryland and he's an American dude and he's got his taste. It doesn't mean he's right. It just means he knows wine and he set the standard. Now there are more people, but for the most part when Robert Park gives your wine and 95 or above God, why I hit him with a brick.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       Hey, hey. Yeah. Oh my God. Did you think he says snarky things when you go to dinner with him? Well he, he'll say for example the one I was drinking, he called it a century and one, one of the wines of the century. So don't try to please don't try to buy it because you know you can't find it. Is he the Tony Hawk of wine connoisseurs as he is because nobody knows anyone that's gates other than Tony Hawk. That's, that's actually, that's exactly what he is. That's exactly what it is. And the Lance Armstrong of wine. Yes. And there are people who are trying to make their way and, and real critics, but for the most part he's still the man. How much does it Piss people off? Who, who ride bikes, who like are really good and no one gives a fuck about them cause there's not Lance Armstrong, there's one guy, there was Greg Lamont for awhile.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       I remember he was also an American. We remember him, but you know, nobody, nobody. I think part of it's also because he was an American and so dominant and I'm, and it's not, you know, Americans don't watch bike racing. I could never stand on the sideline and be like, how long aisles keep on him. I must keep bundling. You know, here's a water one, an orange. I'm not that guy. Life is too short to watch a fucking bike. Race is definitely too short to be watching on the sidelines, like waiting. It's that. That's how I feel about marathons, but Europeans are so different than we are in that sense. Would Europeans obsess over Formula One they obsess over? That's different than a formula one is fucking why. Yeah, it's wild. You ever seen those videos? They do from inside the cockpit of a Formula One car.

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       It's crazy, but there's some old lightening fast decision making going on there, but when Senate died, if you look at the streets of Brazil for his funeral, it was something that you would never see in the United States. If you have a great race car driver, like say a great nascar driver, you wouldn't see, I think it was some crazy number of people that showed up in the streets of Brazil. Well, the Brazilians are insanely nationalistic. They love their country. They're very, very patriotic. So when someone comes along like Sena who dominates something that's traditionally a European dominated sport, like Formula One, and he was a wild man, you said a documentary on him. I didn't there. Look at that funeral. Wow. Look at that. And he was, uh, you know, he was the guy who, who could have been a playboy, but he never really messed with girls.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       He was, he was, he was, uh, a Samurai who's dedicated. Yeah. His, his ability to shave milliseconds, you know, and just to take crazy chances and cut people off and Oh yeah, Jesus Christ, that precision. But that's a, that is something that, I don't know anything about it, but I'm sure when you follow it and that sort of, those, those millimeters, those differences are what make everything, you know, when you have a cultivated sense, when you know what you're looking at. And what looking for it's a, it must be very enjoyable. Well, they have a deep connection with how much traction there is exactly on those tires feel like they feel it kicking out. Like they, they, they literally say with race car drivers that you have to have an educated ass. Damn. Really? Yeah. Your ass has to be able to feel when your car is breaking loose.

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       Like if you are a race car driver and you had a numb ass, you'd probably be fucked. Wow. Like if you had like Sciatica or something and asked went numb, which I would imagine it'd be a real problem with someone who sits down all the time. Yeah. They're truck drivers, right? They get Sciatica or all the time, but race car drivers itself, physical, physical, they lose so much water. They lose like somebody like seven pounds of water or something in inner race. Oh, I would imagine the crazy sweat like a pig. Yeah. It's hot as fuck. They don't have air conditioning in that thing. Yeah. There's giant engine.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       They're flying down the road. Lazy. Oh, it's mad. It's so interesting that you have to have an educated ass. Cause I think horseback riding, if you watch high, high level jumpers, they, you know, are just Saje guys. They, they, it's the same exact thing. It's all feel literally it looks like they're doing nothing. So the differences between the best in the world and the number 300 you and I could never tell the difference because they don't look like they're doing anything. Literally. They're just, they look like for me, they look like they're sitting upright very still as why I could never ride a horse and just, there's nothing going on. But the details, those little like where are they placed? The micro, how they micromanage that saddle and the signals they're sending to the horse with their hands, their legs and their ass is a whole different thing.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       That's so often the case though with things. Would things look effortless because the people that are awesome at them do it so smoothly that it just, you know, you can't appreciate it unless you, you actually do it. That's what I love about life. That's literally what I love about, you know, and it sounds silly, but you can touch a little of that in anything you do when you, um, you know, when you practice something you're not good at. So tennis, I always talking about tennis unboxing. Am I good at boxing and tennis? No. Do I obsess over where my feet are? Do I have cess over my grip with the right, it's, it's, I swear to God the actual, maybe the actual activity is secondary to how I love to work on the little details and get better through daily attendance through daily practice because something happens to me that reaches beyond that sport.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       So when I do something that I'm maybe a little afraid of or maybe I'm not good at, it forces me to think in a way that informs the other things in my life that I make a living at. I do better at Standup, I write better when I pushed myself in these other areas. It's really interesting. Yeah, it totally makes sense because I think very difficult endeavors. You know, whatever, whatever it is that you're trying to do. Any fucking dance. Yeah. If you were trying to be a ballerina, which I am. Are you? Yeah, keep calling. I thought you were done with that. [inaudible] Bella is my foundation, but I'm so passionate. I live, I live, there's too much a quatre in me. I live in my groin, so I had to move to southside Madang. Well, people that get really get into Jujitsu say that as well for has been saying that a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:10:39       But you know, getting into it is to him it's a lot like writing in some ways or it's so, it's almost like a meditation and it completely obsessed it. A Lot, lot of people that get into Jujitsu become completely obsessed with it too. And it's for those same reasons. Like you get obsessed, first of all, with how deep the rabbit hole goes. Yes. That's probably the same with tennis or with golf. It's most certainly the same. I've never played golf, but I know the people that exactly the same thing I talked to will jerky will durkee, you know, uh, he won, he took second in the, uh, 10th planet Jiu Jitsu Tournament over and in Austin. He's amazing. He's a professional poker player as well. And he was a d one wrestler, I think out of Virginia and you know, watching him, um, he lost to a, uh, another guy who was really good but, but just barely.

Speaker 1:          00:11:22       And when you watch those high level, high level competition, black belts, which I'd never seen the subtlety, I don't even see what they're doing. I didn't even see them tapping the guy. Right. But he was talking to me about how much he loves games and why poker and Jujitsu inform each other. We know Josh Waitzkin same thing. Same thing with chess. Gee, he's a Jujitsu. Yeah. Phenomenal. If you know him well, he's trying, I think he has a school where he teaches kids how to think. You can cause it to, he teaches them how to learn through martial arts. Math, I know martial arts, music and chess. I, and it's all kind of the same. It's kind of the same thing. It's kind of why I feel like a lot of times that I do think there's a place for self help and you know, inspiration when you're young.

Speaker 1:          00:12:05       But after a while, you know, just trying to get really good at something under proper tutelage. I think we'll teach you all of those things may be, but there's a lot of people that just try to get good at it. They never get good at it. That probably would do better if they had better pathways to think. Yes, if they learned how to. Well, I think first what someone like Tony Robins does because I've listened to a lot of his tapes when I was younger and what I was all set to make fun of him because I was trying to write this parody on him and then I listened to him and I went, oh, this motherfucker knows exactly how my brain works. I mean a lot of ways he simplifies and he has tools that helped. Helped me focus my energy and recognize, recognize certain patterns you recognize certain unhelpful, bad.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       It's very important. Is having pathways in your mind like abandoning negative thoughts, concentrating on positive ones, abandoning nonsense, concentrating. I mean that's a lot of what traps are that people fall into like addictive traps, whether it's gambling or whatever. Fill in the blank pornography. Like I was watching this whole thing of the day where people were coming out against pornography and pornography addiction like, and they were talking about how harmful pornography's no, no, your fucking mind is harmful. Pornography's people having sex and sex is awesome. So shut up. There's a great, there's a dean to that. Well you can simplify it this way. There's a dean who said, I am not interested. It's, it's less important what you think. What I want to know is how you think and you're talking about methodology. It's, it's how it's exactly what you're saying. It's how you think about life and how you think about things.

Speaker 1:          00:13:45       So you may be a slave to certain pathways and learning how to reprogram you are your pathways is a way, way more important thing. So it's not so much that it's pornography that's the enemy. Yes, it's, it's the methodology. Pornography is just sex. And by the way, we're just talking about regular pornography there. There's certain pornography that you go, okay, what the fuck is that for? Like, why does anybody need to see people spit in people's eyes and come and people's noses and stuff? Like there's a lot of really fucked up pornography, but I always equate that to like the same thing was like if you watch a certain violent movies, it's almost like they are the product of the ramping up effect. Three other violent movie that's come before them. They've had to go further and further and further to the point where it's just totally ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       That's exactly right. It's not entertaining. It's not good. It's just there. It's a response to like taking it to the next level. The guy who wrote the double helix, quote unquote for the, for a serial killer, for the making of a serial killer, a guy named Richard Walter who's an FBI profiler, brilliant guy. He said that, um, serial killers, we'll typically, and this is from literally interviewing 20,000, 30,000 prisoners, uh, many of whom were murderers, violent criminals, and he put together this profile, which was that serial killers. Many times start as with fetishes. They'll start with, you know, well a lot of times it can be as innocuous as rubbing against people in public places. Uh, and then what? And then you, you graduate, then that doesn't do it for you anymore. And then you have to go into a store and cut leather jackets with a razor because you might get caught.

Speaker 1:          00:15:24       But it's like skin, all that stuff. And S and what he said was that you never, once you get to one level, you never can go back. You have to go forward. You don't see them go, all right, this is too much. Let me go back to rubbing against people on will never, I mean, don't, don't some people like, is there people that are potential serial killers? They go, what the fuck am I doing in my life? I needed, I don't know, Take Yoga. I don't know. I don't know. But I do know that there've been some studies about how, uh, less there are, I guess a lot of serial killers are maniacs are doing less of that stuff because they can, they can get more of it to a simulated environment. Well, that was the argument that the Japanese had or some Japanese scholars had about pornography is a Japanese porn is, is my might be wrong about this.

Speaker 1:          00:16:12       That it's more embraced and that when you look at like deviant behavior, it's more embraced and films and things like that. And that sort of keeps him from doing it in real life. Yeah. I would imagine that you can get satiated visually. You have those, those visual triggers, they say that the triggers for fighting, you know, when you watch mma, there are a lot of those visual triggers for men that are similar to what pornography does to a man. When we see two dudes kicking each other and knocking each other out, we want to do it. Yeah. Or at least we can't take our eyes off it. Yeah. We definitely can't take your eyes off of it. Um, but I think that also it's possible that that could work. If they say that about video games, like the argument against video games, it's always been the video games encourage violence, but it shows the, the actual facts show that's the opposite is true.

Speaker 1:          00:16:57       That video games actually get people involved in the violence of video games and it satisfies whatever weird cravings people might have for violence, which are, you know, leftover from thousands and thousands of years of DNA of people being successful in violence, being rewarded for it. You violence was a way you survived. You know, think about hunting while the coliseum, man, I went to the coliseum this week been, oh my God, that is a fucking trip. First of all, I did not know that the coliseum literally means next to the Colossus. I didn't know that it was all about, there was a gigantic, I think it was 150 foot high bronze statue of Nero that he had constructed. Well, you know, the entire colosseum was Niro's house at one point in time. It didn't exist. It was like, there's like seven areas of Rome, like seven hills of Rome or something like that. And His

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       fucking house was three of them. Damn. His house had an enormous, I think it was like more than a hundred acre lake in the backyard of his house. A man made lake. Wow. And that manmade lake like to drain it, the drainage system to build that lake there. They, they're just discovering some of the areas of the coliseum today. So what they did is when they tore down his house, they built the coliseum for the people. And it was like one of the biggest public buildings ever. And they built it to satisfy the people that were just fucking furious that this cunt, yeah. Taken over, burned Rome. He was just insane. I mean, Nero was just fucking completely insane. But what they had done with his, his structure was turned it into this call scene, but it was right next to this enormous statue of him. So when you say like the La Coliseum, that's a stupid name, right?

Speaker 2:          00:18:44       Because the La next to the call next colossus, that does not make any sense. But that's what coliseum means. Right? It's wild. When you go to Italy and especially Rome, and you're standing and structures that have been there for an, and we're living and had people died on that. It's kind of like the idea, the original octagon, you know? Well, way more fucked up than me. Yeah. Here's one of the things they found out just recently, like really recently that they had boat fights. They would fill the bottom of the coliseum with water. Wow. And they would have boats, Jesus and they would get them. They've literally just discovered this. They discovered some sort of a, um, some sort of artwork or something, some writing that indicated that these boat fights took place for a very short amount of time, like a couple of years. He do that fight each other with your oars.

Speaker 2:          00:19:33       They bowels, they would have battles. Here it is. They, this, they would fill up powerful Jamie. They would fill up the bottom with two meters of water, six feet of water and have these boats and float these boats around and they would fight to the death on boats. How the fuck would they do that? I guess the walls kept the water, I guess they'd say drain it. Well they had a very complex drainage system. Like they showed the draining system to us, wouldn't new they take you on a tour, you know, and uh, they were showing us the drainage system and also the system of raising the wild animals from the basement up through the floor. Yeah. How would they do that? They had this thing where these, uh, they had a reenactment or, or recreation of one that a, I took some photos of, I put one of the photos on my instagram and these wild animals would be a locked in these rooms, right.

Speaker 2:          00:20:23       The small rooms, they would give them no food, no water, and they'd keep them there for days. So they'd be freaking out and starving. And then finally they'd take them out of the dark. They put them, uh, they forced them into this platform. And then they would have these slaves crank this mechanism that would lift the platform up through a trap door in the floor. So their first light in days, and they would be out there with these gladiators and a little and the bottom floor, like they had several levels. And the bottom level was all the rich people, but they fucked up and they didn't have the walls high enough. So the lions with leap 12 feet over the wall and just Jack, all these rich people, she's just fine. She's now the wall thing and though I, Yay. Yeah. So it's something that San Francisco soon, that tiger jumped that 12 foot wall.

Speaker 2:          00:21:18       Exactly. Yeah. Well they had to figure out how to do it too, because they would get these animals in there and most of the time they'd let the animals out and that animals would be just fucking scared. They didn't want to fight. Yeah. So they, they realized that by keeping them down there with no food and no water and getting them to a complete state of desperation and hysteria, that would allow them to ensure that when they pop that trap door, the lions would come out and just try to jack people. Brutal. Yeah. They would kill everything. They had elephants, they had all, all sorts of crazy fucking animals they had brought in from Africa, which by the way is not even a thousand miles away. I had no idea. Africa was so close to the ceiling. You can see it. You can, you know what I think?

Speaker 2:          00:21:55       Well, you can see, you can see Africa from Sicily. I believe. You can see Africa from there. You can see it. Yeah. Like I'm clear days. Wow. That's crazy. Correct. Doesn't mean wrong. It seems like too many miles. No. There are certain parts of, let me look at a map. I can't remember what it seems like. What? Just one area you can see from Spain. From the tempest main maybe. Hmm. I think I can't eat either way, but kind of crazy. That was in Spain and says, you can't get there. You see the mountains or something? Yeah. Wow. That's crazy. So crazy. Is that that? That's that class. It is. Yeah. Look close to this. Wow. It's really close. Yeah. Seriously. It's not attached, but I don't know why that happened. Why didn't have it attach? It's really weird. That's a shitty map. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       Oh, what? Yeah, that's Africa. Yeah. You can see that close. No wonder the Moore's concord system. Exactly. They're right there. Exactly like they traveled. No, they got in a fucking raph floated over. They backstroke turn out the way. I mean Jack Jacked everybody, but uh, it's fucking beautiful. It's so beautiful, man. Oh yeah. God Damn often coast. That's where we went. We went there too. We did a, the Mafia coast with the Vatican, the Vatican's and saying, did you do the Vatican I did is insane. And most of all the seven wonders, man, the fact that you're walking around on this fucking tile that's 1700 years old, it's incredible. And in all hearts Zayic yeah. And I mean beautiful artwork that everybody's walking on. Yeah. Like the guy was explaining to us, they'll like, this is a 17 year, a hundred year old work of art. Not only that, it was moved from somewhere else and reconstructed hundreds of years ago inside the Vatican wasn't even originally there. Damn. I, I never ever, I've been to Saint Peter's Cathedral, I dunno, maybe

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       10 times because my uncle used to live there and he had a rent controlled apartment over the peanuts in Nevada, which is really the uncle used to live in Rome. Yes. My uncle, my uncle was, uh, in, in Brooklyn, New York, in Bensonhurst, New York. My uncle was a gay man. Uh, well he was very handsome. He was a diver and a, yeah. And he was a, but of course he was an actor and a singer and a dancer. And of course in Benson, hers, you know, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn in the, I dunno, let's call it the what, uh, 50s, 30s, forties. When you were gay, you know, it wasn't, first of all, you were very Catholic. So that was already a sin. Second of all, you weren't really that welcome. There wasn't a whole lot of gay pride. Everybody wanted March. Uh, so he went to Italy.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       We went to Rome and lived there, knew he could be accepted. Well, he found his little niche. He got into the theater company there and I spoke Italian of course, and a head of Horus and lived for, and he died at 96 and lived above the Piazza Navona in a rent controlled penthouses die from that. The Vatican own. He didn't die. No, sir. I'm going to ask you to be a little more mature. We have a lot of people listening. He did not die from dicks. Uh, but he was a, he was a character man and he did lots of plays. And did you know that the Vatican owns the building that houses Europe's largest gay gathpath house? I did not know that. But I also don't believe you because the, is that a, is that a matter of, uh, is that a matter of a conjecture or it's fact.

Speaker 1:          00:25:19       It's probably a bath house now. It's the largest gay bath house in Europe and the Vatican owns it. Not only that, I see, I see the, there's the cardinals or the bishops who's fucking office is right above the gay bath house. Conveniently, conveniently, there's a fucking shoot that just dropped down a lot of property as lube up their button, drop down through the floor and look at this Vatican please. Landlord to Europe's biggest gay bathhouse. Catholic church paid $30 million to acquire a building that houses a senior. Will cardinal end a huge gay sauna? Nothing. How weird. It's so weird that, uh, I mean, I don't know why they would want to own that. I don't know cause you want to sweat while you get your Dick Dick work by strong man hands. That's all. Well the amount of artwork that is in the Vatican, like if you haven't been there before, like I was not that excited about going to the Vatican before went there.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       It was like, well I want to see the coliseum. Obviously it's like one of the great wonders of history like that they had this thing there and that they did this and then it's also like the ultimate sign of excess. You know, like the, the one thing that people point to when they talk about society's falling apart due to excess as the Romans, the Romans, they went crazy. Like it was also sort of what gave food to the reformation. When Martin Luther, this German Jesuit priest said, hey man, all this money that's going to, you know, idolatry essentially like building

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       these incredible statues and these incredible cathedrals and we're starving over here. How about if we just read the Bible, we just read the Bible. Then maybe we'll be, you know, just is in favor with God as you guys. And maybe we don't need a hierarchy of bishops and all these and popes and all this sort of rank and file that also needs a salary that's also taking money. Well, Martin Luther was also the first guy to translate the Bible phonetically so that regular people could read it because everybody else was like, no one knew Latin. They couldn't read Latin. That's right. So it was only these priests that we had to rely on to, to get the word of God from Martin Luther was like, that's ridiculous. But as luckily Martin Luther, it had such a high standing in society, they couldn't kill him. Right. They tried. He had to leave.

Speaker 2:          00:27:31       He was always on the run. But you're right. But it was, if he was anyone else, if he wasn't like a very respected high standing person in society, they probably would have jacked him a long time ago. Yeah. That there was already, um, from an eye, I can't remember. I read a lot about it back in the day, but um, he was always under threat of that. He had to essentially, I think it was in bitten Berg. And there's this a phrase that people always associate with Rome called the vomitorium and uh, that's not what it sounds like. Everybody thinks that they got there and they threw up and then they went back and eight again. That's not what they did. I always thought they did that. Yeah. No, the vomitorium refers to the way they got people out of the stadium had nothing to do with the word vomit.

Speaker 2:          00:28:12       Huh? It's the way the stadium is structured. Is this gigantic? That's a vomitorium is the, the, the exit. So they had all these exits. They had a bunch of different doors all throughout the building. Like if you look at like some images of the colosseum, there's all these pathways. Like you would go, you know, 30 yards over, there's another pathway, 30 hours over, there's another pathway. And that allowed an efficient way of getting people see like look at all the doorways, see all those doorways all around it. That that was an efficient method of getting people out of the stadium. So they called it a vomitorium. But like if you look the etymology of the word, like look up the, the origins of the word vomitorium and what it means in Latin, but it doesn't have anything to do with vomit but sounds like it.

Speaker 2:          00:28:58       So everybody was like, ah, they, they just fucking eight and threw up. So people like sort of repeated that over and over and over again. Let's stick a feather down their throat. I'm sure someone did that. I'm sure there was some fat. Fuck, that's right now in Los Angeles. Yeah. Fuck yeah. I just did. A girl had a problem with that. So deny vomitorium. Okay. Here it was a place which according to popular misconception, the ancient Romans were supposed to vomit it. That's not true. Um, the arch of a series of entrances or exit pathways and an ancient Roman amphitheater or theater. Yeah. See, that's what it really means. So the popular misconception, the second version of it, but translate user over time. What, what is the origins of the word though? Like what does that mean? Vomitorium is the plural noun. Huh? That's weird. That's the plural vomitorium probably, you know, it sounds like it's where people would vomit out of, right?

Speaker 2:          00:29:52       Yeah, but it's not vomit. That's not, it's like that's our word. Yeah, but that's not like what they would call it. Right? Like you know what I'm saying? Like our word vomit is puke, but that's not what they were referring to when they were calling it a vomitorium. It's just one of those weird Latin things. But everybody always thinks that everybody thinks that that's what a vomitorium was like. You should imagine if there was a fucking house that people would go to throw up and like, hey, let's keep going to go to the vomitorium fucking puke. Like what kind of assholes eat? Here's a feather. But you would call it the puke house. Like that is so ridiculous. The puke room, vomitorium puke room. The sauna room. What is the actual, does it say Jamie? It says here this tube misinterpret or where it might have came from the misinterpretations.

Speaker 2:          00:30:38       Yeah, but what is the original? Was the actual word mean? Like vomitorium. It just sounds like this is the entrance. Just fourth. Oh, to spew forth this beautiful earth and a wonder if involvement actually came from that then. Yeah, so the original thing was an exit and then vomit became that. Ah, that's interesting. It's kind of how language happens, right? Yeah, but that's, well, it's weird how it happens over thousands of years. So things just stuart and warp. Yeah. That's how the language is always changing. It's always changing. We're always making up our own languages. It's constant. While we were there, they had just found some new shit two days before we were there. They're constantly finding new path and passages underneath the coliseum and new things, but the amount of work that was done in completing that building and making those structures, it's insane with free labor, which is why slavery isn't that bad.

Speaker 2:          00:31:39       Oh, what? Wait a minute. It's interesting that slavery was the order of the day for most of history, but when you look at like wage slavery today, when you mean there's no slavery today, but if you can imprison people in a state of poverty, right. And it's not, not against their will voluntarily. Right. You get people hooked on buying things and you get them hooked on credit. So they need to work, they constantly need to work and then they're in these jobs that are completely dead end low wage jobs. They can't go anywhere and then they perform these menial tasks. And until we figure out robot that could do those tasks far better and far more efficient. It's not slavery because they can quit and leave anytime they want. But in a lot of ways it has the same effect. There's a difference. I think there's a lot of differences. I mean I'm talking about there's a macro difference. Like there's there

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       an idea that has gained great traction and cause ideas move really slowly sometimes. But there's an idea that has gained traction in most of the world and even in parts of the world where it isn't, they try to defend it as it being so, and that is the idea of universal human rights. Universal human rights was not an idea that was embraced by most of the world. Even as far back properly. You can make the argument as 1940 slavery was alive and well. Think about this country and it's and itself, this country until 1964 was it a where there was separate but equal the idea that you had black and white water fountains, um, a brown horse years before that, which is nothing slavery. That's right. And so the idea that, and of course that had to be defended along biblical grounds and all these kind of shotty ideas, but the idea of, of universal human rights, even though the Judaeo Christian ethic and even Islam talked about sort of everybody being of the same moral worth because we're all from the same father, right?

Speaker 1:          00:33:45       That's the monotheistic a notion and where value comes in those religions, we're all the same as long as you, you know, read the Bible and follow these tenants. But universally human rights is something a little bit different and it's a modern concept and um, that likes a germ theory. The idea that these things you can't see, but you still have to wash your hands or you can spread bacteria and things like that. Those things that move very slowly. But that is, I think where you, are you connecting those? I'll just talking about how both those ideas are ideas. It took a long time to gain traction, you know, even though they were good for us and by law. But let's stick to, let's stick to um, universal human rights. I think that that idea, I think that idea is, is just that mindset and the fact that you have to defend it as a society is why there's such a stark difference between, I understand what you're saying by being at bondage to your lifestyle, to having to make a living because you've got people who depend on you and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:34:43       I don't think that'll ever go away. But, um, there's such a, there is, I don't think that'll go with, could definitely go on saying we slavery, I'm optimistic. But what I'm saying is that there's, I think when I'm like, slaves have zero dignity. Like it in fact there's no somebody one time as a historian is that there's no such thing as a slave slave there. There are people in bondage. So anybody who is a slave, you're not a slave, but you are a person in slavery. Right. So, so it was like he, he poses the question, he said, what did the civil rights movement begin in this country? And it was like, well, and sell Alabama and the 60s and the fifth. No. I said, no, no, no, no, no. He said the civil rights movement began the first day that an African American was brought to this country against his will.

Speaker 1:          00:35:29       Any human being doesn't want to be in bondage. You are always trying to get out of bondage. And there is that striving for that. I think we're getting closer to, I think, well wait a minute, that's slavery. How was that, the civil rights movement, this is the first day that someone's brought to United States against their will. That's not the first day that someone enacted some sort of a civil right. Well, he was being, he was being, what he was saying was that, you know, everybody is always fighting for dignity and their own serenity and their own civil rights regardless of, you know, where they are. If you put someone in bondage and you make them do things against their will and you, you take their dignity away, they are immediately, they're immediately beginning to struggle for their own freedom. Right, and that's where the conspiracy theories fall into play, where modern capitalism is thought of as being some sort of a new way around that that instead of having people slaves, like literally bonding them, putting them in chains, keeping them against their will.

Speaker 1:          00:36:28       Instead you just set up these honey traps and you allow people to get sucked into these things like having massive debt from student loans and making credit cards easy and allowing people to mortgage a house they can't really afford knowing full well that eventually the bank's going to foreclose on this and reap some sort of a profit and that all these things, this is where conspiracy theories fall into play, that all these things are set up to enact a modern form of slavery and that there's always going to be people that are taking advantage of people below them and putting them in very disadvantageous situations for their own gain. I would say that that's literally the state of nature. And, and what I mean by that is that, let, let, let's just take for example, I'm the marketplace. Uh, if you just let people, you let people go, let people do their thing.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       They are going to, for example, uh, there's going to be a marketplace for differences of opinion. This is what I mean, there's a company, it's about to start up a, you start a company, I don't know what it is. Let's just say it's a, you know, a tech gadget. And you're going to have groups of people on this side that are going to say, that's going to be the next big thing. Joe Rogan's company's going to be the next apple and you're going to have a bunch of other people on the other side. We're going to go, you know what, uh, not a shot. And here's why. So you have these differences of opinion and there's a marketplace. There is a marketplace for what essentially is a derivative, uh, you know, or a swap. There's a marketplace there too where people say, I will bet you I will short that. I will basically say, I'll buy it at this price right now and I'll sell it to, and if it goes up in value, you pay me the difference. That's how, that's how marketplaces work. So for me it's capitalism has just a bunch of people with different opinions who are trying to make money, who are coming up with ideas. And if you create a society where you can enforce contracts and make people keep their promises and you can, you can ensure that people have what's called property rights, which is really important.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       You know, courts essentially that have integrity, that can't be bought off, then that's as far as I can see what you'd call a free market capitalist society. And it seems to be better than most of the other sort of, uh, systems that require central oversight. And because I, not because central oversight is such a bad thing, I just think it's impossible to control. You know, the way people think on such a macro scale. I think it's very, I don't think you have to control the way people think well or behave or behave more harder. Well, yeah, I get it. And I see what you're saying about capitalism and I see what you're saying about society. I think that all these things, when we point to ancient room would point to how fucked up their world was. And slavery is recently as a couple hundred years ago. I think what we're saying is things are getting better or we're evolving.

Speaker 2:          00:39:31       We're figuring out a way to make a society that is more beneficial to more people, but still not to everyone. And then the point is, is it possible to create a Utopian society where it's beneficial to virtually everyone? And then the way to do that, the only way to do that is like, here's a, here's a good example. Like people love to tout socialism as some sort of a cure to what ails us. You know that somehow or another that if you get people and you, you give everybody money and you, everybody's shares wealth equally. But the problem with that cuts out incentive incentive for madness and excellence and the incentive for madness and excellence is why you have tesla motorcars and Ilan Musk and all these fucking jobs. Steve Jobs. Steve jobs is a fucking maniac. He was up, I mean probably a bad dad. Probably.

Speaker 2:          00:40:24       Probably probably a shitty got to work for, you know, probably a total asshole if you did something wrong. If you put a one instead of a zero and a line of code and the fucking phone crashed when it hit a thousand emails or what, he'd probably beat the fuck out of him. I mean he's a maniac. Yeah, but it was because of him that we have iphones. Well it's because of that kind of madness. 100% how many, how many iphones have you bought that were made in Russia? How many cars have you bought that were made in rush? Exactly, but in Russia's fucked up example, because it's not really socialism, it's really communist. Dictatorship nowadays is, yeah. What kind of was and then it wasn't and it was again, it never really recovered. The Russians. I think that their problem is they have one idea of power, which is biggest guns.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       Divert your eyes in my presence. How fucked up is that? Russia's getting kicked out of the Olympics. Yeah, I pay attention is, yeah, of course. Fuck. They're going to tick. Kicked the whole team. The whole Russian team. What cheating is so it's so systemic, so systemic. It's, it's state sponsored come. They've got the KGB apparently are that. Well, it used to be the KGB involved. Well, now I have this one woman who was a whistle blower who's going to compete independently without a nation. How long before they kill her? I know. Good luck with that bitch. Get fucking bottle of water. That's, that's Russia's problem.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       Russia's idea. There are two types of power, right? There's the power that where you can't stop staring at somebody because they have prestige and you want to be like them. That's a power that you can use for good. If you have all those eyeballs on you, you can, you can say, hey guys, I know you're all looking at me and you do this all the time and how many people love this? How many people download this podcast? You're very aware of the responsibility that comes with, so you do two things. Do you try to keep it really honest and true to yourself? But you also try to have really smart people on who have different perspectives so you can kind of figure out a way to get those ideas out into people's heads. That's one form of power that I would consider a positive use.

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       Then there's the Russian model of power. Well, it's not power. It's influence. Uh, I would, I think they're very closely related. I think they're joined at the hill. They don't, it doesn't control anyone. That's the difference between like the power that Putin has and the power that the nerdist so, so, so, so. Exactly. You just use the word. So there's a difference. So there's power that controls when there's power that inspires. And I think power that inspires is what this country needs to keep in mind at all times. That's the power look. You always need power, you need guns and stuff. They're crazy people. You need a strong military. I think the difference is like is it using a blanket statement like power? It's like the board drugs, like caffeine is drug, so it was meth. You know what I mean? Like there's power and then there's influence, but there's things that are powerful and then there's things that have power over people and exactly like to control people like and then people can't do anything about it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:03       That's exactly, that's a difference. That's right. So the word power, the problem is the use of the word power. I remember also mindset. I believe that Russia and which is such an amazing, with such an amazing group of people, they could do anything they wanted and a strong culture, but I think the mindset of Russians in many, in many ways, maybe it's not their fault, maybe it's a product of their history. Their mindset is that they admire the, the first example of power control and strength and dominance more than they admire the power that influences and inspires things that are powerful. So I like trump supporters. I think so they're polluting supporters. They like a strong man at the helm. We know that trump like Putin and Putin likes trump. Yes, that sec. Yeah, it's probably not good, right? I would imagine. No, I haven't been paying attention to the Republican national convention, but shit, but Jamie did and I, but I am paying attention to the fact that this is, this is what I like about all this stuff. What I like about all this trump nonsenses it's shown how vulnerable the system is to fuckery that a madman and come along and just take over the whole thing. Did you see what his fucking biographer said? That guy, he had rosie for Morris, right? Deep remorse. And he said that if Donald Trump becomes president and it has the key to the nuclear football, he said he literally could be the end of civilization. He said, the book should have been titled and styled titled instead of the art of the deal, should

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       have been titled the art of Sociopath, I believe. Or, or the, the words of a sociopath or something along those lines. But his take on trump is that he's a total sociopath. Not Surprising to me. I mean, he's certainly a narcissist and maybe they're the same thing in some ways, but I've, I mean, my wife though, he's, he's got a hot wife. He's always bringing things back to himself and he just, he just lies at his convenience. He's just, it's unbelievable. Do you know that he's been sued? Something like 3,500 times? I believe that when you have a huge company, that happens a lot. So that's, that's, that's not as surprising to me. What my, by waiters and stuff. Yeah. Well, you know, his creditors, a lot of people that invested, you know, people that did work for him never got paid. A lot of the companies that he started a went bankrupt.

Speaker 2:          00:45:19       You know, we talked about how the university, well, yeah, we talk about him being this great businessman. I don't know that we have a lot of evidence. He's done a good job creating a brand that's worth something. So if you put it on a hotel, it comes with in your mind, uh, you think of high quality prestige plus, you know, nice bedding and the, you know, the, or if he has a building, it's the trump tower. Also interesting that he took the name trump because like I believe trump card, that expression trump card was there before the name trump because his last name is drunk. Yeah, drunk. That's his actual last name that I saw. John all ever her. Talk about that. It's real nice. I mean there's nothing wrong with that named [inaudible]. I mean, shit, Arnold Schwarzenegger became famous as Arnold Swartz, a nigger. I mean, he's got the goofy, his fucking name ever and he smashed it with that name in America.

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       You can get away with it. Why couldn't you be drunk? I did the wrong with drum. I remember it doesn't mean anything. I remember being amazed that the United States voted a man by the name of Barack Hussein Obama. And when we are public enemy number one was uh, you know, uh, Osama bin Ladin so phonetically they sound very similar. Oh yeah. Well how about who's sane when we were also Emma enemies with [inaudible] saying exact crazy. Yeah. I mean he had a goofy ass fucking name for a guy to be elected president, but that's why I give Americans a lot of credit. I think Americans are, are, you know, if you listened to European stock, but they're always marveling at how quote unquote dumb Americans are. I don't think Americans are dumb. And I think Americans and a lot of ways they're very fair minded too. Well, there's that, but there's also the fact that there's a two party system where if you are on the left, you have to support whoever's on the left.

Speaker 2:          00:46:52       That's why all these people lining up to support Hillary Clinton and ignoring left and right. All the crazy evidence against her just being completely full of shit. She's corrupt. We, oh my God. We played this video the other day where they were showing the differences between with the FBI has said about her trial, about them looking into the email server, the illegal use of email server. The fact that top secret documents were shared cut and pasted and shared with people that did not have the status to be able to check those and that multiple devices were used to access these and then compare them to what she has

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       said about it. She's just a liar. She's a liar. He's a liar. She's a liar. You, what do you think? Why do you think she set that server up in our bathroom? What was the benefit of that do you think? Who the fuck knows? What's it? Just convenience and what she told to do that. It could be that. It could be that she just didn't want anybody to have any oversight over her email and she wanted to have a server in her home. Look, she deleted a lot of fucking emails, thousands of emails, and you're not supposed to do that. Like that's a part of that Gig. Part of that Gig is transparency. She skirted around that kid. I had Mike Baker in here from the CIA, a former CIA operative who said flat out if he had done the same thing, he was how he says what he says, yes, I would be in jail now he'd be in jail.

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       And he was discussing how this is just not done and everyone knows this. This is like, it's not a woman who just stepped into politics for the first time. This is someone who's been involved in politics virtually your whole life. I read a good article. Somebody sent me and I'll send it to you. Um, I can't remember what the magazine was credible, a credible magazine and the journalist, he said, look, I have my point of view on Hillary and he's not, I left leaning, I think he's probably more of a conservative columnists. And he said, and he went and um, he interviewed all the people that have worked with Hillary Clinton for, with, and, uh, and even her opponents. And it was really, really, really interesting to get the perspective. He said, the one thing that they talk about is number one, she doesn't feel very comfortable in front of, it's not a natural fit for her to be in front of audiences talking. But Dude, she's such a great speaker. She's a great speaker.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       I think her voice is very grounded and strong like this. It's boxy, but they all bought it. They didn't use words like they consider it to be funny, thoughtful, and very intelligent. Now, uh, that, that was an interesting eye. My eyes were a little bit over and I said, well, the people that are close to it, I've worked with her, had more favorable things to say, and I'm not a hillary supporter, but they had more favorable than negative, which I thought was pretty interesting because I'd never thought of actually interviewing people that have worked closely with her. Okay. Stop right there. These are political people. True. So think about what their job is, right? What they do for a living and how to make it in that world. You have to be full of Shit and you have to like, yeah, it's very much like somebody say something bad about somebody else cause you never know if they're going to be it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:51       It's amazing. It's the best of the best gift I've ever read. Well, not only that, he's an amazing actor. She's amazing. Oh my God. Ghostbusters. The new ghostbusters is incredible. Those girls are so strong. They're such strong women. It's my new thing. It's amazing. My new thing is the empowerment of women. I love this new talk that it's just, it's not new either. I'm just, she's totally empowered. She's, she's totally embraced her new hoodie. Oh God. She's bending over, arching her back and licking her lips. She saw power. She's brave because she's naked and fat. She's so brave. All right. If she was brave, she'd get up at four o'clock in the morning and hit the gym before she went to the set. She wouldn't

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       be fat anymore. I'll tell her what's period that Melissa McCarthy woman, they're angry that she's losing weight to understand this. I love it. They're angry that she's choosing to become healthy. So they're saying this is in direct contrast to who she was before, who we loved is this fucking cartoonish fat lady and this cartoonish fat laid who we want to pretend is healthy. Yeah. You know, there's a fucking slew of people out there that have blogs out there talking about different things that are healthy about being fat. And I went down a rabbit hole one night because some woman was writing shoes, this obese woman. And I was really sad when I was looking at her photos. And you know, people like to highlight things that people say about them on social media and you know, like, you know, all these people are harassing her for being fat, but she putting out a blog, right?

Speaker 2:          00:51:13       When you putting yourself out there and you putting a blog, you're just going to a tree. You put some honey out there, you're gonna attract a certain amount of bugs. It's just no way around that. Right? But she was talking about different aspects of being overweight that are healthy. And that is one weird phenomenon where healthy people that catch a disease sometimes don't do as well as fat people that have the same disease. In the old days they said you should have some weight on you in case you get a disease and you can fight it better. That was always the case. What does that, how, how could that be true? I guess because maybe, and I'm just, this is bro Science, but from what I remember reading your fat can actually absorb or store, uh, uh, more. I, I don't know where you have, you have reserves when you're not eating and stuff at you, you know, your body will use the fatty acids for energy was that makes sense.

Speaker 2:          00:52:05       So your body gets into a state of burning fat rather than burning food. And many times when people are sick, that's a huge issue. Coming up with some form of energy. My Italian relatives, you know, th the Sicilian side back in the day, I remember if somebody was too skinny, they look, they, they would say, you know, be careful. You get sick, you know, you'll die. Or was it totally makes sense, but that doesn't mean it's healthy to be fat, but it just means it's like a, it's a reserve policy in case you get a fucking catastrophic disease, but you also more likely to get that catastrophic disease if you're fat. Yeah. So she's such a catch 22, this book by Gary Taubes, I just love called why we get fat and what to do about it. And he, he traces the genealogy of the obesity epidemic and he goes all the way back to the 30s in New York City and he looks at how ineffective all these obesity clinics and even the science of obesity has been.

Speaker 2:          00:52:59       It's been so difficult because a lot of times they treated it like it was a psychological disease. Like you eat too much, so you'd go to a psychiatrist, um, or they would put you on these very restrictive diets, 1200 calories a day and you would lose weight. But at the end of the day, you descend, but also your body gets into this state of panic. Yes. It tries to store energy. Yes. Really quickly because it's worried that you're in a famine state, right? So what he traces in, and he looks at the native Americans that were, had to sort of

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       get, get on government rations when their land was taken and they all blew up like balloons because they were given white flour. And the, the thesis of the book is essentially that when you eat simple carbohydrates and a lot of carbohydrates, especially things like white flour and sugar, your body produces a lot of insulin. And for a whole bunch of metal metabolic reasons, it's insulin that causes you to retain fat molecules and need more sugar for energy. And he does a really great job in the buffet, a book of explaining it. Um, but that sort of, you know, when, when you look at it that way and when you look at the fact that it's just a question of changing what you put into your body, uh, you know, you will then eventually at this Keto Diet, for example, it's a really good way to lose weight and not have to restrict your calories.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       It just is now. I don't know if it's for everybody. Uh, there is a single die that's for everybody. I don't either. I don't either. Those bodies are differently. Obviously people have different allergies to foods like or allergies, all sorts of things like that. It's, that's a great indication that we're just, there's so much biological diversity, so many people have genetics that have come from all sorts of different parts of the world, all sorts of different environments that we evolve from. There's no one single dime for obesity is fairly recent only because when people started eating that much sugar, but you know the think that's universal, right? Like there's nothing wrong with eating a certain amount of carbs and breads and Pastas, but it is universal that massive amounts of sugar bad for you. There's no, I don't think there's any question any more scientifically, but one of the things, it's hard for a very fat people, obese people who have trouble with this, who may have gotten caught into that pattern as kids at or they have.

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       And it's very true that some people genetically do put weight on. They don't process carbs the way other people do. Like I can eat carbs all day and stay very thin. Some people just can't do that, but for a long time, very active. I'm very active, but for a long time what I'm saying is that there's always been instilled as a stigma, which is your fat, which means you are a of weak character or you have a faulty character you're about, and that's why they take so much shit. Whereas Gary Tab and his books had a lot of it was just the fact that people didn't know how the body worked and a lot of this information came out in Germany before the war. There were these Austrian and German scientists that we're really closing in on what insulin does to make you gain weight, but guess what?

Speaker 1:          00:55:45       When the war was over, no American scientists, we're going to use German data, right? It was kind of like, no, we'll come up with our own data. We use the rocket data. We did use their rocket fucking scooped up all their operation paperclip. We scooped up all their fucking rocket scientists and made them Americans. There is a fucking thing about Wernher von Braun being a great American and like Wernher von Braun was a fucking Nazi. The guy who ran the NASA space program was a straight up Nazi who the Simon Wiesenthal Center said, if he was alive today, they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity. Damn, I didn't know that. They hung the five slowest workers every day at his fucking

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       rocket factory in Berlin. Sweet guys. They've hung Jews. They hung them in the front of the fucking rocket factory to encourage the workers to work faster. One of the things that they, they sit by the way, coming directly from people who are still alive, who worked in that factory, I believe with tattoos on their arm. I believe it. I don't think that's a, I don't even think that's a point of conjecture. Brazy is it that we just scooped up all those monsters and they can. We all scooped out good at fucking shooting Middle Dixon to the sky, so let's come over here. We also, but we also scooped up a lot of a German and Austrian Jewish scientists because when they, in fact, Einstein I believe emigrated after a number of, or that thing was two scientists who were Jewish were assassinated, was shot on the street.

Speaker 2:          00:57:07       And so all of these like brilliant Jewish, uh, scientists said, uh, let's get the fuck outta here and go to the UK and go to the United States. Will tragedy of Fritz Harbor, the harbor method. The [inaudible] method is incredible stuff. And the guy figured out a way to extract nitrogen from the air and it's one of the, they say today that there's a, there's a fantastic radio lab podcast on this, I think it's called the bad show. I think that's what it's called because there's a, they did, they did a good show in a bad show. I think that's what it's called. And would they just showed is that sometimes, and this, we've all known this, so sometimes people that have done horrible, horrible things are also amazing. It's something that benefits a lot of folks. And this is one of the classic example. Fritz harbor figured out this way to extract nitrogen from the air and the nitrogen in our bodies today.

Speaker 2:          00:58:02       They estimate that some 50 in nitrogen with, they use it for his fertilizer and for the longest pneumonia. Yeah. Yeah. For the longest time they used to have to get like dead fish or mulch or something like that. Compost. And then the fact that Bat Guano, yeah. Back when I was a big one literally bat shit crazy was like because people would have wars over a bat. Shit, it's nuts that I didn't know that but I that's exactly, yeah. That's what it is. It was fucking wars over bat shit like cause that's how you grow your food is amazing. People would starve during the winter because they didn't know how to get that nitrogen into the soil. And Fritz harbor is literally credited with stopping mass scale starvation. But then there's the other side, other side. Well they said that today the nitrogen in our bodies, 50% of it came from the hopper method.

Speaker 2:          00:58:48       Degas though all the people today, like literally he's responsible for a massive increase in the population of this world. But he also was the guy that fucking used gas in war for the first time. Not only that, he personally oversaw it, he went to the front lines and we started with, it, started with a p, he was working on insecticides, right? Uh, which is by the way, is what Zyklon B, which was used to gas, the Jews. He came up with Xy, clown eggs, psych on a had a smell it to it so that you could know what it was and get the fuck away from it. Whereas B, the Nazis

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       extracted the smell. He will harbor was at ju. So what a fucking crazy conundrum. That guy found himself where his own relatives died directly from an invention that he creates. Incredible. And you know also if you, if you take a sympathetic approach to a man who was a patriot, he was a patriot. His country was at war. He had benefited from this country. He had a legacy in this country. He had standing in this country and his country was under direct threat. And he said, I think I know a way to help this war effort so we can stop the enemy and you know, we should all again, it's not what you think. It's how you think we should all put ourselves in his shoes. If I had a way, and I'm, I think I'm right about that, if I had a way as an American is Brian Count to save my country from people I thought were going to actually take it over our kill a bunch of people, including my family.

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       I'm going to gas the fuck out of them. If I can invent a technique, I'm going to gas them and I'm gonna come up a way to shoot a rocket. Adam, that's so, if that makes me a bad person, call me Fritz slow. Isn't it crazy though that this guy was literally receiving the Nobel Prize for the harbor method at the same time for being wanted for crimes against humanity for war criminal, but the same people that want to try him for war crimes dropped nuclear fucking bombs on two cities in Japan. Like what is a war crime? Like when you're killing people, like, oh, you killed people the wrong way. Like we have rules, can't kill her. But like, there's lemay who oversaw, I believe, the bombing, the firebombing of Tokyo. Uh, and, uh, December before the, the Hiroshima Nagasaki bombs, this is the fire bombs, which by the way, killed more people, did more distraught.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       I mean, everybody concentrates on the D two events. Hiroshima, Nagasaki firebombing was, oh, I mean, what we did to Dresden, what we did to the allies, really it was the British and the Americans. But, um, I mean dressing looks like the surface of the moon. Uh, you know, uh, Kurt Vonnegut, I think in the book a slaughterhouse five talks about this and the vivid detail, but look at just youtube dresden before and after Jimmy bring up Dresden, Jimmy, before Jimmy, I said Jimmy said Jimmy, right? Dresden before and after the firebombing. But Curtis Lemay, I think in a period of eight days in Tokyo eight and I mean, at 1 million people died from fire and Curtis Lemay said business, it wars the business of killing people. And if I had been on the losing side, I'd probably be tried as a war criminal, and if you see Curtis Lemay, he's always chewing on a cigar and he was the commander and he was the one who made those decisions and they said, we're going to punish the German workers.

Speaker 1:          01:02:02       They're real pictures though. Look at what is this? This? I was like Dresden. Dresden was a jewel. It was a jewel and there's an beautiful post, like the surface of the fucking moon. You'll see they have videos of it. Then Jamie, this all this is before and after the allied bombing. I don't know why. It's just pictures. See if you can find some photos, some actual photo. Beautiful Dresden Ruins after the allied bombing. Whoa. But this is drawing worse in that photograph. Oh, that's a photo. Yeah. There you go. That's what it's a photo. Oh my God. It looks like, Oh my God. If it, all of it. And then any time they talk about the survivors who were just walking around the city that had been standing for 700 years or something crazy and it was no longer, how would the neighbor have survived this?

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       They didn't. In fact, people were falling over and look at that. Those are bodies. People were falling down. Um, they were falling down because the oxygen was sucked out of the air. So you'd be, you'd be on the street and you would, you would just fall down because there was no air. Yes. Or there'd be a bomb and the people would open their shutters and stick their head out and the aftershock would take their heads off. Whoa. We're very lucky. Very lucky. We didn't live at this time. She very left Bryce. What a fucking strange thing. [inaudible] was an apocalypse. Giant scale war is like that. And, and Europe, what was it a, was it a 50 million people at the end of World War II that were dead? Maybe as many as 80 million. Put that into context and that from those ashes from these experiments like fascism and the idea that you can perfect human beings and perfect society and create utopias from those experiments came, uh, ash and 80 million graves.

Speaker 1:          01:03:49       And so, and from that came right Kinda Sorta, I mean, the idea like if you just wanted to improve upon human beings without killing people that you thought were inferior, if you just wanted to create the uber manch without making everybody else die without you. But you need to reeducate. So reeducation camps that Pol Pot would put people in. You had to be marched to the countryside because he was creating a, you an agrarian utopia. But why does it always have to, why? Why does any beneficial act like the idea of creating better people? Like we would all like a better society with better people. I mean if we all had a, a world where everybody had perfect genetics and nobody had to worry about fat shaming, you know, like nobody had to worry about not being attractive. Nobody helped. But that's not good. So the problem is like the stress and the anxiety of being a dork and the, the, the, the stress of being bullied.

Speaker 1:          01:04:42       And that's where diamonds come from. Not good to someone. It's not good to take advantage of someone. It's not good to make someone's life hell. But a lot of times that's where you get a Marvin Gaye. Of course, you know, you get these, these jewels of art. Yeah. You know, you get these people that come out of these horrible environments and they have this power to them, but you have to create, you have, you're right. You still have to create some respite. You know, that the great, the greatest, the Great Matthew Arnold who said that the United States is the land of the stock market and big guns and, and powerful, you know, an agrarian state, it can feed the land of Prince. What he also said, I was going to say, he said, we have to always remember to create safe haven for our gentler spirits are Weirdos and people that think differently and active.

Speaker 1:          01:05:33       And we, that's what you get prints, little Richard, Marilyn Manson and all the things that make our culture interesting. Yeah. And that's a very important thing to keep in mind when you, when you, um, but again, look, when you talk about, um, bombing and how we're getting better, think about for a second the methodology in our brain of how we, a lot of people think of not only terrorism, and I'm guilty of this too, or even say something like cancer. So if you have cancer, there's one method of treating it and sometimes it works, which is there's a tumor, let's cut it out. Let's cut the tumor out was another method of treating and which was diet and health and taking care of your body before it ever happens. This is one of the things that you're talking now about the duality is what I'm saying is that we, we fall sometimes into the mindset that every problem can be cut out and, and removed, right.

Speaker 1:          01:06:23       Instead of saying prevention, what you just said, what you just said is there's another, there might be another tact in, in every issue. So when you, when we talk about, um, the bad guys and we talk about, we have to in, and listen, there's, there's, there's a place in the time to take out the bad guys. There's no question of course, but, you know, but we have to be careful that we have, we don't fall into one way of thinking and one way of dealing with what we consider threats. Right, right. Because we could make the problem worse. Um, and instead, sometimes we might want to say, maybe this time, maybe this is a problem that doesn't require cutting and radiation and, uh, you know, removing, maybe it's what you just said. Maybe we should approach it systemically from a different angle that's not as, uh, not as violent and not as physical.

Speaker 1:          01:07:16       Yeah. Well, there's also the problem of the charismatic leader and there's also a problem of people wanting to be a part of a team. Like you were talking about, if you could guess the people that are a threat to the United States, but who are those people? Cause they're just people. The idea that somehow or another, someone who lives in Italy who, uh, I've never met is against me. Uh, someone who lives in the United States who they've never met. That's preposterous. We just don't know each other. And when you get, by the way, when I was in Italy, one of the weirdest fucking things about it, and I've never been there before, so I don't know that, but the people that were there were describing to me how everything has changed. I was talking to this one cab driver, it was really interesting guy. And, uh, he was, uh, we were commenting on, was asking him about everywhere you look, they have these land rover defenders that are in Cammo with these military people standing out there with fucking machine guns everywhere, everywhere. And I said, is this normal? And he said, no. He said, this is the new way. He's like, is a, the world

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       is changing. He said, this is not a good world. He said, this is not good. And I said, so this is a direct response to the terrorist threats and the things that have been happening in Paris. He goes, yes, yes, yes. He goes, they don't want it to happen here. So, so all the places where there was tourists, where was the Vatican? Whether it was the coliseum. You saw these, these camouflage land rover defenders in these public displays, guy's gun and a woman. I saw a woman, I was thinking about punching her and taking her gun. It's like, I think it can sound as women are no joke know. I don't think so. I got it. They're trained to react. My Guy, that's my guy, that's my gun. It wasn't obviously, I'm kidding, but it is. It is weird to see these people. They're standing out there holding guns and they had fucking very serious looks on their face and they're scanning the crowd looking left and looking right in.

Speaker 2:          01:09:01       A lot of Middle Eastern people there. A lot of fucking people dressed up like beekeepers. A lot of poor ladies with gloves on and Ninja masks and I was like, what in the fuck, 2016 and you've got people wandering the streets of one of the greatest cities in the world and our liberal democracy. I'm fucking that. That talks about giving people their on the serenity on him, but they were, yeah, and all the women like Italian women trust like, Oh yeah, I was looking for Dick. Oh well they're just very, I consider they trust their minimalists. Excuse me sir. They're mental mess and they did. They know how to, I'm fan. I'm a fan of hallways. Did you see what happened in France over the weekend? It's um, this man stabbed a woman and her three children at a, at a resort for being scantily dressed. This Muslim man.

Speaker 2:          01:09:47       Oh, what in the fuck man. Just, well, it's such a bankrupt. It's such a bankrupt philosophy, if you can even call it that. This ideology is an ideology. I'm going to kill you. I thought you talk about people who are caught in a trap. These, this isis ideology talk about being caught in a past. This guy, this guy wasn't nicest. He wasn't an isis guy. He was just some radical Muslim. Some someone who deeply believes what he's been taught, his ideology so powerful that he's willing to stab an eight year old kid in the lungs is poor fucking kid. At a collapse. A little girl, a little girl, cause she was wearing a beach house. Jesus Christ. Well this is a guy. Um, it sounds like you've might've been mentally ill or the guy drove all those people and needs that happened while I was there is, I didn't say it nice.

Speaker 2:          01:10:33       Nice. That happened while I was there. It was a, well this is the other thing is again, not only do they do that because they're fanatical, they think they're actually going to change something and make the world a better place by, by behaving in this mad fashion. In some ways they might because they're going to unleash the Jocko willink on the world who are going to go out there and they're going to fucking kill people like this. They're there. They're going to fucking get people to the point where they lose all tolerance. Well, I'm Kinda shit point and I'm pretty tolerant and I'm getting to that point. And here's the, here's the thing about when you think about isis. So I was talking to my buddy who's a CIA guy, you know, he's at, he's at Delta Guy. He's one of these were bill kind of a guys

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       who's in there and does all the dirty work. And he said, um, I said, you know, let's, why don't we just bomb, uh, the, the, their strongholds, you make a martyr. Well, no, he also said, he said, you have to understand that that's not like they're all camped out in one area. They're in a town the size of, you know, let's say Baltimore and there they have safe houses, but for the most part, they're all over that place. But more importantly, as Isis fighters die, what they do is they come to families that are peace loving families and they say, listen, we need to, we need to conscript your son and your two other sons. Right? They're there. They now belong to isis. Now you can say no and die or you can bring, bring them over for the cause because you better be down cause that what's going on.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       That's what's going on now. Where's this happening? We'll pull in the world in Syria, in Iraq, in, in those places where they have strongholds. [inaudible] people are joining voluntarily. Yes, yes. They, including European women. Have you seen this crazy shit where girls are going from England and they're joining isis? Yeah. They're also getting their also getting wholesale just destroyed. Oh Man, I just fucking dying. And now isis is trying to support the families of the martyrs and they're running out of money and you know, so they're losing the, they're losing the physical battle. But the ideology is always going to inspire fuck faces. Like this guy who kills children. And I think in that case, you know, you do need a strong presence and people willing to shoot those people before they do what they do. It's really hard to prevent though. Well, it's hard to prevent crazy people.

Speaker 2:          01:12:46       Yeah. And the word crazy is not the right word. It's hard to prevent even addicts, psychopaths, it's hard to prevent people. Like, I mean, forget religious ideology. The guy who fucking shot up those people in the movie theater in Colorado. It's hard to prevent that. Yeah. It's, it's hard to, I mean that, that happened more than once. Right? I mean, how many times people didn't, someone gets shot up in Amy Schumer's movie. The one where there are people that went to see train wreck that was right, right. Yeah. And because she was a, what would you set up?

Speaker 1:          01:13:16       What do you think is the answer? I mean it's a good question. The answer is the answer. This is a little bit radical, but is the answer. Let all of us carry a gun.

Speaker 2:          01:13:25       How are you gonna stop that truck with a gun? I don't know. The trucks are more dangerous than guns, you know, it's fucked up. I kind of predicted that that truck attack during the Steven crowder podcasts and I didn't even realize I did it. Somebody posted on the integrator in the Internet, like a clip of it. Like what's to stop someone? Cause we were talking about gun control and I'm like, the problem is mentally insane. People that are willing to kill people and they could do it a lot of ways, man. And I was like, what's to stop someone from taking a car and driving through a fucking crowd of people. There's not much you can do

Speaker 1:          01:13:55       about it, but you can't shoot him in the face so that they die in the car. Maybe I do get lucky

Speaker 2:          01:14:02       hit them. You know how hard it is to shoot at someone when they're driving at you in a car. It's hard to shoot a deer that's standing still and in you resting your gun on a rock. But it's possible. It's possible. I'd rather have that answer then have to run and scream with my kids. I'd rather be able to stand my ground and fucking squeeze off, you know? Right. Six rounds in his direction. And I really mean that. You'd know it's, it's, there's an argument there and I think the argument against that, that, you know, you should not have that because you're more likely to kill someone in your family. And you know, that's not a great argument either. I think on both sides, like the real issue is mental health. The real issue is inequality. The real issue is people growing up. And, and when I say inequality, I don't necessarily even mean rights.

Speaker 2:          01:14:46       I mean in the environment in which your soul enters this world. Like what, what, what is the environment that you and I entered? Well, we have really nice parents and we got really lucky. We got born in America and we didn't, we even born American, born in the Philippines, there's Jesus Christ. I was 14 years old, barely 100 different countries too. I get my edge. But you, you, you got lucky. You have a really nice family. You know, I got lucky, great family, like Nice people. You know, that's very fortunate. If you were born in Iraq or in Saudi Arabia or in Afghanistan or in any of these places where they're dealing with these ancient ideologies, you're fucked. It's like, it's like there's a race and the race is 30 miles long and you're starting out at mile one where some people are at mile 29 like there's no way.

Speaker 2:          01:15:36       It's no way this is fair. It's no way. It's just not fair. And there's gotta be a way through either time or effort or just the sheer expression of ideas that permeate through this world where it slowly, yeah, slowly but surely things have to even out to the point where people realize the correct way to behave and treat people. Look, you could say religious tolerance all you want, but when there's a fucking woman dress like a Ninja at the mall, that lady is not in a good place. She, she's being forced to dress like that. This is not her idea. There's no way it is. This is an idea that was stuck into her life when she was a small person and she grew up with that idea and now she's married to some guy who enforces that idea and this guy's walking around with a fucking golf shirt on and his wife's dress like a Ninja.

Speaker 2:          01:16:28       I mean, it says, man, I think that it makes their country weaker if you get, yeah, you guys arise and, and, and you know, creates these sort of fencing around an entire class of people and agenda. If you take women and say, you guys have to walk a little bit behind me. You have, we just know that that doesn't work. You're wasting a lot of human potential. Yes. A lot of people with ideas that can make the world a better place. And you also, you're, you're stifling the debate and the discussion. Look, there's a lot of people that think different than me, man. A lot of people, whether they're from different parts of the world or whether they have different likes or dislikes and they have different, uh, art that they appreciate. And I, I like hearing their point of view. There's a lot of people that I don't agree with what they're saying and I like to hear what they say.

Speaker 2:          01:17:17       There's radical feminists that I listened to their ideology and unlistened to what they're saying. And I try to figure out where the fuck they're coming from. I try to figure, okay, is this a direct response to something they've experienced in their life? Like how much of this has to deal with them being persecuted? How much of them it has to, how much of what people say has to do with their direct experiences with the opposite sex. Like when you look at a bunch of feminists, right? And some of them have pink hair and they weigh 300 pounds and you, you know, life was not fucking awesome for them around men. You just know it wasn't he? Well, how much of this anti male sort of ideology that they're espousing, like how much of that comes from their direct experiences with men and how different would it be if they grew up looking like Julia Roberts? Right. I mean, a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:18:08       Really good. Um, one of the things I do with my podcast, the Brian Council now is I do, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You have a podcast? I have a, I have, I have the fight in the Cayman. Wait, wait a minute, Wayne. Man, you brought back the Brian Cowen. Shall I ha I do it once a week and I talk about a book about this. I sent you, I sent you one of them just for you to listen to because I did it with this guy, Hunter Mountain. I don't listen. He was brilliant. Just tell you right now. I sent it to here like whatever. But it was a super busy, we had an amazing, I'm very, very busy, but I had an amazing conversation with my buddy hunter that amazing. Like you can't believe it happened. Is it more? It was good. My buddy hunter is really good at reading everything and putting it in the context where I can understand it.

Speaker 1:          01:18:47       You know what I mean? Like he, he can put it, he can create useful, he can turn it into a useful, you know what I mean? But you can read a bunch of books but you don't have to put it together. This motherfucker can put it all together and contextualizes it and everything else. And we read this book, we'll read a book and then talk about it. So we read this book called the secret of their success at the secret of our success by Joseph Henrik. And the book is, the theme of the book is basically this and it's to your point, human beings are smart because they borrow culture. Human beings are smart because they have societies that excel have to be open and have to be open enough so that they can borrow the best things from other cultures. So for example, if you and I are put in the middle of the Arctic would get a flat unless we find a bunch of Innuendo.

Speaker 1:          01:19:33       We're dead in about three days. You know, if you and I are in the Amazon, if you take an intuit who can kick ass and find seal meat and everything else and put them in the Amazon, he's fun. He doesn't know, he doesn't have the culture. Human beings survive and grow and excel because we are really good at learning from each other, borrowing ideas. It's called the diffusion of innovation. We are, that's the most important thing. And when you have societies that have these strong rules and the strong ideologies that keep people essentially restricted, you are not to have

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       the free flow exchange of ideas. Look at, for example, mixed martial arts. Think about where martial arts has come once the ultimate fighting championship and the grace he's created this crazy thing where everybody got to fight everybody else. Pretty soon everybody starts sharing secrets. Everybody starts to Kinda like go, this works, this doesn't work. And you were putting it in an arena where you were actually, it was just a very open place. It was the people who have been ground. It was a proven ground and you could borrow ideas and people are, look at what they're doing now, their borrower coaches here, I have this idea in submissions and kickboxing and all this. That's how societies, that's how innovation happens. That's the best way to get ideas to move forward. And again, the problem with Wa this sort of countries that are restrictive like Russia, like Saudi Arabia with the strong sort of either cultures of power or cultures of religion is that they create um, a very, very, it's a very difficult atmosphere.

Speaker 2:          01:21:06       Not only, not only to be open with your ideas but, but to benefit from your ideas. You are not going to start a company like apple in Russia when you know that the government like Putin or whoever is co could take it anytime they want. Where would be the incentive that I'm going to work for 20 years. He's buddies with Putin. Exactly. Might be able to pull it off, but you'll never do it in Saudi Arabia. Now it's an economy of influence, not a meritocracy. Let me ask you this, cause this is a kind of an interesting thought that's going through my head. Do you think that one of the things that's going on today that just really wasn't going on, I mean in the 70s you had the Iran hostage crisis with Jimmy Carter and all that jazz, but if you really go back and think about what that was all about and if you really look at the history of the United States intervention in the Middle East, it was really about controlling resources, controlling now also controlling Soviet influence.

Speaker 2:          01:22:01       Yeah, controlling Soviet influence, but that was also about resources too because they were trying to, the mujahideen, they were trying to control Afghanistan and they had wanted to get the natural gas pipelines and there's, there's a lot of it to that deals with monopolizing natural resources and the amount of money that you can get from there. And then also the amount of natural resources that could be used to strengthen military, you know, a regimes there. There's, there's a lot of control issues in that, but you didn't have the kind of terrorist activity that you're having today, which also coincides with the freedom and expression of ideas and information at an unprecedented rate that we're all experiencing today. And the areas where this is not true. The areas where the freedom of expression and the tolerance of ideas, I mean if you look at the United States, there's some some nonsense that's going on today with political correctness and there's some complete the the the the left that's taken so far left that it almost becomes right because they're just completely trolling but could not just controlling but so, so infatuated with the idea of enforcing their version of what equality is, equality is and what life is on everybody else.

Speaker 2:          01:23:16       That it becomes this like, oh this is radical. You've very tyrannical. But point is this is this is the, the west, I mean this is where we are. We are in the real marketplace of ideas. This is the boiling point of all these ideas where things are changing at this radical rate and this is the world that is also being attacked and really being opposed by this completely constricted world that really doesn't feel like it has a chance. Like this world is trying desperately to cling to these old ways. D I mean if you look at, look what Isis is, they are desperately trying to cling to these ancient religious ideologies that were established in, in a way that does not allow for the even exchange of ideas and information and this, this new way of, but this is also this new way, is also attached of course, to the military industrial complex. It's also attached to that the idea that there's hundreds of different, some different military bases and hundreds of different countries where we're in control of massive,

Speaker 1:          01:24:23       the mountains has been, has been noted. It hasn't been, you know, terrorism by the way of the 70s I remember being in Rome airport, they had plenty of guys with machine guns because of their red book Grit Brigade. There was timing as terrorism. There was Palestinian terrorists and back then when they killed the people, the Olympics, Munich, yeah, there was always terrorist, but a much smaller scale than today. Much smaller. I don't know about that. I don't know if that's true because terrorism was a terrorism. There was never anything like isis before. No, there wasn't there. This is a new thing and I, I, but this really powerful, but I have to stop you there because, because when you say there wasn't anything, like I said, you're right. But for example, in Indonesia, which was essentially an American ally, uh, in Indonesia, had I just lost my yet, take a look at how many people in one year died during the communist purge and I think it was 1965 by many, many accounts. The, uh, there were probably 1 million people, most of whom were sort of take the commando oxy, they were the sort of civilian conscripts that the military kind of recruited and said, find us the communists in your villages. And they were marched down to the river. They had their heads chopped off and by many accounts, almost a million quote unquote communists in a period of about a year in Indonesia were slaughtered. Let's take a look. These are all related, but no one's saying that. That that my point is, is

Speaker 2:          01:25:56       what I'm trying to get at is I wonder if what is going on now is almost the same thing that's going on with like a two party system. It's an US versus them thing, but it's combined with the os which is this what's going on in the western world. I mean obviously the Western world has plenty of problems, but one thing the western world has pretty clearly is the even exchange of information and ideas. You might not agree with these ideas and you might mean and then that's it. There's a problem with that as well, but, but you have access to them, you have access to them and this access is like, well that's one of the things that's going on with twitter and I dunno if you know about this, but Milo Yiannopoulos, you know what he is? Yeah. He got banned from twitter for writing a bad review about ghostbusters, which essentially confirms what he said about the regressive left is that they're trying to stifle ideas like w and then they're saying that he's responsible for the harassment of Leslie Jones.

Speaker 2:          01:26:49       Right. Which is horrible. You know what people did. She's a fucking comedian. She's awesome. Great. She's not great. She's funny shit, man. Um, but also this is just trolls, right? You're always going to have trolls. But he didn't do that. He didn't, he's not responsible for, he didn't like sending them who wasn't the catalyst to the, yeah. But what he did was make an incredible amount of sense when he was describing that you cannot make fun of this movie. You cannot criticize this movie if you do, you're labeled a massage. Dennis and he talked about how preposterous this movie is that these women are all kicking ass and every man, the movie a buffoon and the women don't have any negative traits or qualities at all. They're there. They're super powerful and super awesome and hilarious. And the humor is nonexistent because they put them in this restrictive box.

Speaker 2:          01:27:36       He got banned from twitter for that band, for twitter, for this you, you what? They've, they're blaming him on the harassment that Leslie experience inside of the inside anything. He made a provocative article about a piece of art and that's what that movie is a piece of art. So they are, they are guilty of censorship in the, in the worst way. Well, what they're doing is they're stifling ideas they don't agree with and they've, they've decided that the twitter established some weird fucking thing called the trust and Security Council or something like that. And they brought all these social dress justice words. Jamie looked at up, what the fuck is that called? That they tried to do, but they brought on all these people for this. I was like mouth China. But Chase is Christ very, very bizarre. It is thought, well look, I'm against harassment.

Speaker 2:          01:28:25       If you could stop people from being shitty to people and you say, well, here's someone who's using twitter and they're going after people in a very shitty way. But the problem with that is look at how many fucking people have made shitty, horrible, evil comments about police officers. All police officers, trust and safety council. When it comes to safety, everyone plays a role. Please make that larger so I can read it. Powers. Twitter empowers every voice to shape the world, but you can't do that unless you feel safe and confident enough to express yourself freely and with the world around you to help give your voice more power. Twitter does not tolerate behavior intended to harass, intimidate, or use fear to silence another user's voice. Very general, by the way, listening in general then, so now you have a council that is deciding whether or not your good enough for twitter as well.

Speaker 2:          01:29:20       You know what the first thing they did with him? They couldn't figure out what to do with him. They took away his verification. Wow. What? What? What does that have to do with, wow, what does that, he's not verified anymore. They took away a little blue chat. Yeah, it's very dangerous. It's a very dangerous, slippery slope. But we see the scenario. Universities, you do exactly the same thing. When they did that, he gained 20,000 new followers immediately because there was a massive backlash. Yeah. So now they're in a place where there is even more backlash because if you look at the actual words that he typed versus what they're accusing him of, and it just doesn't stack up, it's clear that they don't like him because he's a Republican. He's a trump supporter. He and he is a fucking troll. I love him. I think he's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          01:30:03       He's a troll. But in the marketplace of ideas, you should be able to combat his trolling behavior. The thing I gag without gagging, without gagging and engage him, engage him in a debate and a vigorous spirit. Exactly. Gag The guy. Right. If you really feel like he has done something egregious, if he's done something that can be criticized, criticized it. That's right. And if he's actually harassing people, if he's actually saying, Hey, go find Leslie Jones and, and throw dog shit at, or do something horrible to her or slash or tires or something like that, he's actually doing something like that. Yeah. Then you know that he's doing, that's where the, that you don't get up in a crowded movie theater and scream fire because you'll create a stampede. Yeah, right. Exactly. You know my Angela talked about that when she said where the Ku Ku Klux Klan was saying we have a freedom of speech and my Angela said you're a freedom ends.

Speaker 2:          01:30:59       Your freedom of speech can end when you're literally telling people to hang me and you're telling a mob and I'm standing right there that, that the inciting them. That's, that's probably where you know we should take a look at things. I mean, and we all know, we all know the line. What we don't know about what, no, I'm saying, I'm saying that that there is something called common decency and you know people like to jump to these extremes but it's not, it doesn't inform the debate. I think what you're saying is so important and then the idea that you've got to create a safe haven for those that you agree with and disagree with. Disagree with Milo all the time. I mean, he and I are friends and I've had him on the podcast twice. And when we talk, I'm mock them when we have fun.

Speaker 2:          01:31:40       I mean, but he's a good guy, but he's just really right wing. I also think his trolling is so fucking sophisticated and he's one of the ones that was saying that he believes that Melania, how do you say her name? Trust. Why trump? Melania? Is that her name? Yeah. He thinks that they did it on purpose. He thinks trump is a master troll and he thinks that the plagiarism was on purpose because now more people are talking about it and then more people are, I don't know if that's true, but I think it's hilarious that you did, you know that his tweet, trump's tweet that he put out to congratulate his wife for speaking is exactly verbatim the same tweet that Obama put out to congratulate his wife or speaking. Interesting. Exactly. Wow. Every single word in the exact same order. Wow. Yes. Uh, that's, that's pretty calculated.

Speaker 2:          01:32:37       I don't know. I don't think he writes his own tweets. That apparently wasn't true. Is it fake photoshopped? Oh, this motherfucker, they got me. So that was the thing they did. I'm sorry about that folks. That's another thing that they did with the Leslie Jones, which she was really upset is that trolls were taking words, um, and putting them like they were taking a photoshop and making her like her name, like what she had, you know, heard her twitter name and then writing horrible shit about gay people and then putting it in there. Jesus. But Leslie Jones and again, I love her. I think she's really funny. She said some kind of fucked up things on, on twitter herself and you know, things that can be construed as racist. One of the things she said about white people being shit, fuck white people, Shit. Like something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:33:24       It was a on on Breitbart. See if you could, you'd find the actual, uh, things that they were, there were saying that like, how could Leslie Jones get away with saying this? But Milo gets banned for writing an article and I'm not you ma'am. But I think what Leslie said, like white people, Shit, it could've been that she was saying like, someone did something and Goddamn white people, this is some white people, Shit. You know, like she's funny. Like when people climb into a zoo and try to fucking hug a tiger, that's why people, that's why people shit. That's funny though. And let's say anybody who knows let's, no, she's great. She's just that fucking Dall Lord have mercy white people. Shit. What does that mean though? It's white people shit. Like they do, I mean, what does that mean? Like why did she say that?

Speaker 2:          01:34:10       Like what is that about? Who imagine a white person, but look at this, imagine a white person saying that about black people. I understand, but I think I, you know, we've heard this before, we, it's fine. Leslie Jones is not a racist and Leslie Jones's, it never been anything but really kind to people around her. Okay. But hold on a second because sometimes people say things that are racist and they're not racist. They're just trying to be fun. Yes. Like, you know, I mean how many 2 cents and if sometimes the Jeff Ross is hilarious and he says a lot of racial stuff when he exerts Silberman. Sarah Silverman. But Jeff Ross in particular because he's really good at roasting people and a lot of the stuff that he says like, you know, he crosses what some people would say is align but what is he doing? He's being funny. There is, there is a difference. So a lot of times if you're Hispanic, um, if you're, you know, you're from

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       a marginalized group, you can get away with it because you all share in a common experience of repression, right? So like gay people can mock straight people guide, go ahead. Mock me for like composer, who cares? That's what I mean. Cause we don't, we've never had to pay a price for that kind of oppression. We haven't, not physically and not, not economically because we've been oppressed for being straight forever. It's a constant thing. People were just so mad that we're not saying read or fucking breeder out there making babies. Exactly what's fucking auto. And George had a great line, you know, auto and George, if you don't know, Otto was this fucking great, hilarious comedian who had a puppet named George and his Papa was evil and these bushy eyebrows and the puppet would say these fucked up things and auto would go, ah, I can't believe you're saying that.

Speaker 1:          01:35:50       Like what the Hell Creek? And the puppet would say, he goes, Hey, I don't understand where all these fucking queer as it coming from for a group of people that can't breed, where the fuck are they all coming from? It's like you had these like who'd say like purposely ignorant shit as his puppet. Yeah. Well you know, a lot of times all of us think outrageous thoughts. We think prejudice thoughts. It's part of being a human being man is a friend of mine who was dealing with um, these folks that are Jewish that are incredibly cheap. And this friend of mine was saying like, how fucking embarrassing is it when someone just reenact the most disgusting stereotype about a race, like a Chinese guy, he just closes his eyes and just drive straight into traffic.

Speaker 1:          01:36:40       Like this is fucking horrible stereotypes that like when you see them, like, oh, come on man. If I was Chinese and I saw someone driving like that, I'd be like, you motherfucker. You know what I'm dealing with here? Just being shy. If there's an accident and I'm involved, people go, oh, of course the black and Asian guy go car accident. Well, do you know, do you know what Dunbar's principle is? Yes. Yeah, and that's, we have a limited number of people we can keep within our heads. Right? Right. But that also plays a part and stereotyping. There's a limited amount of information that we can kind of like keeping our heads right. So actually stereotyping was something that kept us safe. You're talking about when you talk about stereotyping, what you're really talking about is pattern recognition and chunking information, right? You're looking at something because you don't have a lot of time.

Speaker 1:          01:37:25       You're looking at a dude. It's like Dove, David [inaudible] joke about, you know, he said he was sitting there and he and this guy walked up to him, he's already done this joke so I'm not selling, I'm not, I'm not ruining it. But he said, you know, look, we assume things all the time. You know, he goes, I saw this guy with teardrop tattoos, he had a knife and I was like, I don't want to stay. I don't want us to hang around here. And the girl goes, don't assume it could be a chef. I'm like that's fine. He could be a chef. But if you'll pull your pants down and you've got a bunch of blisters and your genitals, I'm not going to assume you got stung by a pack of bees. You know, at the end of the day you do stereotyped, you make choices based on how you, you know, what the information you get and you do it very quickly because sometimes that information and keep you safe.

Speaker 1:          01:38:04       A cop. A lot of times when they see they can tell if somebody shouldn't be somewhere cause they'll look for certain things out of state plates, fast food wrappers, that person's drive and they're on their way somewhere. There are lots of different little signals that cause you to profile, right? Cause sometimes profiling is what's called good police work. Uh, we all do it. We all, we all, when I'm driving and I see a dude in his car and I see the back of his head, I can make a lot of fucking assumptions on how he's driving and whether or not he's going to signal like an old dude with a hat do it all the time. I do it all the time and I got to speak by this guy. I got a beep my horn before I go by cause he might just swerving cause he's a fucking dummy.

Speaker 1:          01:38:42       You know what I'm saying? So some of this is just being a human being. And again, it's how our minds work and we probably all share very similar thought patterns with even our enemies or even the people we don't like. Right. But being like, being a Jewish person, it's really cheap. Like super cheap. But that comes from that's different. No, because that's characteristic. The way I would look at it as this. So I'd say you'd say a Jew, that Jewish person, that's cheap. Right. And I would say what I would look at is I'd say, well, hold on for a second. If you've been a Jew, you have a history and we can go back 3,500 years, but let's just go back. Uh, I dunno, let's go back 2000 years. You got a history of a lot of people in their twenties. Nope. It doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:          01:39:29       Listen, do you got a lot of people blaming the Jews for killing Christ? Right? And so usually if you look at history, especially European history, they were either kicked out or they were killed. So what happens is if you don't have a homeland, you don't have a homeland and you're a Jew. All right? Don't they have a homeland? No luck yet. But that's very recent. What does that 1948 yeah. So, so as a Jew, when you actually don't have, you know, a country, I'm just, you know, as an example, guess what your security is. Your fucking security at the end of the day is how thick your wallet is. Because money, money is how you survived. You know the reason that a lot of Jews, the reason Jews were into the jewelry trade diamonds, little diamonds or something you could pick up, put an a pouch and run the fuck away really quickly.

Speaker 1:          01:40:11       You could transport your wealth. So they were like, well, we're kept out of banking. We kept that, all of these things, but we can make clothing and we can, and we're jewelers and they came to this country. Those immigrants came to this country with those two skills, Irish came to this country with, hey, I got two hands. I can work a farm. What do you need me to do? The Jews were like, I, uh, I can make fucking really nice clothes and I can label them and I can get you to think that they're even nicer. Because I understand a little bit about marketing. Oh. And by the way, I got diamonds, they there, there were, there were certain things that they were forced into and they came to this country and they had a skill set. So I look at that and I go, Ooh, that's just cultural residue. That's just cultural residential culture. You were taught that that's how you get ahead

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       and you were taught that keeping hold on your money is by the way also a way to ensure your survival. So the more you learn about, you know, the more you learn about people's history and the more you learn about our biology, the more we learn about brain science. I think the more compassionate and makes us, well that's also why a lot of people feel that some Asian folks are bad drivers cause they used to mind their own business not looking left and right. And when they walk they walk straight ahead and they bumped into each other all the time. That's great. That's fucking great. That's what we will do. A friend of mine is China was explaining this to me. He's like, if you go to China and you walked down the street, he goes, people just bounce off each other like cars. And he goes, and it's not offensive.

Speaker 2:          01:41:32       It's just what they're doing. They're not doing it on purpose. It's just like when you're dealing with billions of people, like this is how you do it. Yeah. You just, you to just got to plow forward. If you ever seen intersections in China, yes, you've seen videos of intersections is fucking terrified. It's insanity. It's fucking terrifying chaos. It's the aunts. It's like it was terrifying. It allows the, they drive like fucking savages in Italy. Yeah. I mean there's this roundabouts, well walking, we're driving into the roundabout what it called Jesus and the driver just like skillfully maneuvers around this, but like, look at this, look at this fucking mad bays. But they figure it out. Work they left, they write, they zoom around each other. They're driving slowly and they're all making their own. So at 25 miles an hour, they say anything below 25 miles an hour.

Speaker 2:          01:42:13       Human beings are very good at navigating. You know, that's a good example. And this is kind of a weird overhead view, but this is, this is actually manageable, but I've seen some shit that just does look manageable. You also see people die in those intersections. Yeah. Well how about the people that are walking, they just walk across the street and pray that people avoid them? Like, Oh, you get, God dammit. Yeah. I mean there's a lot of cultures that have their own little thing that they do to sort of deal with the numbers that they're dealing with. And you know, you see that in America to one of the things that I really like about small towns when I go to a small, like I was in Bozeman, Montana recently, there's only 35,000 residents, Bozeman, Montana. It's a great town and everybody drives a really nice, everybody's like fucking super chill.

Speaker 2:          01:43:03       Yeah. There's not that many people. People like real easy going, let everybody. And I realized like, what will your dealing with in Los Angeles, like I felt at the moment I got off the plane when I went from Montana to here. The moment you get here, you're like, hey gotta go gotta go cut this guy off. Get ahead. Get ahead of like there's a feeling in the air. And they did a study and one of the things that they did this study on was they put up cameras in cities and they measured the amount of footsteps that people take. Like how quickly they walk. And then they measured how, how many syllables people say in a minute, how quickly they talk. And through those two numbers, they were able to accurately estimate how many people lived in that city down to like a thousand. God, I love that stuff. Yeah, like

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       a shit load of people. People walk faster and they talk fast. If you have less people, they slow down. Well, Gail Collins, who is a connoisseur New York Times says that right wing and left wing people is, she goes, it's all about space. When you're, uh, when you're, you become more of a socialist when you have to contend with all your neighbors. So you live in a building and, and you, it requires cooperation. It requires waiting in line. It requires all these things. When you live in Bozeman, Montana and you have all that space, you can preach self reliance, you can sort of talk about the value of, you know, serenity, personal serenity, self reliance and all that stuff. So it does play a real factor in your psychology. It's like, yeah, no, go ahead. No, I was going to say Malcolm Gladwell in his book, he said, uh, blend, I think it was blink where you mentioned, um, when people would come to his office and if you mentioned Florida raisins and orange juice, people left the room a lot slower.

Speaker 1:          01:44:51       Do you know why? Why? Because they thought of old people and retirement. Whoa. And so it played a factor in their gate. They left, they left the fucking all lesson spy walked down the aisle where they walked down the hallway more measured because they, they, you put the idea of an old person in their brain. Well, that's what I was going to say is this is where the role of colleges are very interesting because college is sort of throw a monkey wrench into that because college is take a small town and turn it very liberal, which ordinarily would not be that way. You're dealing with small rural environments. You usually deal with conservative populations that are Christian and you know they're in the fucking, you know, Republicans sort of ideas. There's also something else about liberal towns. They're little small liberal towns like you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:45:39       I don't think they turn them liberal. What they really do is they take away any existential threat. For the most part, they make those towns super safe. There are a lot of rules that would penalize anybody, for example, young men for misbehaving by punching each other in the face or imposing their aggression on a weaker group of people. I think that's also what, how I characterize a liberal, small academic town. They are safe for the most part, safe environments for you to figure the world out and express yourself. Do you, do you know what I'm saying? But yeah, safe or like boulder is a good example. Exactly. Yeah. Bull blood sugar sort of, you know? Yeah, yeah. Well it's not, I wouldn't say low blood sugar because there's a lot of like fitness going on there. Boulders. One of the fittest towns in the world per capita, like a lot of people have low body fat. They're hiking all the time looking people and they're in a fantastic environment like as far as like the, the, the natural beauty of the land around them and they take advantage of it. They're always hiking and biking and shit, but you don't have to worry about things like, you know, like my friend who grew up in the hood said that he would, he knew, he knew when something was about

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       to happen and I said, what do you mean? He said, the air changed and your friends might be an idiot. No, no, no. He said, he said he's no, he said, he said, because what happens is it all fairness, a lot of your friends are idiots. No, no. He, he, he grew up in the hood and he said he had a lot of his friends can't guy black guy hit a lot of his friends killed. And he said, what I would notice and everybody would notice is that when the shoot I was about to happen or a fight was about the breakout, he said there was almost like this, like whatever it was imagined or not, there would be this calm before the storm, the air would change, things would settle and then boom, something would happen. And he said everybody felt that. And he said, cause we were talking about how my friend walked through the Savannah with his wife who grew up in Kenya and his wife knew everything about it.

Speaker 2:          01:47:33       She was like, don't worry about the lions. She knew everything. She knew animal behavior until she saw what animal, what guess hyenas. Nope people, nope. Monkeys. Water Buffalo. Ooh. And she looked at her husband, he said, climb that tree right fucking now. And he said, I knew when she told me to climb the tree cause there were lions. And she said, don't worry, when she's had climbed the tree, I climbed that fucking tree because it was a water buffalo. She knew her environment and just like he, he would walk through the hood and he was safe. He knew it, he knew how to navigate, but he also knew when something was about to happen. There's a great Jim shockey show, Jim shockey's, this really famous conservationist and big game hunter from Canada. Really interesting guy, but he's got this great show called uncharted. And, uh, it's kind of a hunting show, but not really.

Speaker 2:          01:48:16       It's more of an exploration of culture because he travels to all these different countries and he really gets deeply embedded in their country and in their culture. And it goes to these strange lands in the middle of nowhere in Russia and or in Soviet Union were former. So, um, and uh, he, he spent a lot of time in Africa as well. Like he's done a bunch of shows in Africa. Like, uh, they actually brought him in to kill crocodiles that were killing people in this village and the people in the village, man, it was fucking horrific. You would you would, they would go through this village with cameras and people would be showing like, this guy's missing an arm. This guy is missing a leg. This guy has a bite taken out of his head. Like everyone, all these p, everyone knew the water down there.

Speaker 2:          01:48:59       Everybody knew it while they were there, while they were there filming this, a woman got taken away by a crocodile while. I mean, it's just a constant, God terrifying and they were not scared of anything. Like they were scared of buffaloes. Those fucking Cape Buffalos Water Buffalos they're like these God damn things. He's grass eating monsters because they have to fight lines all the time. So they're just there. They fuck. And they fight lions off and they're just jack to the tits. I mean, if you look at it and be like, what does that thing eating? It must be eating like steroids and they weighed 300 pounds on the fucking enormous. They're enormous. They're huge. Lion Lions are the biggest assholes because they'll eat their balls while they're on them. They take that to go to the ball. First thing they need is their balls and their Dick.

Speaker 2:          01:49:40       Really? Yup. Cause they're behind him. So he got one on your back and then they're like, hmm, I'll go for the ball. Well it's probably easy to tear a loose. Right. That's good. Good Bite. Good all. It sucks being a water polo sucks being aligned to man. Fuck that. Running around killing shit with your face all day. That's all you can do. You don't have a store. You know, nature is fucking fucked. Fuck. Human beings have always, it's been a constant war against nature actually. It's always been, how do you harness nature and changed if it pretty much every animal that exists, every animal that exists, even lions are in a constant war with other lions. Constant. Like their reign of terror is so fucking insanely brief. They've got a couple of years where they run the pride and then some new line comes along and kills them. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:50:27       Even like great bites them so fucked up that they have there. They're forced to leave even great whites, great whites. They played. Uh, they had this guy, uh, Paul de gelder did our podcast fighter and kid, and he, uh, he ended up losing his arm and his hand in his leg to a bull shark in Sydney Bay in Sydney back. He goes to punch the sharks. Sharks are brutal. Yeah. He goes to punch the shark and he goes, oh, I don't have a hand left and then almost died and all that. But, um, he was saying having his arm, nosy or prestige, it's amazing prosthesis, which can close. And it was a carbon fiber one, I think. So it's like $90,000. Whoa. And, uh, and, but he was at Australian Navy Seal Jack Dude, you know, like a handsome guy and just, you know, there, he was lost his arm and leg.

Speaker 2:          01:51:08       But, um, he was talking about how um, uh, they played, they had, there was an area where at least great whites, I guess, bull sharks and stuff. And they played the sound of orchids. They played the sound of what they make when they're hunting. Oh Geez. And they said that fucking sharks didn't come near that area for six months. They were just like, say I'm Outta here. And then what hunts them us. We fuck up the orchids. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's a constant battle and it always has been. And I always wonder like, it's that battle. I mean, it's sort of necessary. It seems like with the natural world. I mean obviously we're striving towards some higher state of existence. Everyone is, I mean, I think that's where Buddhist come from and meditation comes from and veganism comes from and that doesn't have a central nervous shooter, Utopian ideologies and all these thoughts about what we're trying to do is whether misguided or not, we're, we're trying to strive towards improvement.

Speaker 2:          01:52:11       And when the, and that is the state of life and it's also the state of nature. There's, there has to be some sort of a balance of power with, with animals that are herbivores and animals that are carnivores. Like they're talking about bringing in cougars on the east coast of the United States to deal with it because you have too many deer. Yeah. They have too many deer, you know, and um, it's a really fascinating subject because it's a better idea than bringing in wolves. Well, they're very hard to, they tend to be wholesale with their slaughter. Not only that, they, a lot of fun killing. They liked the fun kill. Yeah. They, they do what they call surplus hunting. That video I showed you where I shot that deer in London, England, here in London. I had an hour and a half an hour outside of London. You're hunting in someone's yard.

Speaker 2:          01:53:00       Well, my buddy owns this giant. My buddy, you know, he made a lot of money. He said, I said, where's your property? And he goes, well, can you see down there? I go, I look. He goes, and can you look that way? And basically as far as I looked at it was all his, and he said, by law he needs to kill 21 deer a year on his property because the deer are such a problem, you know, because there are no natural predators. As another thing they, they found out today, there's an article today, there was always these, um, these myths about mountain lions being loose in England, in the countryside. Yeah. It turns out it's true. It turns out it came from a zoo that just admitted recently that they released these pumas. Wow. They released these fucking mountain lions they had in captivity so that people hit like their, you know, they'd been ridiculed like, oh, someone took away a big cat took away my sheep was motherfuckers drinking.

Speaker 2:          01:53:50       No, they, they were telling the truth. These fucking mountain lions were released in the 1980s. That's amazing. The countryside in England. Damn. Yeah. Just fucking crazy. Yas Iv and all that forest. Well, if as long as it, here it goes, the beasts of Dartmore does high saying dark, more mystery solved as zoo admits. It released pumas into the wild in the 1980s. So it was one that was one of those things. I think it was on that show monster quest where they were trying to puting Raul's looking at, oh this amazing man. They're amazing. And you know, my, my buddy has a 70 pound or 75 pound German shepherd, like a bite train that, you know, it's a complete badass dog. And I was looking at it and if you look at the size of that thing's headed, maybe 75 pounds doesn't look like much good luck fight.

Speaker 2:          01:54:34       And that thing off. I've, I've seen that thing hit a sleeve and it's, it's horrific how powerful their mountain lions get up to what 150 pounds they can get bigger than, than twice that size. It's rare, but I'll also, their cats and cats are just way more agile. I've got a great story about mountain lions. A friend of mine is a, um, a guide, an elk hunting guide in Colorado and he said that they found these tracks of this mount line. They have to kill a certain amount of mountain lions. And their property because they have this gigantic ranch and you know, they just, they, they have a certain amount of tags that they have to fill or that they should feel. And um, so you know, they try to control the populations of mountain lions. So they were trying to find this mountain line attracting, tracking this mountain lion attract these tracks.

Speaker 2:          01:55:17       And they saw elk tracks and they saw a mountain lion tracks and then they saw only elk tracks. Oh. Because the mountain lion had jumped on the back of this fucking gigantic 900 pound bull elk and rode it for 150 yards and then taking it down. So this hundred and 50 pound cat, they wound up killing had killed this, you know, close to a thousand pound l is unreal man. But when they found it, the fucking mountain line was on the elk and the elk was down and then, you know, they followed the tracks of this elk running with this cat on its back. I think just leaped. I met, imagine being something like a person, you know, you weigh 170 pounds. Yeah. Like, like a cat, a cat toy, and you just decide, oh, I'm going to jump on that thousand pound horse and kill it with my face. And their canines have sensors apparently where they can sense where the juggler is.

Speaker 2:          01:56:13       They keep adjusting their grip. Oh God. Good God. What's nature man? Nature's just so creepy and it's ways of adjusting to life. My friend and dress Antonopoulos, uh, my, my friend, the bitcoin expert, explain this to me. Last weekend in Vegas, ducks have three foot long dicks that curl and twist because the, the female vaginas have adapted to fight off rape, duck rape. So they have these pussies that are the, these fucking labyrinth, this, these twisty turny a labyrinth, pussies. And they can choose to let sperm in or not let sperm in with their gigantic labyrinth, pussies. And these three foot long duck dicks, when you see a duck's Dick, you let con that is not real. Look at that ducks Dick. That's a drawing. That's a drawing. But there's actual photograph that's an actual photograph of a duck. Dick. What in the fuck? That's like a person, but like a 15 foot long dick. Yeah. Ducks are tiny man horse to dick. Like a person with a three foot dick is a monster. But a duck with a three foot long dick is totally standard as a deck. That's a limp. One guy's a little little deck. He gets shamed by the other ducks. Poor guy. Yeah. I mean, duck ducks are ridiculous. They're, it's a fucking ridiculous animal.

Speaker 2:          01:57:39       I knew the ducks engaged in rape, gang rape. Oh, that's all they do. That's the only one that hung up on one. Look how, look how the female's vagina has sort of adapted to deal with the male raping. You know, created these bizarre pathways in their pussies. Wait, when you, when you listened to Dan Carlin's a wrath of the cons are you read history, you know, and it was always, here we come, we're knocking down your walls when we're selling everybody into slavery. History is a, is a, is history of rape, right? So most women basically we'll, I got shit. Laws are coming down. We're about to, our men are going to be killed and we're going to be, we're going to be raped. I mean it's just happened over and over and over. I would imagine that most of history is a story like that.

Speaker 2:          01:58:21       And women were basically just forced to be taken by, you know, either group of men or whatever, just like most of animal has. Yeah. Yeah. It's really, really, it's just brutal. It's really interesting how, how, I guess women had to adapt and evolve and, and, and this woman wrote an article and I came her name cause it was pretty controversial and she said that because you know, so much of history, women had no choice and they were forced upon by men. Uh, one of two things happen. First they had to find the man who was the most aggressive and strong and who could protect them from the other men. So for women to be attracted to aggression and strength is not so uncommon. But the other really controversial thing she said was that there are cases where women are turned on by aggressive sex, you know, being held down and all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:59:17       And it's probably the fact that they had to evolve because otherwise they'd get injured if they didn't get lubricated. You know, it's kind of like, I, I read that, I was like, well, good luck with that. But that was, you know, she was a female anthropologist. I can't remember if fucking name, but I was like, well, only that if can imagine coming out with that article. And, and that's my, this is my thesis for a in anthropology and amherst college, everybody. And it's a very objective thought process. I mean there's, there's evolution. It's just an illusion. Well, it's called evolving, you know, in dealing with aggression the way the ducks did well, and also dealing with the natural world that you find yourself in, which is just filled with danger and murder and constant warfare. I mean, that's, that's what people did. That's all people do.

Speaker 2:          01:59:58       I mean, there was states of peace interrupted by war and it states a piece, I mean gingiss con kill in his, his children and his armies killed 10% of the population of the world during his lifetime. There is a New York Times article they wrote where they were saying that he altered the carbon footprint of human beings on earth, a measurable altering of the carbon footprint because they had killed so many people. Like you could measure the difference in the amount of people that were there before him and after him. By core samples. Yeah. Like, well, you know, I mean Hitler did something similar in the Russian countryside. He killed entire villages because he was trying to clear an area for, you know, sort of the migration of the German peoples and the idea that, you know, let's get rid of these sort of people that think and talk differently and let's create a, a utopia.

Speaker 2:          02:00:52       We'll what gingiss topcon did that was so fucked up as he did it all before there was even guns. Yeah. I mean there's doing bows and arrows. They killed [inaudible] hand somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 to 70 million people while he was alive. Well, he said, I think that what he said was really neat. I never forgot. He said there were, the Romans would create a wasteland and call it peace and to an extent the, you know, the, the con, the Gaviscon did the same thing. Well, not only that, what's interesting is how history looks at them now. And that's one of the things that Dan Carlin was talking about. Colin was talking about how people tend to look in the future. They'll look at, and he was actually using it in, in, in terms of like, would people do this with the Nazis that they would, when enough

Speaker 1:          02:01:39       time has passed, you can say, well, he cleared the road for trade to the east. Yeah, yeah. You know, what was the, what was the silver lining in, in massive genocide. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that very controversial, but of course with everything it would, it goes back to exactly what we were talking about. Where, where when you come up in the ghetto, you might just create miles Davis. I mean there's a lot of heartache and terrible things and from shit is the brightest flower, that kind of stuff. And once there's enough time passed, then you can sort of look at it with this distance and you can kind of objectively look at it and go, well, you know, here's the benefit of that. Here's the silver lining. Where that doesn't really hold up though is if you look at where the bulk of innovation and uh, our artistic expression on a high level came out of it came out of free societies.

Speaker 1:          02:02:27       I mean, look at what Sparta left behind, nothing. And look at what Athens left behind. Look at Sparta lift behind a deep history of warriors. Mythologize but nothing, you can really hang your hat on. Another words, story and, and I talk about hardship and separating the child from his mother and all that stuff. But you're Ron Butler, 300 and kicking people into wells. But yes, it, it, it's, there's a, there's a mythology that, a warrior ethos that you can, you know, kind of, I'm a spartan, but, but Athens, the Acropolis and the writings of all the bug cracking and philosophy, the butt fucking, uh, the idea of demos that democracy at Demos, the people, these are, these are ideas that still live on and were built upon. You know, uh, look at, look at in today's world, the amount of innovation that's coming out of a peaceful society and a society that respects other peoples' ideas and a society that for the most part, um, at least from a historical perspective, gives a great deal of freedom and a benefit to those that have the guts to come up with their own ideas.

Speaker 1:          02:03:32       Well, that's the interesting aspect about what the United States is as this experiment in self government and what it is, what it started off as. What it is currently is that this is the most recent of countries. And it's also the one that has overwhelmingly the most innovation, the most artistic, uh, the contributions, the pioneers. There's so much that comes out of here. So, in terms of comedy film, I mean obviously the rest of the world has its contributions. I'm not saying that United States is the best. I mean the Beatles came out of England. There's a lot of amazing works of art that come out of all over the world. But this country is a hotbed of artistic expression by far, by far and away the biggest, and it's the most recent now, the oldest country that we know of, the cradle of civilization is the Middle East, Iraq, and that, those are the townies of the world.

Speaker 1:          02:04:28       This is, this is the thought that I've been bounced around for a long time. Like this is the reason why those places are so fucked up is cause there's the echoes of savages. The echoes of these ancient people are still in this area. It's so difficult. Like you got to get out of the fucking town, man. You got to leave the town. Well was he the great tragedy is that the, you know, and they've done a lot of studies on why do some nations, why does some nations fail and why does some nations, uh, become prosperous? And you can break it down into a number of things. You can see the problem with the Middle East for a thousand reasons. We can, again, two and a lot of it was just a foreign invasion and, and foreign meddling and stuff like that. But how about getting his con yes.

Speaker 1:          02:05:08       I mean, did what he did to bag that in 1260, you know, they say that to this day Baghdad maybe still hasn't recovered from them invading and killed. They said that the rivers ran red with blood and ink black ink, like all the amazing works, like viber is burned and everything Islamic scholars throughout history were like innovators. They were like the huge contributions math philosophy course. And, and, and there are a lot of people say that the Middle East has never even recovered, has never quite recovered from that. But you know, there are so many important things for why a nation, you know, for example, one is that your political parties that lose live to see another day. That is very important when you lose an election and a lot of countries like the hard liners, and somebody said to me, I said, why are the hard liners in Iran such a pain in the ass?

Speaker 1:          02:06:00       He goes, because if they lose, they will die. That's a very important thing to keep in mind. So when you have power and your survival depends on holding onto power, you're going to have a secret police that basically it's pretty brutal when when they sniff any kind of insurrection. This country is pretty amazing. What's so unique about the United States is after the revolutionary war, after every revolutionary war, the country always breaks into civil war always. And the founding fathers had incredible restraint and wisdom to, to allow the election after that war to go as it would, they didn't resort to violence. That's so unique in history, but our country and the UK and Australia and Canada and a couple other countries when you lose is that democracy is built on the idea that when your political party loses you, you lived to see another day and fight on very important.

Speaker 1:          02:06:53       The other is property rights. You'll need property rights. The other is courts. That means something and the other is the scientific method. You have to embrace the scientific method. A society has to say that it's not about superstition. This is not a theology. Let's, let's base reality on what you can measure and what you can see that those things are so fucking important. If you don't have those, those central principles as a through line, if that's not the scaffolding of your society, you're not going to do, you're just not going to do as well as a country like the United States. You're not going to have people that innovate because there's no fucking incentive. There's no incentive in it. You're not going to benefit from it. You could get it stolen

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       or you could be killed because you think differently or all those things will also, you're not safe enough to innovate. Yeah. You don't have the ability to express yourself. You don't have the ability to take chances. Yeah. So the irony, the ironic thing is when you're sensitive and nice to people, when you're empathetic and when you're respectful of other people, even the ones you don't have this you disagree with, you make a stronger society. The society is stronger in every way, including militarily, including you have more innovation with militant, with, with, with weaponry. And on that note, God, I'm smart guys. Did you write that shit down? Amazing. You want to hear more? You have your own podcast. I got more out unpack. And by the way, I'm taking that podcast and the road with a guy named Brendan Schaub. Oh, that's a different podcast. Oh No, this is, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:08:18       Yeah. But let's talk about the fight and the kid for a second. Cause Brennan Brennan will beat me up if I don't talk about this. July 29th July till he hits me, he strikes me with an open hand. Ah, he pulls my pants down and spanks me and you know, he could and I couldn't do anything about it. And I've tried. I've tried to find him and it bothers me cause sometimes I get jumpy with them. I get jumpy and I'll get under hooks on them. And a giant, no, no, no, he's, he's weird. He's weird. Shiny. He I tried, I said kind of tiny dude. Don't use that word. Just say medium. All right. Just say me kind of medium, I guess. I said the other day, I said, I don't believe you could. I don't believe if we were to go take them for a take down. And I tried to do a little upper body Greco with them.

Speaker 2:          02:08:54       Yeah. And it didn't go well and I got so flustered and hurt Mike actually tweak my neck that I left my wallet and my phone on my fucking car. I let him, he drove off Brendan's brother drive my car and I yeah. And Smash your phone. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I have blue been talking about that recently, that I think that people have a massive owes overestimation massive of what they can and can't do with their body. And it's we, we, we hang around for any shop, hang around, Brennan Shop, forget bearing to shop. We played this video of these people that put on these gigantic balloon suits and let bowls hit them. What? You haven't seen this? Well, we'll end on this. It's fucking insane that these people, I want to say this, but I think people have this idea in their head that all the bolts come in.

Speaker 2:          02:09:37       I'm going to be fine. I just fucking get out of the way. You don't realize like they have, they massively overestimate what they can and can't do with their body, how they move their body. I got to see this, by the way, while we're watching this, July 29th 30th Phoenix stand up live. We're there. We still have some tickets left. Live fighter and the kid podcast show. It's a show. Me and Brendan Schaub Brennan shall be doing new standup. I'm very excited to watch this. So these assholes look at this. No. Yeah, the legs like say goodbye to your acl. Look at this, watch this. Boom, boom. Oh leak. I mean, these are massive, massive animals. Bulls are so mean. And meanwhile they just eat grass. He looks like he's not hurt. I wonder if bulls, it'd be nicer if they had a stake wait for it. Yeah, because he gets worse.

Speaker 2:          02:10:24       Like this guy, he's like, oh Jeez man, this is good. This is just, just started. Meanwhile, people are laughing. This is what people in rural environments do. They laugh, they low my hands and I would never do that fucking hair. That guy got the air. That gentleman got Lord. Yeah. That guy is fuck. And he hit him again while he's out cold.
