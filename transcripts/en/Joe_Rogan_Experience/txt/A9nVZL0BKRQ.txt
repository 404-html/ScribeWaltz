Speaker 2:          00:01:03       [inaudible] listen to that music.

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       I have like an extra echo in there. Are you sampling your own shit? I'm just fucking around with the mixer. Oh, is that what you did? Did you go DJ on us right there? Did you go straight Russell Peters on a bitch but test low or whatever his name is. You'd like to a class once at a community college. You're trying to put that to good use. I know. Who was the guy that he ate a Tesla guys. That huge guy. The guy who was of no, what is that guy's name? Stoats. Yesto. Yeah. Ts though. I was trying to explain him to Mrs Rogan. The end of the day. We were driving down the highway and there was this big billboard for this ts tow guy and really that billboard. Oh Dude, I don't think you and I haven't any idea how big that guy is. I've looked online and watched his concerts where it's like him on a stage and he's got like a bunch of laptops and a bunch of musical equipment and he's like pumping his fist and there's a huge audience of people that are like dancing along to him.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       And I, I don't know how many big Djs are like that. We'd have to get Russell Peters back on to explain to us the whole world of deejaying because Russell doesn't like the guy cause he says that what he's basically doing is sort of like pressing play on all the computers and then waving his arm up. But you know, I, I've been listening to it because my friends are like set a lie and I've been listening to it and it's, you know, it's not bad. I know. Wait Russell saying, but it's all about like how you feel when you're listening to it. I'll take that any day over at [inaudible]. Oh shit man. I mean that they just crammed down her fucking ass is your friend that likes it. A girl or a guy? A girl, a girl. But I like that same kind of music, that kind of chillax music where you're just like, yeah, it's, it's um, what he's doing is interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       You know what I mean? It's, it's not d I understand where Russell saying, it's sort of like a guy going on stage in a statue, a sketch group on, on stage saying he's a standup comic and you're like, you know, it's still good. I mean, come on man. You can't deny it. Like some sketch shows like in living color or you know, some Saturday night live sketches, they're fucking brilliant. It's fun to watch. A lot of them suck. Like I'm not a fan of like sketch comedy because it's too much miss to the hit, you know? It's like a, for every really good sketch you get on senator didn't live. You have to endorse him. Bullshit. Yeah. I can't do it man. But, but Russell is saying this do just pretty much just pressing play. Like it gets all the music together beforehand or whatever he programs at all.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       But he's making it pretty bad ass if all these fucking, I mean, I know I'm not a fan of it. I never got into it. Maybe I could get into it if I really sat down and listen to it, but damn, he's got these fucking huge arenas filled with people jumping up and down whatever drug they're on or not. You know what it was on. If it's an x to see situation Molly, yeah, whatever. Or maybe not. Maybe it's just they're having a good time, but you know, I don't, I don't know, but whatever it is for them, it's fucking awesome. You can tell that that music for them, it might not click for you or me, but he can't say sucks. You know? And Russell just says he sucks sorta because he's not really a Dj like Russell's at Dj. Like Russell, like remember when Russell was over and he picked up this fucking beat that like a secondary beat in the back of a song like you said?

Speaker 1:          00:04:04       No, they're also sampling like salt and pepper right here. And we were like, what? Like play that back again. We had to play it like three or four times and still we were like an uneducated, a morons trying to like test wine with a Somalia. You know what I'm saying? Well I would, I would see, I don't even consider Tashi or tests or whatever. The guy's Tsl. Yes. Though I don't even consider him a DJ. I just music of electronic music producer. That's a good, yeah, you're right. I know a few djs but I've never heard of this guy. And you said you've seen a billboard like Dane Cook of Dj even bigger than Dane was when Damien isn't, it was in his prime. This guy is [inaudible] nationwide or worldwide rather. He's huge all over Europe. He's huge. This guy does like 50,000 seat arenas where people are out there like pumping their fists and he's fucking playing records.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       I mean there's one thing if the music's good, but I mean there's art to being a Dj about mixing the stuff right there when you're on stage being in that moment. But if you're just sitting there pushing play fucked up. Well, I think a lot of people are looking for cool shit to do when you're fucked up on drugs and when it comes to cool shit to do and you're fucked up on drugs, this guy's need device to go sweat like a laser show. I tuned, if you're on ecstasy and you'd go to one of his shows, first of all, you're going to be sure there's going to be a lot of other people on ecstasy to, yeah, I mean, it's electronic music and everyone's dancing and everyone's drinking. Come on, there's going to be ecstasy everywhere. So if that's the case, you know, this guy is really providing this fucking cool symbiotic service with people that are tripping on an ecstasy he make. He creates the full experience. You know, you know that you're going to, he's going to draw them all and they're all going to come to him because they know what he does. And then you, so you're going to have your likeminded people there that are going to want to meet up at the [inaudible] concert and then a everybody just fucking dances and he puts on a show. And, and you're blitzed out of your fucking head and you know it's going to last for four hours. Perfect. So He's like the Dane Cook of Djs where he,

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       he's mixing songs and it just really get that extra punch. He just does a leg kick or something. He goes home at the end of every show and emails. He does that. He goes home and emails. Everybody who came to his show, there's a new sample. Yeah. Dane would really do that, you know? Yeah. He's a machine. Dean is, he's a phene as far as like emailing people. It's really fun. But I mean it's, the guy did it, you know, the way he did it and it worked. There's no, no one else has ever become famous from the instrument the way. Dang cooked it. It was really, truly spectacular. You know what he, what he did like his comedy or not what he did as far as like the marketing himself was fucking genius. Dane had some good bits over the year. Dangerous. You know, I like Dane.

Speaker 3:          00:06:42       He's not a bad dude. He's just, he, he lost his way a little bit there in the, the great tide of wanting to be famous and wanting to be a big comedian, you know. But I think he's paid for it. You know, think he's paid his latest album, his, his blues stuff. I guess what uh, what's it called where he was like raw on stage and it was just filmed one take called an intimate evening or something. The whole shit. The whole Bon Jovi, the whole episode was filmed one Katie went, went that's, I love that shit. Yeah that was great. Even though it was good. It was good. It was good stuff, you know. And that was sort of like a retribution thing for him. You know, he hasn't done standup in a long time. I ran into him at the warriors from here. Let me just name drop real quick cause you know I've been to like four. I haven't had a formal, your true, isn't it 20 fucking years I've lived out here, but my friend was in Brian Cowan who was here yesterday, was in warrior and I saw, I met them. There. Is that that came out warriors. Yeah, it was it good. Yeah, it was pretty good. But anyway, Dan said when I met him there that he hadn't done standup in six months. Good grief. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:07:48       I saw him when he was working on that blue, the blue stuff. Was that what this album was about? All that kind of rocks? I didn't like it. You didn't? Yeah. I mean he's one of those guys that I think I heard his standup first back when he was like on top of the world and I was like, Nah, I don't, I don't really know. And then I saw him live and I was like, oh I get it. I see why people love this. And then I went back and heard the bits and it was great. But having never heard him or, or, or, or uh, seen him live. I don't know how people can understand his jokes cause cause he's

Speaker 3:          00:08:16       so fricking physical. Yeah. Some of it is a, it's hard, but some of the earlier stuff wasn't nearly as physical. Like, so there was some stuff, I've heard his stuff on like Sirius satellite radio and it translates. Yeah. Okay. I mean I just, different beds. Yeah. You know, for a while he was getting like super crazy physical with shit, but he's also doing 15,000 fucking scene of arenas. Yeah. You gotta go, you gotta get big. But this was at like an improv where you know, there's, there were like 150 people. Yeah. Who preparing for it. He does those theaters in the round two, which is interesting. I've only done that a couple of times. I did like the stage spins I did in Phoenix. Um, celebrity theatre. Yeah. I've done it twice in Phoenix and Phoenix is, it's

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       interesting because, uh, that celebrity theater is as big circle and that's where Kat Williams got in trouble. That dude where you know, the, he was, the guy was like fuck America. And he was like, Fuck America Sarah. Remember that, that whole thing. And everybody was mad at him for telling this Mexican guy that how great America was and shit.

Speaker 5:          00:09:15       Who's heckling stories when he goes to cities? We're just an Ontario doing comedy and be like, one guy guy's like, oh he won't. He pulled a gun on him and the other guy is like, oh no, that's not true. What the fuck are you saying? Have we had a cross reference? We had to bring people in together. Did Clark, who's the guy who runs a place? I go, did Kat Williams put a gun on you? And he's like, no, we'd put a gun on me. Like it got crazy. And then like, and then we had to go back to the first time. Oh, that's what I heard. I go, he can't just scope saying a guy pulled a gun on how my man cat man, just going around [inaudible] I want to hear the stories I haven't heard yet from like Dayton, Ohio, where he fucking, you know, ate a guy's ass out or something. Boy, Brian Cowen making stuff up now. He's silly. Fuck no, but there has to be stories that just never made it in a TMZ that was in the weed store that was in the weed store once, and Cat Williams assistant came in and she announced herself. So I'm Kat Williams, I'm Kat Williams assistant. I'm here to pick up his weed. She was getting weed for Kevin. Welcome to America. Welcome to California where your assistant can go to a, we chop and just announce hello. And you go in there, you announce yourself properly.

Speaker 5:          00:10:25       This

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       girl. So yeah, it was interesting. But anyway, that's theater in the round. That's a, that's a smaller place. The one where cat was that I've been at that place, it's like 2,500 seats. Dane's doing that shit with, it's like 18,000 people. Same goal. Like what is that? That's so bizarre. People eat that shit up, but it's like really? It's so cultive personality when it, when it was really hitting what people didn't like about it. What a lot of comics who were upset about the true reason is that he had packed somehow another tapped into this boy band thing. So he hit this boy band energy with common, like this big boy band energy like no one had ever done before. Like backstreet boys shit, where girls would go and fucking scream to meet Dane Cook and he hit that somehow or another. He tuned into that frequency for a little while and I don't know how the fuck he did it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       He just, you know, he just was the perfect energy and the perfect planning mean you've got to give the guys is his props for figuring that all out. But that's what bothered comedians because they knew that there was just like boy band thing going on. It's almost gimmicky. Yeah. Without it being gimmicky, she did it all himself. It's not like, you know, Dick Clark productions put together some comedian and taught them how to dress and then foisted a month to the American public. Like what happens with a lot of music acts, you know, they construct them. You know, I mean it's, it's funny how it's so open in the music community. You know, like our friend Eddie Bravo has had a whole bunch of looks throughout his life, music career with his long hair or whether it's, you know, it's, it's funny how like people like in the music industry it's like, you know, this is our band and we only wear leather when we take pictures. You know, it's like the, the idea of like projecting an image, you know, it's very much just accepted.

Speaker 3:          00:12:08       It's funny how a lot of them overused the same looks cause they all use the same photographers to make like, like album covers. Like a lot of them are all similar. So like I was looking at some like just an unknown bands recently and I was looking at their, their, their promo shots, like their headshots and they're all like sitting in like window sills, like outside of factories. Like looking off at each other backwards and like the one singing that's looking down at his shoes.

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       Yeah. He's on the railroad tracks. How many fucking people who are supposed to be moody of taking pictures by the railroad trucks, you know, like Chaz Christ. We get it. Yeah. You're just going to get on that train and ride out of nowhere. You're just going to disappear on us. You're such a crazy rebel at any moment. You're going to light a cigarette, take a puff and hop on the train, man.

Speaker 3:          00:12:52       Yeah, those album covers, dude, you could, you could put a hold blog site together. Just every asshole has ever done that. Why? You're looking away and all that. Sending in window sills.

Speaker 1:          00:13:01       Guess what? The dude who's kneeling in the front, he does not want to be kneeling. He wants to be standing up just like the singer, but the singer's is not going to think I show you the one who stands up and talks. You're the tambourine player man. So tamarind players got to take this like gangster slouch people, I'm going to take me seriously in this band unless I get down and if you're a tambourine player, you have to have like thumb rings and Shit. You have to work, brings in your thoughts. You have to be extra cool. You know those banjo players that have like a little pick on every finger. You ever see that? That's what they do every, they have claws like damn talents. Yeah. They have those weird ones that like the connect to their fingertips, like metal kitty cat claws and they all, they all have that piercing from the belly button that goes down to it, like their nipples and stuff. For a lot of musicians, it really is like trying to get you to notice them. There's like four other guys on stage sweating it out. I'm just standing here with this fucking base. Yeah. I need something shiny. They figured kiss, figured it out the best. Just have a whole fucking character show, have a show, you know everyone's wearing makeup. You're blown firing into the crowd.

Speaker 3:          00:14:11       Yeah. It's the same makeup too. It's not like a mixture. I mean pretty much it's just black and white and I can't tell the difference of who they are, what their, their makeup on.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       I've been to a lot of concerts in my life. The greatest concert I've ever been to ever was a kiss concert. I've been to a bunch of kiss concerts because my uncle used to work for kiss in the early seventies so I was, yeah, I was a little kid. I was like, fuck. I was like maybe six years old the first time I met ace freely. Was this like your first concert or you're like just the best concert and it just happened to be when you were five or six years old? Well, no, just you know those and then I saw them again with Kevin James. Kevin James is a big kiss freak too. And he and I went to see them two nights in a, in the 90s when they made that comeback tour. Yeah. Here's before neither one of us, you know, I think maybe I've just gotten on news radio and Kevin, you know, nobody knew who Kevin was yet.

Speaker 1:          00:15:00       And uh, we went to see kiss to ninth and a fucking row. We went to see it. It was awesome. It's good. It's fun to see a band like consecutively like that and change up the show. They came back to, this is the real kiss. It was like Peter Criss and ace freely with them, which had never happened. But we like for years they did like the band had broken up and there was this Vinny Vincent Guy and his other, a bunch of other guys that came in. But essentially the, the only two guys that was constant where Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley and then this was like the big tour and having him back again, it was just so fun. It's like, it's so much, there's so much involved as like nostalgia cause he songs that like, you know, they're singing songs from Detroit, rock city, this thing had songs from like 40 fucking years ago or whatever it was, you know, that the time 30 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:15:45       And they're still, they're not fat yet. They're still wearing makeup and their dance read like they look like they're still their characters. It's where it works, you know, they're really still can put on a fucking good show. So there's, so it was so much involved and how they all died in that plane crash. What Gene Simmons is getting married, if you've seen that shit. Yeah. Yeah. How long was he with his, uh, it was going to be his wife of 28 years or something. Crazy. Lindsay Lohan is going to be in playboy for $1 million. Who pays for this? You, it should be just like, dude. So we need to say them aside and be like, look, no one cares about that at all. This is sort of, I don't think you're right though. I think this is sort of the model that he's based his entire career on.

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       It's like do something sensational woman. No, won't see a broken woman. Everybody wants the American woman's ass hole. She's naked. Yeah. If I can just see her asshole. Just the, just the hint of it in the distance, but mostly concentrate on the vagina. Even if the vagina lips are closed, which I, except with playboy, you have to accept. You have to accept they won't get all gynecological. I would take Brittany, Brittany's asshole Britney Spears over Lindsay and I would like to see Lindsay Lohan photograph drunk. That's what I want to say. I want to see real drunk, not fake drunk, real drunk. And when she goes to the real, yeah, no, I'd be really interested in those photos. I'd really interested if you could get photos of her in her element. Obviously. Look, I have nothing against Lindsay Lohan. Okay. She seems like a girl who's just looking to have fun.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       She seems a girl who, yeah, maybe she's partying a little bit, but you know what? Guess what? It probably wasn't too fucking easy growing up on the Mickey Mouse Club and being in the limelight when you were a child and all your developmental years and with your parents, people would take it fucking photos of your all the time. Your Dad's fucking nuts to me. Totally say the girls just having a good time. I want to see if she's going to take pictures naked. It should be watching as having a good time, which the ankle bracelet. She get high, she should get high. She should do a bump. Drink a couple of shots, you know, and then show me your pussy. Let's see what's up. Those, those should be the pictures, the Lindsay Lohan pictures that we get. I don't want to see that airbrush cropped

Speaker 5:          00:17:49       out bullshit where she's pretending to get on a fucking Polo Pony. [inaudible] hanging out of her pants. But this is, I mean, obviously a total PR moves, so people who are kind of managing the PR, this won't ever let that happen and that's disappointing. Yeah, those dummies, they don't know what they're doing. They're doing it the wrong way. What they should do is embrace it. You know what? He should embrace what you are. That's what brought you to the dance. Lindsay. Little hands is nothing wrong with that girl. She's a freak. She's a freak. She's not hurting anybody. She's not out there clogging people's fucking eyes out. She's just getting fucked up. She's got millions of dollars. It was 24 years old. What do you want her to do? What do you want it to do? You want her to take yoga classes? We didn't want it to, not everybody's going to be fucking mother Theresa. You know this curly bad. She's just out there probably sucking in some decks, getting cooked up, getting fingered in the bathroom. She's fucking, she's putting it together. Yeah. It's called together an exciting little life. Join her twenties she never see. See, when I asked her if she wanted to Fart in Katy far cup, when I asked her, no, you asked her. You actually, you harassed her. What a piece of shit you are, Bro. No, no. Poor girl. It's pretty awesome.

Speaker 6:          00:18:55       Okay. You're going to like this if it works. And Brian, all right, here we go.

Speaker 5:          00:19:10       Hey Lindsey. Lindsey. Oh my God. Do you, have you ever farted in a cup and put it in the cat space just to see its reaction. What about what about puppy? That's not really true. You added all that shit. Ain't [inaudible]. You already told me how you did, but knucklehead joke for everybody. Everybody tried to pull it over my eyes and maybe watch a gag from four fucking years ago. That wasn't even real. It's real. [inaudible] tell you what he did. Ladies and gentlemen, he added his audio into the previous audio of Lindsay Lohan. This is a fucking fraud perpetrated on the American people. It's fine. It's fine. And it's funny, but you already did the bit on the podcast. No, but you did it to Joe. I was doing it to America. I knew disrespectful man. Yeah, he's fucking tried to trick me, man. The good thing is that people think that's real and now the really good thing is they don't know until you ruined it. I ruined it. I wanted to know what Lindsay Lohan thinks about that video. I think that would be hilarious to see stuff. She already asked me that. It's a stupid question she wants. We thought it was a stupid question. It's got 7,000 users a chance to, you seen it?

Speaker 5:          00:20:30       Yeah, man. That's everybody. That's a youtube is going to make you a partner. There's a fucking videos, some videos online. If you look at and you go, Whoa, how many? I finally started watching Zeitgeists. There's a new site guys to film that everybody tells you you have to watch. So I finally started it. I looked

Speaker 1:          00:20:47       down to views, 11 million views.

Speaker 4:          00:20:50       Right, and when was it uploaded? Do you know how fast that came? Good question because that stuff, I mean there's like a formula almost. I got a couple of buddies who are like youtube partners and they just, I mean it's ridiculous. Once people start subscribing to you, they'll just watch anything and they just throw up shit. It doesn't matter just because they need to put more content out there and you know that that part of it suffers, which sucks.

Speaker 1:          00:21:13       Dude is only a bloated in January of 2011 so I guess it's been around for, what is that, six months? February. March,

Speaker 4:          00:21:20       yeah, but when did you watch this? A couple of months ago. It's secret is black woman on toilet equals 38 million hit black Raymond on toilet? No. Was that the woman who was like smacking her lips and singing some crazy Dee Siggy type

Speaker 5:          00:21:39       black ones and this woman looks like she's got a Bandanna on her head and she's morbidly obese. I think she really is sitting on the toilet too, which is cool. It's not funny. Wow. This is, this is one of those things.

Speaker 4:          00:22:20       What about wiping a dirty bitch? I had a buddy who sent me that and I watched about 10 seconds of it when this chick's like trying too hard to be viral and I'm pissed that she became viral. Yeah. Read a lot of hydro, 38 million people married and she would have sped up her voice like times two that would have made 80 million hits. He has to do is setting up.

Speaker 1:          00:22:44       That's what you do. And if you were an alien and you were from another planet and you were evaluating Earth and whether or not the earthlink should be allowed to move forward, he would look at things like this and you would go, wait a minute, what the fuck? They'd probably wasted all their resources. Let's move on. I might get one of the real housewives of Beverly Hills checks to come on this podcast. This is Rogan is friends with one of them. I can't say until we, until she says yes. But that would be fascinating too, because it was another perfect example.

Speaker 4:          00:23:11       I need to be a watch that could show Joe. It's fucking, it's unsafe. Feeling uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       Yeah. And they, um, they're, it's real gross man. Did the, like the level of behavior, especially the Beverly hills one is real gross. They're just disgusting human beings. Yeah. These women are foul. I haven't seen this new season. Have you been watching it this season? I just watched one episode, the one that misses Rogan's friends in the, they are so fucking, yeah. These women are, they're ugly and doing drugs. Girl keeps running to the bathroom and doing drugs and she's coming out and they're, they're mean to this pretty girl and they're mean to this pretty girl for no reason. I mean, she doesn't do a damn thing and they think it's hilarious, but they're being mean to her. You know why? Because when you're a woman and if you're, you're an an unattractive woman and another woman is really attractive, all of the sudden it's like she stole something from you.

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       It's like she has this magical power just to have some fucking roll of the dice. And so they feel like it's okay to be contrary to them because the woman actually makes them feel like we're already at a deficit before the conversation. Even starts, they feel uncomfortable, so they don't feel bad about turning that uncomfortable feeling on the girl for no reason at all. Right. Just for the girl being pretty and it's, it's crazy to watch, man. It's crazy to watch these like really low level human beings, like low level thing catty. Yeah. It's worse than caddy. It's just worried about is who's fucking who and whose bag is who wearing and where do you get your shoes and low and they're monsters, man. They're just just retard monsters.

Speaker 4:          00:24:50       I watched all of last season and I don't know why, but oh I

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       did you feel like, did you see the guy committing suicide coming? Did you see that coming?

Speaker 4:          00:24:58       No, but he was a little weird. He was just kind of off and the way his wife would describe him, she was saying like, oh, he's a manly man and he's like a cowboy and he's just muscular and all this shit. And he just looks like a dude who sits in a cubicle. I mean, I know he didn't, but he looks like he's never been at the gym and his life. But you know, it wasn't like a fat tub of Shit, but he was just all right. And I was just like, this woman has blinders on,

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       you know? Yeah. Well, so I think some people, you know, they sit down, they go, well, how are you going to talk about me? Well, I'm going to say that

Speaker 5:          00:25:29       love wildlife. How are you going to talk about me? Well, I'm going to say that you're a manly man. Tell people, meet you. And they're like cowboy

Speaker 1:          00:25:37       pull balls down by the,

Speaker 4:          00:25:39       that wasn't even a plot point. And one of the episodes they were, they were like, wait, she described him as there's like, there's mainly cowboy and he's just like a balding piece of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       Yeah. You know what? The producers would probably smacking their lips.

Speaker 5:          00:25:51       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a good way to describe on the way to describe him. But I like to wait, we've met this guy. Make sure this gets to the year fast enough.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       If there's any words that slurry, just make her do it again. Do it again. That's called, she had like major, major botox. Dude, I don't think it's a botox. I think it's actually an implant.

Speaker 4:          00:26:11       Oh really? Well, she was constantly going in and getting more plastic surgery done.

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       Oh, jumps and stuff. And She just looks ridiculous. Yeah. They start fucking with her face man. And it's way better to look old and they look crazy and women don't want to accept that. But there's, I know women, they need to stop. I know women that have become monsters. I mean literally become monsters. I've seen them become monsters. I've seen them change from this very nice older woman, you know, it's just accepting the fact that she's entering her forties or 50s or whatever. And this just life, the cycle of life

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       for all of us. There's other things to concentrate other than that. And instead they just whacked her face out, man. I mean whack it out with like fillers. So their cheeks stick out. Right. And then they get, they get their noses change and their eyes pulled back. Well, the duck lips freaking the fuck out there. Like w w what are you doing? What is this? It's almost like people thought that because you were allowed to have duck lip, tits, those blah, that's fucking stupid tits. We not only like, they were encouraged like buck mom, nobody, nobody went, you know, you've ridiculous bitch. But if you go duck lips on the, on the lips, then we go get outta here. You can't go super balloons. You can go super balloons on the tits, but you can't go super balloons on the lips. People drew a line there.

Speaker 5:          00:27:30       They're like, this is creepy to tits. I can go with, it's past the point of being funny and it's just sad. Yeah. And ridiculous. But it's more disturbing. Like for whatever reason, fake breasts don't bother me nearly as much as fake lips. Fake breasts seem like, yeah, I see what you did there and you know you want him to bigger ones. Okay, cool. That's cool. But fake lips are like, whoa, Whoa, whoa. That's your fucking mouth man. You know, like you're, you're, you're, you're jabbing some shit into where you sit and eat to change the shape event. Do you look at the before and afters? Is anybody looked better with that shit? Especially the eyebrows when they started fucking with the eyebrows too. Like people that shaped who much also. And then there's people that get those teammates. At least your eyebrows grow back. That doesn't bother me.

Speaker 5:          00:28:11       But the tattoos. Have you seen the tattoos? Cat eyes and eyebrows. I, I'd rather not do permanent makeup too with a tattoo. Like eye shadow on shit like that. I don't like that Shit's weird. Like a clown person. That's a commitment man. Who's got bits about the tattoo on your face? It doesn't. One of our friends have a bit about tattoo on your face. Is it team? Does team have been about tattoos on his phone? Hey Thompson girl. So Gurra has bits about guys with tattoos on their face. One of the guys on our board, it's a stupid fucking picture, but it makes me laugh every time I see it. This guy a non on the message board, he has this, uh, this photo of a dude who had tattooed on his lip pussy eater it, and it's a mugshot of this guy. I hate the Mugshot of this guy.

Speaker 5:          00:28:59       And he's kept pussy eater tattooed on his lip. Can you imagine being there and carrying that? I could. Oh, he cares, man. That's why he did it. Doesn't not care. It's abuse, Bro. Somebody abused that kid for sure. Yeah. That's a kid that grew up in a terrible environment. That's what that is. I got a buddy who's got a, you know those name tags that say like, hi, my name is Tom, or whenever it's got to as just he's, he tattooed that on his chest when he was drunk and Mexico and so it was that and it says, hi, my name is Dildo tron. Here's the best part. The Mexican dude given him the tattoo misspelled Dildo. Toronto does says Delo. Oh, to go back and get it fixed. Oh, that's hilarious. That's so beautiful. That's so beautiful. It's ridiculous. So much better that way. That's so much better. There's some hilarious misspelled tattoos online. If you want to just, just laugh your fucking ass. Just go and look at some of the shit that people have misspelled on tattoos. It's like, my God. Fuck man. Do you just not care at all? Do you do not double check? I'm pretty sure it's how it's spelled, but let me check real quick. That's why he just try not to get any writing. Just do that. You can't have

Speaker 4:          00:30:15       design like that will. You could always say, oh well then no, that octopus was supposed to have nine tentacles.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       Especially if you do like to Betten language. Like I have a friend who was this big Tibet and piece across his stomach like come on Sunday, can't read Tibet.

Speaker 5:          00:30:28       Know what the fuck does that really says? That can say some ridiculous shit. Like what is your say you you, you got a tattoo. You thought it said Brian. I thought it was the letter R and I found out it meant what are flowing water or waterfalls and he blames crying fits in that Tattoo under my lip right here. I thought it said, you know my last name and it says cum bucket. Are you doing bitch? He felt like he was setting us up there twice, twice, twice, twice today. Brian, you try to sneak something in there is that there's a porn star. It has the word cum bucket. And that's what I was thinking about it because she had a Twitter the other day and she was looking at like her lips and as a company,

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       that's disgusting. I just, some girls just say, all right, you want to play slot? All right, I'm going to play super slot. Right. They just take it out. Like when you watch those gang bang scene, so you watch gang bang scene and like, you know, they get together and they go, all right, and how many want to do all right, what we're gonna do 300 today and they'll do a 300 man gang bang. And then another girl go, that bitch, she had 300 I'll fuck her. I'm going to do 150 more. And so she'll do the fucking four 50 and then some crazy bitch to 600 but that's what they do. They just outside each other they get instead, since they can't be pure and loved and they can't be accepted for who they are, instead they just go deep, deep into the slut barrel.

Speaker 4:          00:31:49       Brad, you know Brad Williams, he was dating. Yeah, the little, uh, the little guy, he was a, he was telling me that he was like, he had been like fucking this porn star. Whoa for a while. And then she, you know, and this is going on for two years or something. And then she comes to him and says, listen, we've got to stop and this and that. I'm getting out of the business. And he's like, oh, is that just like what you do? Like when you stop, you just don't want to do when she goes, well, you know, I want to be faithful to my husband with like, this whole time you've been having this two year affair with this porn star. Didn't even know, Whoa, maybe I shouldn't have said his name.

Speaker 5:          00:32:24       Well, see Shatsky these chicks, these chicks,

Speaker 4:          00:32:30       you know, it goes back into, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna fuck 150 more guys. I'm going to go fuck dwarfs or whatever. You know.

Speaker 1:          00:32:38       Well, you know, I mean I'm,

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       I'm a shitty arm chair psychologist, you know, and I want to, when I break down porn stars and like why does a person do this and does a person do that? There's different reasons. There's a lot of different reasons but, and some of them are really nice, like Danny, the Armand, she's really nice. Jenna Jameson's running nice, you know, some, they're really nice people but I can't help. But when, you know, especially since I have daughters of my own, whenever I seen something like that, that there's this weird part of me that has to do the math, you know, I can't just watch a girl with a Dick in her mouth and wandering around assault and one in her vagina. I can't go. Wow. They must be crazy. Like this bitch is just letting go and just wild. I have to do the math in my head has to go back to puberty.

Speaker 3:          00:33:25       It has to go back to child and that's the girl. What the fuck happened to you that you're expressing yourself? This word is your bond. It's really like fucking sex like a lot, like it feels so good and you just gave up me like, you know what? Fuck it. I liked the fuck it is possible. But you know, all all varieties of behavior are possible, I guess. Supposedly friends with her family. No, nothing's ever happened to her. She's just a good example. Dana Dermo now that she's a very strange girl. Yeah. You know she did. She did a gang bang scene and afterwards she was so happy about it that she was crying. It was an awesome video. Just the trailer alone. Totally legit. Awesome. Totally legit. She's just crying because she accomplished awesome senior.

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       No that. I love them. I love them all and it's like, whoa. Like for everybody else he watching you go, wow, what the fuck? But she's nice. She's a nice person. He's going to bring a tear to your eye because you know her. No, not quiet before. It's one of those Arsenio Hall things that make you go, you remember that was a song for a while,

Speaker 3:          00:34:31       D and c music factory. Is that what it was? I wonder if they took that from Arsenio Hall and I think it was, I think it was the whole, I think they ripped him off or was either or the other backwards. Oh, it could've just been like a same time period though. Cultural thing. Like they're just like a phrase that people, you know, in that time,

Speaker 1:          00:34:50       Arsenio Hall show that never fell off like that. I would've loved to see that guy continue his talk show ways like Jay Leno's done like everybody else has done. I liked the Arsenio Hall show. He's a nice fucking guy and he lives, he lives, uh, and, well, I don't want to say where it lists, but I've, I've run into them a bunch of times and he's always super friendly.

Speaker 3:          00:35:09       I keep hearing he's trying to make a comeback or something and then I never hear anything about it at anytime. I hear his name is always trying to get things in order because he's going to do a comeback and then you just don't hear anything.

Speaker 1:          00:35:18       Well, he was doing standup for a while, you know, he came to the comedy store a bunch of times. Do you remember it came to a comedy store? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:35:23       Well we saw him at the comedy Magic Club. We hung out with him and then got in the green room.

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       Yeah, I'm really, yeah, it was like maybe two years ago. Three years ago. Really? Yeah. He's a great guy. Either way. Um, he's um,

Speaker 7:          00:35:38       I don't know why the fuck did we get on to him? Oh, things make you go home? It's called dead air.

Speaker 4:          00:35:44       No, that shit. Do you remember how they used to portray or sending a hold on like Saturday night live with that really long finger, like, yeah, like this creepy long finger. Oh, remember that? Remember that? Was that Sarah and I think it was Saturday night live in living color. Oh, did you hear about it?

Speaker 7:          00:35:58       This a high school, uh, drug bust that they pulled today.

Speaker 4:          00:36:02       And can I saw you, I saw you tweeted that, but I didn't get a chance to look at it.

Speaker 7:          00:36:06       Fucking ridiculous. One of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard in my life. They told these kids that is in Connecticut and um, Walcott, Connecticut did this, this happened today. No, I'm sorry. They reporting it today. It happened last week. Oh, so they say that the over the loudspeaker that an intruder has entered the building, they think it's a shooter. You know, they, they implied that they think that there's some armed person who has entered the building that everyone needs to get into a corner and huddle up and then they go through the fucking high school with drug sniffing dogs looking for pot.

Speaker 1:          00:36:40       That's ridiculous. So they scared these fucking kids into thinking that there was a shooter and they're building now they don't know the history of these people. What if one of these kids was related to someone who got shot at Columbine, right? Or many of those other schools shootings. And you're going to give some horrible trauma to some fucking kid. Who remembers their uncle Mike who got shot in the fucking hammer? They did that then because their comments, because morons run the school systems in Walcott, Connecticut. So they send dogs through the fucking in the hallways. They find no drugs by the way. They find nothing. Meanwhile, these fucking kids now are going to think, oh, they're willing to lie to us for a shit reason. They're not even, they're not even going to ask us, do you have drugs? And then search to the school unexpectedly. Instead of doing that, what they're going to do as a lie to us about a fucking shooter, about an armed intruder, get us terrified now, how the fuck are you ever going to believe them if they come on the loudspeaker again and say an armed intruder is entered into this tool at fuck you was, it really was an army. God Damn. Fuck you. Yeah, you're right. Fuck you.

Speaker 4:          00:37:39       When I was in high school that were like, you know, it's probably more today, but like 10 dudes you knew did, you know did did pot and stuff and that was it. It's like, I'm sure most high schools are like that. Like you know who the fucking pot heads are just like corner them or so. You don't have to lie to the entire school freak everyone.

Speaker 1:          00:37:55       You don't have to lie to them either. If you want to search the fucking school, search to school, tell the kids to sit the fuck down and put the dogs in the hallway and you know, make sure you have the dogs on leash. You fucking savages. So no little kids get bitten. But the, the disease, this is whose idea it was like the superintendent or the principal or, I mean there's should be multiple firings for this firings. They should go to jail. You guys are criminals, criminals, and you're fucking up a kid's brain. You're going to make kids think the cops are idiots. You're going to make kids think the cops won't, will lie to you to find out if someone's smoking a fucking joint. It's all high school. Jesus fucking Christ. How will you raising your 15 1617 year old kids do not talk to them.

Speaker 1:          00:38:37       Yeah, you could do your fucking talk to him at that age. They're fucking teenagers, man. There are a lot of fucking smarter than you think. What you don't do is lie to him and see there's a fucking shooter in the building. It's just so bad. Associate or Duke Walcott, police department. You can't dumb dumb, dumb cunts. Did you fucking think this shit through at all? It's just one of the things where it makes you just really realize that there's no special qualifications to be in charge of a situation like this. To be that guy who comes up with that Shitty fucking idea and then implemented without anybody stopping him. Right. Damn. How the fuck do you trust them? You Morons not one teacher go, wait, whoa, whoa. What the fuck are we doing? But not one cop go. What? What you want? I mean, I know cops just want to keep their fucking job and keep the fucking pension, but when your boss tells you that you got to be like Jesus Christ, we're going to bring dogs to the fucking high school and you're going to tell them that there's a shooter.

Speaker 1:          00:39:40       Well, I mean it's doubtful, but maybe the cops didn't know. Maybe they said you just get the kids off in one area and we'll come through with the, yeah, there might be. Yeah, there might be more to that story. Like the cops had no idea what they were doing. You know, like they were just like what? There's a gun really. This is the exact note, the school administrator and now it's over the public address system that a dangerous intruder had entered the school and that all students were to remain in their classrooms away from windows and ideally huddled in one corner of the room. They had the kids huddle in fear huddle in one corner of the room for nothing, for our fake drill. Cause I'm a fucking moron, cop and Walcott, Connecticut. And I think I'm smarter than people because they have to listen to me cause I have a badge because they operate under a system of law. These fucks these fucking cops and they get into these situations, band, they start thinking they're better than regular people there. Start thinking they can tell you what to do. What? I will just tell them there's an intruder jets. Why you're the boss always with the great ideas chief. How do we get all these kids to huddle in the corner? Terrified in fear. Well, denim, there's a Nandan Truda.

Speaker 1:          00:40:49       Oh, that's why you get all the big tax dollars. We're paying this guy. We're paying this cunt to lie to our kids. You fucking dummy. What a disaster of a human being. You. If I've got the day off, you need me to come in. Yeah, come down. We're gonna scare the shit out of some kids. Show up with dogs. We're going to look for joints. You fucking cunt. You just useless. I think it was coke. If it was coke, it'd be okay if they were, even if it was coke, man, look, all of it. Anything. You know, even pot, if you're this pot going around the school, you've got to find out where the fuck at pots coming from kids, 14 year olds, he'd be a lot harder than it is to get pot. I agree with that. I don't think it should be high all through fucking high school.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       It can ruin you and ruin your motivation. You're not developed. Yeah, you're not. You're not fully a human being yet. There's these, there's a way, but there's ways to handle it that don't get kids terrified of Jack boot thugs for the rest of their fucking lives and lies the lies that the people that are in control are going to tell you, no matter what, you're always going to question those kids that experienced this will always question any official announcement now forever. Right? It's impossible for them not to write and they'll have this story forever. They will laugh about this store. They should sue the fuck out of those people. Yeah, and I know it's a down economy and I know that, you know, there's no Melissa, this is shit we're suing over. Not Frivolous lawsuits you get all the time. This is where it's soon over. If that was my kids, I would fuck you. I would sue sue the fuck out of that police department and I love cops. It's not the cops themselves. It's, I know this is the work of one dummy. You have to find that dummy. You'd find that dummy. You need to move him to Siberia. Thought he was going to win an award or something for some sort of, you know, drug task force bullshit.

Speaker 8:          00:42:30       My new model might not be an edge. As we came and I came up with a great idea, score shoot or fish, Judah, everybody's game, finish school.

Speaker 1:          00:42:40       It's fucking idiot. Running around running a police department, fill of grown men with guns and this is what he tells you to do. What a piece of shit you dumped. Fuck, I wish I knew your name. They don't list the name it and how could, how could they not? Listen to me a better officer. What do you need to do is do mushrooms? Well, you need to do officer is just get alone in the woods is good. As long as you know there's no bears, you know you're not going to be freaking out while you're in the middle of your peak, right? Just do some mushrooms. Now Find Yourself, find how bad this idea was and if you're scared of mushrooms, eat one of those pop brown is that you confiscate. If you're not prepared, he two or three pot brownies. If you're not prepared. That's just as bad as it was doing mushrooms that will introduce you to your flaws.

Speaker 1:          00:43:25       You know they have to to to eat those already. Right. That's I'm sure if they do a drunk bus, probably just going to burn all that weed or like dispose of it in one way, but it's a Brownie. Yeah. Yeah. I mean they're good. They're going to be munching on that on the way home. Well, you can obviously you can just say it's a Brownie. You know it doesn't look like contraband. Right? What's that? That's Brownie. My wife pack went my lunch there was black and brown. Did you ever hear that video of the cops are called nine one one because they had stolen some pot brownies from this kid and ate them. I guess they stole a pot and then cook them into brownies and then ate the brownies and I think that's a story. Either way, the most important part was they were calling nine one one they were cops and they're calling nine one one.

Speaker 1:          00:44:03       They were like, I think we're going back in time. I don't think that really, I think I might already be dead like they were. They were thinking they were already dead. Like did they were so high that they were like, oh my God, I have passed into the great beyond that, I'm just starting to realize it. So they were calling essentially the nine one. One in the great beyond, right. They were calling as cops. Hilarious. So funny. Yeah. This cop needs to party with those people. Yeah. Right. Just get your shit together, Dude. The are you doing man?

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       I'm in war right now with Wikipedia. What's, yeah, it's impossible. I, there's been so many people, like I have tried to make me a Wikipedia page and then it gets canceled cause it says I'm not important enough. Which I agree. That's fine, but then you look who else is on there and you're like, wait, this person's on air because they f they were a porn star for a month, you know, or this person, it's like a notator ship over there, man. It's so fucked up. Right. And so that there's all these, there's all this, well there's all this controversy about these people that kind of are like the head editors and no one, you know, it's, everyone can edit Wikipedia. So it's all about the people. It's like the moderator. Yeah. But there's like these moderators that they want to put who they think is important enough to be put in there.

Speaker 3:          00:45:13       So you go through this and you're like, wow, this is where you wanted there just for promotional purposes. Do you want there? I W I want it there because, well, one, one of the things I want to be is because Siri and all this, all these technologies are incorporating Wikipedia into it. So yeah, it's it for search reasons and for what I do, it's, it's, it makes sense to be in Wikipedia. Right. And then the other reason is because then I look at, uh, who's in there and I'm like, that's makes sense. They have a Wikipedia. I should have a Wikipedia just for as a kind of a quick bio, you know? So when people are like, who the fuck is Hilton? Have a Wikipedia course? And so, so what, you're sort of a many, many, many Paris Hilton. So, so I'm at some asking the p one of the moderators or editors or whatever, and I'm like, you know, like what do I have to do?

Speaker 3:          00:46:01       And they're like, well, you need to send links of like your work. Uh, like on other websites or other publications or who you are on other publications that are linked. So I'm sending them like on Sirius Xm radio, they talk about our podcast page. It's probably, they listened to the podcast, right? I know what it is. And you're like trying too hard. So then they have the power. I know. So I'm thinking about being in a porn movie just to be in Wikipedia. It's a good move. And wiki leaks what you're doing. See, your girl wants to start branching out into male porn and you're resisting and you'll say, well, I'll just fuck you and it'll kill two birds with one stone. Sure. It'll get me on Wikipedia and you can do boy, Girl Porn. I make more money. That's right. So I think it's my transition and getting a wig.

Speaker 3:          00:46:45       I won't fire you. There's some jobs will, they'll fire you if they catch you doing born. I'll tell you right now, you can go do all the porn you want and I will never fire you. It was a part of your job growth at it. You're free to do mourn. You might get a hundred percent job security. You don't have to worry. I got it. I got a buddy who is an attorney, he's an attorney and he moved, he moved from Phoenix to La. Oh, just to work in the office out here. He was living with a guy who created a big TV show, but I don't want to say what it is, but everybody would know what it is. Bonanza. And he was living with a guy who created bonanza.

Speaker 3:          00:47:16       And so he's a lawyer and a, and then the guy, he's living with his like, Hey, do you want to come and do a little guest spot on my show? This is like a reporter, right? And he's just asks two questions. It's some, some little guest star thing. And, uh, so what I put on Wikipedia, I make a Wikipedia page for him just as like a joke. Like, oh, Brandon, Lombardy is a American actor. And uh, but he's also a lawyer. He, he, this thing is taunting him now. I've tried to take that off several times. You can't, like, you can't take it off him and take that. I'll delete it. It'll be back within an hours because he'll, he's like trying, you know, he's like interviewing for other jobs and stuff at different law firms. They're like, well, what the fuck is it? You're an actor.

Speaker 3:          00:47:52       Like what? And he's like, no, no, no, no. They look, I mean, he's on IMD be and that sort of thing, but it's like he, that's not who he is and it's, it's like starting to fuck with them. Like they're tyrants over there, dude. Yeah, it's weird. There's some kind of like government that runs we Wikipedia and they want you to know who they want you to know. Almost like the media where it should be an open source thing. Like it's rolled, you know it. And it's really fucking weird because if you can say, hey, like I gave them a link list of links, like 50 pages, like how many Twitter followers do you have now you're like 30,000 but I was a guest on Adam Carolla radio show about the Carla's been see a video I, you know, have, have little things that are, I would gay more important than somebody that is like, I was in a blowjob video when I was 18

Speaker 5:          00:48:33       the blowjob video provides a lot of people with something to beat off to. You think it should be knocking it? Like what's, what's Charlie Sheen's girl that crazy that his ex that day, the crazy slide. Her name. What's the Olson? She is the most beautiful fucking Wikipedia page with photos and lane. She's a superstar though. She's a porn superstar. Compare yourself to her. That's ridiculous. That's what I'm saying. I'm just know what you will never be hurt if you, you know what you are and you're the guy who confidently says, you know, like if you have to choose to treat me or fucking Bree Olsen, you'll let me live. I know you will. I don't even have to think about it. And then it gets to the judgment time when the guy was like, I'll take Brielle's and what the bottom falls out of the floor and he drops down. He just doesn't understand.

Speaker 3:          00:49:19       He just wants some legitimacy. He just wants to affirmation for what I do, what I do, my videos and, and Margaret. It helps promote stuff. It's pretty, it makes more sense to me that that's like my being not being able to be on I MDB for you probably imagine. You know, it's kind of like that. It's kind of like a Techie, nerdy.

Speaker 5:          00:49:38       I got, what else? What else I get is the fact that you've had it up a couple of times and then somehow or another it gets yanked back.

Speaker 3:          00:49:43       Yeah. It's because it's, they always give the excuse that you're not important enough or you're not showing importance at all.

Speaker 5:          00:49:49       I send them a link, 30 different things like article reviews and stuff like that. He listens to this podcast. I fucking guarantee you he listened to these podcasts. He's one of those guys. It's fucking red being Nazi. Every time we bring this up is another six months of me not adding it. Tired of red pens. Bullshit. Nobody wants to hear about your cats Dick. He's going to Applebee's on the weekends. Just bitching. Anyone who will hear and will be, did I tell you I've got the craziest Internet search story other ever. There was a store, I've told this before, I think this is the the 1990s like right, right around 2000 ish. There was a

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       small mixed martial arts organization and it was when they were just starting to learn about Internet searches and they had this guy who was fighting for them and he's got, he's got, he's a fucking beast dude. Like six four two 40 built like a, like a comic book superhero smashing everybody and he was like a big star and their organization, so a, they're trying to assemble some press on this guy and they do a search and they find out that a gentleman with the same name had won something called the hungry is but contests. So

Speaker 5:          00:51:05       pre Google man, this is like, who knows what they had for search engines back then. So clearly this couldn't be our guide, this couldn't be our gladiator, our warrior and not be involved in something called. So they click a link,

Speaker 1:          00:51:18       there's two dudes using him as Chinese finger handcuffs, one's in his ass, ones in his mouth and they got these pictures of this guy, oh my God. And so then my friend has to sit down with this guy, talked to him and he has to say, uh, you know, um, did you ever do gay porn? Which is the guy fucking freaks out and starts yelling, what the fuck you saying? What the fuck are you saying? And he has to literally click on the link and then step away from the computer while it loads. And he's like, and the fucking few seconds and it took to load. I'm locked. He goes, I'm locked in a fucking office with a gay savage, right, right. Big Day gladiator who is lying to me and tell me he's not gay. And I'm clicking this link and as it's click, click, click, click, click, click. It's old school internet where it takes a long time for a personal loan and slowly but surely he sees the Dick in his mouth like slowly but surely you see men's abdomens mag, men's abdomens, someone's head,

Speaker 5:          00:52:14       your head, what's in your mouth? Oh, that's a car once in your ass. That's a cocktail and you, you're watching this

Speaker 1:          00:52:22       and he's watching this. They're watching this together. You know, they're watch this together. And then the guy says, listen man, listen man. I just needed the money. It's not that I'm gay. I just needed the money. It was just a bad situation. It turns out he did like a hundred movies.

Speaker 5:          00:52:34       Oh Shit. You can do like 15 movies. That's a lot of money though. I'd take her money movies. That's what's a lot of money though, for fee. How much worse? It wasn't getting paid back then as compared to what you would get today too. Yeah. The joke is when I talked about it in my act, the joke was how much does a lot of money to you? Cause for a lot of money to me is I do one movie. I live like I'm in a fucking Jz video for the rest of my life. They did 15 you should have all the money on a planet. There should be no money left for anybody else. You have everything. You did 15 movies where we, they like, man, fuck you. You got everything and great memories

Speaker 1:          00:53:07       do, do, do, do.

Speaker 5:          00:53:09       How pissed off are you Brian that I have a Wikipedia page? I already know you'd already looked. Oh goodness. I looked it up because it's kind of you coming off a little jealous. No, no. I looked it up. I looked it up actually when I was trying to get, no, trying to get photos for you for the show we did last week and it came up

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       as on when I did a search and I, he, he's in a TV show, so you should be on, have a Wikipedia show. But I didn't, I don't know how it got made or how, I mean, I would imagine my own voice if they try, if they verified it that I was on that show. The way that you're saying they do that, I don't know why they're not. There's gotta be something else as a reason why they're not like, I know. I think it's because I'm German. Josh has his own website. Josh mcdermitt.com. What a handsome fella. Hey, can I plug my Twitter? Fuck yes, dude. This is what I like. Anytime you say anything about me on Twitter, I pick up like a hundred followers like that. Please follow Josh McDermitt, m c d. E r M. I t. T. Derm myth to be, it used to be fat piece of crap, which is easier to remember.

Speaker 3:          00:54:11       How can we change it? Uh, cause people who pay me a lot of money asked me if I would change it so they get promoted and I just kind of went, this isn't a fight I want to have. I was like, sure, whatever. But I still have fat piece of crap so don't try and get it. But um, this is what I'm going to do. Cause uh, uh, no, this is kind of little plug. If I could put, November, November is pancreatic cancer awareness month and my brother in law died of pancreatic cancer. And so for every follower I get, let's start it now through the month of November, I'm going to donate 5 cents to pancreatic cancer research. And I know, I think I had like six 82 or something when I walked in here. So everything from now on, uh, through November I'll donate 5 cents. Oh sweet. That's pretty good.

Speaker 3:          00:54:53       I get all the money in the world, so I don't give a shit if I get a million followers. Guys, you crazy. What's a million followers? 5 cents of falling or know who can do the math, not me. You know, there's someone listening to this right now already who's already done it. Yes. Yelling it out. Killing [inaudible] answer. Morons guy ain't talking. I'm not Brian. We're going to get you on Wikipedia buddy. It's going to be okay. We gotta do it, man. So me and Joe were talking, we're still in the other day talking about yawning and like, like what the fuck is yawning for it? And I was like, what if there was some kind of communication back in the old days were we're not figuring out. And we went on this whole theory of like, like what if we yawned and touched her nipples at the same time?

Speaker 3:          00:55:29       Like a dragon head would come out and teach us something or that was you not wait, don't say we when you came up with a stupid idea. So anyways, last night it was last night was watching. What's that show where they tried to break a myth? Myth busters. I was watching mythbusters and during doing theory on yawns and it was so weird that out of nowhere that I saw this, uh, and they would put people around in like groups. And then like see if like one person to yawn, if it would start like a yawn off where everyone would be yawning eventually. It was really interesting. There was a, it wasn't a high number, which I thought it was, but there was definitely shown negative. You Yawn in a group that there'll be more yards per, yeah. Well I think that that's a smart way to test that.

Speaker 3:          00:56:16       First of all, you know they did a few ways you, but that's a terrible way to test it. When you have cameras on people and you make no, they don't. No, they don't know there's cameras. They think that they, they got him off Craig's list. They had to fill out to like some application, like a doctor's waiting room. They don't know there's cameras. Yeah. Yeah. They didn't know there were, there was cameras. Wait for someone to yawn. Yeah. And they just waited for one person to yawn and and see, see if it started. Do the, do people yawn? Like, or just like what if nobody dawned than this? They had problems with that. So they didn't, they did other studies where the gas, the room, then they did you sign the release where they put them in like their each individual rooms and did studies on them? It was just kind of weird because I, while watching that I couldn't stop yawning. You're like I was mentioning I'll, I'll start yawning. Right. Even if you're talking about that makes sense that they studied it that way. I was so stupid. I thought they just got everybody that that's how I was studying. Get them all in the room. Okay. You Yawn first.

Speaker 3:          00:57:17       Shit doesn't work at all. But what if that was some weird communication that we're not, we're missing out. Like you're supposed to yon with the person next to you. At the same time I'm like, there's something there. I think they believe in chimpanzees. It had something to do with, uh, with the Alpha position and with like exchanging like empathy. Like, so when one person yawns like you're almost like, you feel like, uh, obliged to let them know. Yeah, I'm tired too. Cause you don't want to be like, you're taught bitch, I'm wide awake. I'm going to fuck your wife while you're sleeping. You know there's, there's a little something too. It's like a communication thing. When you're young, your heartbeat, I think it was 30% goes up, 30% rate and your lungs completely fill up with air like and it does all this shit when, when you, when you yawn, it also makes me also wonder if there was something else there.

Speaker 3:          00:58:04       Like you're sending a bolt of like you're supposed to yawned at same time while you want to talk to somebody else in their head or something like that. Did they talk about what the fuck are you charging? You're charging your battery. Did they talk about what your heart rate dips too after you're done yawning because you're, you're like relaxing. I don't know. I feel like you almost like relax even more than it would be less than what it was when before he started yawning. Yeah, that seems silly. Maybe it's waking you up. I mean saying that your heart jumps 30 beats per minute. I mean, that's what happens when you take a stimulant. Maybe like the idea of this big burst of this big burst of oxygen and unusual fashion like that. Maybe it sparks like an extra little pump of blood flow that's supposed to like send, like send a signal. Come on guys, let's wake up. Let's wake up. Come on. Because like, that's what a lot of people do too when they're young. Like, oh, okay, okay, okay, let's fucking bear down. You know, when someone like yawns and they're tired, sometimes they'll do that. They'll be on the go, I got to wake up, I gotta wake up and then they'll like fire up whatever you supposed to touch like a pyramid at the same time. [inaudible] on one side, blue monkey up your asshole while you're eating a jellyfish.

Speaker 3:          00:59:14       I thought you guys like what ifs. I'm just talking. This is the craziest, what if ever, Brian, I'm so glad you saw this through. So there's,

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       um, there's some evidence that the justice department is proposing new freedom of information act rules that allow the government to influence of form the public. That records do not exist. Even if they do. So you know the freedom of Information Act, you're supposed to be able to say, Hey, is the records on, you know, Blah Blah Blah, and they're, they're supposed to, you know, in cases where it's not, I mean, I'm sure there must be some fucking national security rules, right? That's mine son I file. You're going to drink out of mind. I'm like, ill, you want some of this? Anyway, what they're saying is they're allowed to lie real. They're allowed to tell you that. It totally, it, it cancels out the whole reason of having the Freedom Information Act. Yeah. I mean it's like, it's, it's, so, it's like there's no way to keep a tab of all the creepy shit the government does on a regular basis.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       They tried to sneak through. It's like you have to read about this on fucking wired.com which is where I read about it. Somebody sent it to me on Twitter. It's just, it's so gross. It's almost like the, the Justice Department is putting this out now and doing that so they don't have to talk about shit like that. Fast and furious gun running thing. Yeah, exactly. You know what I mean? They're like, ah, we got to cover our ass retroactively. Yeah. I wonder. I wonder. I wonder if it's just another distraction, but it's gotta be everything. It seems like everything is a distraction nowadays. It's so offensive. It's so strange. It's like it doesn't, it doesn't make sense that at this stage of the game that people still think that they can communicate with people like this or they can just lie to you and just tell you that they don't, that files don't exist.

Speaker 1:          01:00:53       Even if they do like 30 40 years ago, freedom of Information Act comes out. Nobody thinks anything of it because how many people are actually going to be asking for it. But now that everyone's a blogger, everyone's got their own podcast doing stuff. I mean, it's like anyone could get that information and you start really doing some fucking damage. Yeah. Anyone can get that information. We had, we had yon over when we were young, had stacks of them used to, fuck, I've got the documents, I'll release Jones. Yeah. He had the freedom of information documents like wow. Yeah. But even, even though I know, I know that I could get my hands on, I still feel like, ah, it'd be too much work. I don't know. Is it, it's, I don't want to do it. I don't have the, I don't have the, I mean, you've got to sift through millions of fucking documents.

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       You ain't gotta be a 90 person, but every now and then you find something really crazy. Like they found the operation Northwoods document that was like, they didn't find that until fairly recently. That's the one where the public, uh, the, rather than the army was planning on having fake attacks on American civilians and blaming it on the Cubans to get us to go to war with Cuba. They were going to blow up a drone. Jetliner they're going to send a jet into the air and blow it up. Oh, my blame the Cubans for it and get us to go to war with Cuba. And the guy who came up with that. Then when I moved to Connecticut and did that thing at the school, I got another idea. Well, the scary part about it, it was signed by the Joint Chiefs of staff and it was vetoed by candidates. It's called operation Northwoods. It's one of the creepiest documents you'll ever read because it is 100% lock down.

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       Solid proof that people in high office think that way, that they really, they were going to attack American soldiers. They were going to have armed Cuban friendlies, attack, wan tot them, obey attack American soldiers. They went on fucking lob mortars. Yeah. I mean they would killed, killed kids who would kill, you know, soldiers like American soldiers. They're not pushing this through, put it in over the everglades or something where you know, it's just going to kill a couple of crocodiles. The whole thing is disgusting. But the what's really terrifying, it's like no one went to jail for that. This is like, you know, this is, I believe it was like 1962 somewhere around then. Right. So it was right before Kennedy was killed and nobody was, um, nobody went to jail for that. If nobody went to jail for that and there's no punishment for that kind of corruption and that kind of, you know, the mismanagement of the government, then all that happens is it evolves, everything involves things.

Speaker 7:          01:03:06       They don't stay still. If they're making five bucks a day under the table, they want to make 10 bucks a day under the table. You know, it's a very few people stay at the same level all the time, but that, that document just feeds into why Kennedy was assassinated, you know, probably. Yeah. Like with the, with the Cubans and how he didn't want to do the shit that the military sort of wave of people recently I find that don't believe the Kennedy was assassinated by anyone other than Oswald. And I think it's hilarious. Yeah. It's one of the dumbest conspiracies. It's one of the, if you know, w you go with a conspiracy theories, there's, there's, there's, you know, some that are really out there and you've got to really squint when you look at them. And there's other ones that go, oh yeah, there's something wrong here.

Speaker 7:          01:03:46       And the Kennedy is, there's something wrong here. Yeah. If you just look at the facts, you know that Oswald didn't do it. He didn't act alone so much crazy shit. The fact that they found the bullet on, on the, um, what are those things they carry by on the Gurney, they found the bullet on, on, on Connolly's Gurney just magically fell. Oh here's the bullet that shot you and went through everybody. And even though it's not even bent up, right, it's the whole thing is just preposterous. And the only reason why they came up with a third bullet, you know, the reason why they had to have that single bullet theory, this is one thing a lot of people don't know. It's cause there was a guy under the bridge, he was under the overpass and he got hit by a ricochet. So they had account for that bullet.

Speaker 7:          01:04:21       And since they had committed to the idea that there was three shots that were fired from Oswald's gun, they had account for all these different wounds. One of them being a wound in the front of the neck that in the initial autopsy they diagnosed as a wound in the front of the neck and then in Bethesda, Maryland when they flew the body and they said it was a trake wound and that they opened up it to help him breathe. Why, why are you helping someone brewery that is missing their fucking head. Okay. His brains got shot all over the fucking backseat of that car. Stop pretending that that guy was alive when they flew him across the continent and they stuck a trake wound. He didn't know that's an impact, won't it? So it's an entry wound from a bullet and they can't account for that bullet. So all they came up with was, oh well one bullet just went wiki, wacky inside of his body and shattered bones in two different people came out looking almost pristine. It's, it's amazing how few people believe that. And it's because people like things tidy and they like things and they love

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       this idea of [inaudible] razor. The simplest solution is always the correct one. But that's not the case. Oftentimes it is. But it's not always the case. If you'd see in the operation Northwoods document, there's real corruption. There's your real conspiracy. There's a bunch of guys who really sat down and said, how can we get people to be interested in going to war with Cuba? Well, here's what we can do. We can say the Cubans are attacking us and we can blow up airplanes like the fact that they would drop a memo for that. If you don't think they would get together and say, this Kennedy, this motherfucker, he wants us out of Vietnam. It's going to cost us billions. He wants to fucking end the Fed. He wants to get rid of the CIA. The CIA. At the time, I'd only been around for about 20 years.

Speaker 1:          01:05:59       The CIA was created after World War II, so from World War II to, you know when Kennedy was shot in the 60s it was building up steam and he didn't like it. He thought they should get rid of the CIA. He thought they should get rid of the federal bank. He was like proposing to restructure everything and they shot that dude right in the fucking head. And if you don't think that's what happened, you're crazy. Because Lyndon Johnson took over after him and he's basically just a version of George Bush. Just play it by the book. Good old boy version of George Bush. And they went deep into Vietnam right afterwards. And they stay there for a while. There was, there's no doubt in my mind that they killed that guy who, I don't know. I Dunno. I Dunno. But I have a feeling he thought he was really president. Thank you know, I think there's, there's certain people that get this idea in their head, they're going to get in there and they're just going to fucking change shit and it's really gonna happen.

Speaker 1:          01:06:51       And then they get there and they'd go, whoa. So this is how it works. You know, we were talking about Colin Powell yesterday and I've always thought that he was one of those guys that like probably could have been president, you know, and when you're running for president, I think they don't let you know. Shit, I don't. I was like, you have a clue as to how it works. And then finally one day you're, you're actually an office and you realize, oh my God, like they take you into the matrix room where you watch all the fetuses that are connected to these metals, suck fluid brains to feed this mothership. And you look at it and you go, oh my God, this is the truth. This is reality. And then your hair starts going, that's when your hair turns gray. That's your hair starts calling Greg.

Speaker 1:          01:07:33       But what about, what about Powell though? You feel like he felt like he was a, another one of those guys. It's like, he was like, you know, a real man of character and a guy who you trust would, his word was then all of sudden he's in the Bush administration. He's like, Jesus Christ, just watching the whole thing go down and eventually had to get out of there. You know, it's like the, the whole situation was crows. And then here, here's the guy was a genuine war hero and is watching this chicken hawks, you know, forced us into these weird fucking wars and he's creepy parts of the world and coming up with these stupid fucking reasons why we're supposed to be there and occupy la. They had these pumpkin's in each pumpkin's was carved with a different president or person in office, you know, and every time they made a bush wine, it would get smashed like 30 minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       Like so every time they played, the guy told me he would walk by they, it was always smashed. The Bush Bushman is always smashed. He's a figurehead. That's funny. It's all he is, man. He's just a figurehead. He's just a dude who got a job. You know, it's a not that much different than me hosting fear factor. See Obama is in Los Angeles. He went to Roscoe's chicken and waffles and there's photos. Unless that was an evil Twitter prank. I am sorry if this, if I, no, no, no, no, no. He went, but he went, he went to Roscoe's and it's hilarious. That places amazing. Can't, I can't get into that man. What? Chicken and waffles? It's like fried chicken fried chicken. It's not like they put syrup on the chicken and stuff. I don't know. You don't have to put Syrup on the chin. My mind, that's what it is and that's when I'm like, fuck this.

Speaker 1:          01:09:00       I'm not going dude. It's all delicious. [inaudible] crazy. Listen chicken with a little bit of syrup and some hot sauce. God Damn Son. I'll give it a shot. It's like instead of eating cornbread with your fried chicken at 8:00 AM you eating a waffle? The waffles you get extra butter and extra syrup. All right. I just just go crazy with that bitch. Just appreciate the fact that it's going to be two days worth of calories. What you're supposed to eat in two days. You're going to eat in one. Okay, I'll, I'll, I'll hold off until it was all clear. My schedule. You know what you gotta do? Just do one day of heavy rock lifting. You know what you'd do is just, there's a lot of videos online of guys who pick up these stone circles. You ever seen those guys that come with atlas stones? It's like a very particular type of working out.

Speaker 1:          01:09:38       They pick up these stones. They're like, it's like a giant medicine ball. Me a stone. And they carry these around. They're very difficult to carry around. They actually make special like wristbands and shit so that they don't get the skin of their forearms ripped apart. They have these big long like padded wristbands and he's fucking gods walk around carrying these stones and this thing's supposed to just like burn 800 calories full on caveman shit. Uh, you know, that's like what charges up to system to be the most strong suck. Carrying something really heavy and moving it somewhere. That's the hardest thing to do. It requires the whole body to be strong. Every single aspect of the body. Right? Very difficult. So that's your move to do that and then go Wah Roscoe's chicken and waffles. He'll be so fucking tired. He'd be like, man, I don't give a fuck how many calories are in that.

Speaker 1:          01:10:23       I'm going to eat the shit out of that stuff. I want to sit in the Obama booth. There probably is one now. Right. Do you think they have the keep it light roped off with photos of him and then they said they weren't going to do anything special for the fact that he visited the location because apparently Reagan and uh, who's the other president who's from California? Nixon. Yeah, it came in Roscoe's all the time. Really didn't, they didn't change the menu or do anything special for them. They're not going to do that for Obama. Yeah, but he's black and I know that's what you're supposed to say. US the rope it off. Not only should they rope it off, they should get Madame Trudeau's to create a wax image of him sitting there. Awesome. And there'd be a photo there and you have the whole thing in cased in glass and kids will wipe their boogers on it. They put quarters, they stick

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       quarters in the last year trying to remove one. And if you do, you get to keep it. One of those things. It should be a big candle. Light him from the top every day and see the melt. While he's eating his waffles. A big candle. Yeah, like a big candle statue where he is like, oh yeah. If someone was wax, statues are fucking incredible man. It's really amazing. Yeah. Some, some of them I can't like they'll show the celebrity standing next to it. I can't tell who. Sometimes, yeah, I'm doing rivers. One of them looks weird and the other one doesn't. But you still are like, well, which one is it though? Yeah. You know what I mean? And photos that, just to show you how weird photos are, you know, especially when the photos get photo shopped and have you ever looked at someone's photos? Like you know like especially like professional hot chicks, you know, they'll have like a girl, it's like a ring card girl or something like that and there have her all touched up or someone along those lines.

Speaker 4:          01:12:02       You barely can tell what they really look like. Like you have to actually see them in person to see what they're really looked like. Because in this photo that's not a real representative of who they are. It's like it's weird paint thing. It's like you painted, someone's painted over you. This is not the real picture. This is your, you're showing me a God damn cartoon. This is like artwork. Well, I think three d, three d photos. I don't know if you've seen like those new cell phones. Cell phones. Yeah. I mean this camera has a three d in it, so you can take a panoramic views in three d and then you hook up to your three d TV and it's just like amazing and real. Yeah, it's ridiculous. You can like move your head and look around. Wait, show me a picture on the three d camera.

Speaker 4:          01:12:38       I've never seen that. You can't see it on this. Oh, you got to put on a three D TV. Oh, that's a way to make money. Yeah. What is it? Where's the the end of that? This three d thing to me, I don't like the movies where I have to wear glasses. They have to figure out to put something over the screen, but I'm thinking that this is just a hiccup along the way. So get the Nintendo three Ds. It's a little game. Boy It's in three d without glasses now. So it's just kind of show you five, 10 years. Yeah, it's going to be good. Those three d TVs where they have some commercials or whatever playing in a bar and it's, you know, it's kind of cool. It's not as as good as it when you're wearing the glasses and watching like avatar. Avatar is like the only kind of movies.

Speaker 4:          01:13:19       If it's like a big crazy action movie like that, I'll wear this stupid glasses, those things. Or they're uncomfortable. Then you used to wearing glasses? Yeah. It's to you. It's in everybody. Even even I don't like him. I mean I have to take them off every once in a while and just get my face arrest. You never thought about getting an operation? No, I can't do it, dude. Remember that movie fire in the sky back in like the late eighties or early Ufo? You a phone guys. Travis Walton, I think the guy's name is very famous Ufo case. And they showed, like, I remember watching the trailer when I was a kid and they were like, the aliens were probing him in just the needle was coming towards his eye and he was freaking out and I just went, I don't want anyone to ever touch my eye. And that stuck with me since I was a kid. I was born, I had contacts for a while. That took me a while to, to start doing contacts. I, I hated it. They scare the fuck out of you son Travis Walton. You, yeah. That's the guy's, he's working as a logger

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       in the woods in 1975. Yeah, in Arizona, Flagstaff. And he was pulled out into the fucking sky. I used to have that poster in my room. Huge banner like would get like banners, you know, you're doing poster here, uh, for the movie theaters. And they would throw them away, but they would, you'd have to have them if you were, you worked at the movie theater. So I get all the cool ones and firing the sky was like right on my wall right when I walked in. Wow. That was a dope fucking movie about abduction. That was a fun movie, man. Those, those alien movies scare the shit out of me, man. They still do. It's so easy to say, AH, they're full of shit. I don't believe them. It's so easy to say that because it doesn't happen every day because it doesn't happen every day.

Speaker 5:          01:14:49       It's so easy to go. Sad. It's fucking bullshit. Right? But could you imagine if it actually was happening to you? How wonderful a fucking freak out that would be. Like, Holy Shit. They're real. You're flying into the fucking sky, into the space ship and they're probing you and you're like, [inaudible] real and you're not gonna be able to tell anybody about it. Well, this was one of the best movies at sort of representing that, that fire, this guy moving, because it really did represent that feeling of like, you like you. Like that guy really did seem like he was stuck. I mean, it was a terrifying whatever the fuck happened. Whether or not they they're full of shit or not. I don't know. I mean, but the character in the movie, if that was real, what a terrifying experience. But that movie was like a recount of that Guy Story and experience.

Speaker 5:          01:15:33       But even movies like he t ski, they still, it still scares the shit out of me. I, there was like my parents' bedroom was around the corner or are there a bathroom was around the corner and their bedroom and every once we had a big family, so I'd have to use her bathroom every once wants while I was scared to death, like as a little kid, I thought fucking Iti would be sitting on the toilet taking a shit or something. I just, kids think weird things and even to this day I'll go home and I just, Eh, I'm hesitant to even go in that bathroom. I'm like, I know eating is not going to be here, but I still don't want to just walk around the corner. What if it was white? Do what if it was white t dragging a leg? Like Zombie style. Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:16:11       He's made, eats he creepy. Did they should make an Iti horror movie. Why he eats, he's a lovable little character. Was supposed to be. Yeah, that was a little grittier. And then gives you saw the thing last night. Oh, how was that thing? Prequel dude. It's not getting good reviews, but it's fucking good. I did want to see it just because I love the thing. I don't know. I don't know what rotten tomatoes gave it, but um, sometimes he can't trust that stuff, man. I mean, I think trust in the car with some things, but then there's other shit. 33%, man. They say they're saying it sucks. I don't get it. I mean, I was pretty sober actually. Sober. Yeah. I had a glass of wine. That's it. Um, but it was good, man. It's good. Look, I'm a big fan of the John Carpenter version of the Kirk Douglas or Kurt Russell version. Yeah. That's a good fucking movie. That's fun. It's still holds up. I watched that movie recently, like a month or so ago. Still holds up. That's solid. That's a solid fucking movie. This movie was not

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       quite as good as that. First of all because, um, I don't, I didn't quite, the girl who was the lead is, she was okay. She is her name. Good. I don't know. I don't know her name. She's okay. But I think she's wasn't Mary Elizabeth Winstead. That's her name. So it wasn't a Kurt Russell. Kurt Russell just brought so much to that park. Her fucking Russell. Then that's Kurt Russell in his prime dude with holding onto a fucking stick grenades with a blow torches hand. Fucking with all that, the ice in his face. I'll pull this whole fucking place and you're like, Whoa, that's intense. This district never hit that kind of a, Oh my God, I'm about to die. It was like she's around aliens and craziness and the, but still somehow or another, she's like Dwayne to composed for me. You mean to me, I think everybody should have been really freaking the fuck out.

Speaker 1:          01:18:02       And I just, I, it just, it didn't have that, that's where the effects and everything fucking insane. Fucking insane. Sex were amazing, man. The effects were incredible. Whether they can do now is, well, first of all it's a prequel. So it's, it's basically what happens and it takes place in [inaudible] 82 so it's all what happens right before the Kurt Russell version of sure. So I dunno if they're going to Redo that one. I hope they don't honestly. Cause there's no need to just come up with a new fucking idea. Please. They probably will. The dude, everything's getting remade though, if they redo it. And so it's really, it's really a shit trick because yeah, you'll go back to see ky Kang, the fourth remake of King Kong, but you know he's going to fucking die at the end. It's still the same story. So you're just going to trick me with a bunch of new shit in the middle that wasn't in the original one.

Speaker 1:          01:18:50       So you're basically making your own movie for the middle. You have a very, very flimsy guidelines. Got To pick up King Kong, grab bag, bring them back to America. You figure it out. Then she's supposed to be there and sacrifice. She's gotta be blonde. You got to have a lot of naked black checks and nobody cares about con grabs and then you get them and everything else you can make up on your own. So every version is, that's what we're, we're, we're tuning in for, we're tuning in for the shit that they made up. It's like, yeah, we know what's going to happen. He's going to climb the empire state building is going to get shot down. He's going to die. That's the end. What do you, what are you creating in there? Oh, well we've got is this and now he's going to battle with, he's fucking kick his black.

Speaker 4:          01:19:27       I want to see super racist movie. King Kong is, I want to see Johnny English reborn Johnny English. We see it. Mr. Bean. No, I was never big into Mr. I wasn't either, but my little brother loved that and so if I want her to hang out with him, we'd watch mister. He loved all that British shit and so we'd, I'd watch Mr. Bean and after it was hard growing on me, man. I'm like, it's so stupid. It's funny. It's so stupid that it finally becomes funny. And then I was, I don't remember what movie I was watching, but the trailer for Johnny English came out and I was laughing throughout the whole fucking thing. Man. It's so funny. I can't wait to see it dude. We're going to have

Speaker 7:          01:20:08       Shane Smith from vice TV. Come on. The guy who goes to the lady boys and the guy went to Liberia. Oh cool. I tweeted him today and he tweeted, he's going to, he's going to do the podcast. He's in Beirut right now filming. Who knows what kind of fuck with the lady boy. Like he goes to Thailand and gets a lady boy ever heard of the vice guide to travel? No Fun at the best one. It's on MTV now. Ryan is, I would have told him, you know, I only watch on Netflix, so it's one of the best fucking exposé. What's the best way to describe it? New shows. It's like a documentary online sort of a show where they do a bunch of different things. Like one of the guys is whenever they have some sort of a drug situation, they have one guy who's like a serious fucking cycad.

Speaker 7:          01:20:51       He's like massively into psychedelics and he's like super, super, like uh, educated about them and he sits down with Sasha soul gin and they go over the various thousands of different known psychedelic compounds and human use and it's just incredible shit. He went to the jungle and did Iowasca with the natives and I mean they have incredible shows. They went to Liberia and literally they're in a whorehouse in Liberia where it was like a dollar or it might've been less than a dollar to have sex with somebody. Yeah, it's increased. I mean in these guys go there, they go everywhere. They go to the Congo, they go everywhere, it's nuts. And he went to North Korea. This Guy Shane Smith went to North Korea. They went to the Thailand one. He's hanging out with lady boys. Like they picked up some lady boys and brought them back and we're sitting in the tub with them, hang out with them, I think.

Speaker 7:          01:21:40       I think I saw that. Was that, was that it also a documentary or is this just on his show? It's just the show. It's just, I don't know. I don't know the history of it and that's what a, why it'd be great to have him on because I don't know how it got founded, but these guys have fucking balls, man. They're savages and I've been a big fan of their work for a long time. And one of them, my favorite one is the one where they go up to visit that guy that lives a deep, deep, deep in Alaska. That guy that lives a member, um, he, he lives alone with his wife and they have like this little log cabin in the middle of nowhere and like North East Alaska, North East Alaska, like way the fuck up there, you know, where there's nobody man and this guy and they'd go hang out with him.

Speaker 7:          01:22:24       And he's just every day hunting caribou fishing for fish. Just every day is just foraging food and these are bright guy and he's been up there for like 30 years and he believes that's like the only way people are supposed to live. And that's the best way to be happy. Like he's super content up there. He's like, you know, I don't have any depression. I don't have any problems. You know, I just, I, I, this is what I like to do. I like to hunt and gather and he's that and he's not a dummy man. It's a really fascinating fucking show. And in the middle of the show they have to kill a bear because the bear, uh, was, uh, getting out his food, you know, cause he's, he shoots Caribou and then he has to hang the Caribou. Right. And sometimes they have a problem. You're hanging in his fucking care about and bear [inaudible] brown and when they come around you have to kill him. Yeah. So in the middle of the night, they're chasing him with cameras. Waste, fucking shooting. It's bare. It's wild dog. Cause they're in the middle of nowhere. I mean someone has to come by and drop

Speaker 3:          01:23:16       [inaudible] goods for them out of a parachute. That's the only way that he's getting a gooey Hannah. Yeah. Fuck. Well, if he's been there for 30 years, maybe you should. Maybe he left like in the 80s where it was like, oh look, set tapes suck. You know, fucking Atari. 2,600 this is lane. I gotta get Outta here. You know how to be happy. Yeah, I'll go out in the middle of Alaska. I wonder if he's travels to like at main city or peaches in a long time.

Speaker 7:          01:23:40       It has been. But as of the show, as of the vice guide to travel, I don't think he had ever even seen nine 11 yeah, I don't think he'd ever seen the towers fall

Speaker 3:          01:23:48       check checkout TVs now. You know, like maybe he's just had no idea how awesome it is.

Speaker 7:          01:23:53       Maybe. Maybe, but maybe he's right. Maybe like, you know, we, our bodies are still the same bodies. I mean, you've got to think that there's a bunch of like reward systems that are in place to ensure that people stay alive. And for the longest time, for a period of thousands and thousands and thousands of years, the way we stayed alive was hunting and gathering. That's the way we stayed alive. We went out and we, we killed our own food and we caught her own fish and we grew our own fruit and vegetables. And I think to this day we're probably wired with a reward system that enforces that. Like when you, when you do that, it probably feels really good because I know a lot of, I used to be hooked on fishing. I used to love fishing, I used to fish all the time. It's a very primal thing.

Speaker 7:          01:24:34       Like the, the, the, the excitement of catching a fish. It's very, it's very much wired system as his hunting, supposedly, I haven't been hunting, but they all say that people can't, you know, they all say that it's, it's, it's, it's wired into man. And that's why people to this day, even though it's easy to get food, still go hunting, not even just for, you know, for the meat and the, for the fact that they need to meet to stay alive. But just for, for the actual excitement of it because it's, you know, it's, it's, uh, there's an exciting thing about procuring your own food, going out and getting your own food and, and sustaining yourself through your own work instead of sustaining yourself through a supermarket where he just kind of empty. We pay for things and just consume them. You know? And some people really believe that the, the real true way to be happy is to, I mean, it's not very progressive because eventually we have to evolve past the state, but some people think they're, the true way to be happy is to live as if people were living, you know, thousands of years ago when there was no electricity.

Speaker 7:          01:25:30       And then all this technology, even though we are enjoying in it, it's enhancing our life. We're not really wired to, to use this stuff. We're not wired to be influenced by it. You know, like televisions, we were talking about TVs and movies. You think about the influence that a film has. Think about the influence that that has compared to any influence that you would actually see in the natural world. And compared to what you're supposed to be receiving the the human brain, like as you're developing and learning and going through life, you're supposed to be impressed by certain things. Acts of bravery. He's supposed to be impressed. Character and press by leadership and all these things are supposed to impress you because you should eventually take on that role yourself. If you're a man, you should actually develop to a person of character and respect and leadership.

Speaker 7:          01:26:15       Hopefully if you ever will want to become the leader. But until then you follow the leader, you follow the Alpha cause that's the one that has all the information. They've already lived a long life. They've learned some things and if you want to stay alive, you follow him. Now this is what's programmed in our head, but instead of that, what we're getting in, this is fucking a hundred foot screen. We were wearing glasses that make everything three d and this paralyzed dude's gonna fuck this blue chick. You know, and it's like our bodies and our brains almost can't process that, that much bullshit. It's like, even though we know it's just a movie, there's certain parts of our subconscious or even our consciousness that I think are programmed to expect movie like results from real life. And when you don't have anything like that, when you realize that the reality of it is, well no, I'm just some weird person who gets an a metal fucking box and it's on rubber wheels and I ride over this hard surface to this same spot where I sit in a cubicle every fucking day and repeat over and over.

Speaker 7:          01:27:15       There's no Sandra Bullock movie for me, man. There's no, there's no, there's no beautiful ending. Like what the fuck, man, this is reality. But we're so programmed by this idea of, of, of happy endings and this idea of easy to follow storylines where it all works out in the end that I, you know, and it's, it's, it's a, it's a trip. It's a trip to, to wonder whether or not we have created something in our mass media and our media, in our television or movies we have created something that influences us far beyond what we can control. And almost like that's how it's, it's difficult for people to truly understand people anymore. It's so, I'm just like, people aren't even influencing people. People's creations are influencing people. Artificial bullshit is influencing people, you know? And the, the actual what you know who the human is below all of it. It's very, very difficult to distinguish for a lot of people. Wrap your head. I had

Speaker 3:          01:28:11       about that bitch. So I'm reading the biography of Steve Jobs, I think I mentioned, but they're talking, they're the one cool thing that they kind of hinted at was the future. How Steve Jobs thought that he had mapped out the next TV. He broke the, the idea for the next TV. And so there's like these rumors now that apple might start making their own TV sets. Like, you know, like, well tell you what, that Apple TV program is fucking great man. I love it. Oh, the apple TV. The actual box. It's a little tiny ass box man. Yeah, I got it. And so I was thinking with the, with how good Siri is, what, what could imagine being able to tell your TV like a find me family guy Thursday record, turn the channel Hbo Record that you know and how it's probably going to mix in with the Siri into the TV. Can you, wouldn't that be awesome to be able to just, yeah, that's inevitable

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       I think. Why isn't it like that? Like if you use connects, obviously moving that direction like we're going to, we're going to get that real quick, right? Oh. Have you ever seen Bill Gates' house? Have you ever seen no, there's, there's a bunch of videos. There was actually a thread about it on my message board a few weeks ago. I think I'm amazing house and you wear a pin when you entered the room. When you get into his house, you put a pin on and this pin has a microchip in it and every room it recognizes you. It knows that you're the one who entered into the room. So it changes the movies or a track changes, right? The images on the wall, it changes the atmosphere, the temperature.

Speaker 3:          01:29:33       What's funny is that, so that, that, that's so funny how that's old technology already. Cause even with connect with x box, you have it in your house and you walk in the room, it detects your face and in logs you win and connect. Does it start playing music and change the light? No, but it logs you in and then like you can have like your like Netflix and he'd sit there with your hand and you string through the movies with your hand. Kind of like you can go through Netflix with your hand. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy. Imagine now lazy people, even more lazy. It's not incredible though. I mean that is a big jump.

Speaker 7:          01:30:10       Big Jump. The ability that we have right now to sit in front of the TV and swipe things with your hand in space.

Speaker 3:          01:30:15       Now imagine not having, didn't move your hand now just being like theory, find me this. Maybe you do this kit. I was just getting used to the retinal scan. Like that blows my mind that you could put your eye up. I mean when have you used that on a laptop? I've never used it. I just see it in movies. I'm like, what the fuck is that? I love real. They have it for life

Speaker 7:          01:30:34       tops now. They have fingerprint ones and they have retina scan ones.

Speaker 3:          01:30:38       Wait, they have retina scan one. I've only seen a finger. When do it like to log in or I'm just security. I know they do it for, they have my gym 24 hour fitness I, that's how I sign it. Yeah, that's some of the, we don't work out in the same gym, but yeah, I never see you there. I know I'm 24 hour fitness. Which one did you go to? Santa Monica. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:31:01       I can't find this. I might've made that up. How to buy retina biometrics. Camera? No, they have them. I don't know if they have it on laptops yet.

Speaker 3:          01:31:09       It wouldn't surprise me if there's like a thing you plug into the back of your computer sits on top. You'd do like a retinal scan. Then it brings up your profile or something, but then you know people would worry. What if somebody cut your eyeballs out? That's what I'm always at like with a pencil, like you jam a pencil in there, pop that sucker out and then you get in behind the security wall that you're, you shouldn't be, but you got the eyeball and then uh, you strapped the nukes to yourself and pull the pin and yeah, that's it. Getting kind of jealous. My uh, girlfriend's brother's building a computer right now and he just bought his new case on this case. It looks like alien ware Jealous Cause you're, you're, no, because I missed those days buying like you sit there and find the coolest case. He Pan and you find which motherboard that you've done before. Yeah. Just pretend he's doing it now. Yeah, I just missing

Speaker 1:          01:31:59       it. Yeah. It's kind of funny. I forget that I get, and then there's like a, that new game that just came out to a battlefield three and there was showing how bad acid looks and how I'm thinking, man, I wish, I wish, I almost want to build like some stupid gaming computer so you don't get as much free time as it is. I know I need to clone people. No you don't. You just enjoy less things. But I'm with you on the computers. I used to love the satisfaction of putting together a computer, you know, punching him, putting the mush, the motherboard, punching in the ram, you know, setting everything up. And then the moment it turns on you boot up windows like, yes, what the fuck do I don't Miss Jumper setting. So Jumpers, settings in the ass, if they still have jumpers, settings have tweezers and used to have to like move these little things like what the fuck were those things?

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       But how about that shit? And then it was like primes where your graphics card would interfere with your sound card. Like what was that called? Like in that box bios you had to change frequencies and shit. Oh that was so knowing that shit you, but I think you learn how much does this one work? My appreciate Max so much. I love the fact that I don't have to do anything. You know, you could say that it's a computer for people weren't power users or whatever you want to say. Let the fact that I don't have to do shit. It knows what you're wanting to do. It's like, Oh, do you want to do that? I'll just do it for you. Yeah, it's like that. I Dunno if it's like a sketch or something. It was just like move. I got it. You know? And I don't have to go into the registry and tweak the settings.

Speaker 1:          01:33:29       Like what the fuck are you talking about man? I'm like, what am I even doing in there? I don't know what to talk about this. This. I've talked about it before. This is the best coconut water I've ever had in my life. Yeah. I tell everybody, everybody says coconut water tastes like Shit. Yeah. And I never understood why they said that until I tried other stuff and I, these people are not paying me a dime. This is all just honesty. I think they have a great proxy to o is the Shit. And I asked him, I said, why is your coconut water so much better? Cause it's really delicious. I go, do you add sugar? And they go, no, no, no. What we do is we get our coconuts from a single plantation in Thailand, they own the plantation. And so this plantation in Thailand is the apparently date.

Speaker 1:          01:34:10       The Thais have the sweetest coconuts, real delicious coconut taste, and very sweet. And that's the key. So that's, this is, I don't know what other companies get their shit from Thailand too, but you'd get it from them because that's where c two o gets it there. They're fucking, let's talk about coconut water. And they're like, oh, I love it. So I went to whole foods and, and I bought three different kinds because I figured I wouldn't like one of them or whatever, just to try them out. I hated all three of them. Yeah. This is amazing. It's amazing when people, people think I'm exaggerating and like I said, no one's giving me a fucking dime. I swear to God. There's definitely bad coconut water that other kind of you had a couple of weeks ago. I did not even want to finish. And that's, yeah, this is delicious. This stuff is fucking, it's, and it's so good for you, man. It's really good. Like for when you're working out, like it's a good like

Speaker 7:          01:34:58       natural isotonic beverage, whatever the fuck isotonic means, whatever it is, it's good.

Speaker 3:          01:35:03       Joe, do you know if it's okay, you have a Vitamix? Is it okay to mix like vitamins into your drinks to like crush them into the drinks with? Is that something that be okay? Well, I guess you could do that, but why would you do that when you can just take them? Yeah. I don't know. But what do you, uh, what are you eating with vitamins? No, I mean like I do like a bunch of, like one of those packs of vitamins every day. I've been throwing it into the,

Speaker 7:          01:35:24       he could do that. Sure. You could do that, but you know, you got to wonder how much of it is going to get stuck to the walls. Right. How much of it is actually in your, you know, right. Yeah. I don't know. You know what kind of, what kind of vitamins you're taking

Speaker 3:          01:35:37       fish oil? Uh, it, it's just one of those packs you buy where it has a big pack of different kinds and you take like a plastic baggies? No, it's uh, from Costco. Yeah. Do you notice any difference when you take vitamins? Yeah, my ps really yellow and the smells bad. Smells bad. It smells like pee, like hardcore p more waters.

Speaker 7:          01:35:57       A study recently the, I mean there's always studies one way or another, but this study recently had said something about, uh, there were doubting the efficacy of a large doses of vitamins and they were saying that may even be harmful for some people. It's really interesting because I, I always wonder how the fuck do you judge that? How do you figure that out?

Speaker 3:          01:36:18       Well, it's probably like anything, if you overdo like a B, 12 or a c or something like that, it's probably not good for you. How much of it is placebo then? You know, like with vitamins? Yeah. It's like how much is, is this vitamin C actually helping me? Well, it's also like w how much do you need as opposed to how much other people though. It's not like it's crazy, you know it's not, I think it's just basic stuff to you like fish away. I'll d whatever, fish oil and d. Well you know you don't eat and healthy either. So for you and pretty healthy how to be the problem is I only eat once a day. Why do you do that? Well, like today, you know, I wake up, I get some coffee I can't eat before I have my coffee. You know, coffee?

Speaker 3:          01:36:59       Yeah. It doesn't work. Like I can't eat unless you get an upset stomach sort of thing. I just zero hunger like it's, it sounds gross. Like I would probably get sick if I try to eat. If I have my coffee for some ranchers then and then I usually do something like this. Like I'm doing this podcast right now. I probably will get home put, put, do the podcasts, put it up online and then probably eat around seven or eight o'clock at night. Wow. Yeah. So that's, I mean, my problem is like last night I had, you know, skinless grilled chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, fruit. You know

Speaker 7:          01:37:27       my question when I read these things, when you read a study that says more evidence against Vitamin News, my fucking tin foil hat always goes up. And they always go, well, how do I not know that this isn't some shit that the pharmaceutical companies have come up with? You know, to discourage it.

Speaker 3:          01:37:48       They found out that if you take vitamins, you're less likely to get certain amount of things that we need drugs to cure. And so they're trying to cycle squash pharmaceutical

Speaker 7:          01:37:56       industry. You know, the pharmaceutical industry was trying at one point in time and they have recently tried it again, they're there. They've talked about doing this where they want to regulate vitamins and minerals and they want to make it so they're only by prescription. So they'd go, you're going to cost a lot more and you're going to have to get them from pharmaceutical companies. So instead of these companies like GNC or all these different places that sell vitamins, those will essentially be taken over by the pharmaceutical companies and their massive amounts of profits will in turn be absorbed by the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical SuiteGL industry, by using the American government will essentially jack the whole nutritional market and take it over. And they tried this in the past. They tried to do it under the name nutriceuticals. That's what they're going to, um, call vitamins.

Speaker 7:          01:38:41       And they were going to make it so that if you wanted to get vitamin C, you had to get a fucking prescription. You had to go through the whole rigmarole, you had to go to a doctor, you had to get a prescription. It's, it's, it's disgusting. It's, it's, it's really terrifying. And so whenever I see studies like this, and I know that this was a very recently proposed thing, I always wonder if they're jocking for positioning. I always wonder what the fuck they're doing. I really do. Oh, really? Do you know? And then you know, once they take position they'll say, well, if you get FDA approved vitamins and minerals, it's been shown that moderate doses of FDA approved vitamin and minerals can actually prevent certain diseases. This is one of the benefits of having the government take over the pharmaceutical industry is that we're able to run tests on them and get conclusive results using taxpayer money.

Speaker 7:          01:39:28       Now everybody can be safe, could take government approved vitamins. So when I hear stories like this, I don't necessarily, I don't believe it. I don't know. I don't know who's putting these fucking things together. And I used to think that all these universities where beyond reproach, I just think, well you know, if it's a university study for sure that means until I watched inside job and then I realized how the whole system works with university professors in the fucking studies that they put out. And then the cushy jobs did they get afterwards and they make millions of dollars by playing ball with everybody. Did you see inside job? No, but I heard about exactly what you're talking about. It just makes me wonder like, is there an honest, is there any honesty left in the world for anything when you're dealing with that kind of money? I think the money for the professors, millions of dollars.

Speaker 7:          01:40:14       All of a sudden they're working from Merrick, you know, and they're developing some fucking, you know, brain drug for American making millions and millions of fucking dog for them. It's like the, the numbers are too high. Yeah. You know, I wonder, I wonder if there is anything on, on corrupt. Just, I think the only thing that's going to save people honestly is there's going to have to be some APP that's created eventually that lets us see the truth. Always see the truth and anything. No one's ever going to be able to lie to anyone. All your motives will be exposed right away. You'll be forced to tell the truth and then, and only then are we, we're going to really get it together because half the problem with what it's fucked up about human is the lies and the bullshit in the real motivation behind things. Whether it's operation Northwoods or whether it's, you know, them trying to fucking take over the phone.

Speaker 7:          01:41:02       The vitamin industry under the guys, they're trying to help us. Nobody's, let me tell you something. Nobody's dying from fucking vitamins. No body, no body, a negligible amount. 10,000 people die from fucking caffeine every year. All right. And I love coffee. Who knows how many thousands of people die from aspirins 400,000 die from cigarettes. Just shut the fuck up, right? If they're going after something, they're going after it for money. The federal government is not trying to take over the cigarette industry. They're not trying to give you only government approves cigarettes. You need a prescription to get cigarettes cause we're worried about the dangers of cigarettes. They don't think twice about cigarettes cause the tobacco company pays them billions of fucking dollars. Those dirty, dirty cunts. So the truth APP is the way to go. We need a truth APP, Brian, until you, until somebody figures out how to manipulate that hack, it's money off of it. Of course, the whole don't make it a fucking bought bought for the truth APP. What's the solution? Brian? I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:41:57       Thinking about how crazy that it, if you really think about it, it's there. There's a creator, there's somebody did that created the human person and whatever and they had to like take the eye and try to like design the eye to make it the best, most efficient I and somebody created the nos like no, it has to be, you know, has to have these filters of hair so it collects dust before they inhale it. You know, it's amazing that they're pro there. Is there somebody that sat around and had to design every single part of the human person? No, there's not one person. It's not a jet team of scientists and they created these robots and we're robots and

Speaker 7:          01:42:32       you know, there's the question of whether or not there's intelligent design. There's some pretty intelligent people that believe in intelligent design and a, the idea behind it, everybody has a big red flag when you bring it up because it's been co opted by religious groups and they, they, they use it to sort of promote the idea in school that you can push religious nonsense on kids because the real problem, religious nonsense is not that. It's not possible. What they're saying is true. It's that there's no evidence that it's true. And they're basically just talking. They basically just making up a bunch of fucking stories. Somebody wrote it down and you know, they try to pretend that it's history and they try to sell it to kids. There's no fucking evidence. But it doesn't mean it's not right. It doesn't, it does. It doesn't mean that there isn't, you know, at one point in time, some benevolent you one power that oversees everything. But we have eyelashes to protect our eyes. I mean, with each piece of crocodiles, what would they make? Komodo dragons. Why would they make monkeys throw shit at, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:43:29       so those were all like revision B, c, d e. Well,

Speaker 7:          01:43:33       I think there's a, is there some sort of an ecosystem but does anything, it looks alien. It's us. If you really want it to make the argument and there is this a logical argument if you really want to make the argument that there has been genetic engineering, there's two animals that you'd make that argument with dogs and people and dogs and people both very

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       substantially in size and shape and coloring and the what the where they live on the on the earth. But you can make them fuck each other and they can have babies no matter what. They're all interchangeable. Midgets can fucked Shaquille O'Neal, you know, you can, you could figure out a way to put it all together. It's, it's a way, you know, there's only people in dogs and we know for a fact the only reason why dogs are like that is cause people fucked with them. But people through selective breeding and some sort of genetic engineering that they're really don't know and a bunch of people, thank you have sent me a bunch of documentaries on dogs that a problem I'm not going to watch. I just watched one last night. Interesting. Dogs dissect it or something like that. It's something I'm from wolves. Yeah. They come from words.

Speaker 1:          01:44:32       But how like also like when humans look at each other, they like look from left to right for some reason to like, uh, to judge you or I forget what it was about, but that dogs also did it and then that we actually think closer to the dogs and most chimpanzees or, or monkey. And it was really weird. It was interesting to the see did they only bark like it though? They're not designed to bark Burgum. They're designed a bark were like wolves don't sit around and bark all day. Right. Yeah. Where that dogs are trying to communicate with humans and stuff. It was really interesting. You know, wolves communicate with people too. If you have a wolf, the for a pet. I have a friend that, uh, has, uh, two wolves. He had three for awhile and the wolves fucking talk to you, man. You come home and you're like,

Speaker 9:          01:45:14       what's up dude? What's up dude? They go, Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 1:          01:45:18       They look like they're all on wolves. While there there's something, you know, probably seven eighths Timberwolf they're really tricky. The real tricky pets. Like once you, you're around them, you go, okay, well this isn't a dog dude. You, you live with an animal, you live with a totally different animal. It's just not a dog. It's a wise we a grizzly man. Shit man, it's close. Except they don't really attack people. I mean they can if they're treated badly and if they're, you know, if they're in a bad environment for the most part was, you know, Timberwolf seven I don't have a problem with their master's, at least in any dog could have a problem with someone else. Another person, little kids, sometimes scary. Do you think the little kids aren't our animals? It's a real danger. Some of the funniest shit. My Dad had a friend who would come over the nicest guy in the world, but our dog, Larry didn't like the sound of his voice and she would just bark like crazy, just Rah Rah Rah and, and like try to attack him.

Speaker 1:          01:46:07       But she was the nicest dog to everyone. And this dude for whatever reason, just come over and she would attack him. Wow. He probably fucked her when you weren't looking. Probably it's probably was always fucking that poor dog. But you know, the idea is that human beings were genetically engineered by higher power that something came down here and genetically engineered. That's why we look so different than anything else on the planet. You know, we are so different than any other primate. Our skin is soft and fleshy. For the longest time we've been using tools to the point where we can't even remember. We just have to Kinda like look at old stuff and trying to figure out, they have tools then how think they had on that. And they just recently moved it back way, way, way, way, way back. They moved the dawn civilization back

Speaker 7:          01:46:50       almost 6,000 years really recently because they found this huge structure and go Beckley, Tempe. And they, they used to think that back then people were just living in caves and they had these 19 foot tall carved stone columns with animals on them. And then this is like 12,000 years ago. So to put in perspective, ancient Sumeria was thought to be the cradle of civilization. That was the oldest known civilization that we knew of that 6,000 years ago in Iraq. This is 6,000 years older than that. So to them in ancient Sumeria, it was to them go Beckley Tapley was like Sumeria is to us, which is impossible to even wrap your head around where it, what is the Biblioteca? It's, it's called go Beckley Tepi and it's in Turkey. It's really an amazing, amazing stuff. Yeah. They just, I mean this is recent. This was, the guy found this in the 1990s.

Speaker 7:          01:47:46       He was a, uh, some farmer and he's fucking digging in his backyard and Turkey. It's like a goat herder or some shit. And he found like some thing sticking up. It's like, what the fuck is this? And it turns out there's all these giant fucking stone circles of the huge columns and shit all on his land, all his land and all done like way, way, way before they thought anybody was doing anything like this. They had to rewrite the whole situation because of this stuff. They thought people were just hunter gatherers back then. So there's still trying to attribute it somehow to a hunter gatherers, but it doesn't make sense. Right, right. Temple. Yeah, good luck. It's just fucking crazy. Giant stone carved temple. And you want to tell me that people who made this, we're just running around chasing animals. It blows me away that over time, that much dirt and just shit has just piled up to cover that temple and that it's just on some dude's farmland.

Speaker 7:          01:48:36       Well, actually this one I think they believe was covered over on purpose. They believe that a, that someone at some point in time actually covered it. Oh really? Yeah, because because of the nature of the dirt that's covering it, they believe that it's, uh, it's actually a artificial that someone brought it in and covered it. Covered up the stone structures under the ancient backhoe. Yeah. Ain't shit. It's dogs. A lot of dudes who listened to him. That's what it is. That was your number one resource back then? Yeah. But the slaves who built the pyramids, they're like, oh, we've got another project was so, so what we are talking about then was like 12,000 years. That's how long, long time ago. But even then it just doesn't make sense. Like how the fuck where did, where did this animal come from? How'd his hand will get so much different than all these other monkeys?

Speaker 7:          01:49:19       How did to figure out tools, how did it figure out language? Why is it so different? Why is it so different? Its ability to communicate ideas that just somehow or another the aliens came down and said, God, you know how long it's going to take for these fucking monkeys to ever figure out anything. It could take billions of years and it can never happen. They could go extinct. Look, they live outside. They haven't even figured out five. This might not ever work out. They might catch some crazy infection or there might be some spider that's fucking toxic that likes to live in their sheets and eats them alive. You know there might be no chance of these monkeys making it. How about we do this? How about we just inject a little of our DNA and just spice up the process a little bit.

Speaker 7:          01:49:57       And that's the idea. That's the idea that, and that's the, I'll also the idea of, there's a guy named Zechariah Cichon and he wrote all these books about this shit about the ancient Sumerians had written this very controversial stuff, but it's all about the Sumerian text and how the Annunaki we're on this planet that's in an elliptical orbit and every 3000, 600 years it comes near our planet and they hop off and fucking come hangout with us for a little, show us some shit and then disappeared. And then by the time 3000, 600 years rolls around, we forgot about it again. When are we do probably like a week or so if you just got to get online, probably December 21st, 2012. Yeah, right. That's probably the, uh, one of the people think that there's the people that believe there's a planet out there and it's headed our way.

Speaker 7:          01:50:37       They can't see it yet, but it's getting our way and it's giant. What's really scary is that that definitely can happen. You know, planets get hit by planets all the time in the solar system. Right. Or in the universe rather. It hasn't happened. We know it's happening in certain parts of our solar system I can think is Uranus is spinning upside down. Is it one of them? One of the planets is spinning like the, the, the ravens are going the wrong way and they believe more than likely it's because it got fucking nails by another planet. They just fly into each other and shit. Oh, that was hilarious. That happened at Earth Earth. One in earth too. That's how the moon was created. Earth one like 4 billion years ago got hit with some Mara size planet and just slammed into us and knocked off a fucking slab and that created the moon. Useless Astronomy Mano La.

Speaker 4:          01:51:31       That was your last, uh, Thursday night.

Speaker 7:          01:51:33       Yes. Yeah. On the Internet with this. No, man, I, I've been obsessed with all this shit forever.

Speaker 4:          01:51:38       That's what I love about you dude. You're able to like retain all this shit like from, I don't remember anything man.

Speaker 7:          01:51:44       Well you would if it was interesting to you. This, this, this stuff is absolutely fascinating to me. So I retain all sorts of stupid shit when it comes to that.

Speaker 4:          01:51:51       I find it fascinating, but I'll get into an article and I'll read like three sentences and then go make a sandwich and I forget what I was,

Speaker 7:          01:51:56       you know, get some Alpha brain new system from rain sun. Don't get scared. Don't be scared of the Alpha brain. Eat shroom tech and your feet. Would you be for brain in your head and you're not working? Do you sit around and watch documentaries? Like, do you ever, do you ever like purposely sit down and go, okay, I'm going to watch grizzly man. I'm gonna get some fucking material out of this. Do you ever do you do shit? I don't sit down to get material? No. You'd never know. Do you write when, when you, uh, write your standup, do you sit down and go, come on over, sit down. I'm gonna write some stand up. Yeah. You do. Yeah. Do you force yourself to do that? Yeah. How many times a week to try to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:52:30       Uh, if it's good, it's five days a week. Wow. Good for you. And it went from 45 minutes a day to an hour because I figure, I felt like an hour was out of reach, but I could do 45 minutes and then a lot of times I would end up going hour anyway,

Speaker 3:          01:52:45       so then I would just go for an hour. But then, you know, when Shit just starts getting busy, I don't sit down and maybe once a week, you know, but so much. Right. I don't sit down and go, I'm going to go create all this stuff. A lot of it's just like going over old stuff, tightening it up, make it funnier.

Speaker 1:          01:53:00       Have like, I have a bank of old shit that I'll open up a file. You're gonna never did anything.

Speaker 3:          01:53:05       Is there anything in there? I got that. I got the tape recorder that I always am still rocking a tape recorder. It's digital. It's great cause it uh, I just dump it in and it's an MP three and then I listened to it on my headphones or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:53:15       I used to do that until I got an iPhone and the iPhone, iPhone voice recorder app is so much better. I can actually write in the name of what I thought of like that, you know, a blue smurf, Dick boom. And then that's like, you look at it and you can go right to the voice note and you can have Siri play it. You could have say, Siri, play me Blue Smurf Dick and it'll play it.

Speaker 3:          01:53:37       I just got the iPhone now so I don't even, I mean I know about that stuff but he just got it. Are you a newb? I'm a newb voice notes is in there. It's free. It's a free APP. I know, but I mean it's like I have this, I spent the money for this. I'm going to use it. Cause it doesn't throw that into the crowd when someone angers you. That's the other cool thing about that.

Speaker 1:          01:53:56       The iPhone is you can record all of your sets. I record all my stats on the voice thing and it doesn't, you just make sure that you put it on airplane mode so it doesn't get a phone call. Cause if you get a phone

Speaker 3:          01:54:05       cause there was a good that it'll kill you. It'll kill the recording. Oh really? Stops it. Stops it debt. Use Evernote. If you haven't started that, that's awesome. It's a program where you can type your notes up on your computer and it automatically just sinks it with your, your, you have to have mobile me for that though. No, no. This is a free app in the APP store and evernotes on evernote.com I think. And yeah, Evernote

Speaker 1:          01:54:24       work with um, the, the new voice software on apple. Can you talk to Evernote? Evernote has its own recorder built into the program, but it's a recording. It's not a translation. It's not transcript transcription. So I don't think so because the droids have like transcription. Should they have it to different things? Yeah, they have with dragon I think, but or you can do it on Siri. You know what I'm saying is like you don't know. I don't know. Someone out there will know. But if you can, that would be a good move for Evernote. We could talk to it and actually writes it down, you know, instead of just recording it. Yeah. Cause then it wouldn't be any better than voice recorder. Right. You know Neal Brennan, do you know Neil Brown? Huh? He had a great line about, about having something like a piece of paper or you know, having a voice recorder when you're a comic and he goes, it's like I'm fishing for ideas and I catch one in my net and if I don't write it down, it's going to get away.

Speaker 1:          01:55:15       You know? It was like, but I write it down, then I've caught it forever. It's in my net. And I'm like, yeah, yeah. It is like sometimes it's just the discipline to sit down and write shit out because the discipline to write shit out is such a different mindset than the mindset that comes up with something silly. Like you'll come up with something hilarious and ridiculous and that mindset is just like this shit talking. Good time fucking around mindset. And then the other mindset is we might be able to make money off this year and it's just this little piece of gold we got here. Make sure what type this up. You know, it's a, it's funny how uh, they're, they're, they're both completely different mindsets where it's like we know a lot of funny people that like never write their shit down. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:55:55       it's, I'm a better comic when I do that and when I don't, I, I

Speaker 1:          01:55:58       deck man. I always tell everybody that man, I was like, just two jobs man. One job is performing. There's another job. It's writing. You have to do both. If you just try to come up with only shit on stage and that's improving it on stage, you can do that. And I've done that for years. I did that for a long time. I did, I just only worked on my material on stage. But this was like pre internet days, you know, this is much less people that have access to your, your material if you want to like continue to process new shit, come up with new good stuff. You've got it right.

Speaker 4:          01:56:26       I got it. Yeah, that stuff is fine, but if you are sitting down to do it too, that's, that's the way to go because it doesn't exclude the ability to add live on stage. This whole ton of bitch only writes on stage. She told me, you know who that is? He's just a comic, but it's she suck. No, she's funny. She's hilarious. She's really funny. Um, but she only writes on stage and I was just like, I can't, she goes, well, I just can't sit down and write. And it's like, well you got to force yourself to do that. Yeah. Our nobody wants to know why are you so never read a stage. I used to tell him my or only write on stage. I just tell him, did you sit down and write man or road on storage? That's not writing, dude, that's performing. You're lazy. But this is the same guy. It didn't clean the sheets for six months. Sure. Literally, there's, when you're doing a bit like I'll do bits that I've done for years and all of a sudden I come up with a new tag on stage. Like that new tag was only going to come out on stage, not when I'm sitting down in my underwear or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:57:19       Yeah. And isn't it weird that you forget the tag and then you'll be back in the bit and go, Oh, here it is. It goes right here. Yeah. Taglines for folks who don't know, they're like a little gift from the universe. So like you'll be on stage, you've got this perf, I've had jokes that I thought were, I was like, I really liked this joke. And then you have a tagline, boom. And it's like, oh, now this joke's a weapon. And then now this joke is just hit some critical mass. You're like, this joke is good, it's done. No it's not. I've never done. Do you, um, do you have like a schedule? Like what you try to do, like put out shit for like a couple of years, put it down on a CD and then like try to write a whole new schedule or a whole new act.

Speaker 1:          01:57:56       No, I want to get to that point. Yeah. I've been recently just recently doing that over the last few years. My last few specials have done that where I've banned in one and start another one. It's a good US forces you to get after it. Yeah. Cause right now, dude, I'm still doing shit from my second year of comedy. Which Elle, how long have you been in when we met you? Uh, when did we meet? Like 2004, 2005, somewhere around there. Had I done last comic yet? Do you know, know before last time. And I think it was like 2005 or it might've been four. It was, uh, it was during the dark joy Diaz days and what it meant. So Joey Diaz, I've told this story before, I used to only bring one guy on the road with me because you know, I do like an hour and 20 minutes or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:58:39       I don't really, I only need one. And you know, it's fun traveling with one comic sometimes when you're traveling with two comics, like I got to get organized. Like we lost Brendan Walsh in Houston. Perfect example. We got up in the morning, Brendan Walsh, buzzard awake. He just wouldn't fucking wake up. Call this room when, so we're trying to figure out how to get the fuck to the airport. And we had a band in Brendan Walsh we had even behind but with jelly. I just could never be sure he was going to show up. I never knew it. Never knew. And Phoenix was a perfect example. He didn't show up. He was supposed to go to Phoenix and he's just fucking slipped in between the howling.

Speaker 4:          01:59:13       You did like a Thursday night show it at Tempe. Yeah. And then there it was so fucking weird, like after your show they had some weird contest or whatever that Danny Maher asked me to, to do. I don't even know what the fuck it was. Four. And uh, and so the whole crowd stayed you that you'd like sold out Thursday night? The whole crowd's stayed in the first comic who went up just ate dog shit. I don't even know who she was. I mean, just some horrible comic and like half the crowd gets up and walks out and I was like, and I'm last of this group of people. I'm like, fuck this. And then I remember, I see, I saw you sit down to eat a meal after the show and you're sitting there and, and you were even turning the Dan, you're like, why? Why are they, what is the show going on?

Speaker 4:          01:59:52       Like what did I finish the show now? There's another show and the socks and everybody in the audience and everyone's like walking up and leaving. And I got back up and there was like 12 people in the crowd and I was like, shit, I was so pissed. I didn't give a fuck anymore. So I started doing my jokes, but like, people were laughing, but I heard you laughing the loudest from the back. I was like, oh, well this was a victory for tonight. And then you had asked me, you're like, Hey, can you uh, open for me the rest of the weekend? Because it's a Joey Diaz. Is it here? Yeah, that's how we met. That was like two, it was like 2004, but that was maybe my first show was February of 2003. Oh, so it was, yeah. You were really recent rash. Yeah. You were really fresh, I think you'd said you just been doing it a year. Yeah, it was like a tight seven, which was good. You know?

Speaker 1:          02:00:37       Great job, man. For someone who never performed, like, you know, in that sort of a situation on a weekend, a paid show, what's the difference? A page shows a big difference. You know, when people pay, when there's money on the table, they go, who's this guy? When? When is Joey Diaz Get up there? You know, and then they find out that Joey Diaz, I ain't got a lot of your dog and Never Las Vegas.

Speaker 4:          02:00:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:00:59       What are the influence? He did it a bunch of times, but this is back in the dark days. Joe, he's very reliable now. Scares the shit out of me man. Awesome.

Speaker 4:          02:01:06       Like I love him but he scares the shit. I mean I did shows in Tucson with him and it was so afraid to talk to him. Why I did it was a great guy. Well cause he's just like rough and he's not like bad aggressive, but he's just,

Speaker 1:          02:01:18       he gets mad at me for, he'll get mad at me. It was the last thing we got mad at me for Susko Hannah. We'd, yeah, he didn't like my weed. We fucked up and we w someone told me you should grind your weed in a coffee grinder. And I'm like, oh that seems like it would make sense. You just be like, it'd be really quick. Right. But when you do that, it makes it way too fine and it pack these joints so thick you literally couldn't through them. Oh, hi. It was like, we figured it out. We figured it out. After a while you have to use like a regular grind or you can't use a coffee grinder. It's just too much. So we did it with Joey and he got so mad he was swinging and you just give me this fucking Susko Hannah, we'd Susko Hannah.

Speaker 1:          02:01:52       We thought he was talking about Hannah Montana and it turns out the Susko Hannah. Cause that's what he'll say, you know, like he wouldn't call you Josh McDermitt. He would call you a fucking, I like that guy like Josh McDougall. He's fucking hilarious. And he will come up with just a subtle, and I think he does it a little bit on purpose. Subtle fuck up. And the way he still calls Nick Swanson. Yeah, Nick's and Nick Swardson, he calls Nick Swanson. You know, he was listening. Brian Redman, I'm tired of your bullshit. Yeah, he's uh, he's, but, but he's a great guy. He's a national treasure to me guys like that. It's just like, how do you, how do you create a guy like that? You could, you could throw a million people through life and you will never get a Joey Diaz and so rare combination of events that have to take place to get a guy that's just that comical and doesn't give a fuck and just that's it.

Speaker 1:          02:02:42       That's our original human. So hard for someone to really truly be themselves. It's a very difficult thing that we have in this life. This want for self acceptance and sex and money and poor Brian can't get on Wikipedia round. He gets upset about that. There's very few people in this world learn how to just not give a fuck, not give a fuck. And Joey, Joey, just Diaz is, listen dog. If I'm on Wikipedia, I'm on Wikipedia. Whatever dog. I don't give a fuck. Give a fuck. I ain't got time for that. You know what I'm on. I'm on Joey Coco diaz.com go hit me up on Facebook, Twitter. Check yourself before you wreck yourself. Big Dixon Yas is bad for your health. Are you going to any Halloween parties this year that you have to dress up for? Yes. And unfortunately I took my three and a half year old to the Halloween stores.

Speaker 1:          02:03:28       Her, her idea like, Daddy, we have to get you a costume. We have to get you a costume. All right, let's do it. Let's do it. So she picked out this really fucking scary mask. I would go get it for you guys, but it's upstairs. It's really scary. Zombie masks. I'm like, oh, I want to be a Zombie. But uh, I showed it to the, to the one year old and the one year olds just started shaking her head, thrown that away. I can't wear it. And so then I said, well, I'll just play with it with the three and a half year old. But when I put it on, take it off, Daddy, take it off. Like I had to take it off. I'm like, I'm just okay. I'm taking it off and is okay. You put it on again. I put it on and it's just, no, no, no, take it off.

Speaker 1:          02:04:01       Take it off. It's too scary. It's too scary. So, so I fucked. That was my mom dude. She would, she would, she's like the female Andy Kaufman. Right. She would put the, she would put these like ugly hideous masks on and it looked like you'd dumped acid on their face and everything your mom would do that you had do. My mom was fucking crazy. Right. So we'd come home from school and she'd be sitting on the porch. I get wrapped up in a blanket and a hat with that mask on and she's, and we'd be like, hey mom. She was like, we were eight years old, just scaring the shit out of us. That's awesome. Why did your mom want to scare you so bad? I, I don't know, man. She wanted to be like, oh, she wanted to be a comic, but she just never really did

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       anything about it, you know? Wow. Like she's a dude. She's the funniest person. I know, isn't it? Uh, this, uh, uh, for us, for someone who's done comedy, isn't it a sad, sad thing when you meet someone who really should be a comic and they're not doing it? Yeah. All met them. Right, right, right. No, absolutely. Some of the funniest people I know are not comedians not tied to the entertainment industry at all. Yeah, I've met some hilarious regular people. Hilarious. My mom would do some crazy, crazy dark shit like when she was like nine months pregnant with my little brother and I'm like four or five years old. And she says, um, I did something bad. And she's like, come into the kitchen, you're getting punished. I go, go into the kitchen. She sits down on a stool and she goes, listen, you know, do we, what do you want me to punish you? I'm like, I dunno. I Dunno. She goes, I'm going to kill your little brother. Like she tells me this five years old, she sat on a stool, lifted her stomach, had a retractable knife, which I didn't know is we're tracking to get into her stomach.

Speaker 4:          02:05:32       Oh my God, my God. Oh my God. You know. Wow. That was the childhood I grew up, dude. What's that type of shit? That's crazy. So then of course, you know, she pulled up, she goes, this is a retractable knife. And knowing my mom, she would do that shit all the time, but I'd be like, oh, that's hilarious. Like the mother version of those cops, it made those kids sit in the corner. That's like the mother version that your mother is a criminal. It sounds like growing up in the Family Guy House. Yeah. That sounded like so cartoonish. Is your mom still around? Yeah. Yeah. And she's still crazy as fuck. Do you want to get revenge? We could do something really cool. Well don't listen to him. He'll get you locked up in jail. Yeah. I don't find career ahead of you. You're an excellent standup comic.

Speaker 4:          02:06:12       Thank you. Spray. It's called liquid ass. Don't do I love my mom. I next thing you know, someone's dead hanging from a tree. That's how it goes. They don't resent her for any of this stuff, you know, made you probably funny. It's one of the reasons why you are so irreverent. You know, you have such a funny sense of humor maybe. Yeah, no, that's absolutely what it was. Yeah. But she uh, I mean, but now that, you know, there's the sh she had six kids and then you know, everybody's got grandkids and everything so she starts to fuck with the grandkids a little bit. Hairy woman has to be stopped. I'm like God, you know, my brothers and sisters and we're all kind of onto her so we're a little more protective. So like what my sister had a kid like in, in, I dunno, he was like eight months old or whatever he was on in the back in her bedroom like with pillows around them on the bed so he wouldn't roll off or whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:06:57       And we were just sitting around and my sister in law goes, where's Judy? And, and you hear her from the bedroom? She goes, I'm not doing anything, which is scary shit cause my mom's like always doing something. And we went back there and she was just sitting on the bed with the baby and we don't know what the fuck was going on, what, we don't think she was doing anything. But you still don't know with her because she was always worried about what do you think she would do? I don't know. I mean it was never like dangerous. It was never dangerous. It was never like, she's really crazy, a fun, crazy, not like crazy like you, we're not going to let you, would it be around the kids but you, you were worried that she was in there alone with the baby?

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       Well, yeah. Well I think it was more like what will, where is she? Why? Why are we all at her house and sitting in her living room and she's not here doing it. I'm not doing anything which may have just been to fuck with us. Like she would do that too. I get it. It's not bad. Crazy. Trump obviously stabbing your stomach for your five year old was probably a poor choice and judgment, but I knew my mom well enough at that point that I was like, oh she's, she's just kidding around. And once she told me, that's so crazy. I would come home from school, I'd come home from school and she'd like pops a blood capsules and lay on the sidewalk or in the middle of the way and I'd come home. But it, we just step over and be like, get up mom.

Speaker 1:          02:08:13       Like she's trying to get us way that she passed out or something. Oh my God. But what if she actually did it's again, it's just like that fucking shitty share. Your mom cried wolf every day. Every day. Holy Shit, US man. Wow. But look, look at this sense of humor you got out of it. Oh, she loves it. She's milking it to with their friends. And that you're a comic. The comic. Yeah. I told you I was funny. I got funny jeans. It's all over Facebook or was she just knocked it off like she's all over Facebook. Yeah, it's, it's upsetting me. The last time I saw a mom that was into her son's career, it was Stan helps mom at home. Mom was pretty funny. She was hilarious. She, she's to review porn for us on the man show stand helps moms. Hilarious. She was a character man.

Speaker 1:          02:09:02       Really fucking funny lady. Well, my, my mom's the type of woman that if I ever wanted her to do bits and everything she would, but of course, you know, fucked with us a lot, man. I mean, I've got stories, just tons of stupid shit that she would do. That's how you become a comic, I guess though, right? I mean, I don't think you'd become a comic. Well, it can't say, you'd never know. We really, there's no clear path. It could be just someone has a sense of humor and regardless of how nice their family was or they grew up, I, I've had guys with seemingly perfect lives who become comics and they're funny, but it's what if your child had an upbringing? He was a little fucked up. That's a mind for mine. Gold Mine. I haven't really talked about my mom on stage much just because I don't, I don't want to blow it too early because you don't like the longer you do comedy that funny you, you become and you kind of understand your point of view a little bit more.

Speaker 1:          02:09:53       I know that there's such great shit there. I don't want to blow it early, which you just told us on stage. You don't think that could be hilarious on a show or telling what you just told us on stage. The knife. If you were talking about that on stage a little bit and people didn't laugh. So at that may have scared me away too. It's like, I know this is great, but dude, it's hilarious. Problem is people are like, whoa. More horrified then find this funny. But just your sense of humor is a little warped. The you found it hilarious and then you went, well that's fucked up. You just have to relieve them of that. You have to somehow or another relieve them of that ad like right catch up instead of gliding down fries into it. Okay. Mother fucker. As many of you listening, it's just silly, silly, silly boy. Um, so if anybody wants to find

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       Josh, Josh has a fine standup comics travels all over the place and you TV show is retired at 35. We just got an air date. Our second season starts in March 2nd. What network is it on? TV Land. It's a small cable network on by MTV. That's cool. And the vet channel, when I go to sleep to they, they, they do reruns of everybody loves Raymond and Lucy. Lucy. Yeah. Cosby show all that old Lucy you were, you were a radio DJ for awhile. Where at? In Phoenix and Phoenix, Arizona. I would tell you how to do, we got time. Did I ever tell you how I started with that? No. So I was like 14 years old. Do you, do you remember the Tim and Willie Show in Phoenix? Do you remember radio shows at all? Yes, Brian Remembers. Let me, so that was the show. I worked him and Willie, Tim and Willie's country music.

Speaker 4:          02:11:21       Okay. So anyway, we did their show. I did a lot of different, yeah, you would do are you did our show a lot, but um, I did. Every time I did with you, I was a producer, we would go to every time we go. Right, right. And Tim, we ran into Tim at the mall one day wandering around. Yes. Super cool guys. Yeah, they're great. Yeah. So I was like 14 years old and uh, it was right when that Song Achy breaky heart was like, was out and people were starting to make fun of it. You know, the Billy Ray Cyrus Song, you don't tell her keep brick. Yeah. So I would listen to their show cause I thought they just had a funny radio show, but not necessarily because of the country music. I could give a shit. So one day I called up and I'm 14 years old and I requested Achy breaky heart, but I did a funny voice that said, hello, my name is Coco.

Speaker 4:          02:12:05       Can you play a key breaky heart? And they're like, what the fuck is your name? And I said, well, it's Kako. And they started asking me about it. Well, I hadn't thought of like a backstory and all that stuff. So I'm like making it up on the fly. Mcglynn Pilipino and it just, I just moved to America. I love a cubic yard. I'll sing it for us. I started singing it for him and like, uh, they loved it. They're like, hey, call us back anytime. Kako is great. So I'd call back every fucking day, you know, and I'm calling and, and I became this like mini celebrity on their show is Kaka, which they didn't know was a, a fake guy. One of the story I told Hako in in the split second where I was coming up with this backstory, I said I was born in England and my and moved to the Philippines when I was two years old because my father was in the Royal Air Force that way I thought if I ever meet them, that will be, that will be the justification is why I'm a white guy.

Speaker 4:          02:12:58       So you were going to show up a white guy with a Filipino accent. Oh my God, it's brilliant. So they go. So they were like cargo call us anytime and they would play the fucking phone calls. Then I started calling up as a guy named Josh and I'm like, dude, I'm Kokkos biggest fan play his phone call from yesterday. So it's like marketing myself and everything. They're like genius. So they would do these little concerts and like a Garth Brooks would come into town and they would introduce Garth Brooks on stage and they would invite some of the players from the radio show out. And then, you know, Kako was like this big star and he would come out there. And um, in fact, the first time I met them I walked into the studio and they just looked at me and they're like, what the fuck? And they're like, okay, you can drop the accent now. And I'm like, what are you talking about? [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:13:41       character dude really never broke character. And, and this whole bit came about how I was looking for a job. I was in high school and they're trying to find me a job and then they would find me these jobs, but I couldn't go to the job because it was a fucking in high school. And they're like, hey, you know, so they called me Taco. Yeah. You never showed up for your [inaudible] slipped in, you know, Larry. So I had like 10 different characters going on in the show and they didn't know it was all from one guy. And then they said at one point they were like, Kako you should work down here, man. And I got sick. That's when I got scared and I was like, oh, this is my real voice. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:14:19       and their jaws dropped. I thought it was going to get arrested or something. And they're like, no. They're like, dude, you have to work down here. Oh, that's the list. That's how I got the job with them. And so from, Gosh, what was that, 90 93 until 2007 I worked for them. Whoa, that's amazing. We were syndicated for a while. 14 years. Holy Shit. We were syndicated for awhile. I was the producer for that and I would travel the country when I came in and do it, cause I never really remember sitting down and talking to you until I saw you on stage. Yeah, we met, I met you before. That was, it was just like a high walking through the hallway. She was like, Hey, can I get you some water? We're going on the air in 10 minutes. Some of that bull shit. Probably remember this because I must've remembered it when I first saw you do stand up because I'm, I'm remembering it now.

Speaker 4:          02:15:08       Like a glimmer of it and I think you would ask someone from the club, you were like, Hey, who was that that you know, blonde fat kid with the glasses. Who, who, you know who was funny last night, I want him to open for me. They're like, oh we'll see him tomorrow morning and you probably came in and did our show and then you said hey do you want to, it was something like that might have been, it might have been that. Yeah, but I was so long ago. Yeah, it's crazy. Time flies man. We would have all the comics on and I mean I, I've met so many people and no one, I don't ever expect anyone to remember who the fuck I was but I must have been a cool job. You know, like it was great doing standup and well it started a sock and that's why I started doing stand up cause we got bought out by clear channel bump, bump bump.

Speaker 4:          02:15:47       No there it is. And it, that just made me what happened. It's they suck the fun out of it man. What they do? Uh, they just, all the budget cuts, all, you know, like my mind just works in being funny. I just want to be funny. And then they were just like, well we need you to start figuring out ways we can sell advertising time. And I'm like, I'm a fucking writer and a producer. I'm not, you know, talk to the salespeople and just, they, it just made the show not fun. We started out, you were, they wanted you to find, it was like, well what kind of bits can we do that we can sell to an advertiser to this tire company. So this tire company, we've got this advertiser and they want, they want to buy airtime with us but they only want to do it on the morning show. And they're like, so can you figure out like a funny bit

Speaker 1:          02:16:29       we can incorporate tires into? I'm like, no, what the fuck? It's like weird shit like that. And I'm just like, this is not fun. That's a dumb way to approach it. Or they should say, just make it the funniest thing possible and we'll sell regular ads. Go our rating nutty. Our radio station was owned by Buck Owens. You know who buck Owens and country star. Yeah, legendary dude. And he owned like two or three radio stations and we were one of them. So we were like the focus of that company when clear channel came in, they got hundreds of stations that could give a shit about us and it just stopped being fun. So I had a buddy who started doing stand up and I went and did, I was writing jokes for him and then I'm like, oh, I'll give this a shot. And it was more of an outlet for me because I'd have to censor myself on the air.

Speaker 1:          02:17:10       They got this guy, I don't remember his name, but he was like the CEO or something. And he was always like, I think it was like listening to like a 50 cent song and uh, and his daughter was in the car and he like had to turn it down. He's like, we got it. We're censoring everything and we're, you know, clear channel really started putting their thumb on everything. It was so much shit was confetti. It says all that stuff. And so white girls, Jackson, 50 cent, black girls, just a big mess. You shouldn't you, do you need a podcast hunting or said Oh, 100%. And what are you gonna do for me, man, I'll get you that Wikipedia page. Well listen man, you, if you sign up on the desk squad and be a part of his podcast network, they right now are number seven. There's a number seven all yes.

Speaker 1:          02:17:51       Right now he's in the top 10. We great man. Well we started doing this thing live at the Ice House and uh, we aired one half of it on mine and one half of it on his and when we put one half and I, his, his shit jumped all the way. Oh, number six. He's number six right now. So by doing his podcast, automatically you're going to get seen or listened to by hundreds of thousands of people that you wouldn't normally do. So we'll just do it on his and dude, you, you're perfect for this. You've got great stories. You're a fucking smart guy. It'll help your stand up. It's easy as fuck to do. And you could probably set it up where you could do it from your own fucking house and just getting ready to file. Not Hard. No, you got to come over to my house now. Now you have to come to my house. Why am I going to come over to the house, Dude, I'm on a TV show, man. I don't have to go to your house.

Speaker 1:          02:18:43       I think it's your own show too right now. Well, I mean that's what I tell people. No, I'm not. Who's The star? George Segal. Oh, the old dude. Yeah. From just shoot me. Oh, that guy's a great act. Jessica Walter, the old man, the old man, the old woman from some recipe development doing something with like her. She's cute. Maybe it was you. And they were talking about him doing something that George Segal, I think we talked about this Friday night at the ice house. Was that what it was? Oh, that's what it was and we talked about it on the actual live at the icehouse podcast. Yeah, so that one, that one live dice house podcast. That's what did it. So in with us son, Collin dilutes getting juicy comic needs this man. Every comic is this. It's like having your own radio station with no fucking clear channel. Not One. If it can't just step in and tell you there's no way I'd be able to say cut this much on a radio station
