Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. What a week young Jim Norton has had what a week. Guess what a week. Sirius satellite radio has had what a week censorship has had, what a week Anthony Kumina has had, what a week. All the people online that loved the bitch and Piss and Moan and complain and get very excited when something fucked up goes down. Well, something fucked up. Went down when, if you're listening to this, if it's sometime in the future because these recordings will be saved forever. This is today's date is July 17th. Two thousand and 14. Approximately a week ago. Anthony Kumina was taken photographs. Anthony of the opiod Anthony Show, which our pal Jim Norton is also a part of was he was downtown in New York, taking some photographs and from there on it's a bunch of, you know, what, what he says and what I'm sure the woman who beat the shit out of them would have a different story, but he was taking some photographs.

Speaker 1:          00:59          One of one of the photographs was of this, uh, what are those things called when you, uh, those things we scaffold staffing. Scaffolding, who's walking through the scaffolding, a woman was coming towards him. It looked like he was just taking a bunch of cool photos of New York. There's a bunch of them that he put up on his instagram. Anyway, this woman got upset that he was taking a photo of her, probably thought that he was perving, got mad at them, violence ensued. She hit him and he went on twitter and went on this rant about violence, about the black community and their propensity for violence about this woman calling her an animal, which she did, and a serious fire them and which left a fucking huge hole in my entertainment world. The opiod, anthony shows my all time favorite radio show. I listened to it all the time and now all of a sudden it is no more.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Yeah, it's a, you know, it's a huge hole to no one panicked like may cause opie and Anthony both have. Fuck you money. Jim Norton doesn't so selfishly thinking, I'm like, well, there goes everything because the show's done.

Speaker 1:          02:03          You are always going to be great because you're a funny comment and they can always work and you never have to worry about that. But um, it is a crazy thing,

Speaker 2:          02:11          uh, that, you know, all of a sudden like that for things that he said on the show 100 times. I think when I started, I think what happened was he tweeted, like he told, I talked to him multiple times since then he was walking and people don't believe that he was actually taken legitimate New York photos. That was one of the points of contention. People like he was being creepy, but he really wasn't like anthony has had this giant Hubble like camera in the studio everyday for probably six months now he's getting into photography. It's what he's been doing. So that was not unusual at all to hear. He was out and about taking photos. That's legit. And I guess this woman got angry and I, I talked to him and he said that she just said something like, you know, this white boys taking my picture, you wiped by the or whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:53          She said she clocked him and he kept defending himself as he's putting his arms. She is going, don't touch me like, you know, that thing like that a woman might do to prevent you from hitting her. Like you could see how frightening that would be because then people think you're beating on this woman. So he's putting his hand up and, you know, I know well enough to know he's not going to just punch a woman in the phase. So she's doing that and I think a few black guys came round and they didn't do anything to amp, but there were like, you know, don't touch her. So, um, you know, and who has always armed and he's licensed to carry, didn't hit her. It didn't pull out his pistol and uh, went home and I guess was really upset and went out on, like you said, a twitter rampage. And um, I knew it was bad the next morning when I saw it because my ex girlfriend called me and she's like, what happened with Anthony got beat up by a woman? And I don't know. So I looked and I saw the tweets. I'm like, Oh, I actually texted him about one. I don't think I've ever done that before. There was one that I texted her around like, it was you. All right, man, does it? He's like, yeah, I'm fine. I'm Coco was scary.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Wow. Um, yeah. The, the thing about Andy is he's developed this sort of style of communicating on the show where he goes on these long, hilarious, entertaining profanity filled rants and there's one thing about hearing it, but there's another thing of like seeing it in a text form is just not the same.

Speaker 2:          04:24          It looks things don't look good in print. Certain things. And I think what happened was, is in the middle of like when you have either contextual conversation, it's like you have people, there's inflection, there's another guy next to you go, well, hey, what do you mean by that? And then you're clarifying it or it's just, it's a different energy when you're tweeting and you're that mad. Like I think like any type of an assault, even if it's a woman hitting you and it's not life threatening, it's still like an hour later you're like, what the fuck? Just happened like I think it just freaked him out and she hit him a couple times, five times or so, and she sent me a picture of his face and he had like a little. You could see that he had been struck, you mean it wasn't making it up and so he went on and when I looked at the flow of things like I know anthony and I know what he's saying.

Speaker 2:          05:08          He was not calling all black people animals. He wasn't because he's never said that he's talking about a behavior of this woman and I think that what happened was he was so mad and when you're tweeting that aggressively and you've just, you're fucking dealing with this in your head that sometimes things come out jumbled and muddied and like if you know what he's saying, people who don't know him or reading this score, what does he mean? He's saying that there's violence in black people and their animals, like people are putting these pieces of a puzzle together and they're making a picture and it was like, it just. I know him well enough to know that in a conversation. If someone said, are you trying to say black people or animals, he would go, no, not at all. It's a behavioral based to, you know what I mean? Because you said that about white people too. So I mean it was just one of those things where once it was in print, it's even in context, we lie as a country like, you know, like when cancel cancelcolbert came out the, the

Speaker 1:          05:58          activist knew the context that he was making those Asian jokes and didn't give a fuck. She still wanted to sink them. She's like, no, no, I get it. He was trying to, you know, show the difference between the same thing between this and native Americans and how ridiculous it is, but I don't care. So we've gotten to a point now where we, we don't even pretend to not understand the context anymore. We admit that we understand the context of we go after people anyway. So something like this is bound to a to sink you because it can be taken both ways unless you actually sit there and talk to the guy and each tweet has to come out like a film. Each tweet has to be a beginning, middle and end with no explanation needed around it in order to to be survivable. Right. Makes Sense.

Speaker 1:          06:38          Well, you know, want the big, big key to what you said that it could sink you. Well, it only syncs you if you work for a company and in my opinion that's unnecessary and in this day and age it's unnecessary. And I think you guys, and I think Anthony for sure would be far better off with a podcast. Anybody can get a podcast and put it on their phone. Now everybody's phone has a little Jack that sticks into your car and you play your phone through your car. Everybody has that now. I mean, it's not an uncommon thing. It's more common to have that Jack than it is to have satellite radio. Most people have to get a satellite radio thing installed in their car. Most people already have that. Jack, you know, it's just, it's so God damn easy and I get. I bet you could get all the same sponsors.

Speaker 1:          07:22          I bet you could get all the same sponsors and you would have no middleman and you don't look at the studio. It's not, it doesn't take much to put something together. You know, a little bit of time, little bit of effort. You know, you gotta know someone who's an engineer and knows someone who knows how to put this stuff together and set up the microphones. But other than that, what's the difference between this and satellite radio? I'll tell you what, the differences. Nobody can fucking fire you. You can go on some con rampage, that fucking animal and no one, you know, people might say, I'm not downloading your podcasts anymore, but at least you have the opportunity to communicate, to explain yourself. And if the people decide that they don't like your character based on one thing that you said or one rant that you went on, that is their decision, but it's not the decision of a company.

Speaker 1:          08:05          And when things get, you know, companies are squirrely, man, they have fucking shareholders and stocks and they have responsibilities and all you need is a few slash that start webpages and you know, fire anthony and Anthony can. We were going after those sponsors, we're going to let them know we're boycotting, but mostly just noise, mostly nonsense. Mostly just soft targets. But all you need is a few of those in up a fucking accompany will panic. They do. What happens is, you know, it's a billion dollar company, so you get guys like Scott and Jim who runs it, who, you know, they're just the fourth of July weekend was coming and then all of a sudden they're getting phone calls from the New York Post and the Washington Post and all the press obviously has a narrative and they did a shit job. But the Washington Post I thought was the worst defender with the way they covered it because the woman wrote things that was just

Speaker 2:          08:56          really. It was revolting to read what she wrote. She was talking about Anthony saying that these guys came around and she was saying like, oh, well I guess if a bunch of African American or how was. She said, a bunch of gentlemen want to defend someone from defaming, an African American woman. It's okay. Like that's what was happening. She wasn't acknowledging that Anthony was being hit. She acted like these guys had read his twitter feed and not like it. It was just like she read the twitter feed in the future. It was repulsive on this. A woman who looks like the fucking fake deaf interpreter from Mandela's funeral meeting on Anthony. But uh, it's a meme, a meme. He's rules, but the company, these guys just getting, all of a sudden they're just there. They're harming. They're getting phone calls in the office the day before vacation.

Speaker 2:          09:40          So what are your comments? And they probably weren't even that familiar with it until they're getting calls from the paper and they're like, well, what do we do with this? And then this is what the press does and this is why you got to hate that. Because I think Sirius was going to try to write it out, that's my opinion, because they knew a holiday weekend was coming and uh, this is purely a guess because no one was saying anything and then all of a sudden the press starts going, we have not had a comment from Sirius satellite radio. So we're assuming that they agree with Mr [inaudible] opinions. They do this sneaky shit to push you into defending yourself. So now the company with shareholders, like you said, it has to go, well, how do we tell people that we don't agree with? So it's not like the presses the made them do it, but the press understands how to corner you into giving a statement, a definitive statement because they know that you're not used to this. They know that these guys come into work in management positions are not used to getting phone calls going. How do you feel about this statement and that statement, you know, it was really, it was a very frustrating thing when I saw what the press did with that. That to me has always been my biggest complaint is with always will press this. There's

Speaker 1:          10:42          no nuance to the way they report on certain things like this because there's. There's nuance to this, especially if you look into it and character, if you in context where either if you understand that guy and you look at him, look, there is a problem with violence in the black community to pretend there's not a problem with violence in the black community is to pretend that there aren't insane amounts of murders going on in Chicago to pretend that there's not issues with the amount of black people that are in jail. That percentage of the population now are those economic problems. Are those problems related to upbringing? Are those pro? Yes. Education? Yes, absolutely. There's a lot of fucking disparity. There's a lot of problems with poverty. There's a lot of problems with the structure of our culture itself and that you could attribute a lot of those problems to racism, to racism in the way that funds are allocated. The way that you know, the attention that society puts on impoverished communities, absolutely institutionalized, yes. But to pretend that it's not a problem is ridiculous. It's fucking ridiculous. So when he's taking a picture of some chick and she starts punching him, I think he's allowed to talk about the problem with violence,

Speaker 2:          11:54          with that community, with the community that this person is from. That's beating him up. Did he do it the right way? No, absolutely not. Did he do it in a way that could be misconstrued or construed or interpreted as racist? Absolutely did. Yeah. He did. He fucked up. He did it the wrong way. He probably shouldn't have done it on twitter. He published it and made a video. It probably should've made a video explaining, showing what happened to him and explaining what goes on. Explaining this 140 fucking characters things is a big part of the problem. Do it. Absolutely. That's exactly what it was. Because Anthony is so good at, uh, clarify whatever you talk about race or a million other things, whether it's religion, it, it's so hard to make your point without stepping in shit. And then having to go off on 50 a digression, they go, no, that's not what I meant, or no, that's not what I meant like in.

Speaker 2:          12:43          That's the worst part of the disgusting stuff is that people jumping on this side. What are you saying that all people do? All black. No, I'm not. So in order to be able to, to get your point across, you have to walk a narrow. You almost have to close people's argument doors like a get smart episode as you're walking this way, your point gets through. And Anthony is a genius at doing that, a genius at it because we've debated race so many times, uh, on, on the show at him and Patrice, we'd go back and forth and, and Patrice loved Anthony because he said Anthony is an adorable racist. You know, Patrice was so funny when he never knew, never was upset by Anthony's opinions because Anthony would listen to him and they would go back and forth. Half The Times Patrice was right and half the time anthony was right.

Speaker 2:          13:26          But on twitter, I think like in that emotion when you're saying x, Y, and Z, he, I don't think he did as good a job as he should have done of closing those doors behind him, almost like sealing off things that people can get to you on because he was so upset because he had had a physical assault. And I know it sounds like I'm talking in circles and just defending my friend, but I've been with him for 10 years all in this medium of totally uncensored. And I'm telling you, I know him well enough to know that he's like, he's got weird things where he'll talk about race and people misinterpret them and I've talked to him privately and the guy does not hate black people and I know that that's just all his friends defending him. But I'm telling you that he does not because I know him well.

Speaker 2:          14:07          And then to hear people going, he hates black people. It's like he's not afraid of being misconstrued or interpreted as racist. He's not afraid of it by saying what he really believes is his opinion about certain aspects of a group. Whatever race, uh, gender, whatever it is, he's not afraid of speaking his mind about things because he's got them. Fuck you money. That's a big part of it. And he's got 150,000 guns. Those are the two things. And you know, a big part of it that drove me fucking crazy is people are not, they're not taking into account the reaction that someone has when they get assaulted. Because when you get hit by someone, some fucking stranger that you don't know, hits you as. Especially when you've got a garden, you've got a fucking bullet

Speaker 1:          14:52          gun, you've got a thing inside you that has explosions, you press a trigger, explosions propel bullets and they end lives instantly. And Anthony's an expert with one and he has it on him at all times and he's getting hit and he's like, what the fuck? And so he gets on my fucking animal con bitch, fuck you this back. You know, it's getting hit is a very disturbing thing. It's, I mean, there's one thing to get hit and it's getting hit in a sparring session is infuriating with people. You know, I've seen people go fucking crazy because they get choked out in a Jujitsu session, getting punched his way more traumatic, getting punched by a stranger multiple times for taking a fucking photograph. I don't know what the exchange was between the two of them. I don't know if, if he was saying something that was infuriating, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          15:44          I wasn't there. You know, I'm not gonna pretend that was there, but man, you've got to take into account the reaction that people have when you hit them and it to me, and again, I hate to keep going back to the press, but they didn't focus on the fact that he like, he handled himself properly in that because I know I would have. I don't know if I would have pulled the gun in that moment, but I'm a panicky pete, that I would have just what other guys were coming over. I would have at least brandished it and he acted physically responsible, like as a, as a, as a fucking guy with a pistol on him because people get shot all the time for dumb arguments and dumb things. He, he handled himself absolutely right and lost his cool. Once he got home and people didn't take the press, didn't take that into account.

Speaker 1:          16:24          They harped on the fact that he didn't get a police report and I wished he had. Now, in hindsight, because they're all going, Mr Colby did I get a police report, but here's the deal. Had he gotten a police report, they would have just ignored it. They wouldn't have said, well, at least he got a police report. They would have glanced over the fact and then said, yeah, well I can get a police report. So they were just using that as a reason to kind of ignore the fact that he got hit. They're like, we didn't see a police report. All the press harped on the fact that he didn't get a police report, but answer response was, look man, you know, I know enough to know that me getting hit by some lady in Times Square is not a fucking priority for NYP ed. Who's worried about terrorists.

Speaker 1:          16:59          Yeah. Especially if he's fine. I think there's a real issue also with with the press, with a lot of people in the press, I'll clarify that. What they're trying to do is they're trying to close those getsmart doors as they write a piece as well and as they're writing a piece, they are also trying to placate all the people that are going to be up in arms about their opinions. If they could possibly be supporting a racist, if they could possibly be taking your side, agreeing with him, seeing his point of view, they can be misinterpreted or they could be interpreted as being racist as well, so they have to worry about that as well. Especially if you're with a liberal rag. You know, if you have a very liberal newspaper that you work for and they have a clear agenda, which a lot of them do. The Washington Times does, right. I'll watch the Washington Post rose. There's a lot of them that have a liberal slant and if you are reporting for them, you know, and it's something like this that's very controversial and something where there's. There's a bunch of things that automatically have like a knee jerk reaction to them and this is one of them knee jerk reaction to what's conceived as racist perceived as race.

Speaker 2:          18:02          Yes. And another thing that they do that's even, that's even more enraging is what people who write for the press now have to do is not just reporting what happened. It's how do I editorialize under the guise of being impartial. And they do that a lot too and that I don't like either. It's like that to me is the worst crime they commit actually if the editorializing as they're going along. Like it's legitimate. Like uh, like NBC and I'm on a Zimmerman Fan. Either aunt was a big supporter. Zimmerman, I thought Zimmerman should have went to jail for something. I didn't know what legally I have no ground to stand on, but I kind of thought he was a con. But uh, but, but not a guy who was out to commit a murder either. I thought there was a line in between, but whatever, like NBC edited that tape, like, ah, can't do that. There's no reason to do that unless you're pushing something, but they're doing it under the guise of being impartial and I'm sure they've done it plenty of times to vilify blacks. I'm not saying they have it.

Speaker 1:          18:57          He lost that lawsuit, you know? I know he did on. It's crazy. It's absolutely nuts. I don't know why the news has such a different level of what they can get away with and what they can do because they're seen as doing a public service. In my opinion though, I think they lost it because everybody was hating that guy and they just didn't want him to win something on top of this. The fact that he still has his freedom. The kid lost his life. Right? I think he's us. I think he's a sucky fucking security guard. That's what I think. Yeah. I think if you're going to look at that guy and find fault and what he did, it's how did he handle the situation and what a more confident, competent person have handled it the same way. Like here's a perfect example. My friend, big John Mccarthy who was a cop.

Speaker 1:          19:34          I guarantee you, you know the referee. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You referenced caught. That guy was a cop for a long time, but great guy. But he knows how to handle shit. If, if big John Mccarthy saw that kid walking in the neighborhood, he probably would've said, how you doing man? Everything cool. You know, had a conversation with them. Everything would've been fine. Like even if the kid got up in arms or got mouthy with him, he would have probably calmed him down, you know, without having to get into some physical altercation. Not only that, the kid wouldn't have been able to mount them and bash his fucking head off the ground because he's physically incompetent. Right? If you're going to fucking could patrol a neighborhood, you can't do it just with a gun. Can't be. You can't have the only. The last resort is your only resort.

Speaker 1:          20:14          You key can't physically defend himself. He's out of shape. He's soft and doughy and he's not physically able to hold that guy off, but yet he's put himself in this position where he's like a security. He's the force of the truth of the law. You can't do that, you know you're not. You're not qualified for that job. He's just not. So when that kids on top of them bouncing his fucking head off the curb, look, I don't see any way out for him other than using a weapon right when that kid is beating the shit out of him, but he should have never gotten to that position. He shouldn't have. It should have never escalated to that. You tell me. The only way to people can communicate like that is it comes into violence. No, it, it's how do you deal with it? How do you communicate? How did you address this person? What did you say when he talked back to you? What did you say? What was. What were the exchange of words? You know, when those, those things. There's a big difference between. There's a video that we played the other day. What was the. Do you even lift bro? You ever see that guy? The Russian guy? Is He Russian?

Speaker 3:          21:14          There's even a worse one. There's practice. The Pakistani kids though in New York where the Bronx, the police chief and Bronx, New York was like, stop doing it. You're going to get killed. That like these two kids that just go on youtube and they go up to people in horrible neighborhoods and are like, hey man, you got a problem while he's holding a calculator and he's just trying to be funny, but these guys are just bashing their heads in and stuff and so the bronx chief police or something like that said, look, stop it, but yet these videos more pop.

Speaker 1:          21:40          My point is if you watch those videos, the guy, he comes up to people that like look like your workout and goes, do you even lift bro? Look how small you are, and some people handle it. Great. Some people go like, man, I don't even don't pull it up. We don't need to see it. Some people go, yeah, I mean I don't even lift. You know, I guess I'm small and then they laugh and they walk away and some people like threatened them. Like it depends entirely on how do people interact with each other. And I think that's what we don't know about the anthony situation. That's what we don't know about the Zimmerman situation. It's not just about what went down, it's about how did it all play out, how could it have been avoided?

Speaker 2:          22:19          There's little subtleties in language like when Jonah Hill is apologizing recently, um, and he's, he's obviously not a homophobe. We just got mad and said, suck my Dick, faggot. It was a stupid thing in a moment. And he's said the tonight show. And again, he's just apologizing. I don't think he never had to deal with something like this. And he said something. He goes back, the intent doesn't matter, it's the word, the words. And it was like, again, I know you're on the spot in that moment and I'm not going to crucify the guy, but I wish I was there. So I could just appear on the seat next to him. Like in that woody Allen scene, when the guy walks out to correct a guy online and go, no, the intent is everything. Because if the words matter the next time somebody said the fucking giants killed the jets, while we better call the police. Oh, that's right. It's the intent. We understand every, every, every single interaction or phrase has an intent behind it, which, which doesn't always come through in the written word. It's just, it's an inflection.

Speaker 1:          23:07          Something that you and I had a conversation about with the Tracy Morgan situation with people pretending that what he was saying when he was on stage, you know, that he was going to stab a sign of

Speaker 2:          23:18          like his whole act is filled with him saying ridiculous shit. Yeah. This is not a statement. It's not an affidavit. He's making court. You're, you're taking it out of context because it's the soft target. If you do that, yes, I'm going to stab my son because he's gay as a statement of fact, or at the, at the end of a political rally is a pretty awful thing to say, but if you've opened up with I'm going to get you pregnant and I'm going to mold shit and make a hat out of it. It's kind of hard to take any one statement go, well that's the serious one, but that's again, that's that purposely ignoring context or even when you can't ignore it, saying, yeah, we understand the context. We don't fucking care. It's just soft targets. People find soft targets and those targets. Look if they're all ganging up on anthony too.

Speaker 2:          24:00          That's the other thing. I'm not saying Boo Hoo Anthony. Let's pay attention to what's really going on. If you're writing an article out of the blue for no reason about Jim Norton, you, you're the only guy. I think Jim Norton is a despicable person and you write this article, you have the option to respond to that and you can go, Whoa, who are you, Mr. reporter Dick Wad. Let's take a look at you, and then other people can take a look at him too, but when everybody's piling on, it's a free for all. It's a free ride and then you're there flailing wildly. All the Louis Louis ck actually raised a really good point about that. When something has happened, he goes, you know, you have to remember to. Everybody's not googling you like everyone is not googling Joe Rogan or Jim Norton or Anthony Cool, like so you're seeing a every result about yourself and it appears overwhelming, but the reality is like people may be reading news day or the post or the Gawker or vice or whatever they're reading, but they're not reading every single article on Anthony Kumiai or on Jim Norton, so that's where the overwhelming thing is sometimes misleading because people are all reading little snippets of it, but when the company is getting calls from again, five or six different outlets to them it feels overwhelming and like, what the fuck do we do with this?

Speaker 2:          25:09          Because this wasn't on the air. So I think that's where, and again, they haven't discussed this with me, I'm. I'm purely speculating because to them, if it was on the air, I'm guessing they would have said, well that's what he does on the air. But they're not looking at it like, well, he was reacting to being hit. I think they just were like, oh, okay. We got a fire. I think that's why they. They kind of just reacted very quickly. I think they fuck themselves. I really do. They fuck themselves because they were supposed to be the place where it was free speech. This is the wild place, but where the fibrous w was the virus channel member now with Sirius Xm talk. That's it. Sirius xm talk. We have to rename it but we don't know what would they have? They have to. They're not asking for my input.

Speaker 2:          25:48          I don't want my name on the show like I want. I want to be on the show, but I don't, I don't want to be open. And Jimmy, I don't people to feel like I'm jumping into Anthony's seat because I'm not. If they call the OPI show a much more happy with that because that's what it was before he met Anthony Columbia. I would call it. We Miss Anthony. Uh, yeah. That would be kind of a or Tony will call it Tony so they don't know who we're talking to. Bring where's Tony be sneaky. But it is a horrible. And it's like people get mad at me and opiod and say we don't. And I tried to say like, we didn't mad at you for what? Because the, they, they people think that we're like a bunch of teenagers hanging out and like you guys should walk and support and it's like, first of all, you dumb mother fuckers that say that Anthony I've talked to, he wouldn't walk and he told me you got to make your money like, and it's all a and B, I'm under contract.

Speaker 2:          26:36          I can't just walk. I have three more months in the contract. And opie tried to clear this up on the air. Like if we just walk out, if they fire us and we just walk and say a bunch of more subs leave because they realize like, wow, the show really is gone. Then all of a sudden serious wants to take action on us for breach. It's a whole fucking legal. People just don't get that part of it. And they think that we're fucking anthony. You know, who doesn't think we're fucking Anthony Anthony? He knows we're not fucking. Only an idiot thinks you're fucking anthony, but there's always going to be idiots with opinions office. And I'm fine with that when people say like, dude, I love you and ob, but I got to cancel because I'm staying with Anthony. I don't get mad at those people.

Speaker 2:          27:11          Or if people like I'm going to keep serious and I'm also going to listen to ant. I don't bog. I'm fine with that too because I get the emotion, like whatever they got to do to support and is cool with me, I want them to stay because my, in my ideal world, they listen to me and opie and then they fucking listen to Anthony. There's no competition. I'm not going to. We're not like here you don't mention Anthony. You don't want to fucking show comes out. I'm going to, I'm going to tweet it because I want him to succeed because he's one of my closest friends. It's gonna succeed. It's going to. If you, you know, just.

Speaker 1:          27:41          He's an entertaining guy. He's an interesting guy in the platform of the Internet is so free and easy and he's already got a full professional setup at his house. Yeah. People don't know if you've never seen. One of the main reasons I started this podcast is because of live from the compound, because he said a fucking greenscreen in his house, a professional studio, and he was playing images behind him of like the city of La. He had a green screen, I mean a beautiful green screen like professional broadcast quality cameras, like the whole deal. I was like, that's amazing and that slowly but surely led to what you're seeing right here. Like him doing that while he was already on Sirius and Sirius tried to stop them from doing that. They got it. They gave him a hard time about that. Yeah. Yeah. That was it. I think that was a contractual issue too where they're like, look, this is the medium you're on. But eventually they're like, they're of like, let them do it and they're like, what do you think is going to go down September when your contract is up

Speaker 2:          28:40          October fourth? I don't know. I mean like I love the Gig, I love performing, but you love the Gig. The same with Anthony not being there. Of course not. No, no. I mean, I mean the idea of performing either alone or with other people. I want this thing to work because I want my own thing. Like I've done so many things being the vice thing, Jim Norton show, I want to have my own thing too, because you feel like a more complete performer when you're not always with Opie and Anthony or Colin Quinn or Louis Ck or Amy Schumer's put me on her show. Like I don't always want to be on somebody else's thing. Right. Um, so I love the idea of performing on the radio. I love doing it with Opi. I love doing it with opie and anthony more because now let's say the same thing of opiod left.

Speaker 2:          29:22          Like I honestly do love being a part of that radio show. Being without anthony is difficult and it will be with say the same thing. It's just like, it's hard to realize how much space a person fills in your life until they're not there. Like, I mean, we all know Anthony's a comic gene. That's easy to say, but it's like the little moments, like when there's that chair, I mean I'm, I'm close. I said closer to um, to anthony that I do to you everyday, five days a week for 10 years and that was just gone and it's really hard to get used to that empty seat whether he's saying something funny or whether he's just doing a stupid Iraq joke or a little aside or just pipe. It's like this whole fucking vacuum of this, this great powerful brain that used to be, you know, a foot away from it.

Speaker 2:          30:08          Yeah. Or just talking about things. He's a fascinating guy. He's got a lot of information in his head. He can talk about anything for any length of time, anything he could be. And we've said that, like I've said this before, Patrice said that anthony can access funny faster than anybody he'd ever known. Like he just had the ability to access being funny immediately on any subject. Like if you talking like, you know, he was a tin knocker. He had put in air conditioning vents and he can walk you through that in a fascinating way. And be funny about it and be captivating with it. Me, I just die telling a story. I lose people in me. It's a joke I've done, but I meant the sincerity of it that if I was on nine slash 11 on the, if I made it out of the first tower, I would lose people halfway through the story.

Speaker 2:          30:58          Like I just have no ability to go from the beginning to the middle to the end and keep people locked in. Did you guys have a meeting with serious after this? No. No, opiates. We talked to Scott. I talked to Scott on the phone and he goes, look, we're going to try to move forward with you and open and see how it happens. He goes, worked through it organically on the air. They didn't tell us how to do it. They didn't say don't bad mouth the company don't. He said worked through it organically on the air and what we'll see what happens. So I mean see what happens if they completely closed the idea of anthony ever coming back. I don't think so. Um, and, and they've given me no indication. So I'm careful how I say that because I don't want the fans getting like I'm putting false hope out there, but I'm just being truthful is it doesn't feel final to me and maybe that's my own denial or my own lack of willingness to admit that this thing could be over.

Speaker 2:          31:47          Like it was really sad, man. I last I saw, I don't think I went to his fucking fourth of July party and I was very depressed driving home. Like I know I'm going to be okay financially and I know like, Hey, there's other show could take off. Hey, you got stand up. Hey you got. But just the idea that this thing you love to do, like this chapter is closed. Like just fucking depresses me. Depresses me to listen to it. I can imagine if it was me every day, day in day out being a part of it. Every time I did it, I loved it. I mean I had a great time doing your show. So my favorite radio show of all time, without a doubt. It's a real conversation. You have real moments and the laugh somebody played for me recently are, they sent me a link to Jim Norton's laugh compilation.

Speaker 2:          32:28          There's just times where people have made me laugh on the show and I listened to part one and two because the point is not me laughing. It's the things. And in most of those laughs I've come from anthony more than any gas or anybody and some of the things that he did a thing recently or years ago that I heard two days ago where we were talking about people who have shot themselves in the head and survived. And Anthony did the voice of the guy who survived and he just wanted an immediate. He became the guy who had shot himself in the fucking head in survivors talking about how he just has a more positive outlook and I'm howling listening to it in the clip and I'm listening to it. Uh, uh, like, you know, two days ago. And I'm laughing all over again. I'm like, I forgot that bit ever existed, but God is cocksucker made me fucking laugh. And I'm not talking about him like he's dead. But I mean that's how valuable a thing he is. Like I said, I can't listen to two radio. They made a big mistake. I think they made a bigger stake for them for a

Speaker 1:          33:26          couple reasons. One, I think they made a big mistake because I think it's going to open the door more to the Internet because people are going to look at that as the only last remaining true free speech option because that's what it is. Look, you can. You could say you don't like this podcast. You can decide that I'm offensive. You can do it, but you can't stop it. I mean you might, even though the host might say, we don't want to host you anymore, I'll find another host. Those sponsors might say, we don't want to be your sponsor anymore. Well guess what I'll do with no sponsor. We did it with no sponsors for years. This is the only real option where you're your own producer, your own director, your own. You're the whole thing. You're the performer. You're the whole thing. That's where it's sad because just like a standup is entirely responsible for your act.

Speaker 1:          34:15          You put on stage, if you had some producer hovering over your fucking shoulder every time you wrote a bit, every time you were thinking about putting together a set list, every time you are going up and doing a show, they would review it afterwards. That would be gross. That would take all the fun out of being a comic. Yeah, it would be awful. I mean that's why I'm a bad collaborator because you're so used to having absolute and ultimate control of things. So you're a perfect example. Think about you and you as a successful performer and personality. Who the fuck would have ever thought you could have made a mainstream career out of talking about your love of trannies, talking about shit and Piss and shit and in each other's mouths and peeing on people. Monster rain. Just look at the honest things that you've tackled because you're honest because you're funny.

Speaker 1:          35:02          If you had to vet that through somebody else, if you had to have that filter through some sort of a mainstream producer, it would've never happened. Never work. You're absolutely right. I mean, that's why you're right though. The Internet is the last place where at least for now, who the fuck knows what happens with that, but all that stuff you did, you did on serious, serious at a different approach. When they first came out, they. They've slowly but surely clamped down from that Condoleeza Rice incident. That's where it was like, Ooh, you could get in trouble for something that someone says on a radio show that isn't even like

Speaker 2:          35:38          a guest. I mean, isn't even one of the hosts, right? He was at your show could get canceled, a homeless guy and they were going to fire us. That Eric Logan sailor that was accent. It wasn't sure it was, and this is how. What happened? The fucking the NAB National Association of broadcasters. Somebody on that side I think was what was pushing it. Could the story went on? Drudge and Breitbart, will this hurt the merger? And again, the guys who ran the this, when they're about to merge, will this injure the merger? And Man, it was a billion dollars at stake and then it wasn't going to hurt the merger, but they fucking panicked. And these are all different people that are in charge now. Uh, but they're like, well, uh, and they don't know how to deal with stuff. So they get the phone call. The Guy Nate I think was running at the tower cupid's Arrow.

Speaker 2:          36:21          What do you think of this thing? They said a homeless guy said he wants to rape Condoleezza Rice. And like he, he's worried about a billion dollar merger and I'm not defending them suspending us. But I try to put myself in there like, and this is a guy I mentioned, Louis because he's a good, he's a good nonemotional reactor to things and he'll look at things and go, well they're just trying to do this. And like Louis will give you a very logical reason as to why something's happening. And it's like, yeah, I wish I would've seen that. I get too angry and emotional and you're like, fuck that. And they're say. And then I'll go like, okay, that's a billion dollar company. They're not used to this. And they hear this guy wants to fucking first lady raped Bush or George Bush and they're laughing about merger. Might be threatened to fuck, get rid of him.

Speaker 2:          37:07          And he just panics. Isn't it fascinating though that you're talking about a billion dollar company? Okay. Sirius xm billion dollar company. Okay. What exactly are they selling? What they're selling is content. Who delivers that content? Guys like opie and Anthony, guys like Jim Norton. They're selling your ability to be entertaining. Other than that, it's just music. How you, how do you have a billion dollar company that's just selling music? Well, I don't. That's where my argument would be to. It looked the talk thing is the last, like the last thing you guys have, and this is for any evil terrestrial radio to the last thing. You have his original talk content and their point back would be, well that's a great thing that we have, but we also have, um, whether it's a celebrity, people doing shit or we have sports that you can't get across. Let's say we have the MBA, we have a major league baseball game. I'm just saying that's what they would say. Yeah, but nobody's paying for that. Let's be honest. They're paying for stern. They're paying for Opie and Anthony. I hope so, man.

Speaker 3:          38:07          Especially since spotify and Pandora, they used to be. I like Sirius Radio because they had the thirties to forties to fifties, whatever and all the different radio stations. Nowadays you just put spotify put anything you want and as you know.

Speaker 2:          38:18          Yeah, I mean I. I get almost all my shit from itunes. I don't ever listen to music in my car anymore unless it's coming off with my phone. I just just, I don't need to. You don't need to anymore. You don't need them anymore. And the last thing that's exciting is things like stern and things like

Speaker 1:          38:36          opie and anthony where you can have a guy who is just freewheeling, same whatever he wants, doesn't have to worry about language restrictions. Does it have to worry about anything? And the fact that he can get fired for saying the same things that he's always said on his show to saying them in a text message that they're so ignorant that they can't recognize that this is. You're taking it out of context. You're taking it from a guy who just recently been assaulted. You're taking it from a guy, probably had a couple of drinks in him when he said it and he shouldn't have done it. He fucked up. He definitely shouldn't have gone on that twitter rampage. He should have said it on a video

Speaker 2:          39:09          and you know what podcast or on the show up on the shelf on the show. It would have been perfect. It would've been a great episode. Oh, that would been fun. And, and Keith Robinson pointed out, he's like the teasing. We could've given him a that teasing beautiful but it. But I don't know if that's something that will ever change. Like they may at one point, we do kind of understand that maybe he's, you know, he's a valuable asset to the like, you know, again, I don't, I don't know why I don't get that feeling because they haven't said to me we'll bring him back. They really haven't and I never want to give fans. I'm not trying to keep fans from who it literally is just a feeling, a gut feeling. He didn't drop any bombs. He didn't go on this and I've talked to him enough to know what his intent was and maybe I'm just naive dummy in me, but I keep thinking, man, he should come back, he can come back. Just give it some time and I just keep hoping for that. I think he

Speaker 1:          39:58          can come back. I think if they gave it some time, he definitely can come back in the context of what he said wasn't that bad. You know? I wouldn't have been happy if it was my company and I had shareholders and all that jazz, but I obviously I would never be that guy anyway. I would never be a fucking head of a big company. I'm just not built for it, but you got to recognize the entertainment quality, you know the entertainment aspect of that guy, the entertainment possibilities of keeping the show together. It's his. Without that all, you have a stern, you know, obviously you guys are still together and they'll still be a great show, but it's not the same show and you leave open the door for anthony starting his own thing, some wildly successful thing on the Internet, which also look, if someone comes along and they put together some sort of an advertising budget and they say, hey listen, we would like to do the top.

Speaker 1:          40:46          We'd like to host the opiod. Anthony podcasts on the Internet will take x percentage of the. The advertisers. We've already got it lined up. We have a big launch. We're going to do it around thanksgiving. Someone's going to fuck a Turkey. Live on the air, you know, whatever. You know what I'm saying? You start, you start doing. You come up with some idea to do something completely free and wild on the Internet. A big advertising push, buy billboards, Time Square, you know, fuck serious. We're doing it on the Internet, you know ONA is back and it's free. Downloaded online. You don't need to pay for a subscription anymore. Anybody can get it on your phone. I mean you could do it. The way we do it, we're, we're available on were were available online as an MP. Three were available from itunes. We're available on Stitcher, on Youtube, on Ustream, on Vimeo.

Speaker 1:          41:31          If you just did something like that, it would be. Yeah, maybe you're right, man. Who we have thought about it and again, we're up in October fourth, we don't know. We honestly don't know what we do from here. Like again, opiod, I are doing the shell, bringing guests in and just performing and it's like we both feel the fucking last go through. Vice do it all through vice. There'll be a wonderful promotion vehicle to for guys to do. Opie and Anthony Live through vice. They'll set you up with a studio. Do it all online, do the show as a video online and through the show. Have it available as a podcast. Free downloads. They provide you with advertisers. Wouldn't be hard to do. Shane could hook that up in five seconds. They can make one phone call and it would be. The wheels would be in motion. I would, I would, uh, I would love to do that. And that's a guy that you, you know, like she could get really crazy and everyone's going to be fine.
