Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Three, two, one and we're alive. How are you sir? Hey, I'm great. Thanks for being here man. I really appreciate it. It is the coolest thing I've done really well. You know, I remember that far back. That's pretty cool. Um, I watched a ted talk on, um, what was the word that you used? A lester land. Lester. Lester. Yeah. And uh, it felt hopeless. Like if, if for people who don't know what I'm talking about, could you just give like a brief synopsis of the way you were describing how complete completely rigged our election system is and, and what, what it actually takes to be elected and how much of the time they spend is involved in raising money and why? Yeah, so we've got a system where we have a money primary and then we have a regular election. And in the money primary to compete, you got to raise tons of money to be able to fund your campaign.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       And when you raise that money, you raise it from a tiny, tiny fraction of the 1%. So, unless in the, in the Ted talk about lester known him and I said, you know, imagine a place called Lester land where basically it's the lesters who rule. And by the lesters I mean the same proportion of people named Lester as in the United States. Right now there's about 150,000 Americans named Lester. I'm one of them. But here we are, the Leicester. So imagine a world ruled by Lester land, um, because that's essentially the world we have because of the way we fund our campaigns, because there's about 150,000 men who give even just a maximum contribution to one political candidate. Um, if you ask who the number of people who give the maximum contribution over the course of a campaign, meaning in the primary and the general election, it's about 22,000 Americans in 2014 who gave the maximum contribution to one political campaigns.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       So what that means is it's a tiny, tiny fraction who are the most important funders of political campaigns and candidates for Congress. And members of Congress spent 30 to 70% of their time sucking up to this tiny, tiny fraction. And so is it any surprise that you see congress bending over backwards to keep those guys happy? Because they know without those people, they don't have a shot at getting back into congress. And the way you were describing it as when you were saying it as lester land, it was like, imagine if we were this screwed up. That was essentially what you're saying. Yeah, but we're more screwed [inaudible] lester land. Yeah, we're more, that was a disturbing video because I was realizing it was a merging as you were speaking. I was like, wait a minute, is it that bad? Yeah. You know, it's, I actually, since that video have come to think it's even worse, right? Because, uh, clarence

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       land, well, it, it could be worse because it's even smaller number. And if you look at the number of Super Pac donors, you know, the really critical super packed hundred, about a hundred people who gave more than half of the Super Pac money in the last presidential election, you know, a hundred, you know, so this is a really tiny, tiny number. Um, but what this tiny number represents and the way we fund campaigns is the extraordinary inequality on that dimension. Right? But since, since I was focused on the money, I've, you know, more recently started thinking about the other screwed up dimension. So think about gerrymandering. You know, we gerrymander districts in America so that about 85% of the house seats in the United States Congress are safe seats. Which means if you're a republican in a safe seat, democratic district, your views just never mattered to the congressperson. Cause that vote of a Republican will never determine who's in Congress or a Democrat and safe seat Republican district.

Speaker 2:          00:04:01       That's, that's the same. Okay. But that doesn't mean those congress people are not afraid about reelection. Of course they are afraid about whether there'll be reluctant, but they're afraid not of a Democrat running against a Republican. They're afraid of an even more extreme republican running against the incumbent Republican. So what those incumbents in those safe seat districts do is they obsess about what the extremist in their own party cares about. So the extremists on the left and the right have this ability to leverage extraordinary influence inside of the House of Representatives simply because we've decided to gerrymander these districts to create these safe seats. So those extremists are a kind of lester's too. There are more of them, uh, you know, it's more democratic than lester land, but they too have enormous influence over ordinary people in most ordinary people's views. Then to these congress people just don't matter.

Speaker 2:          00:04:58       That feels hopeless for a dummy like me sit on the outside looking at this, I'm like, God, if, if this is this deeply entrenched with, I mean, I guess it's not technically corruption because it's all legal, right? But it's a, an entanglement with money and with influence that, I mean, how do you want wine this? Yeah. So that point is really critical. It's not technically illegal. Hmm. And what that means is that people are engaged in this or not doing wrong things. They're just playing by the rules, their plan with a system. It's just that the system has become corrupted. When did it start? Well, I think that the moment the United States Congress begins to fall apart in a really dramatic and interesting way is when Newt Gingrich becomes speaker of the house. Um, so when the Republicans take control of Congress in 95, um, um, it's the first time the Republicans have taken control of the House of Representatives in 40 years.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       So the house becomes incredibly competitive. Each election, you know, is up for grabs. Who's going to control the house? So Gingrich turns his members in the House into perpetual fundraisers. It's basically we got to raise the money to defend ourselves next time around. And then the Democrats followed suit. So the Democrats turned their members into perpetual fundraisers and they changed the rules about like, who gets to be chairman of committees? It's no longer like who's the person with the most experience, with the most insight increasingly becomes who raises the most money. And the Democratic Party, I know about the Democratic Party, the Republicans don't talk to me much, but the Democratic Party increasingly changes its focus from what are the policies that our members care about too. What are we going to do to make sure that you as a member meet your fundraising target? And so from 95 until today, the institution becomes an institution focused on the game of getting reelected.

Speaker 2:          00:06:58       Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee who went to Congress first in like 1983 so he's been there for a long time. Um, Cooper says Capitol Hill has become a kind of farm league for K street. Okay? So what he means by that is members go there, they learn how to raise money, they become focused obsessively unripe made it raising money. But one of the things that they're really focused on, it's how do they go from Capitol Hill to becoming a lobbyist? Because that's where the real money is. You know, a member of Congress gets paid about as much as the students I educate at the Harvard law school in their first year as lawyers Co, you know, so to ordinary Americans it's a lot of money, but to people on Capitol Hill, it doesn't seem like a lot of money. But then they go and become a lobbyist. They could make 10 times that as a lobbyist.

Speaker 2:          00:07:41       Um, and so what Cooper says is you have this institution which has become so focused on the money that it's, it's just, uh, institution for producing influence that can be sold. And first, the congressmen are basically sucking up to the people who want to buy influence and then the congressmen become the people buying influence themselves because they're working as lobbyist for these important interests. So they're in the rig game, they understand how it gives rigged and then they work to rig it. Yeah, yeah. They see, they see this as their, this their business plans their honeypot. Yeah. And there is, um, whatever the district is outside of Washington, DC and Virginia, where there's some ungodly number of wealthy people per capita, where there's more, there's more lobbyists in that area than anywhere else in the United States. And that's this giant collection of wealth, right? Washington DC as an incredibly prosperous place.

Speaker 2:          00:08:37       And anybody who's been there, um, you know, for a long who've seen it for a long time, like I, I clerked there in the early 1990s and it was a pretty grungy place, but it's a really opulent city now. It's like the golden city on the hill, you know, the eyes. Um, and the reason for that is the amount of money that's been poured into that district for the purpose of buying influenced to buy legislation that makes it so these incumbent dinosaur corporations that have protected themselves against competition across the country can, can, can you to profit. It's a weird place though, because even though it's incredibly wealthy, it's also incredibly porn. There's a vast difference of the spectrum is really wide because, I mean that was one in the 90s was that, that's the Marion Barry time, right? Yeah. So that's when, I mean he won as mayor again when he came back after being arrested for smoking crack and people are like, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       Yeah. Little crack. Yeah. It's, it was an ugly place then. It's become an grotesque place now from the, from the standpoint of the principles of what America's supposed to be. Yeah. Because the privilege, there are not people who are privileged because they've, you know, Elon Musk like, and rented a great new product or they've worked incredibly hard and in a competitive marketplace and succeeded. They're privileged because they've leveraged influence in a corrupt system to, uh, to profit. And the people who are failing their, um, you know, a lot of reasons they're failing. It's just we don't have a competitive, powerful economy that gives them the opportunities right now because that, that district, Washington dc, because it's got no effective representation is one of the worst represented districts in the country. So essentially this all started out with new Greek Gingrich's group in day, decided to spend so much time concentrating on fundraising and then once that became successful, everyone else followed suit.

Speaker 2:          00:10:36       Yeah, yeah. So the game became no longer how do we legislate for America, but how do we rally our troops to raise the money we need to win in the next election? The game is just about the election. I mean, you know, my, my mother lives in, uh, in Hilton head, which is of course a very republican district, but they elected their first Democrat, Joe Cunningham and Joe, uh, um, my mother loved him and wanted to support him. My mother is a Republican, but here he was, shoot, wanted to support a democrat. So I sent a check for on her behalf to this Democrat. The day he was elected, he started raising money for the next election. His whole focus from that moment on. And now he started a big membership organization where they, to get members to sort of help him sort of get back to Congress the next time around.

Speaker 2:          00:11:18       Their sole focus is the elections. Uh, and this is really different in the 1980s, you know, they would go to Washington for 18 months, they would do the work of governing and then for six months they do the work of politicking. Um, so, you know, a year and a half they could figure out how to solve the problems of America. And then for half a year they figured out how to get reelected. That's no longer the game. The game now is from day one. How do we raise the funds? We need to make sure we can get reelected. Um, and with the Democrats, extraordinary turnaround in this lacks selection. You be damn sure that's exactly the obsessive focus that we'll be going into 2020 and if there's no other viable alternative, this is a game that they have to play. Yeah, good people have to play it.

Speaker 2:          00:12:04       This is the point. It's not like you can have the good people who say, I'm not going to play this game. I mean, there's some famous people who could say, I'm not going to play this game. Um, you know, Alexandria, um, occasional Cortez. I mean she doesn't have to raise money, I'm sure. Um, and people on the right, uh, to, you know, who are the famous people, right? They don't have to worry about this, but the ordinary congressperson knows, given the way the system is right now, they've got an obsessive focus on how to raise money. And what they know that that means is they develop a sixth sense, a constant awareness about how what they do will affect their ability to raise money, becoming the words of the x files, shape shifters, as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money.

Speaker 2:          00:12:47       Um, there's a congressman Leslie burned Democrat from Virginia who describes it when she went to Congress. She was told by a colleague, quote always leaned to the green. Then to clarify, she went on, you know, he was not an environmentalist. So the point is like, you know, in your heart of hearts which way you got to go to make sure, and if you're good and you're smart, you'd never say anything to indicate it, but it's operating. But sometimes you're not so smart. So in the tax bill leading up to the passage of the last tax cut, you know, the one point $6 trillion gift to corporations and wealthy people, primarily a congressman, New York stood on the floor of the house and said, you know, my donors have told me that if we don't deliver on this, I should never call him again. That I should never call them again.

Speaker 2:          00:13:33       So it's basically, you know, as simple and clear as possible, you don't reduce our taxes, don't ever ask us for more money. And, and that's the reality of what Washington has become. Now, once this gets started and it moves in this direction, w we don't have a long history of this to understand the, the waves and the ins and the outs of the tide. It just, this is what it is and it keeps moving in the same general direction. How would that ever stop? How would there ever be some sort of reform that puts this back into a position where it makes sense and it's tenable? Yeah. So, you know, I, I've been in this business for about 12 years now in the business of like trying to figure out what can we do yeah. To reform this corrupted system. And you know, part of me feels as you said, like it's hopeless, but part of me feels like it's the most hopeful moment we've seen because like a decade ago when I would go around and say, you know, we got this really corrupted system and like money is really, people say no when you talking about we just have to focus on getting the people we want elected.

Speaker 2:          00:14:38       And if we get the people we want to like have, we'll get the policies we lot past now almost everybody realizes that until we fix this broken congress, nothing else can happen. So it's not like this the most important issue out there. You know, you could have been climate change or health care or jobs or comp competitive mind. You can think those are the important issues. But what people are increasingly seeing is that this is the first issue. If we don't fix this, we don't fix anything. And what's really encouraging to me is that that frame is increasingly being embraced by important leaders. So, you know, about, um, six years ago, I think, um, Nancy Pelosi was on Jon Stewart show the daily show and Stewart said, you know, the whole system is corrupt and Nancy Pelosi's, no, no, no, this isn't, it's not corrupt. People in the system are corrupt, but the persistence not corrupt.

Speaker 2:          00:15:30       And Jon Stewart just had a field day because of how ridiculous that statement is now. But now Nancy Pelosi is going to introduce as hr one, the most ambitious and comprehensive reform package that Washington I think has ever seen. I mean, it is unbelievable in its breath. Um, so it has public funding of congressional campaigns so that congressmen don't spend 30 to 70% of their time sucking up to the lesters. It has a mandate to end gerrymandering, politik partisan gerrymandering, exercising Congress's power under the constitution to tell the state it's clean, this mess up. It has an incredible, um, uh, ethics package to kind of close block the revolving door. So congressmen are not running off to k street and it has an incredible restoration of voting rights. The rest, voter rights, restoration of voting rights act, automatic voter registration. It's the most comprehensive package of political reform, I think the civil rights bill of the generation.

Speaker 2:          00:16:35       But of course nobody outside of Washington has heard anything about it because most people look at what Washington does and says, ah, it's just a game the Democrats are playing to embarrass the Republican's. How would they stop congressmen from becoming lobbyists? Well, one thing they do a, and then I build loopholes into it, but one thing they can do is they can basically say, um, once your congressman you can't be alive is for five years and five years or whatever the time is. But the more fundamental factors, you know, if you change the way you fund campaigns, if it was no longer the lobbyists who are kind of channeling the money in or that we're getting their clients to channel the money, and then it's not like there wouldn't be lobbyists anymore, they just wouldn't be so well paid. They wouldn't be as valuable. And if they're not as valuable, it's not as valuable for them to pay the congressman and incredible amount of money to become con, uh, lobbyists.

Speaker 2:          00:17:27       You know, they would become almost like, you know, lawyers, policy wonks that kind of go to Capitol Hill and say, here's what will happen if you adopt this legislation. You know, that's an important part of the process. But they wouldn't be the mockers in the system. They wouldn't be the people who called the shots. And so the value of their services would fall. And if the value of their services fell, then um, it wouldn't so much sense to go and become a lobbyist. Maybe you'd come home and be a doctor again or come home and like be a business person again or do whatever you want back in your district. So I think if you change the way you fund campaigns, you would change 70% of the problem. You would just fix it right then. And these other things that good additions but not as critical.

Speaker 2:          00:18:08       But without changing the way you fund campaigns, I think all of these other changes are relevant. It just can't get over the money. You will always hear the phrase take money out of politics. It's a constant phrase, but that's not really possible now and underneath it gets really good. The point isn't, the point isn't to get money out. The point is to get money that doesn't represent a tiny fraction of the special interests controlling how congress people think. So, um, I think today a congressman from California Rogue Kahana is going to introduce a bill that he hopes will be eventually part of whatever this big reform packages that would create a way of funding campaigns where everybody gets a voucher or a set of vouchers. You know, Seattle has done this for city elections where everybody gets for $25 vouchers that are only usable to fund campaigns.

Speaker 2:          00:19:00       So a candidate comes around and tries to persuade you to give him or her the voucher and then they take that voucher and they use it to fund campaigns. Okay. If Roca Han is bill passed and everybody had vouchers to use to fund congressional campaigns. And you know, the idea is basically you take the rebate of the first $50 of your taxes, which every American pays at least $50 to the federal government. You take that first $50 you'd give it back and you give it in the form of a voucher and you say, take this voucher and help fund campaigns with it. Congressmen would still be raising money, they'd still be spending a large time raising money, but they wouldn't be raising money from the tiny fraction of the 1% they'd be raising money from everybody. And so the point is that you would be using that money to spread the influence in the way that democracy is supposed to spread the influence to every American as opposed to the influence in a tiny, tiny fraction of the 1% so that wouldn't get less money.

Speaker 2:          00:19:56       I think that could be more money in the system, but it wouldn't be corrupting money because it would be money that is democratically accountable. But the lesters of the world would probably try to put the Kibosh on that before it ever got moving. Yeah. I mean, you know, the biggest block to anything like hr one happening is that the most influential people in Washington have the most to lose, right? The lobbyists, you know, the value of the industry of lobbying just collapses. Um, and those people are going to fight like hell to block it, which is why as wonderful as it is to me to see somebody like Nancy Polosi take up the charge and say, here it is. Here's a package of reform and it's going to be the first thing we do. Fix Democracy first. What, what's true, what's obvious about this is without a president taking up the charge, it's never gonna happen.

Speaker 2:          00:20:45       And what's most depressing to is that right now in the Democratic Party, you don't have any candidate for president who's making reform, uh, uh, even an important issue, let alone a primary issue. Um, and of course we had a president who is elected under the drain, the swamp slogan. But of course nobody believes he has any plan or any intent to do anything to drain that swamp. Yeah. I'm hoping that having him in office is such a, that the whole thing was such a cluster fuck and that so many people are so disturbed that it's going to make people more politically active and more aware of the consequences of having someone like that in office. Yeah. And actually weirdly unifying. Yeah. Because even though the Democrats are not doing this right now, which is really depressing to me, you know, we, we have these things that we know we disagree about and we like fueled the politics of hate as we kind of yell at each other about these things.

Speaker 2:          00:21:44       But there's a set of issues that we all agree about and the, and the most important set of issues we all agree about is the deeply corrupted nature of this government. And there was a poll done by University of Maryland in the middle of 2016 asking about anger and frustration with government found the highest level of frustration in the history of polling. And then when they asked the reasons why they were so angry and so disaffected with their government, the reasons people gave her all the same things, like the influence of money, the influence of lobbyists, the parties care more about corporations and about, and then then we broke them down about how to Republicans think about this and how to Democrats think about this. There was no statistical difference between Republicans and Democrats. You know, sometimes the Democrats were more concerned, sometimes the Republicans and the levels we're at like 80 and 90% so literally 84% of Americans would say it is big money.

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       That is corrupting the way our Congress functions, right? So here is common ground. And what was so extraordinary about the 2016 election is watch a republican candidates stand on a debate stage. You know, in, in September of 2015 Donald Trump stood on a debate stage and pointed to every one of those. Kennedy's and said, I own all of you. I've given all of you money and I know the way the system works and the system is corrupt. And he called Super Pacs and abomination and he attacked the idea of money in politics. And so what that signaled is that Republicans too could be rallied to this cause of addressing this deeply corrupted political system. If only we could find the candidates who would do it. And I think what Donald Trump has done is teed up this moment where we can step back and say, look, we disagree about a lot of things, whether it's gmo or climate change, whether it's healthcare for all or college for all, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:23:27       We disagree about a loving, we got to work a lot of things out. But here is something we all agree about and we should be smart enough to realize if we don't fix this, then none of the things we're arguing about matter. You know you can't, it's not serious to stand on a debate stage and say you, you support single payer healthcare without also saying, but first we're going to fix this corrupted system because there's no way to get single payer health care in a world where doctors and pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies are funding elections. You can't say you're going to get climate change legislation in America without addressing the corrupting influence of money in politics because the oil camp that the dirty energy industry has an enormous opportunity to block this change through the way we fund campaigns. So this is a moment where we should be able to get everybody in this political system to step back and say, Hey, wait, the system's broken.

Speaker 2:          00:24:22       We can see as broken. The first thing we have to do is to fix the broken congress. And if we fix that Congress, then we have a chance to have an argument about what policy makes sense for America. And we each have our views, but no views are different. But the thing we don't agree about, we should be able to agree on. Now, if that's a universal agreement amongst Republicans and Democrats, that funding, then that money and that all, all this is what's ruining politics. The, the people that are donating all this money, these, these, the lesters of the world, what could they possibly do to stop this reform and what's their reaction to this kind of reform? Yeah, yeah. So let me be clear about one really important thing. I, um, when I say Republicans and Democrats, what I mean as people in the districts across Mac in Washington, you know, like Mitch Mcconnell is, I think the focus of evil in the modern world.

Speaker 2:          00:25:17       Mitch Mcconnell will block any reform here at all. So, you know, Nancy Polozi can offer what she wants, but it will never get through the Senate because Mitch Mcconnell and so there are many Republicans in Washington. We're going to block any reform. But, um, but when you ask, you know, the Republicans in Washington and the lesters, what can they do to stop it? Well, the game, the game strategy's clear, they've deployed it before, right? So, um, you know, they'll, they'll say things like, this is welfare for politicians. Um, this is just corrupting free speech. You don't believe in the first amendment if you don't believe that, you know, the Koch brothers are, the sources have the right to spend unlimited amounts of money and political speech. Um, and so I think the way around that fight is to agree free speech is the fundamental value. And nothing of the reforms I support would like try to restrict people's ability to speak.

Speaker 2:          00:26:17       What we're talking about is congressman raising money. We're not talking about individual speaking in the marketplace. So you have a very loud voice. Joe, your voice is heard by millions and nothing in our constitution should permit the government to be able to suppress you at all. So long as you're within the bounds of decency or at least, uh, not decency because that's not a bound boundary. This thought, guess obeys often, but, but at least if you're not, you know, spreading false rumors and causing great harm. But the point is, um, even though this free speech needs to be protected, we still should be able to focus on the influence, the economy of influence congressmen live under when they spend 30 to 70% of the time sucking up to the lesters to fund their campaigns. That should be a focus of regulation without the first amendment getting in the way because we want to Congress filled with people who care about what their voters want now with their funders want the framers didn't create a constitution to replicate an aristocracy.

Speaker 2:          00:27:20       They were fighting and aristocracy. They had a system where there was a house, the House of Lords. They had to ask the aristocracy, what do you want? And everything could be blocked if the aristocracy didn't like it. Well, we've replicated that system more efficiently in America than they had there because we have a system where both the House of Representatives and the Senate is filled with people who are obsessed with a single question what to my funders want? And if they can't answer that question in a way that supports the legislation, they're not going to support the legislation. Or if it's important for them to block legislation, they will block legislation. And that's the dynamic of Washington right now. Um, uh, Francis Fukuyama describes our government has a veto ocracy veto ocracy. And what he means by that is that there's so many places we're influenced. Powerful influence can block the ability of the government to do something good.

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       It just can't do anything anymore. And that's, I think the consequence of allowing this corruption of money to be so deeply woven into our political system. Is it possible to fix? Yeah, it is possible effects because you know, for, for example, hr one plus Roca, Hannah's bill all perfectly constitutional, you wouldn't have to amend the constitution to do it. I think that bill alone would solve 80% of the problem. The possibility, the problem isn't like conceiving of what changes have to happen. The question is how do you build the political movement to get there? And what that takes is leaders willing to say we have to fix this corrupted democracy first. And, and leaders who stopped, like pretending that we can get like a Christmas list of great changes in government without fixing this democracy first. So, you know, Bernie published our last month in the Washington Post list of the 10 things that should happen in the first hundred days in the next democratic administration.

Speaker 2:          00:29:19       10 great ideas, not a single one of those ideas address the corruption of our political system. You know, it was just, it was just a Christmas list of all the things that the progressive's wanted. And you know, I'm a progressive, I want some of those things. But the point is which things were the, you know, things like a trillion dollar infrastructure project, single pair, healthcare free college, um, you know, all things that Bernie is pushing it has made so sale it and things that I think it's great that he has made salient. I mean, he's a hero and like making these issues central to at least the debate. But what frustrates me is that instead of focusing our anger on the billionaires, which he does, we need to focus more anger on the congressman, the politicians, which he does not. I mean, the guy's been in Congress Romas 30 years now. And so it might be natural for him not to notice that the people around him are the problem.

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       Is it a natural thing or do you think that he's possibly aware of the consequences of stirring up that Hornets Nest? Because you know, if anybody has a right to complain, when the DNC conspired to rig the primaries against him, he's the number one guy. He should be screaming from the rooftops. You're dealing with a corrupt system and this is disgusting. And heden it didn't do that. And he didn't do that while he'll, Hillary Clinton was running for president and he knew it. He knew that he had been screwed out of the primaries. He knew they had conspired, he knew it was all illegal, and he kind of just kept his mouth shut.

Speaker 2:          00:30:44       Yeah. Well, I think, you know, that was a responsibility. I think that was a kind of, um, you know, I was a person reflecting on the horrendous outcome if he took Hillary Clinton down. And so I think he restrained himself. Um, you know, not perfectly. I mean, the fact is after it was clear he was not going to be the nominee, he still continued to talk about the coat corruption, Rad Hillary, which donald then picked up and turned into a, a weapon against her. But I think he, he recognized, you know, is every responsible politician does that. You know, it's not just about him, it's about the future of America. So when he restrained himself and didn't want to take the whole system down, then, um, I, I get that. But what I'm talking about now, I'm talking about when you've got the House of Representatives talking about fundamental reform, it will be the first thing they take up.

Speaker 2:          00:31:33       We at least ought to have a presidential campaign where candidates are saying, hell yes. The first thing we will do is to end the corruption that makes it impossible for this congress to function and stop pretending like we can get all these wonderful things given to us by Santa Claus without fixing this first. You gotta do the hard work of convincing America that there is a solution because you know, the reality is I think most of America is where you started this podcast. Most of America thinks it's deeply corrupted and there's nothing that can be done. They're half right. It is deeply corrupted, but it's not true. There's nothing that can be done. We can do something. And in fact I think we can solve almost uh, you know, 80% of it. I still think there's constitutional changes that might be necessary. And I've been working like how do we get constitutional changes and talking to people, my, my podcast, which of course has about one 1000th of the one 1000000th of the people listening to it.

Speaker 2:          00:32:29       It's yours does, but as your podcast so people can listen to it's another way. So season two is released today, which is about an article five convention. But season one was about how to think about the 2020. Um, um, but you know, I, I think that, uh, we might have to have constitutional change and I have been supporting the efforts to think about that. But while we've got to do is to give people a sense that there's something we can do before we amend the constitution. You know, we did a poll and found 96% of Americans believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics. 91% didn't think it was possible. So that's the politics of resignation. You know, if you'd gone to Egypt under Mubarak and you'd start the average person in the street and said, you know, what do you think of Mubarak?

Speaker 2:          00:33:13       They would've said, you know, we hate Mubarak and then say, why aren't you doing anything about it? And they said, because nothing can be done. Or, you know, African Americans in 1900 and America, what do you think about Jim Crow? You know, we hate Jim Crow. Why aren't you doing anything about it? Well, because there's nothing to be done about it. Well, that's how Americans think about this political corruption. They hate it. They think it's deeply unjust, inconsistent with what they thought America was about, but they don't do anything about it because they don't think there's anything to be done about it. And that's where leaders have a role and what we need our leaders running for president right now to begin to explain to people, here's what we could do if only we built the power to do it. Recognizing the most important opposition here, the lobbyist in Washington are going to be an incredibly difficult group to to defeat.

Speaker 2:          00:34:03       But we can do that. And if we do that, every other issue becomes easier to resolve in a sensible way. Now, there's no public support for lobbyists, right? There's no, there's no people out there that are super psyched that lobbyists are out there and exerting their influence on our world. But they obviously have enormous financial backing behind them and they have incredible influence in our, in our culture. But if you had some magic wand, you could wave across this system and and fix it. Wouldn't removing lobbyists the one of the first things that you would do? No. No. Why? Why so? Well, because look, you know, Congress, especially in the current government, legislates on a whole bunch of issues that they don't have a clue about, right? They don't know squat diddly about 99% of what they're legislating mouth. They need information. And one of the other things Gingrich did was to completely may eight Congress's own information service.

Speaker 2:          00:35:05       They used to have a really powerful information service to help congressmen figure things out. All of that's basically gone. So they rely on outsiders to come in and help them understand it. Now, my view is, you know, that's an imperfect system because there's great inequality among the quality of lobbyists. But if all lobbyists were doing was providing information like, congressman, here's what's going to happen. If you pass this bill, like these jobs will disappear or this lead will reappear in the water system if that's all they were doing. A really valuable thing, information to the Congress to help congress decide what to do is an essential part of making democracy work. The part of lobbying that is the corrupting part where they become the mockers for the money, not so much that they give it directly, but you know, they call their clients and they say, you need everybody at the c level and your corporation to send $2,700 to this person and they steer it like that.

Speaker 2:          00:36:02       When they become the kind of source of a resource for members of Congress, that's when they have this influence, which is not related to their argument. So you know, I've met lobbyist who, who hate the system as it is right now. They'll say things like, look, I want a system where I win because my ideas are good. My arguments are better. I don't want a system where I win because I'm able to channel more money than that guy. Cause that's not a democracy like a democracy should be. These representatives are listening to us and then they do the right thing based on what they think helps their constituents, not how much they're going to raise if they do this over that.

Speaker 2:          00:36:41       How many lobbyists are there? Oh Man, I can't answer that question. You know, one of the big problems we've got is that the law has been weakened in registering lobbyists. So you know, we have tens of thousands of people who are functioning effectively as lobbyists but don't have to call themselves lobbyists. You have these members of Congress who go to government relations departments and they oversee the government relations department as long as they don't go on to Capitol Hill and shake hands, but instead set up the meetings on Capitol Hill with the lower people shaking hands. They're not called lobbyists. So if you look at the lobbying numbers, it looks like we peaked and lobbying and about three years ago and now are declining. But what that is in fact is that the rules have been interpreted or allowed to be uninformed. So that many people who are lobbyists actually aren't actually functioning as lobbyists today.

Speaker 2:          00:37:30       So they are lobbyists, but they don't wear the label is lobbyists, what do they call themselves? Government relations. People. Experts. Yeah. Um, you know, and uh, they aren't, they, they're not technically lobbyists. And, uh, um, you know, I got into a huge fight with, uh, Scott Brown. You remember Scott Brown who ran, um, uh, for, uh, who was a senator in Massachusetts. Um, he ran under tea party ticket and I was like this amazing Republican to win as a senator in Rep, Massachusetts. And then, uh, Elizabeth Warren, um, defeated him in the, in the, um, in the election two years into his term. And he then went to Massachusetts to New Hampshire and ran for Senate. And I was helping a Republican in New Hampshire who was a reformer running for Senate, and we've referred to him as a lobbyist. And he went ballistic. He said, I'm not a lobbyist.

Speaker 2:          00:38:21       And then he said, I'm not technically a lobbyist. He's a government relations person who's like calling people on Capitol Hill, used to be with on the Senate trying to get them to do things for him. But he hasn't quote a technical lobbyists. So merely because the irs wouldn't refer to them as a yes, he thought it was outrageous and fraud for me to refer to him as what we all know is, which is a lobbyist. So lobbyists being a lobbyist is not defined by your actions. It's defined by your label. It's defined by, did you have to fill something out to be alarmist? So once you are a lobbyist, according to the law, you've got all sorts of obligations of reporting, uh, who you're spending your time with. But you're spending money on government relations, government relations people, and a certain level that do certain things aren't caught lobbyists, but yet they have the exact same function even more because you know, they've got tons of people working for them.

Speaker 2:          00:39:13       They get to, to deploy in their, in their work of doing lobbying. How would that ever be? How would you ever put a dam up there? Well, you know, you only put a dam up there if you've got the political will to make it happen, right? You only get the political will to make it happen. If you have a political process that focuses America on this deeply corrupting problem and says, God damn it, we have to fix this. And if you had that will, if you said, we're just going to fix this and you had like the, you know, the Geeks then go down the list of 25 things that have to happen to make it so we have our congress, it's worried about being representative of America as opposed to representative of the lesters in America. We could do it. It's not rocket science.

Speaker 2:          00:39:58       It really is not that hard. Um, you got to think carefully about what kind of incentives you're producing. I'm not saying it's like obvious. We're not going to sketch the full plan here, but it's possible it is constitutional to do it. And if we just built the political will to get there, we could do it. And the only way we build the political will. It's a really important right now because right now people, especially people like you need to be saying to every one of the politicians who is going to be sucking up to try to be on your show to try to have a chance to get their voice out. That class of heat to the people who are listening to your podcast. It's important to people like you to say, okay, what are you going to do about this problem, this problem in particular?

Speaker 2:          00:40:36       Is it a priority or is it like one of 12 things on your list? I mean, I imagine it's 11 for Bernie or 12 somewhere on the list, but the question isn't, you know, isn't on the list because every one of them is going to say, yeah, of course I support reform. The question is, are you going to bring America around so that America thinks on day one this is what will happen. Whatever else happens, this is going to happen and my view is if there were a democrat running for president who said, look, hold on, we're going to fix this. And the trumpers who were drained the swamp, you know the 25% of that base that's drained the swamp. Hers come with me because that guy did not drain the swamp. That guy filled the swamp. The swamp monsters are bigger and more valuable or more vital now then now than they ever were. But come with me. We actually will do it. I think there's a way to break this election so that it becomes an election about the unity around this recognition rather than the disunity, which is the screaming left against the screaming, right, which is the way things, right

Speaker 3:          00:41:39       now we're evolving to a person on sit down on the outside who doesn't have any involvement in politics like myself. It seemed so unbelievably complicated that it, it's, it exhausts you when you start examining it and trying to pay attention to it and how the system will works. Um, correct me if I'm wrong, but then in the recent past there was something that was changed that allows corporations to donate money the same way that an individual would.

Speaker 2:          00:42:03       Right. So in 2010 the United States Supreme Court decided a case called citizens united and citizens united said that you couldn't limit limit a corporation's ability to spend money independently of a political campaign. So corporations not allowed to contribute directly, but that's not worth that much because you're only allowed to give a total of $5,400 to a candidate over the course of the life of his campaign. But what citizens united said is that the constitution protects the right of the corporation to engage in political speech independent of a political campaign. So if, you know, if some congressmen is running for Congress, um, Exxon corporation can come in and spend $1 million to say why that congressman is a good congressman or why the congressman of the terrible congressman, but they have a constitutional right to do that. Now when that happened, there were a bunch of us who were, you know, chicken littles about this who said, oh this is the end of democracy.

Speaker 2:          00:42:59       Cause these corporations are just going to spend unbelievable amounts of money in the political process, like spending their money to effect the results. And that was not correct because what happened is corporations quickly discovered the high price of free speech, right? So corporations like target back day, uh, anti gay candidate for governor, um, and, uh, all of a sudden found their stores being picketed across the country because people were furious that they would be supporting such a candidate for governor. So corporates and quickly found that it's not cheap to engage in political speech in the marketplace. They didn't want to do it like that. Instead, they wanted to find a way to channel their money into dark money organizations or into what evolved after citizens united, something called Super Pacs. So super pacs were created not by the Supreme Court. Superpacs were created by a lower court that said, well, if you can spend unlimited amounts of money, you should be allowed to give unlimited amounts of money to an independent political action committee.

Speaker 2:          00:44:04       That was the Super Pac supreme court has never ruled on that question. We have a case that we're taking up to Alaska that's trying to appeal to the Supreme Court to get them to actually decide whether super pacs are mandated by the constitution. And what's different about this case is the argument we're making is to the conservatives. What we're saying is the framers of our constitution, we're obsessed with corruption. That was the issue they were overwhelmingly trying to avoid. And they weren't focused on bribery. There were focused on institutional corruption. These institutions, it became unconnected to their purpose representing Americans. And we'll, our view is, is you know, these conservatives on the supreme court, like, um, you know, uh, Neil gorsuch or justice thomas or Brett Kavanaugh who say that we interpreted the constitution of the way the framers would have interpreted it. We're going to make the argument to them, which is there is no doubt the framers of the constitution would have looked at these superpacs and said, these are an abomination.

Speaker 2:          00:45:04       These are outrageous from the perspective of the democracy they were trying to create. And those justices should at least one of them be willing to stand up and defend the framers values against this modern corruption. And if just one of them voted with the four liberals who've already said they think super pacs are an abomination, then we could have a way to end the superpacs in this system and that, and that would be an enormous benefit because they've become so powerful. But the courts alone can't save us. Even if you ended superpacs tomorrow, you still have lester land because the super pacs are not what I was talking about and lester lamb, when I was talking about Lester, Leanne was giving to candidates directly and the small number of people would still be giving to candidates directly and the only way to solve that is for Congress to pass a new laws that change the way campaigns get funded. That's the sort of thing hr one is trying to do as a sort of thing Roca Honda's trying to do, but that's the sort of thing that we don't have a president to support right now. We don't have Democratic presidential candidates who are making it the champion issue right now. And um, it won't get done unless they do.

Speaker 3:          00:46:16       Well, it seems complicated to people when you try to explain campaign finance and you try to explain contributions to candidates and contributions to sitting senators and congressmen, it's, it's complicated and there's so many different things to think about when you're discussing this that to a person who's on the outside, well how do you fix this? Well, what are the laws now? While how did it get that way? Well, well w w how about make it so they can't give them money? And there's all these like real simplistic views of it from the outside, but it seems that it at the very least limiting the amount of money that someone's a lot. Like what is the maximum amount of money someone can give to a Kennel

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       right now in the primary and the general, it's $5,400 $2,700 in each and that goes up according to inflation. And that's pretty small potatoes compared to what the super pacs are doing in the collection. So you have these people running who expect they're going to raise the money to run their office from their direct contributions, but they're counting on the super pacs to come in and spend ungodly amounts of money, like tens of millions of dollars to support their candidate or to oppose their Optima, their opponent. Uh, and so the supporters for those super or even tiny, there's are the adolfs in America, people named Adolf, this tiny, tiny, tiny number of people who are contributing to those, to those things. But you're right, people. Look, there's no reason why most Americans should understand the complexities of campaign finance law and they don't need to. What they need to ask is do we have a system of integrity in the way we select representatives?

Speaker 2:          00:47:54       And if you're, if you're not brain dead in America, you believe the answer to that question is no. We do not have a system of integrity. There is no representational integrity. It is corrupted in all the obvious res. And like nobody should be forced to study campaign finance in order to have the entitlement to say, hell, hell no. This system has got to end. Uh, and so I think you're right. If we, you know, people are forced to like articulate all the 34 different changes that have to happen, we're never going to get there. But let's not go there. Let's just start and end with it is a corrupted system and we want politicians to fix it. And if they don't fix it, we'll throw them out into a get the politicians who do. Um, and if we could build that as the movement, the recognition, the core message of 2020, I think there's a real shot because we've primed the Republican Party.

Speaker 2:          00:48:43       There are a lot of people in that party who are now so disgusted with the corruption of the system. Not Necessarily Mitch Mcconnell, he loves it. But you know, ordinary Republican voters and the Democrats have now committed themselves to fixing this corrupted system. It, this is the moment to do that. And we don't have to get into the details of how much you should be allowed to contribute to say there is a way to fix this that would give us a representative democracy. Maybe not. Again, but for the first time wise, Mitch Mcconnell's, so a uniquely evil, this guy has had it in his DNA from the first moment he went to Washington to end any regulation of money in politics. He engineered the selection of the FEC. This is the federal election commission commissioners, so that they would block basically every enforcement action or the FTC.

Speaker 2:          00:49:37       The FTC does nothing now because it's a commission that has half Republicans and half Democrats. So if the Republicans disagree from the Democrats, then nothing gets done. They can't enforce the most simple rules anymore because Mitch Mcconnell is populated the FEC with people who don't believe in campaign finance rules. He has said citizens united this decision that said corporations could give unlimited amounts of money to independent political speaking says one of the greatest decisions of the Supreme Court. And he said he was gonna fight like hell to defend it. And when this proposed hr one was raised to him, Mitch Mcconnell said, there's not a chance in hell. This will ever even get a debate in the Senate. This man is obsessed with the idea that money should have the power in Washington that it has right now. And people who talking about reforming it are the enemy. And so you, the thing about Mitch Mcconnell is he's actually an incredibly smart man and he's an incredibly smart strategist and he's been playing this game for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:50:36       Um, and um, and I think he's like responsible for 85% of the judicial structure that makes it possible for this to be blocked. There's an amazing series to debates happened 20 years ago between John Mccain and Mitch Mcconnell. So this is when Congress was passing something called the McCain Feingold law, which was the last great effort to deal with this problem. It was flawed and a bunch of ways, but it was an important success. Mitch Mcconnell, um, uh, uh, stood on the floor of the Senate and said, Mr Mccain says that, uh, the Senate, we can't say Mr Mccain's said, the senator from Arizona has said that the system is corrupt. I want him to name the corrupt people. And Mccain stands up and said, I'm not talking about particular individuals. I'm talking about the system, it's the system's corrupt. And then Mcconnell, almost clueless, just said, if the system's corrupt, there must be corrupt people.

Speaker 2:          00:51:25       If there's not corrupt people and the system's not corrupt. So the only corruption he could imagine was corruption where somebody was taking a bribe. And if that's the only corruption where allowed to remedy, then the whole system of influence we have right now is not to be touched. But you know, I think Mccain's point was you can have a system filled with lots of honors congresspeople and lots of on a senators who never engage in bribery, but they know how to Bob and weave and bend and speak and say the right things to attract the right kind of money. And that's as much corruption as bribery is. And Mccain's view was we had to end it. So he was the last great Republican fighter for reform of this corrupted system. There'd been many, before Barry Goldwater was an incredibly vocal opponent to the role of money in politics. Um, but I think what we have to do is to find a way to revive that and to leverage from this presidents assertion that this is a corrupt system and we have to change the system into actually building the political power to make that change happen.

Speaker 3:          00:52:34       Another thing that's very weird is it every four years or so, there's this cry to eliminate the electoral college every four years ago, people realize that the battleground states are so critical and that so much money is being spent on the small handful of states because they give you all the electoral votes and this is how you win an election. And then people said, well, why is that? That doesn't make any sense. It should be one person, one vote. Are we really that divided as a nation that we need to isolate ourselves into these small little lines in the, on the dirt where you know, this part is worth this amount and that part's worth that amount. And so everybody plays this weird electoral college game and then you get a situation like what just happened, where Hillary Clinton wins the popular vote, but he's not the president because the electoral college is what, what makes everything,

Speaker 2:          00:53:21       yeah. So the way you just described this problem is exactly the people have to think about it. The problem is, I mean, it is a bad thing that the loser wins. I mean, that's just not the way an election supposed to work. So that's happened twice in our lifetime. Um, and uh, it happened to a hundred years before that and it's going to happen more frequently going forward. We can show that demographically, but that's not the real problem. The real problem is that in every election, the presidential candidates are focused on just 14 states. The battleground states, the purple states, and those 14 states are the only states that matter to those candidates. And, and what scholars have demonstrated as the president's and campaigns bend themselves and their policies to make those states happy. And those states don't represent America. They're older, they're wider, they're industry has kind of 19th century industry.

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       There are seven and a half times the number of people in America working in solar energy as mine coal. But you never hear about solar energy in a presidential campaign because those people live in California and Texas. They don't matter to the presidential election, which you hear about his coal mining because the 50,000 coal miners left in America happened to live in these battleground states. So this is just a product of the way the electoral college or the way states count their votes to allocate their electors. Something called the winner take all system. So all but two states say that the winner of the popular vote gets all of the electoral votes for that state. So in, you know, in 2000 in Florida, um, George Bush won that state based on a stopped recount by 531 votes. Uh, he got all the electoral college votes in that state, even though he just barely won that state.

Speaker 2:          00:55:08       And so winner take all is what makes it so that it doesn't make sense for anybody to spay pay any intention to any of the non battleground states. And Penn, all of your time in the battleground states in 2016 99% of campaign spending was in 14 states, 90 99% 95% of time. But the only reason they were not 99% in those battleground states is the other 5% they were in New York and California raising money. Right? So, so this is a system designed to give power to these battleground states. And then you say, well, why is it something the constitution requires? And the answer to that is absolutely not. The constitution does not say how the states will allocate their electors. And indeed, when states started adopting this winner take all system, many thought it was an outrageous perversion of the constitutional design. So Jeff to Jefferson was outraged.

Speaker 2:          00:56:07       But then he said, well, some states are going to do it, then all states have to do it. Because if you're a state that, uh, allocates all of your electrodes to the winter, you're going to have more power than your neighboring state can only gets half the electors to the winner. So very quickly there was a race to the bottom and that's kind of where it's stuck. And so the question is now what we can do about it. Well, there are two big reform efforts out there. One of them is called the national popular vote compact. I mean, I should say, you know, you can imagine amending the constitution, but it takes three fourths of the states to change the constitution. And three fourths of the states are not going to agree with abolishing the electoral college. So this is not going to happen anytime soon through the constitution.

Speaker 2:          00:56:47       But there are two ways. Without amending the constitution, we could fix this problem. Won The national popular vote. Pro Compact is basically states who say, look, we're going to pledge our electors to the winner of the national popular vote. So, um, the state, you know, looks at who won the national popular vote and then picks the slate of electors from their state with the party of the person who won the national popular vote. So in a state like New York, if the Republican won the national popular vote, even though most people in New York and democratic, they would allocate their electors to the republican vice versa in Texas. That's, that's the way that system would work. And you know, I personally like the system because I believe in the idea of one person, one vote, everybody's vote is an American citizen for the American president should be equal.

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       It shouldn't, shouldn't matter that you're having to live in Wyoming versus Pennsylvania versus New York. Um, but there are people who are worried about this because they fear that it will become a kind of fly over democracy. But the only places that candidates will care about will be places like la or New York or Chicago. I actually don't think that's right, but I get the understanding, I think they're wrong about the way the campaigns work, but I understand why they're anxious about it. So then that leads to the alternative solution, which is something, you know, my group equal citizens that us is litigating this right now. Um, we're just trying to declare this winner take all system, violates the constitution because it basically says that if you're a Republican in California, your vote never matters. If you're a Democrat in Texas, your vote never matters because we just count your vote up and then we throw it away because we allocate all the electors to the dominant party in your state.

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       And so we've got, David boies is our chief litigator. We've got a case in California, Texas, South Carolina, and Massachusetts asking the courts to declare a winner take all unconstitutional. And instead say that electors have to be allocated proportionally. So if you get 40% of the vote in the state, you get 40% of the electors. If you get 50%, you get 50% of the doctors. And what that would do overnight is it would make every state in the nation competitive. Like there'd be a reason for a Democrat to go to Texas because you're not going to get all the electoral votes. You're Nike, you've got to half the electoral votes, but you'll get 40%, maybe 45%, and that could matter. Or a Republican would go to California because you know, you're not going to get all the votes in California, but you're going to get a lot there.

Speaker 2:          00:59:14       A lot of Republicans in California. Um, so this change would immediately make every state in play. But unlike the national popular vote alternatives, there are many people who look at this and say, this would be better because small states would still have a pretty important role, like an elector as an elector. And if I can get it from Arizona, I'm going to care about Arizona. If I can get it from Arkansas, care about Arkansas. Um, so it's not going to just be the big states are the big population centers. It's going to be every state. And so if we can get, you know, a court to say this violates the constitution, um, then you can have states forest to allocate or electors proportionally. And if they did that, and then the problem that you identified at the start, which I think is the problem, could be solved overnight.

Speaker 2:          01:00:00       You would no longer have these battleground states deciding everything you'd ever president who cares about getting elected by all of America. And that would be an incredible improvement though that seems like in and of itself would be a game changer. Yes. If they could do that, that would change a lot. But one of the things that you said, uh, you said you don't think that it's possible that we would ever vote out the electoral college, but is there a support for the electoral college? Is there a good argument for it? Um, so there is support for the idea that every state have a role and there's a support for the idea that small states get to kind of thumb on the scale, which is what the electoral college does. So there is some support it, but most people, you know, 70% of people don't like the idea that the president is not chosen from the majority of voters vote.

Speaker 2:          01:00:52       Right. So most people would oppose it. But the point is to change the constitution, you need the state legislatures or state conventions to agree with the change. And what many states, at least 13 states I fear would say is that, you know, we actually win more under this system than we lose. Yeah. So we're not going to change the system. Uh, and so unless you get, um, like some overwhelmingly popular movement to support it or again, you know, you can imagine a presidential candidate who kind of made fixing this part of the democracy part of the plan too. I don't see how you're going to build a political movement to get there. Another way of putting it, as you know, this national popular vote compact, which is going around state to state and getting states to join right now has about a hundred. And so the way this works is that when the equivalent of 270 electoral votes have been committed, then the compact kicks in.

Speaker 2:          01:01:46       So when they get to 270, the problem goes, oh, you know, the problem of this electoral college goes away. We'll kind of add to 70. According to the plan, the winner of the popular vote wins the electoral college. They right now have 172 electors pledged, right? So they have less than a hundred more to go. But the problem is they've got to convince states to join the compact and they're kind of, they kind of hit this red wall now because many Republicans thing, the only way to win the presidency is through the electoral college. Now, so many state legislatures, why do they believe that? I think many Republicans just think that they're great benefit is from the electoral college. It's not surprising because the battle ground states are primarily Republican because the base number of Republican states is so high, right? Because, um, you know, these small rural states get disproportionately more electors then states like California.

Speaker 2:          01:02:39       So, you know, Wyoming has three electors disproportionate in terms of the population, right? So they liked the system as it is. And you know, you look back and you say, well, they got George Bush, even though he didn't win the national vote and they got Donald Trump, even though he didn't win the national vote, it's not hard for to understand why they're there. I think, again, I don't think they're right about this. You know, in 2004 if 50,000 votes had switched to John Kerry in Ohio, then John Kerry would have won the electoral college, but lost the popular vote. And if that had happened in 2004, I think the electoral college would be dead today really because a Republican won in 2000 uh, Democrat Ron in 2004 people would say, this system is just crazy. We got to get rid of this system. But now people think, well, Republicans benefit from this.

Speaker 2:          01:03:27       So I'm a Republican, I'm going to block the change. And if that's true, then it's never going to happen at a constitutional level because the constitution requires three fourths of the states to support the reform and the reinforcement of does it Donald Trump won without having the popular world. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, of course, nothing, there's no hypocrisy that touches this president. But remember in 2012 when I'm, there was a moment for about 10 minutes when the national media was reporting that, uh, that Romney was going to win the popular vote, but Barack Obama was going to be elected by the electoral college. Trump started tweeting vigorously about how this is a denial of democracy. We have to march on Washington to end this banana republic like system, because the electoral college was the worst possible thing in the world. And of course, after 2016 he had different views about the electoral college.

Speaker 2:          01:04:16       Um, I wasn't old enough to understand what was going on during Watergate. Uh, I don't know what year was that? Well, 70, uh, so, you know, the break in happens in the lead up to the 72 election and then he eventually resigned after that. But this is our Watergate right this moment right now, Colin's going to go to jail for three years. And I mean, he's testifying against trump and all these people are testifying and they're calling him, what are they calling them? Coconspirator number one is that what the, you know, the individual official individual number one, this is a very unusual moment for us to be watching this all unfold and to see this slow dissection, what Mueller seems to be doing is like slowly closing off all the escape routes and slowly circling the troops around this one area that he's trying to, that is that he's attacking.

Speaker 2:          01:05:10       Yeah. So, um, he's a brilliant tactician. Yeah. And, and uh, and so I think it's clear that the worst for Donald Trump has yet to come. Um, and I do think the parallel is Watergate, but there's a really important difference here, you know? Um, so I'm old enough to remember while Watergate, I was like 12 or 13 when this happened and my uncle happened to be the lawyer who worked in the House of Representatives convincing the House of Representatives to vote the articles of impeachment. So he, and that weekend when Nixon resigned, he came to visit us. We lived in the Kentucky part of Pennsylvania, that kind of right wing, middle part of the state. He came to visit us and um, he told me this was gonna happen. And uh, that was the event. That was the weekend. And I decided I wanted to become a lawyer. Um, but, uh, but the big difference between these two times is that when that happened, the way most people got access to news was three television networks every day they watch the news at the same time because there was nothing else on.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       And those three television networks kind of shot right down the middle and told the story as they saw it. Um, you know, it was kind of a Walter cronkite era of news. Um, and as this story broke, they just reported it as they saw it. And as they saw it, it was a pretty damning indictment of the precedent. And what's amazing is he watched the polling among Republicans and their support for the president six months before the president resigns. The poll says, among Republicans, he has about an 83% support rate. And then when he resigns, his support rate about Republicans is about 50%. And that's because the news, newspapers and television had like told everybody the same story and American's hearing the same story. It came to the same view that there was something deeply corrupt about this president and he had to go, we don't live in that news environment today.

Speaker 2:          01:07:05       We live in an environment where half of America lives in one news world and the other half of America lives in another news world. And the half of America living in the Breitbart Fox News world are not being told. The stories that the people living in the MSNBC, NPR, news universe are. And so in this world, the opportunity for Americans to like see the facts, the same facts and have a reflect of judgment about it and come to a view that this president, um, uh, you know, it needs to resign or be impeached. I don't think he should be impeached. But let's, that's a separate question. Um, is, is not possible. And that's what's so terrifying about it. When you live in a democracy where we don't all live in the same universe, you know, we don't know the same facts. Um, how do you knit together a public that can address these critical issues of national import? Um, and, and that's, I think our biggest challenge right now. It gets grayer than that, right? With characters like Sean Hannity that they, they separate the line between not just being some sort of a political pundit but actually campaigning for the president showing up at speeches, uh, addressing

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       the crowd making, making these big statements in support of the president. It's very strange to watch cause I don't remember that at any point in time. No, it wasn't the past. But I think the thing we need to realize is it is the future because it pays cable news pays tremendously when these people become partisan hacks inside of a politics of hate, which is the current politics of like both of democratic and Republican parties and the cable news stations, they build tribes who are deeply loyal to them. And the loyalty the tribes translates into advertising dollars. It is the business model of cable. So Sean Hannity looks to, you know, old geezers like me, like an abomination from the perspective of what news should be like. But from the standpoint of what the future is going to be, he is the future. And so then it becomes a question like how do we knit together a democracy given there will be people like the Sean Hannity's on cable television.

Speaker 1:          01:09:15       Uh, and you know, I've began to talk about the slow democracy movement, which I think, you know, I think I pointed to you as part of that. I think that there's a need to begin to think about how do we build political understanding, not through broadcast television but through something else that gives people a chance to think in more than 32nd bites. Yes. And podcasting I think is a core part of that. Is it entirely possible that something could be profitable that does shoot down the middle because people are so tired of this CNN, Fox, bipolar distribution of information. I mean, I remember when the elections were going on, I would flip back and forth between the two channels and it was like two alternative universes. There are different worlds, different worlds of focus, different worlds of what they're projecting. Yes, it, but I don't think the point is that it has to be down in the middle.

Speaker 1:          01:10:06       I think it has to be deep. So this is what I think is so powerful about podcasting. Like you know, the fact that you get people to listen to, you talk about an idea for an hour or two hours, some him three hours is astonishing. Literally astonishing in an age where the most a cable news channel we'll allocate to a new story is a minute and a half, two minutes, three minutes. Right? And you know, in the context of like the tweet thinking of Cable News, they can't afford to go deep on anything. And everything they're going to talk about are the things they can talk about sensibly in 25 seconds or 30 seconds or 40 seconds. And what you know, because you've lived this life of like having deep conversations about things that are important is that it sometimes takes more than 30 seconds to understand something always.

Speaker 1:          01:10:53       And the point is if we have media that's focused at the 32nd chunk, and that's how America understands the issues, we're never going to get anywhere. And the only way to get to get someplace is to begin to have conversations that are at the hour long chunk or the two hour long truck. And it's not important that, that be neutral or balanced. I don't care if it's balanced, I care that it is attempting to be serious, an in depth understanding the issue. So I don't care if Keto wants to have podcasts that try to tell us the deep story of Iron Randy and economics or something like that. That's fine. That's good. I think it's important that people start thinking about these issues in a richer, deeper way. And I think the challenge we have now is how do we begin to produce understanding, realizing that the world of Walter cronkite is never coming back and it might be a good thing, but it is just never coming back.

Speaker 1:          01:11:46       And, um, the world of Sean Hannity is a world that will destroy democracy. So how do we rebuild democracy outside of that? And you know, if you, if you had to pick the three things that have the most hopeful, I think podcasting is number one. I think some of the reflective deep, you know, funny, playful, but in the end, at the end of the hour long segment of a podcast, you understand something you didn't understand before. I think that's number one. I think comedy, like comedy television like brings people into understanding things in a way that's not possible on Fox News. I think that, you know, as number two I think shows like homeland, I don't know if you know, watch homeland, right? So watched it until the redheaded guy. Yeah, no. And then that went through this dark period in the middle, but the recent seasons, her chest unfucking believable and because they are unbelievable because they are such a deep rich understanding of the tensions at issue.

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       Like you won't understand the Iran nuclear deal watch the last season because after watching that season you like understand the tensions between the CIA and the president and what's actually going on with Israel. And, and I think that if you imagine television shows aspiring to tell the story in an entertaining way, in a way that brings people in the, that they voluntarily want to watch it. Uh, but that in the end, at the end of watching a season, you understand something. I understand the current season's about the Russia, you know, struggle. And I can't wait to watch it because it's going to be a richer understanding of that story than anything on television. Did you watch house of cards? I did. Um, up until the season did you quit at this season? I watched the season. I was very disappointed, but watched episode one and I said this, it seems like they just gave it to some different writers and it's just craziness.

Speaker 1:          01:13:33       It just seemed like a, like somebody just got ahold of it and they said, I'll take it and I want to write it my own way. Right. But even in the very beginning, you know, the striking thing about house of cards is it made it seem like stuff actually could happen in Washington. Yes. And you're like, wow, this really powerful guy, Frank Underwood. Actually can actually get important bills passed. And I remember watching that saying, Holy Shit, this is just completely not the truth. This is just not the way the system works. I mean, it would be good if it worked like that because at least it could do stuff. But the way it actually works is that these guys would be scurrying around trying to figure out, you know, what the tentacles of funders are directing them to do and the tentacles of funders added together.

Speaker 1:          01:14:14       It would be don't do anything that's not what you're there to do. Mm. Um, but would it at least did is sort of highlight the influences these people experience and it showed how deeply entrenched everything is. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't want to talk it down at all, man. I want a million different things like this on television. Just something that gives people, just gives them a richer understanding. Well and understanding period. Because for the most part, what people, when you go to school, you learn about democracy and our system of representative government and then you become an adult and you forget most of what you learned. And then you hear something about the electoral college and the popular vote and you know, and then you see bills getting passed and you know, what the hell is that and this and the stuff you learn at school is so politically correct and can't actually give you an understanding of anything.

Speaker 1:          01:15:06       Like you actually taught kids in high school, the way Congress worked, you'd, you know, the school board would go crazy. And they're like, no, no, no. You can't talk down American democracy like that. So the truth is not teachable. The only way to get people to see the truth is to expose it to them in a way that they want to see it. And you know, my point is that's not going to be Fox News. Fox News can never cover it at the depth and the interest level that it needs to be covered. It's going to be things like what you do, um, or things like what, um, you know, great television can do is our system of government analogous to like taking 'em like dos or windows 95 or something like that and just continuing to patch it. And never revisit it and never come up with a new operating system.

Speaker 1:          01:15:48       I think the better analogy is an operating system that has been taken over by malware virus because it's not innocent, you know, dos, you know, it was a fun system and that like cranked to a halt after awhile when you're trying to pile more and more on top of it. But that was just kind of the limits of what it could do. There was nothing malicious in its failure. But there's something malicious in this failure. There are people who are eagerly focused on how to make sure our government can't govern because if our government can't govern, they win. So, you know, um, the Koch brothers have this amazing, um, bipolar character. On the one hand, they're talking about the ideals of government, but the reality is their interventions make it so we don't have an EPA that can regulate their companies. So basically, you know, we have environmental policies that leaves their companies alone, which means they can make tons of money by polluting our environment without ever having to pay the consequence of it. And what they want is not change of a particular kind except for tax cuts. What they want is nothing to happen. Um, and so that's the kind of, you know, malware that's taken over the system of our government. This blocked the ability of the government to function. Um, and rather than having leaders at the center who say, hold it, let's just pause for

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       a second and realize this is a fucking broken system. We have politicians that continue to pretend as if everything's working, you just have to elect more Democrats and we'll get what we want. Yeah, I'm voting online. What, what would be the pitfalls of that and why hasn't that been implemented? If you can bank online, why can't you vote online? So I think, you know, most of the tech that the experts who are disinterested, meaning they're not working for deep old or something like that, I would tell you that we don't yet have the infrastructure to be able to be confident about this. Now. There are lots of people working on I think, really great open source implementations that that could be, could eventually produce the kind of confidence that we needed to have to be able to vote online. Um, and so I don't foreclose it in the long run, but I think what we've seen in the short run is that when we turn to these proprietary providers of technology to enable us to vote, they give us shit.

Speaker 2:          01:18:10       Uh, you know, look, you look at these voting machines, there was a recent story about, um, his 11 year old who was able to, uh, within like 15 minutes hack into the Florida election, um, uh, uh, system and change the results from, uh, you know, one, one candidate to another. Um, because you know, the companies that build these technologies are not filled with a bunch of rocket science. It's like, if you're really good, you're going to go work for Google or for facebook or something like that. So, so the proprietary software has all of these bugs and holes and intended backdoors built into it, intended back doors because they need, you know, the company itself needs a simple way to get in to check or to fix things. But then they don't worry about the fact that other people will get back doors to be able to get.

Speaker 2:          01:18:56       This was the argument for diebold system that did have a third party, um, entrance, tons of allegations about that. Did you ever see that documentary hacking democracies, is that disturbing to you? Incredibly. I don't know how much I believe about it was a, well, because I've seen so much that contradicts some of the claims about, you know, the extent to which there was real differences in the numbers. I remember at the election really being anxious about it because it seemed to me in Ohio in particular, a really compelling case was made that there was some something weird going on. But you know, the point is not so much the particulars of a particular election, it's recognizing that if you turn this over to proprietary software companies who are going to build these closed systems, nobody can inspect. There's no reason to trust them. Um, you know, there, it's not like they are intending to make themselves vulnerable to the Russians. They're just going to make themselves vulnerable to the Russians. And there are alternative systems like open source systems. It's something I know some people are building right now that I think eventually it could get us there and open source system like Linux based, something that would go onto your phone. Well it could be on your phone, but the point about the open source is that anybody can inspect the and be confident that the code is doing what it says it's due. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:20:11       Um, what I'm saying about being on your phone as the, the biometrics that we use on our phone today or some of the most secure in terms of like being able to establish that it's you that's making that vote. Like Iris scanners that you have on the, I have a Samsung note nine that has an iris scanner, checks my eyeballs. You know, you're my iphone checks my face and cheeks. The Shit. I mean there's, they're pretty amazing fingerprints obviously, but the fact that this is probably in terms of our own personal security in terms of information, this is probably the most secure. Our smartphones are probably the most secure devices we've ever possessed.

Speaker 2:          01:20:48       So on the one hand, yes, and that's why I say I agree with you that in the long run we should imagine a world where it'd be trivially easy to vote, just like it's easy for me to Venmo you, um, or a cash app. You, I guess is your favorite here. Um, uh, uh, money that should be the way the future is. But on the other hand, we need to realize that these technologies are also incredibly insecure in the sense that there is now a commercial market to exploit a insecurities inside of these funds. And, uh, you know, these companies basically have bounties that they post on the web, um, for people who will come forward and find certain holes and hacks. And once they get those hacks, um, they use them to leverage power and governments play this game all the time. And you know, there's a pretty strong argument that the cash shogi murder was a product of one of these exploits which was then going to be revealed and the need to cover up the fact that there was such an exploit out there.

Speaker 2:          01:21:50       Witnesses, I didn't know this. What is this about? Well, so the, so the basic idea is that the, you know, these companies and many of them, um, most prominent ones here, Israeli companies who facilitate the ability of governments to buy access to your phone, right? And that the standard way in which this has done is to, is to pierce the security by sending you something that you click on. An event embeds itself in the phone and there's no way you see it in it. No way that done it can be blocked. But there's, there's rumors now that in fact we've got something more than that going on where all they need you to do is get your telephone number and they're able to hack into the system to get access to your phone. But the point is these companies have a market now for selling this type of insecurity.

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       So belts like sell the ability for you to get access here. And the story that, you know, I don't have a lot of reasons to, to, to be absolutely confident about this except that I trust the person who's inside the security world that says this to me. Um, you know, the story is that this is part of what happened in the [inaudible] context. That the Saudis had exploited this in a way that was going to be revealed. And, and the simple solution to that eventual revelation was to remove the person who would reveal it. And that's why.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       Yeah. So, so this is the point about the wrecking hazard at these funds. On the one hand, for the ordinary life, it's more secure than anything you've ever had. But in the other hand, systematically it's building insecurity into our lives in a way that can be exploited by powerful people. And for most people, it doesn't matter. Like most people, ordinary, ordinary Joes, um, uh, you know, they're not, they're never going to be vulnerable because nobody's going to spend $1 million to get a hack against the individual person. When I hear that from a person justifying why they don't worry about it, it drives me crazy. I can't do anything. What are they going to do? I'm a, I'm clean. Don't worry about me, but it's not, that's not what we're doing. That's all we're talking about. Right? Because if we have a system where systematically powerful people can just push a button and like find a way to control, you can control anybody. Jamal. Yeah. Then we've got a system that no longer makes it possible for ordinary people to stand up to power that that's basically what it is. Like this is the, this is a structure that allows powerful people if it is insecure to protect themselves because they can just leverage that against us. And I think, you know, this is a completely UN focused problem. Like nobody is talking about this politically, but the market for this commercialized ex, uh, security exploits is hugely important and we've got to find a way to, to address it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:31       So is it feasible that as technology advances and as the security advances as well, I mean the biometrics that we have today are far greater than the passwords that we use just a few years ago. Um, that there could be something that you can't exploit, especially considering open source variance where there can be checked by the community. Yeah. So, so, so the problem is, is not the kind of particular technologies working the way you intend them to work. You know, if you've got great biometric technologies, um, those are really good at making sure in the ordinary case that you're the right person using your phone. The problem is the code is so big and so complicated that there's always going to be little bugs inside the code. And what these exploits are, are like coders who like poke at the code looking for these little hooks and they link one hook to another hook to another hook, and then they find the way in to exploit the system. So the exploits are never, well I shouldn't say never. There's another story. It's important to recognize, I'll talk about that a second. But the exploits are not in the main case intended by anybody. It's just the UN. It's just the natural consequence of having, you know, literally hundreds or millions of lines of code that go into making this machine work. And that's what's being exploited. And when you have a world like the iphone, which is this monoculture, like, you know, everybody has the same operating system or a seam versions of the system. If you find

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       an exploit in the and the I os, um, and apple doesn't know about it, um, and you can exploit it for six months or a year, you can, you know, do a lot of damage to a lot of people's lives before anybody gets around to it, to blocking it. Now, you know, that's even in the best case where everybody's working hard to make their system as secure as it can. It can be. You know, there was this period after the, um, nine 11, when there's, you know, very strong, incredible allegations that the United States government went around to these technology companies and said, we need you to build back doors into your technology so we can track down the terrorists. And there's strong allegations that in fact, many of the most important technology companies complied. And what they quickly discovered is that the backdoor is intended for the United States government trying to attack terrorists were being exploited by the Chinese trying to steal trade secrets from American companies.

Speaker 2:          01:26:58       So this infrastructure that was intended to be secure to protect American companies so that they could do their work without being s for an espionage on top of them became an infrastructure of espionage again, because it's so complicated to get it perfectly right. And, um, the, the return from exploit is so huge that you can just expect the market is always going to supply it. What was the other example that you're going to bring up? That was it. That was the idea was that the intended back doors that that turn out to be exploited for other purposes. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:27:32       but isn't the system itself, like when you deal with the hanging chads or paid hairball their counters or to kill people, you living giving it up to human beings, the potential for errors, massive, right to just to count things up or the potential for corruption, the decision to ignore certain collections. I mean this, this is all been documented, right?

Speaker 2:          01:27:54       Yeah. And all of this follows from the fact that we, bizarrely in America, unlike most mature democracies around the world, make the running of elections a partisan event. Like, you know, Republicans in a district or Democrats in a district control the voting systems. Like, why the hell would that be? Why don't we have like people who, who self identity and professional framework is nonpartisan, independent, like election commission. That's about, you know, it's above the partisan bias so that there's no incentive in Georgia, for example, for the government to allocate money to fix voting machines just in Republican districts and not in democratic districts, or there's no incentive to shutdown a voting polling place, which they did in Georgia, making it so that people in that area would have to go a huge distance to be able to vote where to create it so that it takes seven hours to vote in some districts in 20 minutes to vote in other districts.

Speaker 2:          01:28:49       There's no incentive to do that if your job is simply to make it possible for people to vote efficiently and if we measure you and, and, and reward you based on how easy have you made it for people in this state to vote easily and efficiently, we don't get that kind of efficiency. We don't get that kind of innovation because it's a rigged game. You, you know, you might have people who, I'm sure many of these people are above partisan motivation, but we also know that many of these people are deeply motivated by partisan politics, especially at that kind of middle level of party politics. And if they can set it up so that their side winds because of the way they've played the game for allocating voting resources, then more power to them. And that's exactly what happened in Georgia with this recent governor's election, that kind of outrageous that the man running the election system, secretary state does not resign from this job as he runs for governor. And the governorship is decided in such a very close way by um, the decisions that he made about, you know, how they're going to throw people off. The voting roles are, which allocations of a voting system technology will be made across the state. This is a product or just making it political. We could make it non political and might not have all of these kinds of problems

Speaker 3:          01:30:05       dealing with this very unique landscape now of Google and facebook and twitter and instagram and all these different social media groups that have a vested interest in a specific narrative, uh, being portrayed. And, uh, one, one thing specifically is, and this is being addressed right now in Congress, is the discrimination against conservative voices. And, uh, there's a lot of denial that, but there's also a lot of evidence that that is the case and that they feel like they have some moral or ethical obligation to suppress certain conservative voices for whatever reason, and push the narrative of, of progressive and liberal voices. This is a very strange thing because the, the amount of influence that something like Google or facebook has today is arguably as great or greater than that. The Sean Hannity's of the world and the CNNS and the, the, the, the traditional news outlets.

Speaker 2:          01:31:07       Yeah. So no doubt. You know, there's a big debate about whether they were more important in 2016 then, um, the cable stations, my colleague Yolk Benkler has a book that argues pretty powerfully. I think that it was actually the cable stations that were more responsible for the result then the facebooks. But whether in 2016 they were the more powerful someday in the future, they are going to be more powerful. It's certainly powerful. Absolutely. Um, and you know, the question is what we mean by bias or discrimination here. Like you know, in 2017 in the fall it was revealed that facebook was selling ads for people who wanted to target quote Jew haters. Okay. So you could go and you could buy ads for Jew haters. Now there was never, how did that work? Okay. No, I mean, you know, they have lots of categories you get to pick when you buy facebook ads, you know, liberals or people who people over 60 white armor.

Speaker 2:          01:32:01       This was one of the categories that was exposed. You could buy ads for Jew haters. It was, it was an actual category. Yeah, yeah. What, yeah. Now, there was never a time that a facebook engineer or marketing person decided we ought to create a Jew hater category, right? This is not a decision of any human. It was the product of the machine, the Ai that was developing the categories based on what they saw people happen to be interested in. And then throw up categories to see what sticks. And then certain categories stick and then they run with them. So it, so you might say, you know, if you are the, uh, you know, if he defamation League you would say, Oh my God, facebook is, you know, discriminating to encourage Jew haters. But from another perspective, you're like, the machine's doing it. No doubt. But, uh, but to what extent do you want to say facebook is doing it?

Speaker 2:          01:32:51       And I think that's off. That's often what you're going to see in this argument about whether they're quote biasing the system against one side and the other, you know, like this hilarious, um, uh, hearing that was just held on Capitol Hill two days ago where a great congressman Lewis, like if you don't want negative ad results in the search, then don't do bad things right then. Um, so, you know, I think this is nice and quite fun. It was really funny. It, this is like nobody's intent. We should explain that to people. Just don't know what we're talking about. Yeah. So, so there was an argument about, you know, whether Google was tilting the ads to embarrass one side or the other and um, uh, um, I guess it was a congressman from Iowa. Everybody that's the guy who didn't know that Google didn't make the iphone.

Speaker 2:          01:33:38       Yeah, he got really embarrassed. But anyway, there was this, um, you know, the exchange with basically here I'm going to show you a demonstration and they put it in a certain name and Congressman Smith and then up comes this or reference to his race baiting. And he's like outraged by this. And you know, so one theory is you've got Google engineers down there saying, let's get Congressman Smith so we're going to make it so every time you put Smith in their upcoming race baiting, but Google's response was, look, we don't do individualize search results. Like we give people what we think people want based on what they've done in the past and what they've shown interest in. And, and so that's what's producing this. It's the machine that's producing this result and that let Congress Lou come back with, you know, if you don't like the connections, then just don't enable them to be made by doing things like don't do things like race baiting.

Speaker 2:          01:34:24       Um, if you don't want negative search results, don't do negative things, which is a pretty, but, but I do think that it, there's a really hard problem here. When you say it's the machine is doing it, you know, what's the future gonna be like when we can just say it's not my problem, it's the machine. This is just facebook though. Um, when, when you're talking about, or Google rather when you were talking about twitter, twitter has a, a different issue and their issue is there's accusations of shadow banning that they have decided that they're going to silence voices

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       or make them much more difficult to find or eliminate them from certain people's feeds. You know, and they're doing this, this, the allegation that they're doing this based on their own personal preferences, their, their beliefs that the, you know, they're progressive ideology wants them to lean left and dis somehow or another distribute that information in a much more left leaning way. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:35:24       And I hear these and I don't, not an expert on what they're doing. Um, and I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, certain complaints come in about certain feeds and they say, we're going to take these off. I mean, that's the allegation and they haven't denied that. Um, and you know, quite frankly, some of these like feeds, you know, Alex Jones stuff. Um, you know, if you're, if the consequence of your news show is that somebody takes a gun to a pizza shop in Chicago in, in Washington to try to prove that Hillary Clinton is running a sex slave operation in the basement, there's something wrong with what's going on their child's sex, sex life. Um, so I understand why they feel like they're a responsible there. And you know, it was recognized from the very beginning. These companies have said we're going to try to create a certain kind of environment. And like, so facebook required, you identify yourself so that under the shadows of anonymity you wouldn't be causing wreaking lots of havoc inside the system. But look, I think the more fundamental problem here, you know, so what I've said so far, people like Google and facebook might like, here's stuff they're going to hate. The more fundamental problem here is that we have no antitrust enforcement of any of these companies against any of these companies. And we've allowed them to become so incredibly powerful without any justification under the law.

Speaker 3:          01:36:42       Well, isn't the issue though that this was never anticipated that this is not like when they created twitter, they didn't think of it. It's going to be, it's going to be some voice of distribution of information that's unprecedented worldwide. But that's what it is.

Speaker 2:          01:36:55       Yeah, no, they didn't expect, no doubt. They didn't expect it to work exactly the way it worked. But the antitrust law has from the beginning had standards that should have said we need to step in and certain places. So for example, in 2010, facebook is facing a pretty powerful competitive threat from instagram. And, uh, the question is what they're going to do. Like it's cooler to be instagram. It's kids are using it. Much of the growth rate is much faster in an ordinary competitive market. What they would do is they would build a better product to compete with instagram. Their response was to write a check for $1 billion and they bought instagram and um, and they've bought a whole bunch of other companies. Clearly your whatsapp, which you know, was a very important competitor in, uh, in people believed a really secure way to communicate and they, by Boston dynamics to have they, that's amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:37:48       There's, there's a wikipedia page. It has like endless list of companies that they've bought. They're buying robots. Yeah, that makes sense. Um, does it find out if that's true? Yeah. Um, but the point is, antitrust law in any of these moments should have in historically would have stepped in and said, wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't buy your way into complete dominance of these markets. Um, and I think one of the biggest changes that's happened in the last 20 years is at the antitrust department has just shot up its doors and just stopped doing its work. So if we had a more competitive internet environment where, um, companies had to compete against each other, um, you'd have companies that try to compete by protecting your privacy differently, by refusing to sell your information differently. You'd have lots of pressure on companies like facebook to behave, not because idiot senators who don't know how facebook works or calling them before hearings, but because the market itself is creating the competition that drives them to behave in a way that actually conforms with what consumers want. So I agree with you. These are real questions, important questions to figure out. Are they biasing in one way or the other? And if they're biasing systematically, that's a really important problem. But the solution to that problem might not be more government regulation. The solution to that problem might be governments making sure we have the right kind of competition going on here so that they can't get away with behaving

Speaker 3:          01:39:15       as bad way. What would be that right comic is in fact, Google bought it and they actually sold it last year. Oh yeah. Interesting. Probably sold to the Russians, the Japanese in Japanese, uh, um, these like what would be the right kind of competition? It would have to be something that balances it out, right? Like some sort of a right wing social media platform. But those tend to get infested with trolls. And four Chan type people. Then who the seat when you, as soon as you say we're not gonna have any regulation. I mean the idea would be right. You say, oh Google and facebook, they're so progressive, they lean left, they suppress conservative voices and they don't believe in freedom of speech. So we're going to create a right wing platform that allows freedom of speech and doesn't suppress conservative voices. And you know what happens to those things?

Speaker 3:          01:40:06       They get infested by four Chan people and the pepe the frog people and they started saying racist things. If I could say anything, I'll say anything, anything means anything. And that's, that's a real problem in today's Day and age because there's a lot of bored people out there and they get excited about a platform where they can say something that they know is completely outrageous under an anonymous screen name. And people think, well this is indicative of a person's actual real beliefs. Eh? Sometimes. Sometimes it's board people that are trying to fuck with people and they're trying to get a rise out of folks and they know that if they write a bunch of n words and Heil Hitler that it's going to get a reaction and then they'll check it every couple of minutes to see what kind of, well, I'll look at all these people getting mad.

Speaker 3:          01:40:50       Ha Ha. Like this is what happens. So incredibly progressive team tends to, when you think of someone as being progressive or b, having a progressive voice, you tend to think of being inclusive. You know, uh, did not supporting homophobia, being open to all sorts of different marginalized groups rights. But when you think of conservative, you opened the door for a lot of people that are rejected by these progressive groups. And they might not necessarily be conservative, but they are not welcome in these progressive spaces. So they come on to these new places and they, it turns into a dumpster fire.

Speaker 2:          01:41:31       Yeah. Look, um, the story you just described is the story of cable television, right? So the story of cable television is that at a certain point, people like Robert Roger ailes and the murdochs decided that we didn't have enough conservative media out there. And so they funded not just magazines like the new republic, but they funded the beginning of cable television and um, and that created this bifurcation in media with cable television. And you know, one could make these observations about, I mean, this is what [inaudible] book is all about. Like what the nature of truth is on cable television on the right is different from what it is on the left. Um, so I think that's all fair and I don't think anybody has a clear sense of what the right answer look looks like in this space. I mean, the reality is, you know, facebook is a technology. I mean, facebook friends are going to really hate me for this, but here, um, facebook is a technology to exploit insecurity for the purpose of selling ads. That's what it does. What it does is make you feel like you've check and you're like, why didn't she like that photograph? Or why isn't he friended me? And so you constantly engaged because you're constantly trying to feed this, you know, feedback and that is exploiting Tristan. Tristan Harris's work is really a powerful here. It's exploiting your insecurity.

Speaker 3:          01:42:53       Is that really what it is? Cause I've always thought about it as being a fast food version of the nutrients that we're missing in an actual real community.

Speaker 2:          01:43:01       That's so good. That's exactly the right way to think about it. But just in the same way that fast food companies figure out how to exploit the brain chemistry that makes it so that you eat chicken wings, you know barbecue chicken wings because they know that's what's going to feed that kind of addiction. And just like gaming companies figure out how to tweak the game so that they'd know how to get the addiction out of your kids that this company is really great. If I getting you to like turnover as much as you can to them to build you into this quote community. Why are they doing that? Not because Mark Zuckerberg has come, some kind of freaky guy who wants to know your secrets, but because the more you turn over to them, the better their ads are in feeding you information. So this is a technology for the purpose of engendering advertising. And so that

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       advertising gets really, really good. And so, you know, you could say that facebook is tilted to the left, but the reality is there is an extraordinary amount of exploitation of the advertising inside of facebook to feed information to the right in this last election, I mean is what I'm Kathleen Hall Jamieson Book about. This is really quite amazing and documenting and that's because it's gotten really good in being able to segment markets on the basis of what people know or care about. Again, not because anybody planned it, nobody wrote you a hater, but because the AI is smart enough to figure that out. And so when you build this technology that is driven to the purpose of making it easier to sell ads, you produce this world that um, you know, has no necessary connection to figuring people, figuring out what the truth is. Again, think of cable television.

Speaker 1:          01:44:39       Cable television is about building really loyal community, building the tribal sense of the community. If telling the truth did that they would tell the truth. If not telling the truth does that they will not tell the truth. The question is not whether you're telling the truth or not. The question is what builds the advertising base. And so this, this reality that we have, these platforms that are ad driven, um, distort or constructs drives that platform to develop in certain ways. And that's why I think it's important to think, well what if we could create a competitive environment where there were different platforms available, ones that we're not focused on, you know, driving ads. And this is something that I get, I think power, they fund those. Isn't that the, the reason why something like Google or facebook has gotten so big is because there's so much money behind it.

Speaker 1:          01:45:26       Well, two things because they've been allowed to get so big and because so much money behind what stopped them, the antitrust departments, you know, the people in antitrust department would step in and say, facebook, you become too successful. The way you're buying up competitors is disturbing to us. Well, but again, the thing of the difference in that sentence, you've become so successful. That's one sentence. And what we want to do in America is encourage companies to become successful. I believe in, you know, innovators and markets working. That's really great, but you've bought your competitor is a separate statement. Like you have a bunch of money because the stock is so valuable because people think you're the future of money, but then you turn and use that money to buy a competitors. What do you putting up Jamie?

Speaker 3:          01:46:06       What is this? That's the total number of, they've spent the last, I think it was seven years, saw the company as they bought. Scroll back, don't move. Okay. Total cost of acquisitions. What does that $23 trillion? Billion. Billion. $23 billion more than the gross domestic product of a Fiji, Zimbabwe and mild deeves combine. 19 billion of that was for that one. What's that? Really? Yeah, 19 billion. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:46:33       it's insane. Anyway, so, but the point is when you're talking about acquisitions, you're not necessarily talking about companies that are succeeding because they're so good, right? So you know, when you say what are the alternatives going to look like? It's a really hard question, but we have some of it in real space. Like we understand

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       NPR has a different side of incentives from Fox News. We understand podcasts have a different set of incentives from youtube videos, right? Youtube videos have a different kind of constraint. If you did a three hour youtube video, um, you would not live in the same way that you get to live in the context of podcasts. But we do do a three hour youtube videos, but it doesn't get the success that it gets because it's a three hour youtube video. It's because people are committed to your podcast. I mean, I know these guys, I could carry it around and like when you get to a place where it sounds like it's going to be interesting to see what's on the video, then they flip up the video. But that, you know, the average successful youtube video, you know, you do a political youtube video, you're told you can't be more than two and a half minutes, then you've lost people. Um, but the point is the environments,

Speaker 3:          01:47:36       I don't necessarily think that's correct. Jordan Peterson is doing a lot of really long youtube videos that are very successful. There's hurt as podcasts and there's, um, there's a hunger right now for unedited thought. And I mean, not, not, not edited and unedited nonsense and in terms of language, but in terms of no one influencing what you're saying. So if you decided to do a podcast or a thing on youtube and no one was leaning over your shoulder with an agenda or a guideline to follow, there's a real hunger for that because people feel like they're what you've described about facebook and cable news, they're essentially just trying to sell you things, keep you on the hook so they can profit from you. There's a real hunger for someone who's not doing that. Right. I agree. That's why I feel like there's gotta be a market for news in that regard. Like an actual, unbiased, uncensored, truly objective centrist news station.

Speaker 2:          01:48:32       Well, again, I think that's the slow democracy movement, the podcast feeds, you know, because the reality is if you had a simple way to be watching in every second of your two hour, three hour podcasts, what was working and what was not, it'd be really hard for you to resist. I would resist. Okay. I wouldn't pay attention to that thing for a second car to you.

Speaker 3:          01:48:55       I've already been faced with that before. People is like said to me, well you know, how will this is when people start tuning on black. Throw that away.

Speaker 2:          01:49:02       Yeah, but you know, I know friends I want Chris Hayes will tell you about, you know, life on Msnbc where it, see that's because of advertiser doll. Okay. That's my point. My point, the way to tell me, this is my whole point about this platform. This platform is an advertising drone platform. That fact steers it in a certain way and I saying we need to build alternative platforms, which was what you're building in the, in the pocket. It's not like advertising is not important to your stuff. Of course you start with, you know, talking about certain products, it helps sponsor what you're doing. So it's not anti market, it's all for market. But the point is it allows you to develop the content in a way that's not micro managed by the advertising dollar or the or the market incentive. And that's critically, it's

Speaker 3:          01:49:47       also other people's incentive to get you to do things in a way that they will feel they feel would be more profitable so that everybody gains. Um, I don't have those other people, so there's no one else. So if I, but if I've done television shows before, when you do television shows before you will have meetings with producers and they will have notes and they will tell you that this is hurting our bottom line and this is not good for that or we have to emphasize more this or the network wants that. And it's really just about accentuating your ability to make more money. Right. Which is why we have to build these alternatives that can compete with the advertising driven platforms. Well, if you could get a really entertaining news show on youtube or, I mean not cast, the young Turks sorta tried doing that, but they leaned so hard left have to bet.

Speaker 3:          01:50:35       But they attract an extraordinary number of people and that's good. But again, I, you know, we have this image of like new shows, you know, have a version of Walter cronkite. Maybe that's not what it is. Maybe you know, the cold air report is a new show. Maybe something who's someone is mocking as they're delivering you the infant, they're giving you the information that makes someone who's objective. I would like someone is really objective who talks about the negative applications of whatever law or build it's being discussed. Like what would be bad for everyone? What would be good for Democrats, Republicans, poor people, rich people. You don't get that. There's no version of that available right now. Every version leans towards whatever platform they're on, whether it's Fox News or MSNBC. Yeah. I think, not for want of trying. I just think the world doesn't support it. Right. But the world doesn't support it because there's people are so tribal because they want to be either on the Fox News camp or they want to be in the MSNBC camp. I really feel like there's a lot of people that just aren't being represented and folks like me who just, I want to know what, what is happening? Why, why is this the case? Why is this leaning in this direction? What's the real motivation behind this bill? What's the real motivation behind these actions?

Speaker 2:          01:51:53       Yeah. And uh, and the question is whether you're going to get it from a single person who purports to be quote objective or whether you're going to get it from three or four people like reading across these different perspectives. When I was a kid, I was obsessed with the Soviet Union. And in 1982, I went to the Soviet Union. I was like, uh, I guess I was 20, just turned 21. And um, and I was hitchhiking through Eastern Europe. And then I went through the Soviet Union and I was on a train from Leningrad to Moscow and on a sitting next to a professor, I always seem to be followed by people who spoke English. But this guy spoke English. And he said to me, um, you know, we have a better system of free speech and Soviet Union than you do in America. How dare he? Eh, so I said, what the hell could that possibly mean? And he said, well, when you wake up in the mornings, he said, uh, he said, when you wake up in the morning,

Speaker 1:          01:52:47       you read the New York Times or The Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal and you think you know the truth. But we know when we read our newspapers, everybody's lying to us. So we have to read seven or eight newspapers and triangulate on the truth. And that makes us a more critical, free speech society that America is. And you know, it's kind of funny at the time because like you realize they didn't have any, but there's a kernel of truth to that. You know, when my dad gets an email that says Barack Obama's a Muslim, he comes from the time when he just believe what's printed, even though it's not printed, it's just an email. And so he just kind of like, oh my God, the president's a Muslim. Um, but you know, my kid gets an email that says Barack Obama is a Muslim. He's like, yeah, well, I mean, what else?

Speaker 1:          01:53:36       I mean like he's going to be like, you want to see different views. And so I think that in some sense we are producing a culture, especially among our kids, uh, or at least one hopes where they recognize that everything is partial. Yes. And you gotta you gotta do a lot of work to mold to knit it together and in the end that might be a better mip, a better ecology for producing democracy and truth. Then one where, you know, you've got to trust the source to be quote objective in this case. That's an interesting perspective. Um, I do definitely agree that young people are more skeptical and more aware of the possibilities of fuckery today than ever before. Here's a funny story. Michael Sherman, you know Michael Shermer, who is a professional skeptic. Yeah. I get a DM from him, says, uh, there's a story about you on bees.

Speaker 1:          01:54:29       Uh, uh, what it, what is the British BBC? It's a story about you on BBC. You have to log in to your twitter to read it. So I look at that. I go, what kind of bullshit? This what'd you get hacked? So I sent him a message, say, Hey, did you get hacked? They sent him the message and he said, what? There's a story about me. And he logged in. Shit, he's a fucking professional skeptic. Wow. They got him. But why? Cause he's older now, you know, I mean, I think guys that didn't grow up with that, they don't, or they don't know tricksters right. They don't know the, the, the ways of and was a nightmare for him. He'll like, I mean, his whole system was screwed up. He had a j every time it would make to make a tweet, it would get deleted. Like it was really bad. And I, well, I, the email, I'm go, Dude, you got hacked? Yeah, no, it's a problem with us old people. This is the way we live. Well, it's just you grow up with one system and then all of a sudden, you know, I don't know what to do here. Oh, it says it needs my login. Let me just give me what, and then all these pop up boxes and oh no. The number of people who are being tricked into believing the irs is calling them on the telephone and demanding hilarious, hilarious and tragic. I

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       mean, there's these amazing me and told me they were going to put my whole family in jail. My whole family, they left a message. Since you did not return our call, we will put your whole family in jail. I'm like my whole family. The dog to everybody. What about the cats? It's like, what the fuck man, like dude, trying to freak people out and it's, you know, an automated voice message. People fall for it folks. Yeah. Yeah. Old folks get roped into that stuff real hard. It's very sad. It's very sad because you know, a lot of them are lonely and they don't have a lot of companionship and they get these messages and they don't know who to turn to to explain it to

Speaker 1:          01:56:24       God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you know, so is there a reason to be hopeful here? Well, younger kids. Yeah. The other thing that makes me really hopeful is places like Reddit, you know? So which forums are you going?

Speaker 3:          01:56:39       Well, I know there's so much shit that's really bad stuff. No, some of them were

Speaker 1:          01:56:45       great though, but many of them are great. But the point, what the greatness can inheres in there demonstrating incredible talents out there in the world that, you know, in the 1970s just would have been invisible. Like you kind of looked at the world in the 1970s which I remember the 1970s he kind of thought they were great people at the top. You know, they were all on television and, and everybody else was kind of a troll. But what reddit does every day, you know, I'm obsessed with certain of these feeds adjuster. Amazing. But it's like you read them like here's just some Joe Schmo out there that's taken a bunch of data and data is beautiful and like demonstrated something amazing by the way he's built it. And you get the sense that the world is filled with these incredibly talented, smart people everywhere who are, you know, many of them just have too much time. But the point is they are out there everywhere. So if you ask why should we be hopeful? It's that we develop these critical attitudes, we have this ability to think across and the army is filled with so many incredibly talented people and the Internet surfaces it, it makes it possible for us to at least reach them. Yes. I, and then the question is, can we use this power leverage is power and actually do something with the forces of evil that now control.

Speaker 3:          01:57:59       I had an interesting moment last night, uh, at the Ice House comedy club where there was a drunk couple in the front row that we're talking really loud and they were annoying all the people around them and they were kind of chiming in and heckling and raising their hands and eventually they got kicked out and a, it was pretty fun. Everybody was having a good time. It was pretty, pretty crazy. Even as they were getting kicked out, the rest of the audience was having a good time because we're making fun of it. And I said, as these people were getting kicked out, I said, this is basically us. Most of us are cool. There's 150 people in here and add of the hunter, 50 people, 148 of them are having a great time. Everyone's drinking and, and we're the, all these comedians and no one wants any extraordinary attention.

Speaker 3:          01:58:46       No one wants any special attention, but two people fucked it up. Now if you were next to those people, you would say, oh, the crowd there sucks. The people are always yelling things out and they're drunks and they heckle well because that those two people required an exorbitant amount of attention. They asked for more attention than anyone else. And if you use that bias sample group and say, well this is the crowd, the crowd is these drunk people that yelled, no, the fast majority of the crowd are really polite, fun people out having a good time. And they approached it with the perfect attitude. I think this is the world. This is the world. I think the world is, there's a small percentage of people that fuck things up for everybody. And I think that this, this is in terms of politics, in terms of business, in terms of everything.

Speaker 3:          01:59:34       Isn't that yes, in terms of the net for sure. And I think the net is the perfect example of that. If you're a person that gets, um, if something happens to you and uh, people, uh, start attacking you online for it. If you just noticed the, the number of people that say you're involved in some sort of a story, right? A say maybe there's a million people that know about this story and you get a 450 people send, you mean things? You think it's the end of the world? Yeah, 150 people like you don't notice that it's a hunt. You just see all these messages and it's, it's unmanageable. You're like, oh my God, everyone hates me. No, 150 people have decided to take action and make you feel bad because they feel bad. It's a small number in terms of the overall number of human beings, but if you are Louis C k right and it's coming at you, you're like, Holy Shit, the world fucking hates me.

Speaker 3:          02:00:26       You know, and it's, it's, this is, this is the situation that we're in right now. We just have so many voices. It's incredible though because ad of all those voices, as long as you're not personally trying to figure it out and filter it yourself with your own, which is completely impossible. But if you could just look at it objectively from afar, this is going to work itself out in a far better way than has ever happened before. In our past, there's never been this many voices and our pastor's been, uh, like you were talking about a select few voices, the Walter cronkite's, the whoever it is at the top, and then everyone else sort of had to wait for the narrative to be spelled out for them. Right? That's not the case anymore. That's right. And, and again, I think it's the best of times and the worst of times. So it's the best of times because all these new voices are bringing all sorts of great perspective and insight and intelligence to the, to the story that wasn't there before. And that's great. The problem is, is if the infrastructure that used to be there to kind of bring us up, bring us all up to kind of basic level so that we understood the facts disappears, so they went and have anything that kind of makes it so that we all understand what's at issue and what's at stake

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       and what the facts are so that we can act as a democracy in a sensible way. Then the question is how do we run a democracy? You know, because if we could have all these different, you know, I like to think about the difference between the culture channel and the democracy channels and the culture channel. This is the best of times by orders of magnitudes and the stuff on television today is a billion times better than anything from the 1970s in 1980s yeah. And it's, that's a product of this incredible competition and the fact that you can have anything and any niche market and as long as it's enough, it makes sense to do it I, and that's what's great. But when you turn to the democracy channel, the same fragmentation, the same niche market, the same reality of it's all living in these different universes means we can't address problems as a democracy with even the same facts.

Speaker 1:          02:02:31       And that's a real problem because if we all live in our own fact universe, uh, but we have to same face, the same real problems in the same real earth, then we're not going to decide them in any sensible way. And how you solve that problem is really hard. Like we're not going back, thank God we're not going back to the 1960s. It's just not going to be the case that there are three channels we get to watch that's just not gonna happen. Um, and, and it's a great thing because we've got all this amazing culture, but what do we do on the democracy side? How do we build a democracy recognizing that everybody's not going to spend all their time geeking out about campaign finance reform legislation? I, and, and that's why I think we need to think about these other ways to bring people to some sense of understanding.

Speaker 1:          02:03:13       Um, and you know, Brian Calendar and uh, um, uh, hunter mats were the first people that brought me into this. Like they put me out of their podcast. And I remember like not even knowing when he did this, like the length of that conversation and thinking, what are you going to cut this down to like six minutes or 10 minutes. How long did you guys talk? I think we talked for an hour, you know, and then we're already done two hours and 15 minutes. Holy Shit. Yeah, it was a time warp when this room. Wow. I can see that. Yeah. I mean, but I remember thinking like in the middle, like I stopped and I thought, Whoa, this is the, this is the changing of the world, this is it. And as opposed to those panel shows us three talking heads, I go over each other. Like when you're on these cable television shows and you've got 30 seconds to say something and, and you know, you linked it before and I think this is really the key.

Speaker 1:          02:03:59       It's, it's, it's exactly like diet. Like, we recognize that we have been like put into a world right now where we all eat shitty food because it's been designed to make it so tasty. Like we love it. You know? And the only way we reformed that is if individuals, one by one began to decide to eat the right stuff, right? You've got to decide to, to engage in the right kind of healthy behavior to, to be able to survive in this world because the incentives of the market are to sell you stuff that doesn't necessarily do that. It's the same thing with the information space. That's why the slow food movement is like the slow democracy movement. Like the slow food movement is how do you produce food that's actually healthy in a way that feeds you. You feed your body in the right way.

Speaker 1:          02:04:46       I think the slow democracy movement, how do you feed it, democracy and, and the elements to that. If gotta be contexts where people are free to get deeper than 30 seconds. Um, and if we don't build more of those, we're going to have a, we're going to have a really desperate time for democracy. We're going to have what we have, which is the rise of authoritarians around the world. Do you foresee the possibility of alternative social media outlets sort of viewing all the issues that people do have with Google or facebook or twitter and any of these are perceived to be biased sources of information and coming up with something that has clear protections in there and sort of like the founding fathers did when they distinguished the our system of government that, listen, we don't want that. Let's, let's organize that as we're starting to make sure that this doesn't, it doesn't ever turn into some sort of an echo chamber.

Speaker 1:          02:05:42       Yeah. Look, I, I'm way above my pay grade. Yeah. But what I know gets us there is competition. I know that the only thing that has ever gotten us to the next great innovation is the enforcement of competition, which is why it's a problem when someone like facebook. Absolutely [inaudible] gave us the Internet. Yeah. Was interventions by the government against a t, and t, which was the dominant telecommunications company for more than a century that finally said, enough of this, you can't leverage your power to control all innovation. And once that intervention happened, people could layer on top of their wires a new network called the Internet. And when they did that, government said to companies like cable television companies, okay, yeah, you've got broadband across your cable line. But that doesn't mean you get to decide what applications go on that cable line. So you, your Hba, I mean you're the cable company.

Speaker 1:          02:06:40       You can't say that there can't be Netflix on the cable or you can't slow netflix down. Now obviously they would want to slow netfix down because Netflix is a competitor with their basic business model. But the intervention to assure competition created the opportunity for these great new innovations. Now, nobody at the beginning of that had any clue about what would come out of it. All that they knew was that the only way to get something new and create was to assure competition. And that's the commitment we've given up since 2000 since George Bush became president, it's 2001. There's been no major enforcement action by the antitrust department against any of these companies. And that is a huge problem. And until we rediscover the importance of competition, not because we're geniuses and we can figure out what the future will bring, but because we know from the past that the only way the future comes is if you guarantee competition.

Speaker 1:          02:07:38       Unless we do that, we're never going to solve any of these problems. Yeah. Ensuring competition is ensuring innovations and shoring and anybody who doesn't want competition wants to stifle innovation. And it's gotta be thought to be a selfish proposition. Right. And the basic, so you know, the basic argument and competition lie, you know, there's competition law got taken over by a bunch of Chicago economists who said the only question was efficiency or consumer welfare. But there's another perspective that libertarians like Luigi Zingales, who's an economist at University of Chicago Business School and um, and people who are not libertarians like Tim Wu, who's a professor at Columbia embrace. And this is the idea of political antitrust and the idea of political antitrust is you should also worry if companies are so big that they can corrupt the government. Like this is a dimension to worry about too, because if they get to be so big that they can corrupt the government, then you know that they will use that power to protect themselves against innovation because if an innovator comes, he doesn't come with 50 lobbyists.

Speaker 1:          02:08:39       He does comes with a great idea. I mean, you know, Elon Musk saw this dramatically as he's developing this incredible alternative and tried to figure out how to sell it inside of states and then the lobbyists for the car companies would go state by state and forbid them from being able to sell cars without a local dealership in the state. Right? There was a huge fight as the incumbent industries leverage their power over government to protect themselves from this new competitor. And this is the, this is the fight we have to, we have to make central again because if we don't do that, then the dinosaurs will have the power through this corrupted political system to protect themselves against the future. And this is just the moment when we need to figure out how to make the future come. I'm glad you're raising these warning flags, but I feel like from talking to you that you're fairly optimistic.

Speaker 1:          02:09:30       You're the first person who's ever said that. It really is like you're optimistic, you're perception of the Internet and the young people coming up and the, okay, that's fair. The way information is being distributed today, there's so many people participating in it and there's so much competition even in that form, right? I mean there's, yeah, there's more voices now and there's a lot of, look, in the past when you had to be selected in order to speak, it was very difficult to get through that selection process. And it's not necessarily the best voices that got through. It's just sometimes the most persistent and the most influential, whatever the reason why they got to be one of those people with the tie in that block on those panel shows, that's not the case anymore. Right. You know, now you've got Kyle Kalinsky, you've got all these, you know, these, these people that are, they don't necessarily fit in, you know, any traditional Jimmy Dore, they don't fit in any traditional role on regular mainstream television, but they have a pretty influential voice.

Speaker 1:          02:10:35       Absolutely. And they're very politically savvy and they're talking about things in a way that they would be, they would be, it would be very hard to get a producer to sign off on the way a lot of these guys communicate and some of the things that they do. It'd be, it would be very, very difficult. But, so you're optimistic too. I'm very optimistic. I'm optimistic in that space. I guess. You know, everything outside of the beltway of Washington, I'm optimistic about, I think America has an incredible capacity to innovate out of its problems. What I fear and what I'm not sure any rational person should be optimistic about, but you know, that doesn't mean you don't fight it. What I fear is Washington and um, and so I've said many times I like the power of corruption in Washington might be so great that it cannot be defeated, but that doesn't affect what we should be doing.

Speaker 1:          02:11:25       We should be fighting it whether or not we think we can win. Winning is not the only reason you fight. You fight because it's the right thing to do. And we need to rally because we might be wrong. It could be to just be that if we got the political force, we could take them down and, and I think that's what we gotta be setting up for it right now. When you see people like Tulsi Gabbard or we see this young woman in New York, Alexandria, a casio is, I was in a called Casio Cortez. That to me that's very promising that people are leaning in this direction and that they're, they're saying, let's just, let's, let's look at this in a different way and let's see some new voices. Let's hear people that are clearly not influenced by corporate America. They're clearly not, they don't have all of their veins hooked up to the Matrix yet.

Speaker 1:          02:12:12       Yeah. Now I telsia I had known before your, your interview with her, your interview with her I think gave people an incredible understanding of the depth of her soul, which is deep coma when she tweeted to the president making us Saudi Arabia's bitch is not putting us America first so she can go. She can both do the deep and also the, the shallow, she can do bus. That's amazing. That is an unprecedented thing too because what trump has done is he's opened up the door for this kind of very hostile communication, but what he's also done is opened up the door for it to come back at him. Yeah. Yeah. Not that he notices, but the, you're right, exactly right. The rest of the world notices. But what I think is interesting about Alexandria is she is very disciplined about saying, look, we got to fix the system if we're going to get any of these things done.

Speaker 1:          02:12:59       So I like to think about like Alexandra versus Bernie. So she like every time she gets up there and talks about, you know, her green energy, new deal, and it's like you got to fix the political system and then we're going to be able to get this stuff. Um, as opposed to like putting a list of 10 things you want to do without anywhere even mentioning the fact that you're going to, you know, make these things possible by picking, fixing political system. I think we need new people, which this new congress is filled with them. There were 107 members of people running for Congress who wrote to Speaker of the House and said they want, as the first thing is addressing of this corrupt political system. And Nancy Polozi gave them, not just that, but all these other reforms to, that's hr one. The younger people coming into Congress realized the system is broken.

Speaker 1:          02:13:45       I fear the older people in Congress who have gotten so used to the system that they don't even notice anymore just how broken it is, how outrageous it is, and they need to rage. So they're going to rage against the billionaires or whatever. But I think we need to focus the rage on the problem. And that problem is congress. If we don't fix congress first, nothing else matters. Nothing else will happen. And we need to build the movement, which I think could actually be a movement that brings people on the right and people on the left in, um, to make that change possible. Well, if that's the philosophy that you have to have darkness in order to inspire light and that there's some sort of a balance to be achieved in this managing of those two energies. And that when you have an administration that's clearly fucked up and then people come along and say, it's time that I get into politics and make a difference because these are the people that are motivated because they see a need for change of whereas you know some people with other administrations.

Speaker 1:          02:14:42       So like I like the way things are going. I'm going to go pursue the private sector, I'm going to go do this, I'm going to do it. If people see something like what's happening with trump and they say, I want to, I want to stop this. This is not the America that I know. There are people entering politics for the best possible reasons and I think people on the right have entered politics for the best possible reason and people in the left to the question is how quickly do they get bent by the system? How quickly do they become part of the system, the dark side of the force. Because like when you like, you know, when you say members of Congress, you know, spend 30 to 80% of their, 70% of the time raising money, you might think that means they're miserable most of the time.

Speaker 1:          02:15:21       But you know, there's a way in which it's actually psychologically rewarding for them. So, um, you know, to be a member of Congress right now as a pretty miserable job, you don't get much done. Like you're spending all your time like rats in a maze. Like the bell goes off, you've got to run to the floor, your aide tells you how you're to vote, you vote, then you leave from the floor. It's nothing like what the framers imagined. Like they were sitting on the floor listening to debate about ideas. All that's bullshit. The only debate is debate to cspan as like a speech to cspan. And, and that's, and that's what it is. So the life of a congressman is pretty miserable. But, um, but when they fundraise, it's kind of like push ups, you know, it's like there sit down and they're told, okay, you've got to raise $20,000 and a the aid sit there and say call Joe, he cares about this and call Fred. And he cares about that. And you go through and when you hit your numbers it's like, Hooray, I did something. So it's like you feel like you're accomplishing something, but the point is the psychology of that increasingly makes you okay with the system that you're in and you realize you win in that system. You've won under that system. And so your openness to the system becomes

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       really sketchy. So I think the critical moment right now is to, is to solidify the recognition. This congress is corrupted and we have to fix it. And um, you know, the only thing I'm worried about with hr one is that it's going to make it into a democratic issue. It's like that Democrats care about it. So the Republicans are supposed to not care about it. The critical thing now is to get Republicans to support the idea of reform. And then make it something other than just a traditional tribal fight between left and right. Are you optimistic? Was ice it was that correct. And that I'm optimistic about everything outside of the beltway, and I'm going to fight like hell to, to, to prove that we can fix stuff inside the beltway. But if you told me I had to bet on my son or daughter's life, I'm not going to tell you that I think we're going to. Yeah, I would never ask you to do. Okay, good. All right. That we're clear. Thank you for doing this. I really appreciate it. I really enjoyed talking to you. Let's do this again. Hopefully you'll be right every time you ask. All right. We'll do it. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

Speaker 2:          02:17:43       Hmm.
