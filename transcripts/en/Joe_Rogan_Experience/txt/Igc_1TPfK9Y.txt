Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Three, two, one. And we're alive. How are you sir? Hey, I'm great. Thanks for being here, man. I really appreciate it. It is the coolest thing I've done really well, you know, remember that far back. That's pretty cool. Um, I watched your ted talk on what was the word that you used? A Leicester Land and uh, it felt hopeless, like if people don't know what I'm talking about because you just give like a brief synopsis of the way you were describing how completely completely rigged our election system is and what it actually takes to be elected and how much of the time they spend is involved in raising money and why. Yeah. So we've got a system where we have a money primary and then we have a regular election and in the money primary to compete, you gotta raise tons of money to be able to fund your campaign.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       And when you raise that money you raise it from a tiny, tiny fraction of the one percent. So unless in the Ted talk about lesser known and I said, you know, imagine a place called Lester land where basically it's the lesters who rule. And by the lesters I mean the same proportion of people named Lester as in the United States right now. So there's about 150,000 Americans named Lester. I'm one of them. But here we are, the Leicester. So imagine a world ruled by Lester land, um, because that's essentially the world we have because of the way we fund our campaigns because there's about 150,000 men who give even just the maximum contribution to one political candidate. And if you ask who the number of people who give the maximum contribution over the course of a campaign, meaning in the primary and the general election, it's about 22,000 Americans in 2014 who gave them maximum contribution to one political campaigns.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       So what that means is it's a tiny, tiny fraction who are the most important funders of political campaigns and candidates for Congress. Members of Congress spend 30 to 70 percent of their time sucking up to this tiny, tiny fraction. And so is it any surprise that you see congress bending over backwards to keep those guys happy? Because they know without those people, they don't have a shot at getting back into congress. And the way you were describing it as when you were saying it as lester land, it was like, imagine if we were this screwed up. That was essentially what you're saying. Yeah. But we're more screwed up lester land. Yeah, we're more. That was a disturbing video because I was realized there was emerging as you were speaking. I was like, wait a minute, is it that bad? Yeah. You know, it's, I actually, since that video have come to think it's even worse.

Speaker 1:          00:02:58       So like clearance land. Well, it could be worse because it's even smaller number. And if you look at the number of Super Pac donors, you know, the really critical super packed hundred about a hundred people who gave more than half of the Super Pac money in the last presidential election. 100, you know, so this is a really tiny, tiny number. Um, but what this tiny number represents and the way we fund campaigns is the extraordinary inequality on that dimension, right? But since, since I was focused on the money, I've more recently started thinking about the other screwed up dimension. So think about gerrymandering. You know, we gerrymander districts in America, so that about 85 percent of the house seats in the United States Congress are safe seats, which means if you're a republican in a safe seat, democratic district, your views just never mattered to the Congressperson, cause that vote of a Republican will never determine who's in Congress or a Democrat and Republican district.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       That's the same. Okay, but that doesn't mean those congress people are not afraid about reelection. Of course, they are afraid about whether there'll be reluctant, but they're afraid not of a Democrat running against a Republican, they afraid of an even more extreme republican running against the incumbent Republican. So what those incumbents in those safe seat districts do is they obsess about what the extremists in their own party cares about. So the extremists on the left and the right have this ability to leverage extraordinary influence inside of the House of Representatives simply because we've decided to gerrymander these districts to create these safe seats. So those extremists are a kind of lester's too. There are more of them, a more democratic than lester land, but they too have enormous influence over ordinary people in most ordinary people's views. Then to these congress people just don't matter. That feels hopeless for a dummy like me sit on the outside looking at this, I'm like, God, if this is this deeply entrenched with.

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       I mean I guess it's not technically corruption because it's all legal, but it's an entanglement with money and with influence that. I mean, how do you unwind this? Yeah. So that point is really critical. It's not technically illegal and what that means is that people are engaged in this or not doing wrong things. They're just playing by the rules, their plan with the system. It's just that the system has become corrupted. When did it start? Well, I think that the moment the United States Congress begins to fall apart in a really dramatic and interesting way is when Newt Gingrich becomes speaker of the house. So when the Republicans take control of Congress in [inaudible] 95, so the first time

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       the Republicans have taken control of the House of Representatives in 40 years. So the house becomes incredibly competitive. Each election, you know, is up for grabs. Who's going to control the house? So Gingrich turns his members in the House into perpetual fundraisers. It's basically we got raise the money to defend ourselves next time around. And then the Democrats followed suit. So the Democrats turned their members into perpetual fundraisers and they changed the rules about like, who gets to be chairman of committees? It's no longer like who's the person with the most experience, with the most insight increasingly becomes who raises the most money and the Democratic Party. I know about the Democratic Party. The Republicans don't talk to me much, but the Democratic Party increasingly changes its focus from what are the policies that our members care about too. What are we going to do to make sure that you as a member meet your fundraising target?

Speaker 2:          00:06:49       And so from 95 until today, the institution becomes an institution focused on the game of getting reelected. I'm Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee who went to Congress first in 1983. So He's been there for a long time. Um, Cooper says Capitol Hill has become a kind of farm league forK street. Okay. So what he means by that is members go there, they learn how to raise money, they become focused obsessively on raising money. But one of the things that they're really focused on, it's how do they go from Capitol Hill to becoming a lobbyist because that's where the real money is. A member of Congress gets paid about as much as the students. I educate at the Harvard law school in their first year as Lawyers Co. So to ordinary americans, there's a lot of money, but two people on capitol hill, it doesn't seem like a lot of money, but then they go and become a lobbyist.

Speaker 2:          00:07:38       They can make 10 timeS that as a lobbyist. And so what cooper says is you have this institution which has become so focused on the money that it's just a institution for producing influence that can be sold. And first the congressmen are basically sucking up to the people who wAnt to buy influence and then the congressman become the people buying influence themselves because they're working as lobbyists for these important interests. So they're in the rigged game. They understand how it gets rigged and they work to rig it. Yeah. Yeah. They see, they see this as their, their business plan. It's their honeypot. Yeah. And there is, um, whatever the district is outside of Washington dc and Virginia, where there's some ungodly number of wealthy people per capita where there's more, there's more lobbyists in that area than anywhere else in the United States. And that's this giant collection of wealth, right?

Speaker 2:          00:08:34       Washington dc is an incredibly prosperous place. And anybody who's been there, um, you know, for a long who've seen it for a long time, like I, I clerked there in the early 19 nineties and it was pretty grungy place, but it's a really opulent city now. It's like the golden city on the hill, you know the ahs and the reason for that is the amount of money that's been poured into that district for the purpose of buying influence to buy legislation that makes it so these inCumbent dinosaur corporations that have protected themselves against competition across tHe country can, can, can continue to profit. It's a weird place though because even though it's incredibly wealthy, it's also incredibly poor. There's a vast different extra. The spectrum is really wide because, I mean that was when in the nineties was that. That's the marion barry time, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:26       so that was when, I mean he won as mayor again when he came back after being arrested for smoking crack and people are like, whatever little crack. Yeah. It was an ugly place. That and it's becoming, you know, grotesque place now from the, from the standpoint of the principles of what america's supposed to be. yeah. Because the privilege. There are not people who are privileged because they've elon musk like and rented a great new product or they've worked incredibly hard and competitive marketplace and succeeded. They're privileged because they've leveraged influence in a corrupt system to to profit and the people who are failing their, you know, a lot of reasons they're failing is just we don't have a competitive, powerful economy that gives them the opportunities right now because that, that district, Washington dc, because it's got no effective representation is one of the worst represented districts in the country.

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       So essentially this all started out with new green gingrich's group and they decided to spend so much time concentrating on fundraising and then once that became successful, everyone else followed suit. Yeah. Yeah. So the game became no longer how do we legislate for America, but how do we rally our troops to raise the money we need to win in the next election? The game is just about the election. I mean, you know, my, my mother lives in hilton head, which is of course a very republican district, but they elected their first democrat, Joe Cunningham and joe. My moTher loved him and wanted to support him. My mother is a republican, but here he was. She wanted to support a democrat. So I sent a check for on her behalf to this democrat, the day he was elected, he started raising money for the next election, his whole focus from that moment on and now we started a big membership organization or are they going to get members to sort of help him sort of get back to congress the next time around.

Speaker 2:          00:11:18       Their sole focus is the elections. And this is really different in the 19 eighties, you know, they would go to Washington for 18 months, they would do the work of governing and then for six months they do the work of politicking. Um, so, you know, to a year and a half they could figure out how to solve the problems of America. And then for half a year they figured out how to get reelected. That's no longer the game. The game now is from day one. How do we raise the funds? We need to make sure we can get reelected. Um, and with the democrats extraordinary turnaround in this last election, you be damn sure. That's

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       exactly the obsessive focus that we'll be going into 20 slash 20. And if there's no other viable alternative, this is a game that they have to play, good people have to play at this point. It's not like you can have the good people who say, I'm not going to play this game. I mean there are some famous people who Can say, I'm not going to play this game. Know alexandria, occasional cortez. I mean she doesn't have to raise money, I'm sure, and people on the right to you know, who are the famous people in, right? They don't have to worry about this, but the ordinary congress person knows, given the way the system is right now, they've got an obsessive focus on how to raise money in what they know that that means is they develop a sixth sense, a constant awareness about how what they do will affect their ability to raise money, becoming the words of the x files, shape shifters, as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money.

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       There was a congressman leslie burned democrat from Virginia who describes that when she went to congress, she was told by a colleague, quote always leaned to the green than to clarify. She went on, you know, he was not an environmentalist. So the point is like, you know, in your heart of hearts which way you got to go to make sure, and if you're good and you're smart, you'd never say anything to indicate it, but it's operating, but sometimes you're not so smart. So in the tax bill, the leading up to the passage of the last tax cut, the one point $6,000,000,000,000 gift to corporations and wealthy people, primarily a congressman, New York stood on the floor of the house and said, you know, my donors have told me that if we don't deliver on this, I should never call him again. I should never call them again.

Speaker 1:          00:13:34       So it's basically as simple and clear as possible. You don't reduce our taxes. Don't ever ask us for more money. And that's the reality of what Washington has become. Now once this gets started and it moves in this direction that we don't have a long history of this to understand the, the waves and the ins and the outs of the tide, it just, this is just what it is and it keeps moving in the same general direction. How would that, that ever stop? How would there ever be some sort of reform that puts this back into a position where it makes sense and it's tenable? Yeah. So you know, I've been in this business for about 12 years now in the business of like trying to figure out what can we do to reform this corrupted system and you know, part of me feels as you said, like it's hopeless, but part of me feels like it's the most hopeful moments we've seen because like a decade ago when I would go around and say, you know, we got this really corrupted system and like money is people saying no, when you talk about we just have to focus on getting the people we want elected.

Speaker 1:          00:14:38       And if we get the people we want to like it, we'll get the policies. We're past now, almost everybody realizes that until we fix this broken congress, nothing else can happen. So it's not like this is the most important

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       issue out there. You know, you could think climate change or healthcare or jobs or comp competitive mode, you could think those are the important issues. But what people are increasingly seeing is that this is the first issue. If we don't fix this, we don't fix anything. And what's really encouraging to me is that that frame is increasingly being embraced by important leaders. So, you know, about six years ago, I think nancy pelosi was on jon stewart's show, the daily show, and stuart said, you know, the whole system is corrupt. And nancy pelosi's no, no, no, the system's not corrupt. People in the system are corrupt, but the system is not corrupt. And jon stewart just had a field day because of how ridiculous that statement is now. But now nancy polosi is gonna introduce this hr one, the most ambitious and comprehensive reform package that Washington I think has ever seen.

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       I mean, it is unbelievable in its breadth. Um, so it has public funding of congressional campaigns. So that congressmen don't spend 30 to 70 percent of their time sucking up to the lesters. It has a mandate to end gerrymandering, political partisan gerrymandering, exercising congress's power under the constitution to tell the states, clean this mess up. It has an incredible, um, ethics package to kind of close, block the revolving door. So congressmen are not running off the k street and it has an incredible restoration of voting rights. The rest voter, a restoration of voting rights act, automatic voter registration. It's the most comprehensive package of political reform, I think the civil rights bill of the generation. But of course nobody outside of Washington has heard anything about it because most people look at what Washington does and says it's just a game the democrats are playing to embarrass the republicans.

Speaker 2:          00:16:45       How will they stop congressmen from becoming lobbyists? Well, one thing, they do a and then build loopholes into it, but one thing they can do is they can basically say, um, once your congressman, you can't be a lobbyist for five years and five years or whatever the time is. But the more fundamental factors, you know, if you change the way you fund campaigns, if it was no longer the lobbyists who are kind of channeling the money in or that we're getting their clients to channel the money and then it's not like there wouldn't be lobbyists anymore, they just wouldn't be so well paid. They wouldn't be as valuable. And if they're not as valuable, it's not as valuable for them to pay the congressmen and incredible amount of money to become a lobbyist. You know, they would become almost like lawyers policy wonks that kind of go to capitol hill and say, here's what will happen if you adopt this legislation, you know, that's an important part of the process.

Speaker 2:          00:17:37       but they wouldn't be the mockers in the system. They wouldn't be the people who called the shots. And so the value of their services would fall. And if the value of their services fell, then it wouldn't so much sense to go and become a lobbyist. Maybe you'd come home and be a doctor again or come home and like be a businessperson again or do whatever you want back in your district. So I think if you change the way you fund campaigns, you would change 70 percent of the problem, you would just fix it right then. And these other things are good additions, but not as critical. But without changing the way you fund campaigns. I think all of these other changes are relevant. I just can't get over the money. You always hear the phrase take money out of politics. It's a constant phrase, but that's not really possible now.

Speaker 2:          00:18:21       And I don't think it's really good point isn't the point isn't to get money out. The point is to get money that doesn't represent a tiny fraction of the special interests controlling how congress people think. So I think today a congressman from California rogue kahana is going to introduce a bill that he hopes will be eventually part of whatever this big reform packages that would create a way of funding campaigns where everybody gets a voucher or a set of vouchers. you know, seattle has done this for city elections where everybody gets for $25 vouchers that are only usable to fund campaigns. So a candidate comes around and tries to persuade you to give him or her the voucher and then they take that voucher and they use it to fund campaigns. Okay. If roca han is bill passed and everybody had vouchers to use to fund congressional campaigns and you know, the idea is basically you take the rebate of the first $50 of your taxes, which every american pays at least $50 to the federal government.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       You take that first $50, you give it back and you give it in the form of a voucher and you say, take this voucher and help fund campaigns with it. Congressmen would still be raising money. They'd still be spending a lot of time raising money, but they wouldn't be raising money from the tiny fraction of the one percent. They'd be raising money from everybody. And so the point is that you would be using that money to spread the influence in the way that democracy is supposed to spread the influence to every american as opposed to the influence in a tiny, tiny fraction of the one percent. So that wouldn't get less money. I think that could be more money in the system, but it wouldn't be corrupting money because it would be money that is democratically accountable, but the lesters of the world would probably try to put the kibosh on that before it ever got movement.

Speaker 2:          00:20:08       Yeah. I mean, you know, the biggest block to anything like hr, one happening is that the most influential people in Washington have the most to lose, right? The lobbyists, you know, the value of the industry of lobbying just collapses and those people are going to fight like hell to block it. Which is why as wonderful as it is to me to see somebody like nancy polosi take up the charge and say, here it is. Here's a package of reform and it's going to be the first thing we do. Fix democracy first. What? What's true? What's obvious about this is without a president taking up the charge, it's never gonna happen, and what's most depressing to

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       is that right now in the democratic party, you don't have any candidate for president who's making reform a even an important issue, let alone a primary issue. And of courSe we had a president who is elected under the drain, the swamp slogan, but of course nobody believes he has an implant or have any intent to do anything to drain that swamp. Yeah. I'm hoping that having him in office is such a that the whole thing was such a cluster fuck and that so many people are so disturbed that it's going to make people more politically active and more aware of the consequences of having someone like that in office. Yeah. And actually weirdly unifying because even though the democrats are not doing this right now, which is really depressing to me, you know, we, we have these things that we know we disagree about and we like fueled the politics of hate as we kind of yell at each other about these things.

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       BuT there's a set of issues that we all agree about and the, and the most important set of issues we all agree about is the deeply corrupted nature of this government. And there was a poll done by university of Maryland, the middle of 2016, asking about anger and frustration with government found the highest level of frustration in the history of polling. And then when they asked the reasons why they were so angry and so disaffected with their government, the reasons people gave were all the same things like the influence of money, the influence of lobbyists, the parties care more about corporations and about. And then then we broke them down about how to republicans think about this and how the democrats think about this. There was no statistical difference between republicans and democrats. you know, sometimes the democrats were more concerned. Sometimes the republicans and the levels, we're at like 80 and 90 percent.

Speaker 1:          00:22:31       So literally 84 percent of americans would say it is big money that is corrupting the way our congress functions. Right? So here is common ground. And what was so extraordinarY about the 2016 election is watched a republican candidates stand on a debate stage. In september of twentY 15, Donald Trump stood on a debate stage and pointed to every one of those kennedy's and said, I own all of you. I've given all of you money and I know The way the system works and the system is corrupt and he called super pacs and abomination and he attacked the idea of money in politics and so what that signaled is that republicans to could be rallied to this cause of addressing this deeply corrupted political system. If only we could find the candidates who would do it, and I think what Donald Trump has done is teed up this moment where we can step back and say, look, we disagree about a lot of things, whether it's gmo or climate change, whether it's healthcare for all or college for all, whatever. We disagree about a loving. We got to work a lot of things out. But here is something we all agree about and we should be smart enough to realize if we don't fix this, the none of the things we're arguing about matter. You know, you can't. It's not serious to stand on a debate stage and say you you support single payer healthcare

Speaker 2:          00:23:47       without also saying, but first we're going to fix this corrupted system because there's no way to get single payer healthcare in a world where doctors and pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies are funding elections. You can't say you're goIng to get climate change legislation in America without addressing the corrupting influence of money in politics because the oil camp that the dirty energy industry has an enormous opportunity to block this, changed through the way we fund campaign. So this is a moment where we should be able to get everybody in this political system to step back and say, hey, wait. The system is broken. We can see as broken. The first thing we have to do is to fix the broken congress, and if we fix that congress, then we have a chance to have an argument about what policy makes sense for America. And we each have our views, but no views are different.

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       But the thing we don't agree about, we should be able to agree on. Now, if that's a universal agreement amongst republicans and democrats, that funding and that money and that all, all of this is what's ruining politics. The people that are donating all this moneY, the, these, the lesters of the world, what could they possibly do to stop this reform and what's their reaction to this kind of reform? Yeah. YeAh. So let me be clear about one really important thing. I, when I say republicans and democrats, what I mean as people in the districts across America, I don't mean in Washington like mitch mcconnell is, I think the focus of evil in the modern world. Mitch mcconnell will block any reform here at all. So, you know, nancy polozi can offer what she wants, but it'll never get through the senate because mitch mcconnell and so there are many republicans in Washington.

Speaker 2:          00:25:28       We're going to block any reform. But, um, but when you ask, you know, the republicans in Washington and the lesters, what can they do to stop it? Well, the game, the game strategy's clear, they've deployed it before, right? So, um, you know, they'll, they'll say things like, this is welfare for politicians. Um, this is just corrupting free speech. You don't believe in the first amendment if you don't believe that the koch brothers or the soros is, have the right to spend unlimited amounts of money and political speech. Um, and so I think the Way around that fight is to agree free speech is the fundamental value and nothing of the reforms I support would like try to restrict people's ability to speak. What we're talking about is congressman raising money. We're not talking about inDividuals speaking in the marketplaCe. So you have a very loud voice.

Speaker 2:          00:26:24       Joe, your voice is heard by millions and nothing in our constitution should permit the goVernment to be able to suppress you at all, so long as you're within the bounds of decency or at least not decency because that's not a bound boundary. This thought guests obeys often, but at least if you're not, you know, spreading false rumors and causing great harm. But the point is, even though this free speech needs to be protected, we still should be able to focus on the influence, the economy of influence congressmen live under when they spend 30 to 70 percent of the time sucking up to the lesters to fund their campaigns. That should be a focus of regulation without the first amendment getting in the way because we want to. Congress filled with people who care about what their voters want now with their funders want the framers didn't create a constitution to replicate an aristocracy.

Speaker 2:          00:27:20       They were fighting and aristocracy. They had a system where there was a house, the house of lords that had to ask the aristocracy, what do you want? And everything could be blocked if the aristocracy didn't like it. Well, we've replicated that system more efficiently in America than they had there. Because we have a system where both the house of representatives and the senate is filled with people who are obsessed with a single question what to my funders want? And if they can't answer that question in a way that supports the legislation and they're not going to support the legislation, or if it's important for them to block legislation, they will block legislation. And that's the dynamic of Washington right now. Francis fukuyama describes our government as a veto ocracy veto ocracy. And what he means by that is that there's so many places were influenced.

Speaker 2:          00:28:11       Powerful influence can block the ability of the government to do something that it just can't do anything anymore. And that's, I think, the consequence of allowing this corruption of money to be so deeply woven into our political system. Is it possible to fix? Yeah, it is possible to fix because you know, for, for example, hr one plus roca, honda's bill all perfectly constitutional. You wouldn't have to amend the constitution to do it. I think that bill alone would solve 80 percent of the problem. The possibility. The problem isn't like conceiving of what changes have to happen. The question is how do you build the political movement to get there? And what that takes is leaders willing to say, we have to fix this corrupted democracy first. And leaders who stopped, like pretending that we can get like a christmas list of great changes in government without fixing this democracy first.

Speaker 2:          00:29:08       So, you know, bernie published last month in the Washington post list of the 10 things that should happen in the first hundred days in the next democratic administration. 10 great ideas. Not a single one of those ideas address the corruption of our political system. You, it was just, it was just a christmas list of all the things that the progressives want. Did you know, I'm a progressive. I want some of those things. But the point is like what things were the, well, you know, things like a trillion dollar infrastructure project, single pair healthcare free college, um, you know, all things that bernie is pushing, it has made so salad and things that I think it's great that he has made sale yet. I mean, he's a hero and like making these issues central to at least the debate. But what frustrates me is that instead of focusing our anger on the billionaires, which he does, we need to focus more anger on the congressman, the politicians, which he does not. I mean, the guy's been in congress romas 30 years now, and so it might be natural for him not to notice that the people around him are the problem.

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       Is it a natural thing or do you think that he's possibly aware of the consequences of stirring up that hornets nest? Because you know, if anybody has a right to complain, when the dnc conspired to rig the primaries against him, he's the number one guy. He should be screaming from the rooftops. YoU're dealing with a corrupt system and thiS is disgusting. and he didn't. He didn't do that, and he didn't do that while hillary clinton was running for president and he knew it. He knew he hAd been screwed out of the primaries. He knew they had conspired, he knew it was all illegal, and he kind of just kept his mouth shut.

Speaker 2:          00:30:45       Yeah, well, I think, you know, that was a responsibility. I think that was a kind of. I was a person reflecting on the horrendous outcome if he took hillary clinton down, and so I think he restrained himself, you know, not perfectly. I mean, the fact is, after it was clear he was not going to be the nominee, he still continued to talk about the corruption around hillary, which donald then picked up and turned into a weapon against her. But I think he, he recognized, you know, as every responsible politician does that, you know, it's not just about him, it's about the future of America. So when he restrained himself and didn't want to take the whole system down, then I get that. But what I'm talking about now, I'm talking about when you've got the house of representatives talking about fundamental reform, it will be the first thing they take up.

Speaker 2:          00:31:33       We at least ought to have a presidential campaign where candidates are saying, hell yes. The first thing we will do is to end the corruption that makes it impossible for this congress to function and stop pretending like we can get all these wonderful things given to us by santa claus without fixing this first. You gotta do the hard work of convincing America that there is a solution because you know, the reality is, I think most of America is where you started this podcast. Most of America thinks it's deeply corrupted and there's nothing that can be done. They're half right. It is deeply corrupted, but it's not true. There's nothing that can be done. We can do something. And in fact, I think we can solve almost 80 percent of it. I still think there's constitutional changes that might be necessary. And I've been working like how do we get constitutional changes and talking to people. My, my podcast, which of course has about one 1000th of one, 1000000th of the people listening to yours does. But what is your podcast? So people can listen to it. It's another Way. so season two is released today, which is about an article five convention, but season one was about how to think about the 2020. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       but you know, I, I think that we might have to have constitutional change anD I have been supporting the efforts to think about that. But while we've got to do is to give people a sense that there's something we Can do before we amend the constitution. You know, we did a poll and found 96 percent of americans believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics. Ninety one percent didn't think it was possible. So that's the politics of resignation. If you'd gone to Egypt under mubarak and he'd start the average person in the street and said, you know, what do you think? I'm a bark. They would've said, you know, we hate mubarak, and then say, well why aren't you doing anything about it? And they say, because nothing can be done. Or you know, african americans in 1900 and America, what do you think about jim crow?

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       We hate jim crow. Why aren't you doing anything about it? What? Because there's nothing to be done about it. Well, that's how americans think about this political corruption. They hate it. They think it's deeply unjust, inconsistent with what they thought America was about. But they don't do anything about it because they don't think there's anything to be done about it. And that's where leaders have a role and what we need our leaders running for president right now to begin to explain to people, here's what we could do if only we built the power to do it, recognizing the most important opposition here. The lobbyist in wAshington are going to be an incredibly difficult group to to defeat, but we can do that. And if we do that, every other issue becomes easier to resolve in a sensible way. Now there's no public support for lobbyists, right?

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       There's no, there's no people out there that are super psyched that lobbyists are out there and exerting their influence on our world. But they obviously have enormous financial backing behind them and they have incredible influence in our, in our culture. But if you had some magic wand, you could wave across this system and fix it, wouldn't removing lobbyists be one of the first things that you would do? No. No. Why? Why so? Well, because look, you know, congress, especially in the current government, legislates on a whole bunch of issues that they don't have a clue about. They don't know squat diddly about 99 percent of what they're legislating amount. They need information and one of the other things gingrich did was to completely macerate congress's own information service. They used to have a really powerful information service to help congressmen figure things out. All of that's basically gone, so they rely on outsiders to come in and help them understand it. Now my view is, you know, that's an imperfect system because there's great inequality among the quality of lobbyists, but if all lobbyists were doing was providing information like congressmen, here's what's going to happen. If you pass this bill, like these jobs will disappear or this lead will reappear in the water system if that's all they were doing. That's really valuable thing.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       Information to the congress to help congress decide what to do is an essential part of making democracy work. The part of lobbying that is the corrupting part where they become the mockers for the money, not so much that they give it directly, but you know, they call their clients and they say, you need everybody at the c level in your corporation. Descend $2,700 to this person and they steer it like that when they become the kInd of source of a resource for members of congress, that's when they have thIs influence, which is not related to their argument. So you know, I've met lobbyists who, who hate the system as it is right now. They'll say things like, look, I want a system where I win because my ideas are good, my arguments are better. I don't want a system where I win because I'm able to channel more money than that guy because that's not a democracy like at democracy should be. These representatives are listening to us and then they do the right thing based on what they think helps their constituents, not how much they're going to raise if they do this. Over that.

Speaker 2:          00:36:41       How many lobbyists are there? Oh man, I can't answer that question. You know, one of the big problems we've got is that the law has been weakened in registering lobbyists. So, you know, we have tens of thousands of people who are functioning effectively of the lobbyists but don't have to call themselves lobbyists. You have these members of congress who go to government relations departments and they oversee the government relations department as long as they don't go on to capitol hill and shake hands, but instead set up the meetings on capitol hill with lower people, shaking hands. They're not called lobbyists. So if you look at the lobbying numbers, it looks like we peaked in lobbying about three years ago and now are declining, but what that is in fact is that the rules have been interpreted or allowed to be unenforced so that many people who are lobbyists actually aren't actually functioning as lobbyists today.

Speaker 2:          00:37:30       So they are lobbyists, but they don't wear the label is lobbyists. What do they call themselves? Government relations people. Experts. Yeah. Um, you know, and they aren't. They say they're not technically lobbyists. And um, you know, I got into a huge fight with Scott Brown. You remember Scott Brown who ran a for who was a senator in Massachusetts. He ran under tea party ticket and it was like this amazing republican to win as a senator in Massachusetts. And then Elizabeth Warren, I'm defeated him in the, in the, in the election, two years into his term, he then went to Massachusetts to New Hampshire and ran for senate and I was helping a republican in New Hampshire who was a reformer running for senate, and we've referred to him as a lobbyist and he went ballistic. He saId, I'm not a lobbyist, and then he said, I'm not technically a lobbyist.

Speaker 2:          00:38:24       He's a government relations person who's like calling people on capitol hill. He used to be with the senate trying to get them to do things for him, but he hasn't quite a technical labia, so merely because the irs wouldn't refer to them as a lobbyist, he thought it was outrageous and fraud for me to refer to them as what we all know he is, which is a lobbyist. So lobbyists, being a lobbyist is not defined by your actions. It's defined by your label. It's defined by did you have to fill something out to be alumni as well? Once you are a lobbyist, according to the law, you've got all sorts of obligations of reporting who you're spending your time with. What you're spending money on, government relations, government relations, people at a certain level that do certain things aren't caught lobbyists, but yet they have the exact same function even more because they've got tons of people working for them.

Speaker 2:          00:39:13       They can deploy in their, in their work of doing lobbying. How would that ever be? How would you ever put a dam up there? Well, you know, you only put a dam up there if you've got the political will to make it happen, right? You only get the political will to make it happen. If you have a political process that focuses America on this deeply corrupting problem and says, god damn it, we have to fix this, and if you had that will, if you said we're just going to fix this, and you had like the, you know, the geeks then go down the list of 25 things that have to happen to make it so we have our congress is worried about being representative of America as opposed to representative of the lesters in America. We could do it. it's not rocket science. It really is not that hard.

Speaker 2:          00:40:01       You got to think carefully about what kind of incentives you're producing. I'm not saying it's obvious. We're not going to sketch the full plan here, but it's possible it is constitutional to do it and if we just built the political will to to get there, we could do it and the only way build the political will. It's really important right now because right now people, especially people like you need to be saying to every one of the politicians who is going to be sucking up to try to be on your show to try to have a chance to get their voice out the class a few to the people who are listening to your podcast. It's important to people like you to say, okay, what are you going to do about this problem, this problem in particular? Is it a priority or is it like one of 12 things on your list?

Speaker 2:          00:40:40       I mean, I imagine it's 11 for bernie or 12 somewhere, but the question isn't, isn't on the list because every one of them is going to say, yeah, of course I support reform. The question is, are you going to bring America around so that America thinks on day one, this is what will happen. Whatever else happens, this is going to happen, and my view is if there were a democrat running for president who said, look, hold on, we're going to fix this, and the trumpers who were draining the swamp, you know the 25 percent of that base that's drained the swamp is come with me because that guy did not drain the swamp. That guy filled the swamp. Swamp monsters are bigger and more and more vital now than now than they ever were, but come with me. We actually will do it. I think there's a way to break this election so that it becomes an election about the unity around this recognition rather than the disunity, which is the screaming laughed against the screaming, right, which is the way things.

Speaker 3:          00:41:39       Now we're evolving to a person on sit down on the outside who doesn't have any involvement in politics like myself. It seemed so unbelievably complicated that it is. It exhausts you when you start examining it and trying to pay attention to it and how the system will works. Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the recent past, there was something that was changed that allows corporations to donate money the same way that an individual would.

Speaker 2:          00:42:03       Right? So in 2010, the United States supreme court decided a case called citizens united and citizens united said that you couldn't limit limit a corporation's ability to spend money independently of a political campaign, so corporations not allowed to contribute directly, but that's not worth that much because you're only allowed to give a total of $5,400 to a candidate over the course of the life of his campaign. But what citizens united said is that the constitution protects the right of the corporation to engage in political speech independent of a political campaign. So if you know, if some congressmen is running for congress, exxon corporation can come in and spend a million dollars to say why that congressman is a good congressman or why that congressmen the terrible congressman, but they have a constitutional right to do that. Now, when that happened, there are a bunch of us who were chicken littles about this, who said this is the end of democracy because these corporations are just going to spend unbelievable amounts of money in the political process like spending their money to effect the results, and that was not correct because what happened is corporations quickly discovered the high price of free speech, right?

Speaker 2:          00:43:16       So corporations like target back day, uh, anti gay candidate for governor and all of a sudden found their stores being picketed across the country because people were furious that they would be supporting such a candidate for governor. So corporates to quickly found that it's not cheap to engage in political speech in the marketplace. They didn't want to do it like that. Instead, they wanted to find a way to channel their money into dark money organizations or into what evolved after citizens united, something called super pacs. Super pacs were created not by the supreme court. Superpacs were created by a lower court that said, well, if you can spend unlimited amounts of money, you should be allowed to give unlimited amounts of money to an independent political action committee. That was the super pac supreme court has never ruled on that question. We have a case that we're taking up to Alaska that's trying to appeal to the supreme court to get them to actually decide whether super pacs are mandated by the constitution, and what's different about this case as the argument we're making is to the conservatives.

Speaker 2:          00:44:25       What we're saying is the framers of our constitution, we're obsessed with corruption. That was the issue they were overwhelmingly trying to avoid and they weren't focused on bribery. They were focused on institutional corruption. These institutions. It became unconnected to their purpose representing americans and what our view is is you know these conservatives on the supreme court, like neil gorsuch or justice thomas or brett kavanaugh, who say that we interpret the constitution of the way the framers would have interpreted it. We're going to make the argument to them, which is there is no doubt the framers of the constitution would have looked at these super pacs and said, these are an abomination. These are outrageous from the perspective of that democracy they were trying to create and those justices should at least one of them be willing to stand up and defend the framers values against this modern corruption and if just one of them voted with the four liberals who've already said they think super pacs are an abomination, then we could have a way to end the superpacs in this system and that and that would be an enormous benefit because they've become so powerful, but the courts alone can't save us.

Speaker 2:          00:45:39       Even If you ended superpacs tomorrow, you still have lester land because the super pacs are not what I was talking about and less julian when I was talking about less. Julian was giving two candidates directly and the small number of people would still be giving two candidates directly and the only way to solve that is for congress to pass new laws. That changed the way campaigns get funded. That's the sort of thing hr one is trying to do as a sort of thing roca honda's trying to do with. That's the sort of thing that we don't have a precedent to support right now. We don't have democratic presidential candidates who are making it the champion issue right now and it won't get done unless they do,

Speaker 3:          00:46:16       but it seems complicated to people when you try to explain campaign finance and you try to explain contributions to candidates and contributions to sitting senators and congressmen. It's. It's complicated and there's so many different things to think about when you're discussing this that to a person who's on the outside, well, how do you fix this? Well, what are the laws now? Well, how did they get that way? Well, well, well how about make it so they can't give them money and there's all these like real simplistic views of it from the outside, but it seems that it at the very least limiting the amount of money that someone's a lot. Like what is the maximum amount of money someone can give to a county

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       right now in the primary and the general. It's $5,400, $2,700 in each and that goes up according to inflation and that's pretty small potatoes compared to what the super pacs are doing, reflection, so you have these people running who expect they're going to raise the money to run their office from their direct contributions, but they're counting on the super pacs to come in and spends ungodly amounts of money like tens of millions of dollars to support their candidate or to oppose their up their opponent, and so the supporters for those super aren't even tiny. There's are the adolfs in America. People named adolf this tiny, tiny, tiny number of people who are contributing to those to those things, but you're right, people. Look, there is no reason why most americans should understand the complexities of campaign finance law and they don't need to. What they need to ask is, do we have a system of integrity in the way we select representatives and if you're, if you're not brain dead in America, you believe the answer to that question is no.

Speaker 2:          00:47:58       We do not have a system of integrity. There's no representational integrity. It is corrupted in all the obvious raise and like nobody should be forced to study campaign finance in order to have an entitlement to say, hell, hell no. This system has got to end. And so I think you're right. If we, you know, people are forced to like articulate all the 34 different changes that have to happen. We're never going to get there, but let's not go there. Let's just start and end with it is a corrupted system and we want politicians to fix it and if they don't fix it, we'll throw them out until we get the politicians who do. And if we could build That as the movement, the recognition, the core message of 20 slash 20, I think there's a real shot because we've primed the republican party. There are a lot of people in that party who are now so disgusted with the corruption of the system.

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       Not necessarily mitch mcconnell, he loves it, but you know, an ordinary republican voters and the democrats have now committed themselves to fixing this corrupted system. This is the moment to do that and we don't have to get into the details of how much you should be allowed to contribute to say there is a way to fix this that would give us a representative democracy, maybe not again, but for the first time wise, mitch mcconnell, so uniquely evil. This guy has had it in his dna from the first moment he went to Washington to end any regulation of money in politics. He engineered the selection of the fec, the federal election commission commissioners so that they would block basically every enforcement action with the ftc. The fcc does nothing now because it's a commission that has half republicans and half democrats. So if the republicans disagree from the democrats, then nothing gets done.

Speaker 2:          00:49:47       They can't enforce the most simple rules anymore because mitch mcconnell is populated the fec with people who don't believe in campaign finance rules. He said, citizens united this decision that said corporations could give unlimited amounts of money to independent political speaking says one of the greatest decisions of the supreme court. And he said he was gonna fight like hell to defend it. And when this proposed hr one was raised to him, mitch mcconnell said, there's not a chance in hell this will ever even get a debate in the senate. This man is obsessed with the idea that money should have the power in Washington that it has right now. And people are talking about reforming it are the enemy. And so you. The thing about mitch mcconnell is he's actually an incredibly smart man and he's an incredibly smart strategist and he's been playing this game for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:50:36       Um, and um, and I think he's like responsible for 85 percent of the judicial structure that makes it possible for this to be blocked. There's an amazing series to debates happened 20 years ago between john mccain and mitch mcconnell. So this was when congress was passing something called the mccain feingold law, which was the last great effort to deal with this problem. And it was flawed and a bunch of ways, but it was an important success. Mitch mcconnell, I'm stood on the floor of the senate and said, mr mccain says that, uh, the senate, we can't say mr again. So the senator from Arizona has said that the system is corrupt. I want him to name the corrupt people, and mccain stands up and says, I'm not talking about particular individuals. I'm talking about the system. It's the system's corrupt. And then mcconnell, almost clueless. I said, if the system's corrupt, there must be corrupt people.

Speaker 2:          00:51:25       If there's not corrupt people, then the system's not corrupt. So the only corruption he could imagine was corruption where somebody was taking a bribe, and if that's the only corruption we're allowed to remedy, then the whole system of influence we have right now is not to be touched. But you know, I think mccain's point was you can have a system filled with lots of honor's congress people and lots of honest senators who never engage in bribery, but they know how to bob and weave and bend and speak and say the right things to attract the right kind of money. And that's as much corruption as bribery is. And mccain's view was we had to end it. So he was the last great republican fighter for reform of this corrupted system. There'd been many, before barry goldwater was an incredibly vocal opponent to the role of money in politics, but I think what we have to do is to find a way to revive that and to leverage from this president's assertion that this is a corrupt system and we have to change the system into actually building the political power to make that change happen.

Speaker 3:          00:52:34       Another thing that's very weird is it every four years or so, there's this cry to eliminate the electoral college. Every four years ago, people realized that the battleground states are so critical and that so much money is being spent on the small handful of states because they give you all the electoral votes and this is how you win an election, and then people say, well, why is that? That doesn't make any sense. It should be one person, one vote. Are we really that divided as a nation that we need to isolate ourselves into these small little lines in the dirt where this part is worth this amount and that parts worth that amount. And so everybody plays this weird electoral college game and then you get a situation like what just happened where hillary clinton wins the popular vote, but it's not the president because the electoral college is what makes everything.

Speaker 2:          00:53:21       Yeah. So the way you just described this problem is exactly. The people have to think about it. The problem isn't. I mean, it is a bad thing that the loser wins. I mean, That's just not the way elections supposed to work. So that's happened twice in our lifetime. Um, and uh, it happened 100 years before that. And it's going to happen more frequently going forward. We can show that demographically, but that's not the real problem. The real problem is that in every election, the presidential candidates are focused on just 14 states. The battleground states, the purple states and those 14 states are the only states that matter to those candidates. And what scholars have demonstrated as the presidents and campaigns bend to themselves and their policies to make those states happy. And those states don't represent America. They're older, they're wider. They're industry is kind of 19th century industry.

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       There are seven and a half times the number of people in America working in solar energy as mine coal, but you never hear about solar energy In a presidential campaign because those people live in California and Texas. They don't matter to the presidential election, which you hear about his coal mining because the 50,000 coal miners left in America happened to live in these battleground states. So this is just a product of the way the electoral college or the way states count their votes to allocate their electors. Something called the winner take all system. So all but two states say that the winner of the popular vote gets all of the electoral votes for that state. So you know, in 2000 in Florida, George Bush won that state based on a stop to recount by 531 votes. He goT all the electoral college votes in that state even though he just barely won that state.

Speaker 2:          00:55:08       And so winner take all is what makes it so that it doesn't make sense for anybody to pay. Pay any attention to any of the non battleground states and penn, all of your tiMe in the battleground states in 2016, 99 percent of campaign spending was in 14 states, 90, 99 percent, 95 percent of time, But the only reason they were not 99 percent in those battleground states as the other five percent. They were in New York and California raising money. RighT? So, so this is a system designed to give power to these battleground states. And then you say, well, why is it something the constitution requires? And the answer to that is absolutely not. The constitution does not say how the states will allocate their electors, and indeed when states started adopting this winner take all system, many thought it was an outrageous perversion of the constitutional design.

Speaker 2:          00:56:04       So jeff to jefferson was outraged, but then he said, well, some states are going to do it. Then all states have to do it. Because if you're a state that allocates all of your electrodes to the winner, you're going to have more power than your neighboring states. You only gets half the electrodes to the winter. So very quickly there was a race to the bottom and that's kind of where it's stuck. And so the question is now what we can do about it. Well, there are two big reform efforts out there. One of them is called the national popular vote compact. I mean I should say, you know, you can imagine amending the constitution, but it takes three fourths of the states to change the constitution. And three fourths of the states are not going to agree with abolishing the electoral college. So this is not going to happen anytime soon through the constitution.

Speaker 2:          00:56:47       But there are two ways. Without amending the constitution, we could fix this problem. Won the national popular vote pro. A compact is basically states who say, look, we're going to pledge our electors to the winner of the national popular vote. So the state looks at who won the national popular vote, and then picks the slate of electors from their state with a party of the person who won the national popular vote. So in a state like New York, if the republican won the national popular vote, even though most people in New York are democratic, they would allocate their electrodes to the republican vice versa in Texas. That's, that's the way that system would work. And you know, I personally liked the system because I believe in the idea of one person, one vote, everybody's vote is an american citizen for the american president should be equal. It shouldn't, shouldn't matter that you're having to live in Wyoming versus Pennsylvania versus New York.

Speaker 2:          00:57:37       Um, but there are people who are worried about this because they fear that it'll become a kind of flyover democracy. But the only places that candidates will care about will be places like la or New York or chicago. I actually don't think that's right, but I get the understanding, I think they're wrong about the way the campaigns work, but I understand why they're anxious about it. So then that leads to the alternative solution, which is something, you know, my group equal citizens.us is litigating this right now. Um, we're just trying to declare this winner take all system, violates the constitution. Because it basically says that if you're a republican in California, your vote never matters. If you're a democrat in Texas, your vote never matters because we just count your vote up and then we throw it away because we allocate all the electors to the dominant party in your state.

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       And so we've got david boies is our chief litigate, or we've got a case in California, Texas, South Carolina and Massachusetts asking the courts to declare a winner take all unconstitutional and instead say that electrons have to be allocated proportionally. So if you get 40 percent of the vote in the state, you get 40 percent of the electorate. If you get 50 percent, you get 50 percent of doctors. And what that would do overnight is it would make every state in the nation competitive. Like there'd be a reason for a democrat to go to Texas because you're not going to get all the electoral votes. You're not going to get a half the electoral votes, but you'll get 40 percent, maybe 45 percent. And that could matter. Um, or a republican would go to California because, you know, you're not going to get all the votes in California, but you're going to get a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:59:14       There are a lot of republicans in California, um, so this change would immediately make every state in play. But unlike the national popular vote alternatives, there are many people who look at this and say, this will be better because small states would still have a pretty important role like an elector as an elector. And if I can get it from Arizona, I'm going to care about Arizona if I can get it from Arkansas, care about Arkansas. Um, so it's not going to just be the big states are the big population centers. It's going to be every state. And so if we can get, you know, a court to say this violates the constitution and then you could have states forest to allocate their electors proportionally. And if they did that and then the problem that you identified at the start, which I think is the problem could be solved overnight. You would no longer have these battleground states deciding everything you'd ever president. Who cares about getting elected by all of America and that would be incredible improvement though that seems like in, in and of itself would be a game changer if they could do that, that would change a lot. But one of the things that you said, uh, you said you don't think that it's possible that we would ever vote out the electoral college, but is there a support for the electoral college? Is there a good argument for it?

Speaker 2:          01:00:29       So there is support for the idea that everY state have a role and there's a support for the idea that small states get to kind of thumb on the scale, which is what the electoral college does. So there is some supportive, but most people, you know, 70 percent of people don't like the idea that the president is not chosen from the majority of voters. So most people would oppose it. But the point is to change the constitution, you need the state legislatures or state conventions to agree with the change. And what many states, at least thIrteen states I fear would say, is that we actually win more under this system. Then we lose, so we're not going to change the system, and so unless you get like some overwhelmingly popular movement to support it, or again, you know, you can imagine a presidential candidate who kind of made fixing this part of the democracy part of the plan too.

Speaker 2:          01:01:25       I don't see how you're going to build a political movement to get there or another way of putting it. As you know, this national popular vote compact, which is going around state to state and getting states to join right now has about a hundred. And so the way this works is that when the equivalent of 270 electoral votes have been committed than the compact kicks in. So when they get to 270, the problem goes away. You know the problem of this electoral college goes away because add to 70, according to the plan, the winner of the popular vote wins the electoral college. They right now have 172 electors pledged, right? So they have less than 100 more to go. But the problem is they've got to convince states to join the compact and they're kind of. They kind of hit this red wall now because many republicans thing, the only way to win the presidency is through the electoral college. Now, so many state legislatures, why do they believe that?

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       I think many republicans just think that they're great benefit is from the electoral college. It's not surprising because the battleground states are primarily republican because the base number of republican states is sell high. Right? Because you know, these small rural states get disproportionately more electors than states. Like California. Wyoming gets three electors disproportionate in terms of the population. right? so they liked the system as it is. And you know, you look back and you say, well they got George Bush, even though he didn't win the national vote and they got Donald Trump, even though he didn't win the national vote, it's not hard for me to understand why they're there. I think, again, I don't think they're right about this. You know, in 2004, if 50,000 votes had switched to john kerry in Ohio, then john kerry would have won the electoral college but lost the popular vote and if that had happened in 2004, I think the electoral college would be dead today because a republican won in 2000 a democrat, ron in 2004 people would say, this system is just crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       We got to get rid of this system, but now people think, well, republicans benefit from this, so I'm a republican. I'm going to block the change. And if that's true, then it's never going to happen at a constitutional level because the constitution requires three fourths of the states to support the reform and the reinforcement of the as the Donald Trump one without having the popular one. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, of course not. There's no hypocrisy that touches this president. But remember, in 2012, when there was a moment for about 10 minutes when the national media was reporting that, that romney was going to win the popular vote, but barack obama was going to be elected by the electoral college. Trump started tweeting vigorously about how this is a denial of democracy. We have to march on Washington to end this banana republic like system because the electoral college was the worst possible thing in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       And of course after 2016 he had different views about the electoral college. Um, I wasn't old enough to understand what was going on during watergate. Uh, what Year was that? Well, 70. Uh, so, you know, the break In happens in the lead up to the 72 election. and then he eventually resigned after that. But this is our watergate this moment right now. And cohen's going to go to jail for three years. And I mean, he's testifying against trump and all these people are testifying and they're calling him. What do they call him? Coconspirator number one is that with the individual official individually. Number one, this is a very unusual moment for us to, to be watching this all unfold and to see this slow dissection, what mueller seems to be doing is like slowly closing off all the escape routes and slowly circling the troops around this one area that he's trying to, that he's, that he's attacking. Yeah. So, um, he's a brillianT tactician. Yeah. and, and, uh, and so I think it's that

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       the worst for Donald Trump has yet to come. Um, and I do think the parallel is watergate, but there's a really important difference here, you know. Um, so I'm old enough to remember watergate. I was like 12 or 13 minutes happened and my uncle happened to be the lawyer who worked in the house of representatives convincing the house of representatives to vote the articles of impeachment. So he and that weekend when nixon resigned, he came to visit us. We lived in the Kentucky part of Pennsylvania, that kind of right wing, middle part of the state. He came to visit us and, um, he told me this was gonna happen and uh, that was the event. That was the weekend that I decided I wanted to become a lawyer. Um, but, uh, but the big difference between these two times is that when that happened, the way most people got access to news was three television networks every day they watched the news at the same time because there was nothing else on.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       And those three television networks kind of shot right down the middle and told the story as they saw it. Um, you know, it was kind of the walter cronkite era of news. And as this story broke, they just reported it as they saw it. And as they saw it, it was a pretty damning indictment of the precedent. And what's amazing is he walked the polling among republicans and their support for the president six months before the president resigns. The poll says, among republicans, he has about an 83 percent support rate. And then when he resigns, his support rate among republicans is about 50 percent. And that's because the news, newspapers and television had like told everybody the same story and americans hearing the same story. It came to the same view that there was something deeply corrupted by this president and he had to go, we don't live in that news environment today.

Speaker 2:          01:07:05       We live in an environment where half of America lives in one news world and the other half of America lives in another news world and the half of America living in the breitbart fox news world are not being told the stories that the people living in the msnbc, npr, news universe are. And so in this world, the opportunity for americans to like see the facts, the same facts and have a reflective judgment about it and come to a view that this president on a needs to resign or be impeached. I don't think he should be impeached, but let's, that's a separate question. Um, is, is not possible. and that's what's so terrifying about it. When you live in a democracy where we don't all live in the same universe, you know, we don't know the same facts. Um, how do you knit together a public that can address these critical issues of national import? Um, and, and that's, I think our biggest challenge, right? Well, it gets grayer than that, right? With characters like sean hannity that they separate the line between not just being some sort of a political pundit, but actually campaigning for the president, showing up at speeches, uh, addressing

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       the crowd making, making these big statements in support of the president is very strange to watch because I don't remember that at any point in time. No, it wasn't the past. But I think the thing we need to realize is it is the future because it pays cable news pays tremendously when these people become partisan hacks inside of a politics of hate, which is the current politics of like both the democratic and republican parties and the cable news stations. They build tribes who are deeply loyal to them. And the loyalty to those tribes translates into advertising dollars. It is the business model of cable. So sean hannity looks to old geezers like me, like an abomination from the perspective of what news should be like. But from the standpoint of what the future is going to be, he is the future. And so then it becomes a question like, how do we knit together a democracy given there will be people like the sean hannity's on cable television.

Speaker 1:          01:09:15       uh, and you know, I've began to talk about the slow democracy movement, which I think, you know, I think I pointed to you as part of that. I think that there's a need to begin to think about how do we build political understanding, not through broadcast television but through something else that gives people a chance to think in more than 32nd bites. Yes. and podcasting I think is a core part of that. Is it entirely possiBle that something could be profitable that does shoot down the middle because people are so tired of this cnn, fox, bipolar distribution of information. I mean, I remember when the elections were going on, I would flip back and forth between the two channels and it was like two alternative universes. There are different worlds, different worlds of focus, different worlds of the, what they're projecting. Yeah. So, buT I don't think the point is that it has to be down the middle.

Speaker 1:          01:10:06       I think it has to be deep. So this is what I think is so powerful about podcasting, like you know, the fact that you get people to listen to, you talk about an idea for an hour or two hours, some of them three hours is astonishing, literally astonishing in an age where the most a cable news channel will allocate to a new store is a minute and a half, two minutes, three minutes. Right? And you know, in the context of the tweet, thinking of cable news, they can't afford to go deep on anything and everything they're going to talk about are the things they can talk about sensibly in 25 seconds or 30 seconds or 40 seconds. And what, you know, because you've lived this life of like having deep conversations about things that are important is that it sometimes takes more than 30 seconds to understand something always.

Speaker 1:          01:10:53       Yeah. And the point is if we have media that's focused at the 32nd chunk and that's how America understands the issues. We're never gonna get anywhere and the only way to get to get someplace is to begin to have conversations that are at the hour long chunk or the two hour long chuck, and it's not important that that be neutral or balanced. I don't care if it's balanced. I care that it is attempting to be serious and in depth understanding the issue, so I don't care if keto wants to have podcasts, they try to tell us the deep story of iron randy and economics or something like that. That's fine. That's good. I think it's important that people start thinking about these issues in a richer, deeper way and I think the challenge we have now is how do we begin to produce understanding, realizing that the world of walter cronkite is never coming back and it might be a good thing, but it is just never coming back.

Speaker 1:          01:11:46       And the world of sean hannity is a world that will destroy democracy. So how do we rebuild democracy outside of that and you know, if you. If you had to pick the three things that have the most hopeful, I think podcasting is number one. I think some of the reflective, deep, you know, funny, playful, but in the end, at the end of the hour long segment of a podcast, you understand something you didn't understand before. I think that's number one. I think comedy like comedy television, like brings pEople into understanding things in a way that's not possible on fox news. I think that, you know, as number two I think shows like homeland. I don't know if you watch homeland, watched it until the redheaded guy died and then that went through this dark period in the middle, but the recent seasons or just unfucking believable and because they're unbelievable because they are such a deep rich understanding of the tensions at issue.

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       Like you won't understand the Iran nuclear deal watched the last season because after watching that season, you like understand the tensions between the cia and the president and what's actually going on with Israel. and, and I think that if you imagine television shows aspiring to tell the story in an entertaining way and in a way that brings people in, that they voluntarily want to watch it. But that in the end, at the end of watching a season, you understand something, I understand the current season's about the Russia, you know, struggle and I can't wait to watch it because it's going to be a richer understanding of that story than anything on television. Did you watch house of cards? I did up until the season. Did you quit at this season? I watched the season. I was very disappointed by watched episode one and I said this, it seems like they gave it to some different writers and it's this craziness.

Speaker 1:          01:13:33       It just seemed like a. Like somebody just got ahold of it and they said, I'll take it and I want to write it my own way. Right. But even in the very beginning, you know, the striking thing about house of cards is it made it seem like stuff actually could happen in Washington. Yes. And you're like, wow, that's really powerful guy. Frank underwood actually can actually get important bills passed. And I remember watching that same. Holy shit. This is just completely not the truth. This is just not the way the system works. I mean, it would be good if it worked like that because at least it could do stuff, but the way it actually works is that these guys would be scurrying around trying to figure out, you know, what the tentacles of funders are directing them to do and the tentacles of funders added together would be don't do anything.

Speaker 1:          01:14:15       That's not what you're there to do. But what it did is sort of highlight the influences these people experience and it showed how deeply entrenched everything is. Yeah. I mean I don't want to talk it down at all, man. I want a million different things like this on television. Just something that gives people just give them a richer understanding. Well, an understanding period because for the most part, what people, when you go to school, you learn about democracy and our system of representative government and then you become an adult and you forget most of what you learned and then you hear something about the electoral college and the popular vote and you know, and then you see bills getting passed and you know, what the hell is that and this and the stuff you learn at school is so politically correct. IT can't actually give you an understanding of anything.

Speaker 1:          01:15:06       Like you actually taught kids in high school the way congress worked. You know, the school board would go crazy and they're like, no, no, no, no. You can't talk down american democracy like that. So the truth is not teachable. The only way to get people to see the truth is to expose it to them in a way that they want to see it. And you know, my point is that's not going to be fox news. Fox news can never cover it at the depth and the interest level that it needs to be covered. It's going to be things like what you do or things like what great television can do is our system of government analogous to like taking like dos or windows 95 or something like that and just continuing to patch it and never revisit it and never come up with a new operating system.

Speaker 1:          01:15:48       I think the better analogy is an operating system that has been taken over by malware virus because it's not innocent, you know, dos, you know, it was a fun system and that like cranked to a halt after awhile when you're trying to pile more and more on top of it. But that was just kind of the limits of what it could do. There was nothing malicious in its failure, but, but there's something malicious in this failure. There are people who are eagerly focused on how to make sure our government can't govern because if our government can't govern, they win. So you know, the koch brothers have this amazing diverse bipolar character. On the one hand, they're talking about the ideals of government, but the reality is their interventions make it so we don't have an epa that can regulate their companies. So basically we have environmental policy that leaves their companies alone, which means they can make tons of money by polluting our environment without ever having to pay the consequence of it.

Speaker 1:          01:16:50       And what they want is not change of a particular kind except for tax cuts. What they want is nothing to happen. Um, and so that's the kind of malware that's taken over the system of our government has blocked the ability to government to function. and rather than having leaders at the center who say, hold it, let's just pause for a second and realize this is a fucking broken system. We have politicians that continue to pretend as if everything's working, you just have to elect more democrats and we'll get what we want, you know, I'm voting online. What would be the pitfalls of that and why hasn't that been implemented? If you can bank online, why can't you vote online? So I think, you know, most of the tech, the experts who are disinterested, meaning they're not working for default or something like that, I would tell you that we don't yet have the infrastructure to be able to be confident about this.

Speaker 1:          01:17:43       Now, there are lots of people working on, I think really great open source implementations that that could be, could eventually produce the kind of confidence that we need to have to be able to vote online. And so I don't foreclose it in the long run. But I think what we've seen in the short run is that when we turn to these proprietary providers of technology to enable us to vote, they give us shit. Uh, you know, look, look at these voting machines. There was a recent story about his 11 year old who was able to, uh, within like 15 minutes hack into the Florida election, um, uh, uh, system and change the results from a, you know, one, one candidate to another. Um, because you know, the companies that build these technologies are not filled with a bunch of rocket science. Like if you're really good, you're going to go work for google or for facebook or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:18:39       So. So the proprietary software has all of these bugs and holes and intended back doors built into it. Intended back towards. Yeah, because they need, you know, the company itself needs a simple way to get into check or to fix things, but then they worry about the fact that other people will get back doors to be able to get. This was the argument for diebold system that did have a third party entrance. Tons of allegations about that. Did you ever see the documentary hacking democracies? Is that disturbing to you? Incredibly. I don't know how much I believe about it was a well because I've seen so much that contradicts some of the claims about the extent to which there was real differences in the numbers. I remember at that election really being anxious about it because it seemed to me in Ohio in particular, a really compelling case was made that there was some something weird going on, but you know, the point is not so much the particulars of a particular election.

Speaker 1:          01:19:33       It's recognizing that if you turn this over to proprietary software companies who are going to build these closed systems, nobody can inspect. There's no reason to trust them and you know, they think they are intending to make themselves vulnerable to the russians. They're just going to make themselves vulnerable to the russians and there are alternative systems like open source systems. It's something I know some people are building right now that I think eventually could get us there. An open source system like linux based, something that would go onto your phone. Well it could be on your phone, but the point about the open source is that anybody can inspect the

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       and be confident that the code is doing what it says. It's true, right?

Speaker 3:          01:20:12       What I'm saying about being on your phone as the biometrics that we use on our phone today or some of the most secure in terms of like being able to establish that it's you that's making that vote like iris scanners that you have on the. I have a samsung note, nine that has an iris scanner, checks my eyeballs. You know, you're my iphone checks my face. takes the shit, I mean, there's, they're pretty amazing fingerprints obviously, but the fact that this is probably in terms of our own personal security in terms of information, this is probably the most secure. Our smartphones are probably the most secure devices we've ever possessed.

Speaker 2:          01:20:48       So on the one hand, yes, and that's why I say I agree with you that in the long run we should imagine a world where to be trivially easy to vote, just like it's easy for me to venmo you or a cash app, you, I guess it's your favorite here. Um, uh, uh, money that should be the way the future is. But on the other hand, we need to realize that these technologies are also incredibly insecure in the sense that there is now a commercial market to exploit a insecurities inside of these phones. And, uh, you know, these companies basically have bounties that they post on the web, right? For people who will come forward and find certain holes and hacks. And once they get those hacks, they use them to leverage power. And governments play this game all the time. And you know, there's a pretty strong argument that the murder was a product of one of these exploits which was then going to be revealed and the need to cover up the fact that there was such an exploit out there.

Speaker 2:          01:21:50       What is this? I didn't know this. What is this about? What's. So the basic idea is that, that, you know, these companies and many of them, um, most prominent ones here, israeli companies who facilitate the ability of governments to buy access to your phone, right? And the standard way in which this has done is to, is to pierce the security by sending you something that you click on it, it then embeds itself in the phone. And there's no way you see it in a way that it can be blocked. But there's, there's rumors now that in fact we've got something more than that going on where all they need to do is get your telephone number and they're able to hack into the system to get access to your phone. But the point is these companies have a market now for selling this type of insecurity.

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       So like, sell the ability for you to get access here and the story that, you know, I don't have a lot of reasons to, to, to be absolutely confident about this except that I trust the person who's inside the security world that says this to me. Um, you knoW, the story is that this is part of what happened in the [inaudible] context, that the saudis have exploited this in a way that was going to be revealed. And, and the simple solution to that eventual revelation was to remove the person who would reveal it. And that's why.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       Yeah. So, so this, the point about the recognize at these funds on the one hand for the ordinary life, it's more secure than anything you've ever had, but in the other hand, systematically it's building insecurity into our lives in a way that can be exploited by powerful people. And for most people, doesn't matter. Like most people, ordinary, ordinary joes, uh, you know, they're not, they're never going to be vulnerable because nobody's going to spend a million dollars to get a hack against the individual person. When I hear that from a person justifying why they don't worry about it, it drives me crazy. I can't do anything. What are they going to do? I'm a clean, don't worry about me, but it's not. That's not what we're doing when we're talking about right? Because if we have a system where systematically powerful people can just push a button and like find a way to control, you can control anybody jamal custodian, then we've got a system that no longer makes it possible for ordinary people to stand up to power. That's, that's basically what it is. Like this is the, this is a structure that allows powerful people if it is insecure to protect themselves because they can just leverage that against us. And I think, you know, this is a completely an focused problem. Like nobody is talking about this politically, but the market for this commercialized x security exploits is hugely important and we've got to find a way to, to address it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:31       So is it feasible that as technology advances and as the security advances as well, I mean the biometrics that we have today are far greater than the passwords that we use just a few years ago, that there could be something that you can't exploit, especially considering open source variance where they can be checked by the community. Yeah. So, so, so the problem is, is not the kind of particular technologies working the way you intend them to work. You know, if you've got great biometric technologies, those are really good at making sure in the ordinary case that you're the right person using your phone. The problem iS the code is so big and so complicated that there's always going to be little bugs inside the code and what these exploits are are like coders who like poke at the code looking for these little hooks and they link one hook to another hook to another hook and then they find the way in to exploit the system. So the exploits are never. Well I shouldn't say never. there's another story. It's important to recognize. I'll talk about that a second, but the exploits are not in the main case intended by anybody. It's just the un. It's just the natural consequence of having, you know, literally hundreds or millions of lines of code that go into making this machine work and that's what's beinG exploited. And when you have a world like the iphone, which is mono culture, like, you know, everybody has the same operatinG system where it seemed versions of the operating system, if you find

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       an exploit in the, in the ios and apple doesn't know about it, um, and you can exploit it for six months or a year. You can do a lot of damage to a lot of people's lives before anybody gets around to, to blocking it. Now, you know, that's even in the best case where everybody's working hard to make their system as secure as it can. It can be, you know, there was this period after the nine slash 11 when there's, you know, very strong and credible allegations that the United States government went around to these technology companies and said, we need you to build back doors into your technology. So we can track down the terrorists and there's strong allegations that in fact many of the most important technology companies complied and what they quickly discovered is that the backdoor is intended for the United States government trying to attack terrorists were being exploited by the chinese trying to steal trade secrets from american company. So this infrastructure that was intended to be secure to protect american companies so that they could do their work without being asked for an espionage on top of them became an infrastructure of espionage again because it's so complicated to get it perfectly right. And, um, the return from exploit is so huge that you can just expect the market is always going to supply it. What was the other example that you're going to bring up that was, that was the idea was that the intended backdoors that turn out to be exploited for other purposes,

Speaker 3:          01:27:32       but isn't the system itself like when you deal with the hanging chads or pay terrible, their counters ridiculous. You're living giving it up to human beings. The potential for errors. Massive, right? Just to count things up or the potential for corruption. The decision to ignore certain collections, I mean this, this has all been documented, right?

Speaker 2:          01:27:54       Yeah, and all of this follows from the fact that we, bizarrely in America, unlike most mature democracies around the world, make the running of elections a partisan event like, you know, republicans in a district or democrats in a district control the voting systems. Like why the hell would that be? Why don't we have like people who, who self identity and professional framework is nonpartisan, independent, like election commission. That's about, you know, it's above the partisan bow so that there's no incentive in Georgia, for example, for the government to allocate money to fix voting machines just in republican districts and not in democratic districts or there's no incentive to shut down a voting polling place, which they did in Georgia, making it so that people in that area would have to go huge distance to be able to vote, were to create it so that it takes seven hours to vote in some districts and 20 minutes to vote in other districts.

Speaker 2:          01:28:49       There's no incentive to do that if your job is simply to make it possible for people to vote efficiently and if we measure you and, and, and reward you based on how easy have you made it for people in this state, devote easily and efficiently. We don't get that kind of efficiencY. We don't get that kind of innovation because it's a rigged game. You, you know, you might have people who, I'm sure many of these people are above partisan motivation, but we also know that many of these people are deeply motivated by partisan politics, especially at that kind of middle level of party politics. And if theY can set it up so that their side winds because of the way they've played the game for allocating voting resources, then more power to them. And that'S exactly what happened in Georgia with this recent governor's election. That kind of outrageous that the man running the election system, secretary of state does not resign from this job as he runs for governor. And the governorship is decided in such a very close way by, um, the decisions that he made about how they're going to throw people off. The voting roles are which allocations of voting system technology will be made across the state. This is a product or just making it political. we could make it non political and might not have all of these kinds of problems

Speaker 3:          01:30:05       dealing with this very unique landscape now of google and facebook and twitter And instagram and all these different social media groups that have a vested interest in a specific narrative being portrayed. And spi. One thing specifically is, and this is being addressed right now in congress, is the discrimination against conservative voices and there's a lot of denial that. But there's also a lot of evidence that that is the case and that they feel like they have some moral or ethical obligation to suppress certain conservative voices for whatever reason and push the narrative of, of progressive and liberal voices. This is a very strange thing because the, the amount of influence that something like google or facebook has today is arguably as great or greater than the sean hannity's of the world and the cnns and the, the, the, the traditional news outlets.

Speaker 2:          01:31:07       yeah. So no doubt. There's a big debate about whether they were more important in 2016 than the cable stations. My colleague yoke, benkler has a book that argues pretty powerfully. I think that it was actually the cable stations that were more responsible for the result then the facebooks, but whether in 2016 they are, the more powerful someday in the future, they are going to be more powerful. Certainly powerful. Absolutely. Um, and you know, the question is what we mean by bias or discrimination here. Like, you know, in 2017 in the fall it was revealed that facebook was selling ads for people who wanted to target quote jew haters. Okay. So you could go and you could buy ads for jew haters. Now there was never. How did that work? Okay. No, I mean, you know, they have lots of categories you get to pick when you buy facebook ads, you know, liberals or people who people over 60

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       white armor. This was one of the categories that was exposed. You could buy ads for jew haters. There was an actual category. Yeah, yeah. What? Yeah. Now there was never a time that a facebook engineer or a marketing person decided we ought to create a jew hater category. Right. This is not a decision of any human. It was the product of the machine, the ai that was developing the categories based on what they saw people happen to be interested in and then throw up categories to see what sticks and then certain categories stick and then they run with them. So it. So you might say, you know, if you were the, you know, anti defamation league, you would say, oh my god, facebook is discriminating to encourage jew haters. But from another perspective, you're like the machines doing it, no doubt. But, uh, but to what extent do you want to say facebook is doing it?

Speaker 1:          01:32:51       And I Think that's off. That's often what you're going to see in this argument about whether they're quote biasing the system against one side or the other, you know, like this hilarious a hearing that was just held on capital hill two days ago where a great congressman lewis, like if you don't want negative ad results in the suit, then don't do bad things. So then, um, so, you know, I think this is quite fun. It was really funny. It, this is like nobody's intent. We should just explain that to people who don't know what we're talking about. Yeah. So, so there was an argument about whether google was tilting the ads to embarrass one side or the other and uh, I guess it was a congressman from Iowa, everybody like that. That's the guy who didn't know that google didn't make the iphone. Yeah, he got embarrassed.

Speaker 1:          01:33:40       But anyway, there was thIs, um, you know, the exchange was basically here I'm going to show you a demonstration and they put it in a certain name and congressman smith and then up comes this are referenced to his race baiting and he's like, outraged by this and you know, so one theory is you've got google engineers down there saying let's get congressman smith so we're going to make it so every time you put smith in their upcoming race baiting, but google's response was, look, we don't do individualized search results like we give people what we think people want based on what they've done in the past and what they've shown interest in. And so that's what's producing this, hits the machine that's producing this result and that let congress lou come back with, if you don't like the connections, than just don't enable them to be made by doing things like don't do things like race baiting. Yeah. If you don't want negative search results, don't do negative, which is a pretty. But. But I do think tHat there's a really hard problem here. When you say it's the machine is doing it, you know, what's the future gonna be like when we can just say it's not my problem, it's the machine that, this is just facebook though when, when you're talking about, or google rather when you're talking about twitter, twitter has a different issue and their issue is there's accusations of shadow banning that they have decided that they're going to silent voices

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       or make that much more difficult to find or eliminate them from certain people's feeds, you know, and they're doing this, this, the allegation that they're doing this based on their own personal preferences, their, their beliefs that they're progressive ideology wants them to lean left and somehow or another distribute that information in a much more left leaning way.

Speaker 2:          01:35:24       And I hear these and I don't not an expert on what they're doing. And I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, certain complaints come in about certain feeds and they say we're going to take these off and that's the allegation. And they haven't denied that. And, you know, quite frankly, some of these feeds, you know, Alex Jones stuff, um, you know, if you're, the consequences of your news show is that somebody takes a gun to a pizza shop in chicago in Washington to try to prove that hillary clinton is running a sex slave operation in the basement. There's something wrong with what's going on their child second child sex life, right? Um, so I understand why they feel like they're a responsible there. And you know, it was recognized in the very beginning. These companies have said we're going to try to create a certain kind of environment like so facebook required. You identify yourself so that under the shadows of anonymity you wouldn't be causing wreaking lots of havoc inside the system. But look, I think the more fundamental problem here. So what I've said so far, people like google and facebook might like, here's stuff they're going to hate. The more fundamental problem here is that we have no antitrust enforcement of any of these companies against any of these companies. And we've allowed them to become so incredibly powerful without any justification under the law.

Speaker 3:          01:36:42       Isn't the issue though, that this was never anticipated that this is when they created twitter, they didn't think of it? It's going to be. It's going to be some voice of distribution of information that's unprecedenteD worldwide, but that's what it is.

Speaker 2:          01:36:55       Yeah. No, they didn't expect no doubt. They didn't expect it to work exactly the way it worked, but the antitrust law has from the beginning had standards that should have said we need to step in and certain places. So for example, in 2010, facebook is facing a pretty powerful competitive threat from instagram. And uh, the question is what they're gonna do like it's cooler to be instagram. It's kids are using it much with the growth rate is much faster in an ordinary competitive market. What they would do is they would build a better product to compete with instagram. Their response was to write a check for a billion dollars and they bought instagram and um, and they've bought a whole bunch of. Other companies clearly have whatsapp, which you know, was a very important competitor in. People believe they're really secure way to communicate to them. They by boston dynamics to have that.

Speaker 2:          01:37:47       That's amazing. There's a. There's a wikipedia page that has like endless list of companies that they've bought. They're buying robots. Yeah, that makes sense. Funnel if that's true, but the point is antitrust law in any of these moments should have in historically would have stepped in and said, wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't buy your way into complete dominance of these markets. And I think one of the biggest changes that's happened in the last 20 years is at the antitrust department has Just shot up its doors and just stopped doing its work. So if we had a more Competitive internet environment where companies had to compete against each other, you'd have companies that try to compete by protecting your privacy differently, by refusing to sell your information differently. You'd have lots of pressure on companies like facebook to behave, not because idiot senators who don't know how facebook works or calling them before hearings, but because the market itself is creating the competition that drives them to behave in a way that actually conforms with what consumers want. So I agree with you. These are real questions and important questions to figure out are they biasing in one way or the other and if they're biasing systematically, that's a really important problem, but the solution to that problem might not be more government regulation. The solution to that problem might be governments making sure we have the right kind of competition going on here so that they can't get away with behaving

Speaker 3:          01:39:16       well. What would be that right? Comic effect. Google bought it and they actually sold it last year. Oh yeah. Interesting. Probably sold to the russians, the Japanese, japanese. These like what would be the right kind of competition? It would have to be something that balances it out, right? Like some sort of a right wing social media platform, but those tend to get infested with trolls and four chan type people. Then as soon as you say, we're not gonna, have any regulation. I Mean the idea would be right. you say, oh, google and facebook, they are so progressive. They lean left, they suppress conservative voices and they don't believe in freedom of speech, so we're going to create a right wing platform that allows freedom of speech and doesn't suppress conservative voices and you know what happens to those things? They get infested by four chan people and the pepe the frog people and they start saying racist things.

Speaker 3:          01:40:13       If I could say anything, I'll say anything, anything means anything, and that's a real problem in today's day and age because there's a lot of bored people out there and they get excited about a platform where they can say something that they know is completely outrageous under an anonymous screen name and people think, well, this is indicative of a person's actual real beliefs. Sometimes. Sometimes it's board people that are trying to fuck with people and they're trying to get a rise out of folks and they know that if they write a bunch of words and heil hitler, that it's going to get a reaction and then they'll check it every couple of minutes to see what kind of, ah, look at all these people getting mad. Ha ha. This is what happens. So incredibly progressive tea tends to, when you think of someone as being progressive or be having a progressive voice, you tend to think of being inclusive, you know, not supporting homophobia, being open to all sorts of different marginalized groups rights. But when you think of conservative, you open the door for a lot of people that are rejected by these progressive groups and they Might not necessarily be conservative, but they are not welcome in these progressive spaces. So they come out to these new places and they, it turns into a dumpster fire.

Speaker 2:          01:41:31       Yeah. Look, the stoRy you just described is the story of cable television. Cable television is that at a certain point people like robert roger ailes and murdoch's decided that we didn't have enough conservative media out there. And so they funded not just magazines like the new republic, but they funded the beginning of cable television and um, and that created this bifurcation in media with cable television and one could make these observations about, I mean, this is what you'll have done. Clare's book is all about like what the nature of truth is on cable television on the right is different from what it is on the left. So I think that's all fair and I don't think anybody has a clear sense of what the right answer looks like in this space. I mean, the reality is, you know, facebook is a technology. I'm here, facebook friends are going to really hate me for this, but here facebook is a technology to exploit insecurity for the purpose of selling ads. That's what it does. What it does is make you feel like you've checked and you're like, why didn't she like that photograph or why isn't he friended me? And so you constantly engage because you're constantly trying to feed this feedback and that is exploiting tristan, tristan harris. HiS work Is really a powerful here is exploiting your insecurity.

Speaker 3:          01:42:53       Is that really what it is? Because I've always thought about it as being a fast food version of the nutrients that we're missing in an actual real community.

Speaker 2:          01:43:01       That's so good. That's exactly the right way to think about it, but just in the same way that fast food companies figure out how to exploit the brain chemistry that makes it so that you eat chicken wings, you know, barbecue chicken wings because they know that's what's going to feed that kind of addiction and just like gaming companies, figure out how to tweak the game so that they'd know how to get the addiction out of your kids. This company is really great at getting you to like turnover as much as you can to them to builD you into this quote community. Why are they doing that? Not because mark zuckerberg has come, some kind of freaky guy who wants to know your secrets, but because the more you turn over to them, the better their ads are in feeding you information. So this is a technology for the purpose of engendering advertising and so that

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       advertising gets really, really good. And so, you know, you could say that facebook is tilted to the left, but the reality is there is an extraordinary amount of exploitation of the advertising inside of facebook to feed information to the right. In this last election, I mean as much, I'm Kathleen Hall, jayman says book about this. It's really quite amazing and documenting and that's because it's gotten really good at being able to segment markets on the basis of what people know or care about. Again, not because anybody planned it, nobody wrote jew hater, but because the ai is smart enough to figure that out, and so when you build this technology that is driven to the purpose of making it easier to sell ads, you produced this world that has no necessary connection to figure people figuring out what the truth is. Again, think of cable television.

Speaker 1:          01:44:39       Cable television is about building really loyal community, building the tribal sense of the community. If telling the truth did that, they would tell the truth. If not telling the truth does that they will not tell the truth. The question is not whether you're telling the truth or not. The question is what builds the advertising base. And so this, this reality that we have these platforms that are ad driven, um, distort or constructs drives that platform to develop in certain ways. And that's why I think it's important to think, well, what if we could create a competitive environment where there were different platforms available once that we're not focused on driving ads and this is something that again, I think they fund those. Isn't that the reason why something like google or facebook has gotten so big is because of so much money behind it? Well two things because they've been allowed to get so big and because so much money behind it stopped them.

Speaker 1:          01:45:31       The antitrust departments, people, antitrust department would step in and say, facebook, you become too successful. The way you're buying up competitors is disturbing to us. Well, but again, the thing of the difference in that sentence, you've become so successful. That's one sentence. And what we want to do in America is encouraged companies to become successful. I believe in, you know, innovators and markets working that's really great, but you've bought your competitor is a separate statement, like you have a bunch of money because the stock is so valuable because people think you're the future of money, but then you turn and use that money to buy a competitor's. What do you put in up jamie?

Speaker 3:          01:46:06       What is this? That's the total number of they've spent in the last, I don't know, I think it was seven years. Saw the company as they bought. Scroll back, don't, don't move. Total cost of acquisitions. What does that $23,000,000,000,000. Billion, billion. Twenty $3,000,000,000 more than the gross domestic product of Fiji. Zimbabwe and mild dbs combined. 19 billion of that was for that one. What's app? Really? 19 billion. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:46:33       Anyway. Yeah, so, but the point is when you're talking about acquisitions, you're not necessarily talking about companies that are succeeding because they're so good. Right? So you know, when you say what are the alternatives going to look like? It's a really hard question, but we have some of it in real space. Like we understand

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       npr has a different set of incentives from fox news. We understand podcasts have a different set of incentives from youtube videos, right? You do videos of a different kind of constraint. If you did a three hour youtube video, you would not live in the same way that you get to live in the context of podcasts. But we do do a three hour youtube video, but it doesn't get the success that it gets because it's a three hour youtube video. It's because people are committed to your podcast. I mean I know these guys like a carry it around and like when you get to a place where it sounds like it's going to be interesting to see what's on the video, then they flip up the video. But. But you know the average successful youtube video, if you do a political youtube video, you're told you can't be more than two and a half minutes. Then you've lost people. But the point is the environments.

Speaker 3:          01:47:36       I don't necessarily think that's correct. Jordan peterson is doing a lot of really long youtube videos that are very successful, doesn't hurt as podcasts. There's a hunger right now for unedited thought and not edited in under an uncensored in terms of language, but in terms of no one influencing what you're saying. So if you decided to do a podcast or a thing on youtube and no one was leaning over your shoulder with an agenda or a guideline to follow, there's a real hunger for that because people feel like what you've described about facebook and cable news, that they're essentially just trying to sell you things, keep you on the hook so they can profit from you. There's a real hunger for someone who's not doing that. Right. I agree. This is why I feel like there's got to be a market for news in that regard. Like an actual unbiased, uncensored, raw, truly objective centrist news station.

Speaker 2:          01:48:32       Well, again, I think that's the slow democracy movement that podcast feeds because the reality is if you had a simple way to be watching in every second of your two hour, three hour podcasts, what was working and what was not, it'd be really hard for you to resist. I would resist. Okay. I wouldn't pay attention to the thing for a second car to you.

Speaker 3:          01:48:55       I've already been faced with that before. People have said to me, oh, well this is when people start tuning. Throw that away.

Speaker 2:          01:49:02       Yeah, but you know, I know friends, chris hayes will tell you about life on msnbc where it. see, that's because of advertiser dollars. Okay. That's my point. My point is the way to this is my whole point about this platform, this platform is in advertising driven platform, right? That fact steers it in a certain way and I saying we need to build alternative platforms, which was what you're building and the in the pocket. It's not like advertising is not important to your stuff. Of course you start with talking about certain products that help sponsor what you're doing. So it's not anti market, it's all for market. But the point is it allows you to develop the content in a way that's not micromanaged by the advertising dollar or the are the market incentive and that's critically. It's

Speaker 3:          01:49:47       also other people's incentive to get you to do things in a way that they will feel they feel will be more profitable so that everybody gains. Um, I don't have those other people. So there's no one else. So if I, but if I've done television shows before, when you do television shows before you will have meetings with producers and they will have notes and they will tell you that this is hurting our bottom line and this is not good for that or we have to emphasize more of this or the network wants that and it's really just about accentuating your ability to make more money. Right? Which is why we have to build these alternatives that can compete with the advertising driven platforms. Well, if you could get a really entertaining news show on youtube or I mean, I guess the young turks sorta tried doing that, but they leaned so hard left a bit, but they attract an extraordinary number of people and that's good.

Speaker 3:          01:50:38       But again, you know, we have this image of like new shows have a version of walter cronkite. Maybe that's not what it is. Maybe you know, the cupbearer report is a new show or something. Who's someone is mocking it as they're delivering you the input that they're giving you the information. Someone who's objective. I would like someone who's really objective, who talks about the negative applications of whatever law or bill it's being discussed. Like what would be bad for everyone, what would be good for democrats, republicans, poor people, rich people. You don't get that. There's no version of that available right now. every version leans towards whatever platform they're on, whether it's fox news or msnbc. Yeah. I think not for want of trying. I just think the world doesn't support it, but the world doesn't support it because there's people are so tribal because they want to be either on the fox news camp or they want to be in the msnbc camp. I really feel like there's a lot of people that just aren't being represented and folks like me who just. I want to know what, what is happening? Why? Why is this the Case? Why is this leaning in this direction? What's the real motivation behind this bill? What's the real motivation behind these actions?

Speaker 2:          01:51:53       Yeah, and, and the question is whether you're going to get it from a single person who purports to be quote objective or whether you're going to get it from three or four people like reading across these different perspectives. When I was a kid, I was obsessed with the soviet union and in 1982 I went to the soviet union. I was like, I guess I was 20, just turned 21 and, and I was hitchhiking through eastern europe. And then I went through the soviet union and I was on a train from leningrad to moscow and a sitting next to a professor. I always seem to be followed by people who spoke english. But this guy spoke english and he said to me, um, you know, we have a better system of free speech and soviet union than you do in America. How dare he, eh? So I said, whaT the hell could that possibly mean? And he said, well, when you wake up in the mornings, he said, uh, he said, when you wake up in the morning,

Speaker 1:          01:52:47       you read the New York times or the Washington post or the wall street journal and you think, you know, the truth, but we know when we read our newspapers, everybody's lying to us. So we have to read seven or eight newspapers and triangulate on the truth. And that makes us a more critical free speech society that America is. And you know, it's kind of funny at the time because like, you realize they didn't have any. But there's a kernel of truth to that. You know, when my dad gets an email that says barack obama's a muslim, he comes from the time when you just believe what's printed even though it's not printed, it's just an email. And so he just kind of like, oh my god, the president of muslim. Um, but you know, my kid gets an email that says barack obama is a muslim.

Speaker 1:          01:53:34       He's like, yeah, well, I mean, what else mean? Like he's going to be like, yo, you want to see different views. And so I think that in some sense we are producing a culture, especially among our kids, uh, or at least one hopes where they recognize that everything is partial. Yes. And you gotta you gotta do a lot of work to Poland to knit it together. And in the end that might be a better. I might be a better ecology for producing democracy and truth than one where, you know, you've got to trust the source to be objective in this case. That's an interesting perspective. Um, I do definitely agree that young people are more skeptical and more aware of the possibilities of fuckery today than ever before. Here's a funny story. Michael sherman, you know, michael shermer, who is a professional skeptic. Yeah. I get a dm from him, says, uh, there's a story about you on bc.

Speaker 1:          01:54:29       Uh, uh, what, what is the british bbc is a story about you on bbc. You have to log into your twitter to read it. So I look at that. I go, what kind of bullshit? This, What'd you get hacked? so I sent him a message, say, hey dude, you get hacked. They send him the message and he said, what? There's a story about me and he logged in. Shit, he's a fucking professional skeptic. Wow. They got him. But why? Because he's older now. You know? I mean, I think guys that didn't grow up with that, they don't or they don't know tricksters. They don't know the, the, the ways of it. And it was a nightmare for him. He'll like, I mean his whole system was screwed up and he had a j. Every time it would make, make a tweet, it would get deleted.

Speaker 1:          01:55:15       Like it was really bad and I will email them and go, dude, you got hacked. yeah. No, it's a problem with us old people. This is the way we live. Well, it's just you grow up with one system and then all of a sudden you know, I don't know what to do here. Oh, it says it needs my login. Let me just give me a hug and that all these pop up boxes. And oh no. The number of people who are being tricked into believing the irs is calling them on the telephone and demanding. Hilarious. Hilarious. And tragic,

Speaker 3:          01:55:43       I mean this is amazing, man. Told me they're going to put my whole family in jail. My whole family. They left a message. Since you did not return our call, we will put your whole family in jail. My dad, my whole family, the dog to everybody. What about the cats? It's like, what the fuck man. Like they're trying to freak people out. And it's an automated voice message folks. Yeah. Yeah. Old folks get roped into that stuff real hard. It's very sad. It's very sad because a lot of them are lonely and they don't have a lot of companionship. And they get these messages and they don't know who to turn to to explain it to

Speaker 1:          01:56:24       god. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And you know, so is there a reason to be hopeful here? Well, younger kids. And uh, the other thing that makes me really hopeful is places like reddit, you know, so which forms are you going?

Speaker 3:          01:56:40       I know there's some really bad stuff. Some of them are

Speaker 1:          01:56:45       great though, but many of them are great. But the point is what the greatness can inheres in there demonstrating incredible talents out there in the world that, you know, in the 19 seventies just would have been invisible. Like you kind of looked at the world in the 19 seventies, which I remember the 19 seventies you kind of thought they were great people at the top, you know, they were all in television and, and everybody else was kind of a troll. But what red hat does every day, you know, I, I'm obsessed with certain of these feats adjuster. Amazing. But, um, it's like you read them like, here's just some joe schmo out there that's taken a bunch of data and data is beautiful. I'm like, demonstrated something amazing by the way he's built it. And yoU get the sense that the world is filled with these incredibly talented, smart people everywhere who are, you know, many of them just have too much time. But the point is they're out there everywhere. So if you ask why should we be hopeful? It's that we develop these critical attitudes. We have this ability to think across. And the army is filled with so many incredibly talented people and the internet surfaces it. It makes it possible for us to at least reach them. Yes. And then the question is can we use this power leverage is power and actually do something with the forces of evil that now control.

Speaker 3:          01:57:59       I had an interesting moment last night at the ice house comedy club where there was a drunk couple in the front row that we're talking really loud and they were annoying all the people around them and they were kind of chime in and heckling and raising their hands and eventually they got kicked out and it was pretty fun. Everybody was having a good time. It was pretty, pretty crazy. Even as they were getting kicked out, the rest of the audience was having a good time because we're making fun of it. And I said, as these people were getting kicked out, I said, this is basically us. Most of us are cool. There's a hundred and 50 people in here and out of 150 people, hundred 48 of them are having a great time. Everyone's drinking. and and where all these comedians and no one wants any extraordinary attention, no one wants any special attention, but to people fucked it up.

Speaker 3:          01:58:49       Now if you were next to those people, you would say, oh, the crowd there sucks. The people are always yelling things out and they're drunks and they hackle will because that those two people required an exorbitant amount of attention that they asked for more attention than anyone else. And if you use that bias sample group and say, well this is the crowd. The crowd is these drunk people that yelled at, you know, the fast majority of the crowd are really polite fund people out having a good time. And they approached it with the perfect attitude. I think this is the world. This is the world. I think the world is. There's a small percentage of people that fuck things up for everybody. And I think that this, this is in terms of politics, in terms of business, in terms of everything, is that. Yes, in terms of the net for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:59:37       And I think the net is the perfect example of that. If you're a person that gets. If something happens to you and people started attacking you online for it, if you just noticed the number of people thAt say you're involved in some sort of a story, right? Say maybe there's a million people that know about this story and you get a 150 people send you mean things. You think at the end of the world, 150 people a unit. You don't notice that it's a hunt. You just see All these messages and it's an. It's unmanageable. You like, oh my god, everyone hates me. No, a hundred and 50 people have decided to take action and make you feel bad because they feel bad. It's a small number in terms of the overall number of human beings, but if you are louis, c, k and it's coming at you, you're like, holy shit.

Speaker 3:          02:00:24       The world fucking hates me. you know, and it's, it's. This is. This is the situation that we're in right now. We just have so many voices. It's incredible though because out of all those voices, as long as you're not personally trying to figure it out and filter it yourself with your own, which is completely impossible, but if you could just look at it objectives from afar, this is going to work itself out in a far better way than has ever happened before in our past. There's never been this many voices and our pastor has been like you were talking about a select few voices that walter cronkite's, the whoever it is at the top and then everyone else sort of had to wait for the narrative to be spelled out for them. RighT. That's not the case anymore. That's right. And, and again, I think it's the best of times and the worst of times. So it's the best of times because all these new voices are bringing all sorts of great perspective and insight and intelligence to the story that wasn't there before. And that's great. The problem is is if the infrastructure that used to be there to kind of bring us up, bring us all up to kind of basic level so that we understood the facts disappears so they don't have anything that kind of makes it so that we all understand what's at issue and what's at stake

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       and what the facts are so that we can act as a democracy in a sensible way. Then the question is how do we run a democracy? You know, because if we could have all these different, you know, I like to think about the difference between the culture channel and the democracy channels and the culture channel. This is the best of times by orders of magnitude and the stuff on television today is a billion times better than anything from the 19 seventies in 19 eighties and it's. That's a product of this incredible competition and the fact that you can have anything and any niche market and as long as it's enough, it makes sense to do it and that's what's great. But when you turn to the democracy channel, the same fragmentation, the same niche market. The same reality of us all living in these different universes means we can't address problems as a democracy with even the same facts.

Speaker 1:          02:02:31       And that's a real problem because if we all live in our own fact universe, uh, but we have to save face the same real problems in the same real earth, then we're not going to decide them in any sensible way. And How you solve that problem is really hard. Like we're not going back. Thank god we're not going back to the 19 sixties. It's just not going to be the case that there are three channels we get to watch. That's just not going to happen. And it's a great thing because we've got all this amazing culture, but what do we do on the democracy side? How do we build a democracy? Recognizing that everybody's not going to spend all their time geeking out about campaign finance, reform legislation. And, and that's why I think we need to think about these other ways to bring people to some sense of understanding.

Speaker 1:          02:03:13       And you know, brian calendar and a hunter mats were the first people that brought me into this. Like they put me on their podcast and I remember like not even knowing when he did this, like the length of that conversation and thinking, what are you going to cut this down to? Like six minutes, 10 minutes. HoW long did you guys talk? I think we talked for an hour, you know, and then we're already done two hours and 15 minutes. Holy shit. Yeah. Was a time warp in this row. Wow. I can see that. Yeah. I mean, but I remember thinking like in the middle, like I stopped and I thought whoa, this is the, this is the changing of the world, this is it. And as opposed to those panel shows, those two talking heads for each other. Like when you're on these cable television shows and you've got 30 seconds to say something and, and you know, you linked it before and I think this is really the key.

Speaker 1:          02:03:59       It's, it's, it's exactly like diet. Like we recognize that we have been pUt into a world right now where we all eat shitty food because it's been designed to make it so tasty. Like we love it, you know? and the only way we reformed that, if individuals, one by one, began to decide to eat the right stuff, right? You've got to Decide to, to engage in the right kind of healthy behavior to, to be able to survive in this world because the incentives of the market are to sell you stuff that doesn't necessarily do that. It's the same thing with the information space. That's why the slow food movement is like the slow democracy movement. Like the slow food movement is how do you produce food that's actually healthy in a way that feeds you. It feeds your body in the right way. I think the slo democracy movement, how do you feed a democracy and the elements to that have got to be context where people are free to get deeper than 30 seconds and if we don't build more of those we're gonna have.

Speaker 1:          02:04:59       We're going to have a really desperate time for democracy. We're going to have what we have, which is the rise of authoritarians around the world. Do you foresee the possibility of alternative social media outlets sort of viewing all the issues that people do have with google or facebook or twitter or any of these, what are perceived to be biased sources of information and coming up with something that has clear protections in there? Sort of like the founding fathers did when they established our system of government that, listen, we don't want that. Let's, let's organize that as we're starting to make sure that this doesn't doesn't ever turn into some sort of an echo chamber. Look, I am way above my pay grade. Yeah, but what I know gets us there is competition. I know that the only thing that has ever gotten us to the next great innovation is the enforcement of competition, which is why it's a problem when someone like facebook absolutely buys in store.

Speaker 1:          02:06:00       What gave us the internet was interventions by the government against a t and t, which was the dominant telecommunications company for more than a century that finally said, enough of this, you can't leverage your power to control all innovation, and once that intervention happened, people could layer on top of their wires, a new network called the internet, and when they did that, government said to companies like cable television companies, okay, yeah, you've got broadband across your cable line, but that doesn't mean you get to decide what applications go on that cable line. So you, you're hbs. You mean near The cable company? You can't say that there can't be netflix on the cable or you can't slow netflix down. Now obviously they would want a slow night fix down because netflix is a competitor with their basic business model, but the intervention to assure competition created the opportunity for these great new innovations.

Speaker 1:          02:07:00       Now nobody at the beginning of that had any clue about what would come out of it. All that they knew was that the only way to get something new and create was to assure competition. And that's the commitment we've given up since 2000, since George Bush became president in 2001, there's been no major enforcement action by the antitrust department against any of these companies. And that is a huge problem. And until we rediscover the importance of competition, not because we're geniuses and we can figure out what the future will bring, but because we know from the past that the only way the future comes is if you guarantee competition, unless we do that, we're never going to solve any of these problems. Yeah. Ensuring competition is ensuring innovations, ensuring and anybody who doesn't want competition wants to stifle innovation. And it's got to be thought to be a selfish proposition. And the basic.

Speaker 1:          02:07:52       So you know, the basic argument and competition law, you know, there's competition law got taken over by a bunch of chicago economists who said the only question was efficiency or consumer welfare, but there's another perspective that libertarians like. Luigi zingAles, who's an economist, that university of chicago business school. And um, and people who are not libertarians like tim wu who's a professor at columbia embrace, and this is the idea of political antitrust and the idea of political antitrust is you should also worry if companies are so big that they can corrupt the government, like this is a dimension to worry about too, because if they get to be so big that they can corrupt the government, then you know that they will use that power to protect themselves against innovation. Because if an innovator comes, he doesn't come with 50 lobbyists. He does comes with a great idea.

Speaker 1:          02:08:41       I mean, you know, elon musk saw this dramatically as he's developing this incredible alternative and tried to figure out how to sell it inside of states. And then the lobbyists for the car companies would go state by state and forbid them from being able to sell cars without a local dealership in the state. Right? There was a huge fight as the incumbent industries leveraged their power over government to protect themselves from this new competitor. And this is the, this is the fight we have to. We have to make central again because if we don't do that, then the dinosaurs will have the power through this corrupted political system to protect themselves against the future and this is just the moment when we need to figure out how to make the future come. I'm glad you're raising these warning flags, but I feel like from talking to you that you're fairly optimistic.

Speaker 1:          02:09:30       You're the first person who's ever said that. Really feel like you're optimistic. You're perception of the internet and the young people coming up and the. Okay. That's fair. The way information is being distributed today, that there's so many people participating in it and there's so much competition even in that form. Right? I mean there's. Yeah, there's more voices now and there's a lot of. Look in the past when you had to be selected in order to speak, it was very difficult to get through that selection process and it's not necessarily the best voices that got through it. Just sometimes the most persistent and the most influential, whatever the reason why they got it to be one of those people with the tie in that block on those panel shows, that's not the case anymore. Right. You know, now you've got kyle kalinsky, you've got all these, you know these, these people that are.

Speaker 1:          02:10:21       They don't necessarily fit in, you know, any traditional jimmy dore, they don't fit in any traditional role on regular mainstream television, but they have a pretty influential voice. Absolutely. And they're very polItically savvy and they're talking about things in a way that they would be. they would be. it would be very hard to get a producer to sign off on the way a lot of these guys communicate and some of the things that they do be. It would be very, very difficult, but. So you're optimistic. I'm very optimistic. I'm optimistic in that space. I guess everything outside of the beltway of Washington, I'm optimistic about. I think America has an incredible capacity to innovate out of its problems. What I fear and what I'm not sure any rational person should be optimistic about, but that doesn't mean you don't fight it. What I fear is Washington and um, and so I've said many times like the power of corruption in Washington might be so great that it cannot be defeated, but that doesn't affect what we should be doing.

Speaker 1:          02:11:25       We should be fighting it. Whether or not we think we can win. Winning is not the only reason you fight. You fight because it's the right thing to do and we need to rally because we might be wrong. It could just be that if we got the political forest, we could take them down and, and I think that's what we got to be setting up for it right now. When you see people like tulsi gabbard or will you see this young woman in New York, alexandria, a casio, casio cortez, that to me that's very promising, that people are leanIng in this direction and that they're, they're saying, let's just, let's, let's look at this in a different way and let's see some new voices. Let's, let's hear people that are clearly not influenced by corporate America. They're clearly not. They don't have all of their veins hooked up to the matrix yet.

Speaker 1:          02:12:13       Now I tulsa I had known before your interview with her, your interview with her I think gave people a incredible understanding of the depth of her soul, which is deep. How about when she tweeted to the president, making us Saudi Arabia is bitch is not putting us America first so she can go. She can both do the deep and also the shallow. She can do both. That's amazing. That is an unprecedented thing too because what trump has done is he's opened up the door for this kind of very hostile communication, but what he's also done is opened up the door for it to come back at him. Not that he notices, but the. You're right, exactly right. The rest of the world notice, but what I think is interesting about alexandria is she is very disciplined about saying, look, we've got to fix the system if we're going to get any of these things done.

Speaker 1:          02:12:59       So I like to think about like alexandria or versus bernie, you know, so she like every time she gets up there and talks about her green energy, new deal, it's like you got to fix the political system and then we're going to be able to get this stuff as opposed to like putting a list of 10 things you want to do without anywhere even mentioning the fact that you're going to make these things possible by pixeling fixing political system. I think we need new people, which this new congress is filled with them. There were a hundred and seven members, a lot of people running for congress who wrote to speaker of the house and said they want. As the first thing is addressing of this corrupt political system. And nancy pelosi gave them, not just that, but all these other reforms to it. That's hr one.

Speaker 1:          02:13:41       The younger people coming into congress, realIzed the system is broken. I fear the older people in congress have gotten so used to the system that they don't even notice anymore. Just how broken it is, how outrageous it is, and they need to rage. So they're going to rage against the billionaires or whatever, but I think we need to focus the rage on the problem and that problem is congress. If we don't fix congress first, nothing else matters. Nothing else will happen and we need to build the movement, which I think could actually be a movement that brings people on the right and people on the left in to make that change possible. The philosophy that you have to have darKness in order to inspire light and that there's some sort of a balance to be achieved in this managing of those two energies And that when you have an administration that's clearly fucked up and then people come along and say, it's time that I get into politics and make a difference and these are the people that are motivated because they see a need for change.

Speaker 1:          02:14:39       Whereas some people with other administration, so like I liked the way things are going. I'm going to go pursue the private sector. I'm going to go do this. I'm going to do people see something like what's happening with trump? And they say, I want to. I want to stop this. This is not the America that I know. There are people entering politics for the best possible and I think people in the right have entered politics for the best possible reason and people in the left to the question is how quickly do they get bent by the system? How quickly do they become part of the system, the dark side of the forest? Because like when you like, you know, when you say members of congress spend 30 to 80 percent of them, 70 percent of the time raising money, you might think that means they're miserable most of the time, but you know, there's a way in which it's actually psychologically rewarding for them.

Speaker 1:          02:15:25       So, um, you know, to be a member of congress right now is a pretty miserable job. You don't get much done. Like you're spending all your time like rats in a maze. Like the bell goes off. You've got to run to the floor. Your aide tells you how your two votes, you vote and you leave from the floor. It's nothing like what the framers imagined. Like they were sitting on the floor listening to debate about ideas. All that's bullshit. The only debate is debate to cspan as like a speech to cspan and, and that's, and that's what it is. So the life of a congressman is pretty miserable, but um, but when they fundraise, it's kind of like pushups, you know, sit down and they're told, okay, you've got to raise $20,000. And uh, the aid sit there and say call joe, he cares about this and call fred and he cares about that. And you go through and when you hit your numbers, it's like, hooray, I did something. So it's like, you feel like you're accomplishing something, but the point is the psychology of that increasingly makes you okay with the system that you're in and you realize you win in that system. You've won under that system. And so your openness to changing the system becomes

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       really sketchy. So I think the critical moment right now is to, is to solidify the recognition this congress is corrupted and we have to fix it. and you know, the only thing I'm worried about with hr one is that it's gonna make it into a democratic issue. It's like that democrats care about it, so the republicans are supposed to not care about it. The critical thing now is to get republicans to support the idea of reform and then make it something other than just a traditional tribal fight between left and right. Are you optimistiC? Was I correct in that I'm optimistic about everything outside of the beltway and I'm going to fight like hell to, to, to prove that we can fix stuff inside the beltway. But if you told me I had to bet on my son or daughter's life, I'm not going to tell you that. I think we're going to say I would never ask you to do. Okay, good. All right. We're clear. Thank you for doing this. I really appreciate it. I really enjoyed talking to you. Let's do this again. Hopefully you'll be right every time you ask. All right, we'll do it. Thank you sir. Appreciate it.
